D.E. 15. The Court has reviewed the Motions, the pertinent portions of the record and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.

D.E. 7. On February 14, 2019, Defendant, Geico Marine Insurance Company (\"Geico\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed its motion for summary judgment. D.E. 15. One day later, Plaintiff, Alfredo Quintero (\"Quintero\"), filed his motion for partial summary judgment. D.E. 16. Quintero subsequently moved for an extension to respond to Geico's motion on grounds that certain depositions were outstanding, and given that the motion cutoff had not yet expired, the Court granted Quintero a minor extension until March 14, 2019 to respond to Geico's motion for summary judgment. D.E. 38. In that order, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff SHALL FILE his response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     by Thursday, March 14, 2019.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED AND THE COURT WILL NOT CONSIDER ANY RESPONSES FILED AFTER THIS DATE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite the Court's glaring warning that it would not consider responses filed after this date, Quintero filed his response to Geico's Motion on March 15, 2019, a day after the deadline the Court imposed for his response. D.E. 39. On this basis alone, and having found that Geico's Motion has merit, the Court would grant Geico's Motion and dismiss this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ.

However, given the pendency of Quintero's motion for summary judgment and that his response was only a day late, the Court considers whether Quintero's Motion or his response to Geico's Motion demonstrates that there is a genuine dispute of material fact precluding summary judgment in Geico's favor; it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Quintero's May 4, 2018 Conversation with Geico\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Geico issued an insurance policy (the \"Policy\") to Quintero with a policy period of May 5, 2017 to May 5, 2018 for a 32-inch 2008 Renegade Boats Runabout (the \"Vessel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   D.E. 15 \u00b6 1; D.E. 15-3; D.E. 15-10 \u00b6 5. On May 4, 2018, the day before the Policy period ended, Quintero contacted Geico regarding a declined charge on his credit card from Geico. D.E. 33-4. Geico informed Quintero that his policy was up for renewal and Geico's automatically debited future installments and renewal payments from the customer's card on file.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. However, because payment was declined on Quintero's card, the payment was not taken.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. After being told that Geico could not lower the amount owed, Quintero stated that Geico would \"lose him as a customer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Quintero did not pay the installment amount due on May 5, 2018, and on May 10, 2018, Geico sent Quintero a Notice of Policy Expiration, informing him that the Policy had expired as of May 5, 2018.

Geico informed him that his last policy payment had been due on May 5, 2018, and asked him if he wanted to reinstate his policy, to which Quintero responded that he did. D.E. 17-2 at 3. Before taking payment, Geico asked Quintero some questions regarding the status of the Vessel and Quintero responded that the Vessel had no damage, was \"sound and seaworthy,\" that the last time he physically saw the Vessel was \"every day,\" and the Vessel was currently in his house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. At the end of the conversation, Geico confirmed that the policy was reinstated and backdated to May 5, 2018.

D.E. 15-4. The same day, at approximately 6:30 p.m., Quintero called Geico to make a claim under the Policy for the stolen Vessel, with a date of loss of May 25, 2018. D.E. 17-3. Geico acknowledged Quintero's claim and immediately began an investigation on the same day. D.E. 15-5. On July 13, 2018, Geico sent Quintero correspondence, advising that the investigation was ongoing and that coverage for the loss would be determined after receipt of the full police investigation report. D.E. 15-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Final Police Report &amp; Non-Coverage\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 17, 2019, the Broward County Sheriff's Office issued a final report. D.E. 15-7. In the report, the reporting officer stated that video-surveillance footage from a neighboring home showed a black pickup truck hauling the trailer and the Vessel away at 4:58 a.m., on May 25, 2018, approximately three hours before Quintero called Geico to reinstate the Policy. D.E. 15-7 at 3. On January 30, 2019, Geico sent Quintero a rescission letter and denial of coverage. D.E. 15-8. Geico explained that it was denying coverage for the Vessel and rescinding the policy\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   because Quintero misrepresented the condition of the Vessel and that that he had possession of it when he called to reinstate his policy on May 25, 2018, which Geico stated was material to its decision to insure the Vessel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Summary judgment is authorized only when the moving party meets its burden of demonstrating that \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

D.E. 16. Specifically, Quintero argues that there is no genuine dispute that Geico failed to comply with the Policy's nonrenewal and cancellation provisions, that Quintero's coverage never lapsed, and therefore the theft of his Vessel was a covered loss under the Policy. D.E. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Geico also moves for summary judgment, arguing that Quintero's material misrepresentations as to the status of the Vessel on May 25, 2018 preclude any recovery on three related grounds. First, Geico argues that under the federal common law doctrine of\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   , the Policy was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   when Quintero misrepresented the status of the Vessel during his phone call with Geico to reinstate the Policy on May 25, 2018. Second, Geico argues that the plain language of the\n   Policy precludes coverage\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   where an insured \"omits, conceals, misrepresents, swears falsely, or commits fraud in reference to any material matter relating to this insurance before or after any loss.\" D.E. 15 at 5. Lastly, Geico argues that under Florida Statute \u00a7 627.409, Quintero's misrepresentation prevents recovery under the Policy because his misrepresentation is material to Geico's acceptance of the risk under the Policy and Geico would not have issued the Policy had it known the boat was stolen\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the Court focuses its inquiry on Geico's Motion because Geico moves on a dipositive issue: whether the Policy is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   . As Quintero's declaratory judgment claims depend upon coverage for the stolen Vessel under the Policy, if the Policy is void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , then Quintero's claims fail as a matter of law. The Court ultimately concludes that Quintero's misrepresentations regarding the status of the Vessel void the policy\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   under\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   . As such, the Court does not address Quintero's remaining arguments, although the court has reviewed them and finds that they do not preclude summary judgment in Geico's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Uberrimae Fidei\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   applies to marine insurance and \"requires that an insured fully and voluntarily disclose to the insurer all facts material to a calculation of the insurance risk.\"\n   <em>\n    HIH Marine Servs., Inc. v.

Throughout his Motion and in response to Geico's Motion, Quintero makes much of the fact that he never \"expressed orally, writing, or otherwise, that he did not seek to have the Policy in place during the interim period.\" D.E. 16 \u00b6 3. He goes so far as to move for sanctions because \"Mr. Quintero never stated that he wanted to cancel the policy or directly note or intimate that he wanted to cease coverage with GEICO Marine Insurance Company.\" D.E. 44. Although not entirely clear, Quintero appears to be arguing that his Policy was still effective from the date of his first call to Geico on May 4, 2018 to the date his Vessel was stolen on May 25, 2018, making the theft of the vessel a covered loss under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, Quintero never explains the relevance of this position with regard to his obligations under\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   ; his sole argument against the application of\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   is that the parties' contracted around it.

Given that the motion cutoff had not yet expired, the Court granted Quintero a minor extension until March 14, 2019 to respond to Geico's motion for summary judgment. D.E. 38. In that order, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff SHALL FILE his response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     by Thursday, March 14, 2019.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   NO FURTHER EXTENSIONS WILL BE GRANTED AND THE COURT WILL NOT CONSIDER ANY RESPONSES FILED AFTER THIS DATE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Despite the Court's explicit warning that it would not consider responses filed after this date, Quintero filed his response to Geico's Motion on March 15, 2019, a day after the deadline the Court imposed for his response. D.E. 39. Nevertheless, the Court entertained Quintero's Motion, but found it to be without merit as under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   , Quintero was responsible for the statements he made in renewing his policy with Geico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   While the cross-motions were pending, Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions, arguing that Geico had misrepresented that the policy expired, that Geico took this position in bad faith in its Motions and was misrepresenting the state of affairs to the Court. D.E. 44. In his Motion for Summary Judgment and in opposition to Defendant's Motion, Plaintiff reiterated this allegation. The Court thoroughly considered the record and Plaintiff's argument and found it to be without merit. D.E. 53 at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Instant Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In the instant Motion, Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   reiterates that Geico's deposition testimony conflicts with this Court's findings that Plaintiff renewed his insurance policy, that the policy never lapsed, and that Geico would have renewed the policy regardless of whether the boat was stolen. D.E. 55. As a result, Plaintiff argues that the Court should reconsider its Order pursuant to Rule 59 and Rule 60, and find that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   as testified to by GEICO's corporate representative the Plaintiff did not request a cancellation or expiration of the Policy; that the Policy was never cancelled\n   or non-renewed; that the Policy was in full force and effect on May 4, 2018 and until the theft occurred on May 25, 2018; that the Policy provided coverage for the theft and thereby the Plaintiff is entitled to final judgment accordingly; that the Plaintiff is entitled to common law or statutory interest for the breach of the insurance contract; that the Plaintiff and its counsel are entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; that the Defendant perpetrated a fraud on the Court by knowingly relying upon an affidavit that it knew was perjurious and/or otherwise false; that pursuant to the common law doctrines of waiver or estoppel the Defendant forfeited any defense of material misrepresentation in accepting the Risk by at all times conveying that it would continue to accept premiums even though it was on notice of the putative material misrepresentation on the same day of the loss and every day thereafter, until it attempted to rescind the Policy some three-hundred (300) days later; and/or any other relief that this Court deems necessary and/or equitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   D.E. 55 at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   District courts \"may set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Safari Programs, Inc. v.

Plaintiff effectively seeks to relitigate every issue he raised in his motion for summary judgment; this is impermissible and arguably sanctionable. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not met his burden under Rule 59 of demonstrating manifest errors of law or fact or demonstrating that this Court has made a mistake pursuant to Rule 60. Therefore, there are no grounds for reconsideration or setting aside the judgment and the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Nevertheless, for the sake of absolute clarity, the Court will briefly address each of Plaintiff's points below, with reference to the corresponding discussion in the Court's order on motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Policy Expired or Plaintiff Requested a Cancellation of the Policy is Irrelevant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiff argues that pursuant to the deposition testimony of Geico's representative, \"Plaintiff did not request a cancellation or expiration of the Policy.\" D.E. 55. Consequently, Plaintiff argues that the Policy never lapsed and there was coverage for his stolen vessel. First, the Court disagrees with Plaintiff as the record does not demonstrate any genuine dispute as to this issue. Having exhaustively reviewed the deposition testimony, telephone transcripts and\n   <em>\n    notice of expiration\n   </em>\n   , the Court stated: \"the Policy, the Notice of Expiration, and the recorded telephone transcripts indicate that the previous policy's term expired on May 5, 2018 and that Quintero called to reinstate his Policy on May 25, 2018 after the Vessel had been stolen.\" D.E. 53 at 16. The fact that Plaintiff disagrees with this Court's conclusion does not entitle him to an altered judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Second and more importantly:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Quintero never explains the relevance of this position with regard to his obligations under\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   ; his sole argument against the application of\n   <em>\n    uberrimae fidei\n   </em>\n   is that the parties' contracted around it.\n   <strong>\n    Even if Quintero is correct that the Policy never lapsed, Quintero's misrepresentations regarding the status of the Vessel during the May 25, 2018 call, void the Policy\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    , regardless of whether the Policy was renewed, cancelled, or expired because Quintero failed to fully and voluntarily disclose to Geico insurer all facts material to the risk that Geico assumed when insuring the Vessel.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   D.E. 53 at 16.

Plaintiff's sole basis for this claim is that Geico's affidavit, in which Geico affirms it would not have issued the policy had it known the condition of the boat, was \"superseded by the deposition testimony that followed, which indicated that the subject policy was renewed without any underwriting consideration and without regard for the condition of the boat.\" D.E. 55 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   First, the very deposition text Plaintiff cites undercuts its argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Q: Can you say it was material, sir, the insured's statements to the insurance company in the sense of the insurance company would not have issued - - or maintained the policy as of May 5th, 2018 forward but for the insured being subjected to some number of questions as posed on May 25th, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A:\n   <strong>\n    As a claims adjuster, I can't answer that.

As the Court noted, whether or not a vessel is stolen would plainly influence the mind of a prudent and intelligent insurer, regardless of whether Geico had provided an affidavit to that effect: \"There is also no genuine dispute as to whether these facts are material to the calculation of the risk of insuring the Vessel; insuring a stolen Vessel is akin to insuring a loss.\" D.E. 53 at 8 n.2;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gulfstream Cargo, Ltd. v.

As discussed in detail\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    there is no genuine dispute that Quintero misrepresented that the Vessel was in his house and was in good condition. There is also no genuine dispute as to whether these facts are material to the calculation of the risk of insuring the Vessel; insuring a stolen Vessel is akin to insuring a loss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    pp. 1161-63. Thus, even if the parties had contracted out of\n    <em>\n     uberrimae fidei\n    </em>\n    (they did not), the plain language of the Policy would preclude coverage\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    , invalidating Quintero's claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Quintero also argues that Geico cannot void the Policy because \"absent fraud, the Policy in question requires 45 days advance notice of a cancellation that is based on a unintentional material misrepresentation.\" D.E. 39 at 11. This is a mischaracterization of the Policy. The Policy requires 45 days' notice before cancellation takes effect, but there is no reference to \"unintentional material misrepresentations.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.E. 15-3 at 16 (\"[cancellation] can be done by giving notice of cancellation at least 45 days before the date cancellation takes effect.\"). Moreover, under\n    <em>\n     uberrimae fidei\n    </em>\n    , Policy is void\n    <em>\n     ab initio\n    </em>\n    , and therefore any limits on\n    <em>\n     cancellation\n    </em>\n    are irrelevant; the Policy is not cancelled, it never came into effect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Quintero argues that at the time he signed the insurance re-application on June 1, 2018, Geico was already aware of the fact that the Vessel was stolen. But, Geico's argument relates to misrepresentations made during the May 25, 2018 call, not the June 1, 2018 application. Moreover, the June 1, 2018 application does not reveal the time of the theft. Accordingly, this argument is unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Quintero also argues that he \"conveyed to [Geico] that his neighbor's motion sensors evidence that his boat had been stolen approximately one hour before he had called earlier that morning ... as such, the Defendant's allegation of fraud in this action in association with the timing of Plaintiff's payment on the Policy premium on the same morning thereafter was admittedly unsupported ....\" D.E. 39 at 4. But, whether or not Quintero committed fraud is not relevant.\n    <em>\n     Uberrimae fidei\n    </em>\n    voids the Policy even in the case of an innocent mistake; fraud is not necessary.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gulfstream Cargo\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2199773\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/409/974/#p980\">\n     409 F.2d at 980-81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"a mistake or commission material to a marine risk, whether it be willful or accidental, or result from mistake, negligence or voluntary ignorance, avoids the policy ....\") (quotations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Quintero asserts that Geico waived any denial of coverage because it \"had knowledge\" of the misrepresentation and because it continued to collect premiums and recognize the existence of the policy until January 2019.

But, the Policy is not governed by Florida law, it is governed by \"United States federal admiralty law.\" D.E. 15-3 at 1.
