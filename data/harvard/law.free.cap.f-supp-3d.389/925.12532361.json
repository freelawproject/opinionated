Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   rule is not compatible with Minnesota's comparative fault scheme by which it abolished the doctrine of last clear chance-the same doctrine that the\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   court relied upon in applying the\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   rule to conclude that the carrier was principally at fault, thereby absolving the shipper according to equitable principles of indemnity and contribution. Recent Minnesota case law emanates an understanding that all-or-nothing rules-serving as complete bars to liability for those who have responsibility-should be brought in line with comparative negligence.\n   <em>\n    Soderberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12560155\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/922/200/#p205\">\n    922 N.W.2d at 205-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   rule, which has the inevitable effect of imposing all-or-nothing liability on carriers, must succumb to Minnesota's comparative fault framework so that the jury can have the opportunity to properly apportion a percentage of fault to Immedia for its alleged negligence if it so chooses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court concludes that the Minnesota Supreme Court would not apply the\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   rule to the instant case.
