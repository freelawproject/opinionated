[D.E. 39]. Plaintiff responded on February 13, 2019. [D.E. 40]. Defendants filed their joint reply on February 20, 2019. [D.E. 43].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Defendants' motion is now ripe for disposition.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about August 24, 2017, Plaintiff was a passenger aboard the\n   <em>\n    M/S Celebrity Summit\n   </em>\n   , a vessel owned and operated by Celebrity. [D.E. 38]. At that time, CR Spaclub owned and operated a spa on the\n   <em>\n    Summit\n   </em>\n   that offered services for Celebrity's passengers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges that, while she was a passenger on the\n   <em>\n    Summit\n   </em>\n   , a crewmember by the name of Carlos Roberto Castro Tadeo (the \"Assailant\") sexually assaulted and battered her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed her initial, four-count complaint on August 21, 2018. [D.E. 1]. She filed an amended complaint three weeks\n   later after a substitution of counsel. [D.E. 13]. On September 19, 2019, Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint to correct a typographical error. [D.E. 21]. Celebrity submitted its answer and affirmative defenses to the second amended complaint on October 12, 2018 [D.E. 23], and CR Spaclub did the same on December 10, 2018 [D.E. 30]. Plaintiff's underlying allegation, up until this point, was relatively straightforward and unchanged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [t]he Assailant, after calling himself a masseuse and spa director and under the pretense of providing Plaintiff with a complimentary massage, trapped Plaintiff in a small room of the spa and intentionally persuaded Plaintiff to undress and eventually fondled her breasts and vaginal area before she was able to get away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [D.E. 21, \u00b6 17]. Plaintiff demanded compensatory damages, costs, interest, permissible attorney's fees, and other relief deemed appropriate by the Court for (1) Celebrity's negligence, (2) CR Spaclub's negligence, (3) Celebrity's strict vicarious liability, and (4) CR Spaclub's strict vicarious liability. [D.E. 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As discovery got underway, however, Plaintiff learned that she may not have been the Assailant's first victim. She claims she obtained a copy of the resume and application that Assailant submitted to CR Spaclub. [D.E. 35]. According to Plaintiff, during the discovery process she became aware that Assailant allegedly engaged in similar conduct while employed as a fitness instructor onboard a Carnival cruise ship in November of 2016 - roughly nine months before she claims she was assaulted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Based on this information, Plaintiff was granted leave to amend her complaint for a third time. [D.E. 37].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the third amended complaint, Plaintiff added additional information about the Assailant's alleged similar conduct from November of 2016 and sought punitive damages on each of the four counts. [D.E. 38]. Defendants now seek to dismiss the claim for punitive damages because, in their words, the allegations contained in the third amended complaint do not rise to the level of \"intentional wrongdoing\" required to obtain such an award in the Eleventh Circuit. [D.E. 39]. We address these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

But, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   did not overrule the holding in\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   . As Judge Williams explained in\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   , the issue is not whether punitive damages are available under general maritime law, but what standard of liability should apply in determining whether they may be recovered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, under the \"broad reasoning\" of\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   , punitive damages should be available in this action even in the absence of a showing of intentional misconduct. However, the Court believes that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding's\n   </em>\n   statement that \"[p]unitive damages have long been an available remedy at common law for wanton, willful or outrageous conduct\" was simply a general description of the circumstances in which such damages are available at common law, and was not intended to announce a bright-line standard of liability governing recovery of punitive damages in all maritime tort claims. Again, the Court notes that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   addressed only the availability of punitive damages in a cause of action for maintenance and cure, and did not specifically discuss personal injury claims brought by ship passengers. Given the relatively narrow scope of the issues presented in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   , the Court does not believe that holding should be read so broadly as to find it in conflict with Amtrak.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012580433\">\n    2014 WL 12580433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (footnote in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We agree with the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   did not foreclose the availability of punitive damages - only that they should be available in \"exceptional circumstances,\" such as \"those very rare situations of intentional wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285021\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/1421/#p1429\">\n    121 F.3d at 1429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court addressed a narrower issue in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   as to whether punitive damages were available as a remedy for a breach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure. And in answering this question, the Court concluded that, because punitive damages were available under general maritime law, they are available for a maintenance and cure claim.\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/#p424\">\n    557 U.S. at 418-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658172\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/404/#p424\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Sounding\n   </em>\n   did not overrule\n   <em>\n    Amtrak\n   </em>\n   because the former (1) focused exclusively on the availability of punitive damages in a cause of action for maintenance and cure, and (2) merely announced a generic description as to how punitive damages have been available at common law (i.e., for wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct).

In further support of this allegation, the complaint cites a case between a former client of Plaintiff's counsel and a former employer of the Assailant as evidence that Defendants knew of the Assailant's alleged misconduct in November of 2016.\n   <em>\n    See Smith v.

The case cited to by Plaintiff involved a lawsuit filed roughly five weeks\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's cruise in August 2017. Thus, there exists an insufficient temporal nexus between Plaintiff's hiring by the Defendants and either (1) the alleged assault on the victim in the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   case, or (2) Doe's alleged sexual assault here; the lawsuit that would have put Defendants on notice about the Assailant's alleged predatory behavior did not come until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff had returned from the cruise in question.

Accepting these facts as true and construing the allegations in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, and based on the special relationship the law recognizes exists between commercial carriers and its passengers, the Court finds that she has asserted enough facts to state a plausible claim for two intentional torts; namely, sexual assault and battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dusek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4351208,5926779\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/832/1243/\">\n    832 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1246 ;\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170036\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/891/#p913\">\n    394 F.3d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n intentional tort is '[a] tort committed by someone acting with general or specific intent [and] [e]xamples include battery, false imprisonment, and trespass to land.\") (citing Black's Law Dictionary at 1527 (8th Ed. 1999)) (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    Doe No. 3 v.
