Civ. P. 40(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Salesforce argues that the court has diversity jurisdiction over this action because the non-diverse Hotel Defendants\n   were fraudulently misjoined. Jane Doe argues that the Hotel Defendants are properly joined because (1) her claims against all Defendants arise from injuries she sustained as a result of her victimization by a single sex trafficking venture and (2) common questions of law and fact will arise in resolving her claims against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court concludes that Jane Doe's joinder of the Hotel Defendants did not violate Texas's joinder rules. Jane Doe's claims against the Hotel Defendants, Salesforce, and the Backpage Defendants arise from the same transaction or series of transactions -- an alleged sex trafficking venture\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which traffickers were permitted to use Backpage, which utilized Salesforce's CRM technology, to solicit johns to abuse Jane Doe in hotels owned and operated by the Hotel Defendants. Jane Doe alleges that Defendants are each responsible in different ways for the sexual exploitation she faced as a victim of that venture. Jane Doe pled the same or similar legal claims against Salesforce, the Hotel Defendants, and the Backpage Defendants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and it is likely that at least one of those claims will raise common questions of law and fact. Specifically, Jane Doe claims that Defendants' actions \"taken separately and/or together,\" violated Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 98.002, which allows a victim of sex trafficking to hold defendants who \"engage[d] in the trafficking\" or \"intentionally or knowingly benefit[ted] from participating in a venture that traffic[ed]\" the victim liable for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 98.002. Jane Doe's \u00a7 98.002 claims against the Hotel Defendants, the Backpage Defendants, and Salesforce are likely to raise such common questions of fact as whether a single trafficking venture involving all of Defendants existed, the extent of each defendant's knowledge of the venture's existence and awareness of the other defendants' participation in it, and what damages Jane Doe sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, even if Texas joinder requirements were not satisfied, Salesforce has failed to persuade the court that Plaintiff's joinder of the Hotel Defendants is so egregious as to be fraudulent. A survey of fraudulent misjoinder cases conducted by the Northern District of Texas recognized three situations in which a misjoinder is potentially so egregious as to be considered \"fraudulent:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) two or more lawsuits with little or no party overlap have been combined in the same action (i.e., there are multiple plaintiffs and defendants, but each plaintiff or discrete set of plaintiffs is suing only one defendant or a discrete set of defendants); (2) numerous plaintiffs have sued a common defendant and assert claims that have no shared factual element other than the presence of the common defendant; and (3) a single plaintiff or group of plaintiffs has joined multiple defendants in the same action and is asserting claims against each defendant\n   that are both factually and legally unrelated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas Instruments,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270181\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/266/143/#p147\">\n    266 F.R.D. at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Only the third situation is potentially applicable here. But Jane Doe is not suing unrelated defendants over unrelated events. While the involvement of each defendant in the venture alleged by Jane Doe was different, Defendants are all in some way connected to her sex trafficking. Plaintiffs' joinder of the Hotel Defendants to her claims against Salesforce and the Backpage Defendants therefore does not rise to the level of egregiousness required for a finding of fraudulent misjoinder. The court therefore finds that Jane Doe did not fraudulently misjoin the Hotel Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion and Order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the court concludes that Salesforce has failed to carry its burden of proving that the court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. Accordingly, Jane Doe's Motion to Remand (Docket Entry No. 26) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
