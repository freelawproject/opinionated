Defendants argue the Government's references to National Coverage Determination (\"NCD\") guidelines are insufficient to establish liability\n   under the FCA and that, because the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has specifically prohibited its litigators from using such guidelines to establish civil liability, the Court here should preclude the Government from doing so as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For the same reasons articulated by the\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   Court, these contentions fail.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530639\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/371/1195/#p1211\">\n    371 F.
