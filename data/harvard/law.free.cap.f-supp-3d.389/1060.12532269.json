Plaintiffs filed a Joint Response to [Def.'s Mot.] and Reply in Support of [Pls.' Mot.] [ECF No. 159] (\"Pls.' Reply\"); to which Defendant filed a Reply in Support of [Def.'s Mot.] [ECF No. 175] (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has carefully reviewed the Second Amended Complaint [ECF No. 70] (\"SAC\"), the parties' submissions, the record, and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is an insurance coverage dispute concerning Plaintiffs' duty to defend numerous personal injury lawsuits stemming from a fatal 2018 bridge collapse in Miami, Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2015, FIGG and Munilla Construction Management, LLC (\"MCM\") entered into a contract with Florida International University (\"FIU\") to design and construct a bridge to accommodate pedestrian traffic between the FIU campus and the city of Sweetwater. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 36-37). Plaintiffs provided general commercial liability insurance policies to FIGG; those policies included professional liability exclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 1-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 15, 2018, the FIU pedestrian bridge collapsed, killing and injuring several people. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. 2). As a result of the bridge collapse, various individuals filed personal injury lawsuits against FIGG. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 1). The lawsuits were consolidated into a single case in state court, in which the presiding judge required the plaintiffs to file two separate complaints (the \"Underlying Complaints\"). (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). The Underlying Complaints have since been amended, and on October 10, 2018, the state court plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Model Worker Complaint [ECF No. 70-2] (\"MWC\") and Third Amended Model Complaint for Civilian Cases [ECF No. 70-3] (\"MCC\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6 4). As the state court case progressed, Plaintiffs sent multiple letters to FIGG (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exhibit A [ECF No. 146-1] 6-83), agreeing to defend FIGG against the Underlying Complaints, subject to a full and complete reservation of rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this action in June 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Complaint [ECF No. 1] ). A\n   few months later, Plaintiffs filed the operative SAC. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that they did not owe FIGG a duty to defend the allegations in the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-99). Plaintiffs also seek reimbursement for the fees, costs, and other expenses they incurred defending FIGG against the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 5, 2019, FIGG filed a Joint Motion to Dismiss as Moot [ECF No. 138]. FIGG argued there was no longer a case or controversy before the Court, as the Underlying Complaints had been dismissed in the state court action. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court granted FIGG's Joint Motion to Dismiss in part. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   March 19, 2019 Order [ECF No. 143] 3). The Court agreed dismissal of the Underlying Complaints resulted in there not being a case or controversy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Yet, the Court found Plaintiffs could continue to seek reimbursement of fees and costs advanced to FIGG in defense of the Underlying Complaints attached to the SAC. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). The parties now move for summary judgment, asking the Court to determine whether Plaintiffs owed FIGG a duty to defend the allegations in the Underlying Complaints, and if not, whether Plaintiffs are entitled to reimbursement for the defense-related payments made on FIGG's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot.; Def.'s Mot.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Policy Exclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Phoenix issued an insurance policy to FIGG providing commercial general liability coverage through November 1, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SOF \u00b6 1). Concurrently, Travelers issued FIGG an umbrella policy for the same one-year period. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both polices include identical professional liability exclusions for \" '[b]odily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the rendering of or failure to render any 'professional services.' \" (Commercial Insurance Policy [ECF No. 70-5] 371 (the \"Exclusion\") (alteration added)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Exclusion defines \"professional services\" as \"any service requiring specialized skill or training,\" including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a. Preparation, approval, provision of or failure to prepare, approve, or provide any map, shop drawing, opinion, report, survey, field order, change order, design, drawing, specification, recommendation, warning, permit application, payment request, manual or instruction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b. Supervision, inspection, quality control, architectural, engineering or surveying activity or service, job site safety, construction contracting, construction administration, construction management, computer consulting or design, software development or programming service; or selection of a contractor or subcontractor; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   c. Monitoring; testing, or sampling service necessary to perform any of the services described in Paragraph a. or b. above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(c)). Plaintiffs' duty to defend FIGG turns on whether the allegations in the Underlying Complaints fall under the Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Summary judgment is rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the outset, the Court identifies the undisputed facts underlying the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties agree Plaintiffs owe FIGG a duty to defend claims of bodily injury and property damage under the policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4; Def.'s Opp. to Pls.' SOF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). The parties also agree the policies include professional liability exclusions, which, if triggered, exempt Plaintiffs from the duty to defend. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5). The parties do not dispute that the allegations in the Underlying Complaints pertained to \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" under Plaintiffs' policies. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot.; Def.'s Mot.). The parties thus do not dispute that Plaintiffs owed FIGG a duty to defend, barring application of the Exclusion in Plaintiffs' policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These agreements lead to the primary issue on which the parties depart: whether the Exclusion applies. If the Exclusion applies, Plaintiffs did not owe FIGG a duty to defend and may seek reimbursement for payments made and costs incurred on FIGG's behalf defending the allegations in the Underlying Complaints. If the Exclusion does not apply, Plaintiffs owed FIGG a duty to defend the Underlying Complaints\n   and are therefore not entitled to reimbursement of defense-related payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties' Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   It is helpful to summarize the parties' positions, as elucidated in their briefing, and in the order in which the arguments are presented. Plaintiffs' argument is straightforward. Plaintiffs assert they did not owe FIGG a duty to defend because every allegation in the Underlying Complaints falls under the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot.). Plaintiffs focus on the meaning of \"arising out of\" and \"professional services\" under Florida law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   7-13). Plaintiffs ask the Court to consider, in addition to the Underlying Complaints, a professional services agreement (the \"Agreement\") between FIGG and MCM to properly conceptualize the work FIGG performed on the bridge project. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiffs go on to argue that even if the allegations do not describe \" 'professional services,' [they] at least 'arise out of' the professional services that FIGG rendered or failed to render.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   16 (alteration added)). In support of this point, Plaintiffs rely on a recent case from the Eleventh Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Witkin Design Group, Inc. v. Travelers Property Casualty Company of America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412358\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/712/894/\">\n    712 F. App'x 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017) (concluding the insurer owed no duty to defend based on an identical professional liability exclusion). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Because they had no duty to defend FIGG, Plaintiffs also insist they are entitled to reimbursement for all defense-related payments made on FIGG's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. 17-18). To date, Plaintiffs have contributed $840,893.61 in defense-related payments and argue the reservation-of-rights letters sent to FIGG entitle them to full reimbursement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   18). Alternatively, Plaintiffs seek at least $270,343.52 - the amount they spent specifically defending FIGG against the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Response and Cross-Motion, FIGG disagrees, stating \"[f]or an insurer to avoid its duty to defend based on an exclusion, the insurer must establish that the underlying pleading's allegations fall solely and entirely within the relied upon exclusion.\" (Def.'s Mot. 3-4 (alteration added; citation and emphasis omitted)). According to FIGG, Plaintiffs cannot meet this burden. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To start with, FIGG contends the Court should not look beyond the allegations in the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   4-7). FIGG insists Plaintiffs fail to cite to an applicable exception to the \"eight corners rule\" which would allow the Court to consider the Agreement between FIGG and MCM. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   FIGG next turns to the merits of the Exclusion. In FIGG's words: \"[d]espite the breadth of 'arising out of' and the definition of 'professional services' in the professional services exclusions, there are allegations [in] the [Underlying Complaints] which do not fall solely and entirely within the definition of 'professional services' and thus are outside the [Exclusion] requiring [Plaintiffs] to defend [FIGG].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9 (alterations added)). FIGG directs the Court's attention to non-Florida case law concluding professional liability exclusions do not apply to allegations similar to those in the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   9-13). FIGG relies on\n   <em>\n    S.T. Hudson Engineers, Incorporated v. Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Company\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5186189\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/388/592/\">\n    388 N.J.Super. 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5186189\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/388/592/\">\n    909 A.2d 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2006), as \"extremely instructive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9-12). FIGG notes the court in\n   <em>\n    S.T. Hudson Engineers\n   </em>\n   \"determined that the professional liability exclusion did not apply to alleged liability for failure to warn of a pier collapse or negligent misrepresentation\n   about the condition of the pier.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10 (citation omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FIGG then turns to the reimbursement issue, which it argues is premature. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16). If the Court is inclined to resolve the issue, FIGG contends Plaintiffs do not have a right to reimbursement under Florida law based on the reservation-of-rights letters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16-20). Finally, in the event the Court finds a right to reimbursement, FIGG asks the Court to limit reimbursement to $270,343.52, the amount Plaintiffs incurred defending FIGG against the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In their Reply, as to the duty to defend, Plaintiffs state \"FIGG has elected to largely ignore the binding case law cited in [Plaintiffs'] Motion.\" (Pls.' Reply 8 (alteration added)). Plaintiffs argue \"none of the cases cited by FIGG involves a professional services exclusion like the [Exclusion] at issue here.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   9 (alteration added)). Plaintiffs review and distinguish the cases on which FIGG relies, concluding all of them \"involve professional services exclusions that are either narrower or less clear\" than the Exclusion here. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10-11). Plaintiffs state a close analysis of the Underlying Complaints \"reveals no allegations that could potentially be deemed as unrelated to professional services,\" as defined by the Exclusion.

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MWC; MCC). For brevity, and in light of the sheer number of \"relevant allegations\" (Def.'s SOF 2-10), the Court does not address every allegation in detail. While the Court addresses only some of the allegations,\n   the forthcoming analysis applies to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   factual allegations against FIGG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   i) Count VII: Gross Negligence against FIGG (MWC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Count VII of the MWC alleges FIGG failed to warn its workers and employees of the danger of working on the bridge. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MWC \u00b6\u00b6 133-134). Specifically, the plaintiffs in the Underlying Action allege FIGG \"\n   <em>\n    fail[ed] to communicate proper cautions\n   </em>\n   to the construction force/workers that cracks observed\n   <em>\n    on the bridge were a safety concern\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134 (f) (alteration and emphasis added)). As Plaintiffs state throughout their Motion, these allegations plainly fall within the Exclusion, which defines both \"failure to warn\" and \"job site safety\" as professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6 3(a)-(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   ii) Count VIII: Professional Gross Negligence against FIGG (MWC) and Count VII: Professional Negligence Against FIGG (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   These counts in the Underlying Complaints require little to no rigorous analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   MWC \u00b6\u00b6 140-154; MCC \u00b6\u00b6 111-121). These counts allege FIGG was \"responsible for the\n   <em>\n    design and engineering\n   </em>\n   of the Bridge Project\" (MWC \u00b6 141 (emphasis added); MCC \u00b6 112 (emphasis added)); FIGG is comprised of \"professional engineers\" required \"to exercise [ ] independent professional judgment\" (MWC \u00b6\u00b6 142-143 (alteration added); MCC \u00b6\u00b6 113-114 (alteration added)); FIGG \"[f]ailed to comply with applicable OSHA regulations and other industry standards, including but not limited to ANSI/ASSE standards\" (MWC \u00b6 147 (f) (alteration added); MCC \u00b6 118 (f) (alteration added)); and FIGG \"[f]ailed to properly\n   <em>\n    supervise and inspect\n   </em>\n   the Bridge Project\" (MWC \u00b6 147 (g) (alteration and emphasis added); MCC \u00b6 118 (g) (alteration and emphasis added)). These allegations fall under the Exclusion, which expressly includes any \"architectural\" or \"engineering\" services as professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6 3(b)). These allegations also have a connection with \"design,\" \"job site safety,\" \"supervision,\" \"inspection,\" \"construction management,\" and \"failure to warn\" - all defined professional services under the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3(a)-(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   iii) Count IX: Strict Liability Against FIGG (MWC) and Count IX: Strict Liability Against FIGG (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   These counts in the Underlying Complaints allege \"[a]s a result of the practices exercised by FIGG with respect to the\n   <em>\n    management, control, and supervision\n   </em>\n   of the FIU pedestrian bridge project, FIGG is strictly liable ....\" (MWC \u00b6 161 (alteration and emphasis added); MCC \u00b6 133 (alteration and emphasis added)). They also state FIGG's participation in the bridge project reflects \"abnormally dangerous construction activity\" (MWC \u00b6 156; MCC \u00b6 128), resulting from the \"innovative\" nature of the bridge and \"unusual choice of materials\" (MWC \u00b6 157; MCC \u00b6 129). FIGG's actions, as described by these allegations, required specialized skill or training and fall within the Exclusion. These actions arise out of FIGG's \"supervision,\" \"design,\" \"specification,\" \"engineering activity or service,\" and responsibility for \"job site safety,\" among other defined professional services. (Exclusion \u00b6 3(a)-(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   iv) Count X: Negligent Failure to Ensure Safety Against FIGG (MWC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This count of the MWC alleges \"FIGG had a duty to notify and/or advise those working on the bridge of the danger of collapse.\" (MWC \u00b6 164). Plaintiffs state FIGG breached its duties by \"fail[ing] to disclose information\" regarding \"the cracks and that the condition of those cracks was worsening.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167 (alteration added)). Count X expressly premises liability on FIGG's\n   <em>\n    failure to warn\n   </em>\n   workers of\n   <em>\n    job site safety\n   </em>\n   - two clearly defined professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6 3(a)-(b)). Further, any dangers FIGG was aware of regarding the structural safety of the bridge would necessarily arise out of its \"engineering services\" requiring \"specialized skill or training.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   v) Count XI: Negligent Misrepresentation (Gross Negligence) Against FIGG (MWC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This count of the MWC alleges \"FIGG represented to those employed to work, and who were in fact working, on the construction site of the bridge project that the project construction was safe.\" (MWC \u00b6 170). The alleged misrepresentation is based on FIGG's knowledge the \"bridge span structure was unstable, unsound, defective, [and] dangerous....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 177 (alterations added)). These allegations certainly arise out of \"job site safety\" and \"inspection services\" - defined professional services under the Exclusion. (Exclusion \u00b6 3(b)). More so, the \"provision of or failure to provide\" any \"opinion or recommendation\" is also defined as a professional service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3(a)). As previously stated, any knowledge or opinions FIGG held about the structural stability or dangers of the bridge arise out of its \"engineering services\" and require \"specialized skill or training.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3(a)-(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   vi) Count VIII: Negligence Against FIGG (Not Professional)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   This count of the MCC alleges FIGG \"owed a duty to use reasonable care in performing its work on the bridge ....\" (MCC \u00b6 124 (alteration added)). FIGG allegedly breached this duty when it, among other things, \"negligently failed to ensure the safety of the public during the\n   <em>\n    installation\n   </em>\n   of the bridge\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125 (a) (emphasis added)); \"failed to assess, consider, and account for\n   <em>\n    project site safety risks\n   </em>\n   and develop appropriate\n   <em>\n    risk mitigation strategies, safety planning and safety measures\n   </em>\n   ...\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125 (d) (emphasis and alteration added)); and \"failed to implement adequate safety measures prior to\n   <em>\n    post-tensioning operations\n   </em>\n   , including completely closing the Tamiami Trail roadway under the main bridge span on March 15, 2018\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125 (e) (emphasis added)). In addition to alleging FIGG failed to ensure \"job site safety;\" the installation of a bridge, as well as actions regarding post-tensioning operations, at a minimum, have a connection with \"engineering services\" requiring \"specialized skill or training,\" thus triggering the Exclusion. (Exclusion \u00b6 3(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   vii) Count X: Gross Negligence Against FIGG (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   This count of the MCC alleges FIGG \"deviated from the industry standard of care\" while performing work that was \"inherently dangerous and ultrahazardous in nature ....\" (MCC \u00b6\u00b6 136-137\n   (alteration added)). Count X also states FIGG \"deviated and departed from the prevailing professional standards of care and failed to comply with its duties in the\n   <em>\n    construction and engineering\n   </em>\n   of the bridge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138 (emphasis added)). Again, the allegations against FIGG arise out of professional services falling entirely under the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(b)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   viii) Count XI: Negligent Failure to Disclose Against FIGG (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   This count of the MCC alleges FIGG breached its duty of care in one or more of the following ways: \"failed to disclose ... that the bridge was unsafe\" (MCC \u00b6 142 (a) (alteration added)); \"failed to disclose ... that the materials incorporated into the project were defective, deficient and/or did not meet specifications or industry standards\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142 (b) (alteration added)); failed to disclose the bridge was structurally unsafe (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142 (c)); \"failed to disclose ... the impending bridge collapse\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142 (f) (alteration added)); and \"assured the construction force, and by implication the public at large and the Plaintiff, that the cracks observed on the bridge structure before its collapse were not a safety concern for the completion of the project\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142 (e)). These allegations against FIGG arise out of professional services and thus fall under the Exclusion. Failing to disclose an impending bridge collapse and other safety concerns fall within the scope of a \"failure to warn.\" (Exclusion \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(b)). Opinions regarding the structural integrity of the bridge, adequacy of materials incorporated into the bridge, and observations made based on the cracking of the bridge clearly arise out of \"engineering services\" and require \"specialized skills and training.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   ix) Count XII: Negligent Misrepresentation Against FIGG (MCC)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This count of the MCC alleges FIGG \"made both verbal and nonverbal representations that the bridge project was safe and posed no dangers to the members of the public at large.\" (MCC \u00b6 146). Further, Count XII count states \"by allowing the travel lanes below the bridge to remain open and/or by not insisting or\n   <em>\n    recommending\n   </em>\n   that they be closed during post tensioning work on March 15, 2018, the Defendant represented to the public at large and the Plaintiff in particular that the bridge was safe ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147 (emphasis and alteration added)). Again, these allegations fall under the Exclusion, which encompasses the \"provision of or failure to approve or provide any opinion, recommendation, or warning.\" (Exclusion \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(b)). And any representations made regarding the safety of the bridge project would also arise out of \"engineering services,\" \"quality control,\" and \"job site safety.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Additional Arguments Raised in the Parties' Briefing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   FIGG repeatedly asserts the allegations in the Underlying Complaints do not fall solely within the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. 9-16; Def.'s Reply 7-10). FIGG conclusorily states the Exclusion \"does not exclude actions or claims related to negligent misrepresentation, failure to ensure the safety of the public at large, actual construction, manufacturing, manual/physical labor necessary to carrying out certain tasks, alleged failures to disclose, failures to notify, or failure to control.\" (Def.'s Reply 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   FIGG seems to suggest that if a specific term is not expressly listed as a professional service, it does not fall under the Exclusion. Not so. The Exclusion,\n   <em>\n    by its own terms\n   </em>\n   , provides a non-exhaustive list\n   of predetermined professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Witkin Design Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207670051\">\n    2016 WL 7670051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (\"The fact that the word 'construction' does not appear by itself in the non-exhaustive list of activities which constitute professional services does not mean that the act of construction is not a professional service.\")). Indeed, the Court has addressed many of the allegations FIGG describes and found each factual allegation falls under the Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   FIGG then references specific allegations in the Underlying Complaints that purportedly \"do not fall within the definition of 'professional services', necessitating Plaintiffs' defense obligation to FIGG.\" (Def.'s Reply 8). FIGG lists, among others:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \u2022 failure to require that all construction operations cease due to safety issues that posed an unreasonable risk of harm;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \u2022 failure to conduct post-tensioning operations during off-peak hours on March 15, 2018;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \u2022 the negligent and careless failure to monitor, supervise and otherwise prevent the development of forces that could challenge the integrity of the bridge superstructure during the movement and erection phase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207670051\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   8-9 (citing MWC \u00b6 147; MCC \u00b6 118)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   FIGG's assertions fail to persuade. By its plain meaning, the Exclusion encompasses these activities as professional services. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exclusion \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(c)). Failing to require \"construction operations to cease\" arises out of the professional service of \"construction management.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, decisions on \"post-tensioning operations\" and acts or omissions challenging the \"integrity\" of the bridge \"during the movement and erection phase\" necessarily arise out of \"engineering services\" under the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Undeterred, FIGG states \"[o]ther counts against FIGG allege that FIGG failed to control certain aspects of the project as well as disclose information, and neither term or activity is excluded by the definition of 'professional services.' \" (Def.'s Reply 9 (citing MWC \u00b6\u00b6 161, 174) (alteration added)). FIGG's reliance on the absence of a specific term from \"professional services\" is again misplaced. As to the specific allegations to which FIGG cites, the MWC discusses \"the practices exercised by FIGG with respect to the\n   <em>\n    management, control, and supervision\n   </em>\n   of the FIU pedestrian bridge project\" (MWC \u00b6 161 (emphasis added)); and how \"FIGG failed to disclose known information about the condition of the bridge to those working on the construction site of the bridge project\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Contrary to FIGG's assertions, these allegations from the MWC fall under the Exclusion. The \"management, control, and supervision\" of the bridge project arise out of FIGG's \"supervision,\" \"quality control,\" \"engineering services,\" or \"construction management.\" (Exclusion \u00b6\u00b6 3(a)-(b)). Further, actions or inactions relating to the safety of the bridge site arise out of \"job site safety\" or \"engineering services,\" and the failure to disclose information certainly arises out of the \"failure to provide an opinion, recommendation, or warning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   FIGG states its \"breaches were to the public at large,\" and \"[n]otably, ensuring the safety of the 'public' is not the same as 'job site safety.' \" (Def.'s Reply 9 (alteration added; citation omitted)). Although there are differences between \"the public\" and \"job site safety,\" FIGG makes no attempt to explain how injuries to specific members of the public, resulting from the literal collapse of the job site, are unrelated to \"job site safety.\" In any event, the\n   Court does not rely solely on \"job site safety\" in concluding that every pertinent allegation in the Underlying Complaints arises out of FIGG's rendering of or failure to render professional services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   FIGG also argues the facts described in the Underlying Complaints establish a duty to defend. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   8). FIGG states the Underlying Complaints allege FIGG \"provided labor and services\" on the project, and these do not fall under the Exclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing MWC \u00b6 8; MCC \u00b6 7) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Additionally, FIGG asserts some general allegations refer to all Defendants collectively \"when referencing the work performed, which includes construction, physical closure of the road and manufacturing, all of which are unexcluded tasks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court has previously addressed FIGG's construction work and safety decisions. As to FIGG's argument the inclusion of \"labor and services\" necessitates Plaintiffs' duty to defend, the undersigned disagrees. The factual allegations FIGG cites state only that FIGG was \"retained to provide labor and services on the project.\" (MWC \u00b6 8; MCC \u00b6 7). FIGG fails to explain what liability is created by this background information or how this allegation changes the specific claims stated against FIGG. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In any event, the Underlying Complaints each clearly state \"Defendant, FIGG, a designer of pedestrian bridges, was responsible for the design and engineering of the Bridge Project and employed the engineer of record for this Bridge Project.\" (MWC \u00b6 141; MCC \u00b6 112). To the extent the labor and services provided by the bridge engineer are not \"engineering services\" under the Exclusion, the labor and services performed must have a connection with or arise out of the \"design and engineering of the Bridge Project\" which FIGG was hired to perform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Considering all the Underlying Complaints' allegations against FIGG, the undersigned concludes each \"aris[es] out of the rendering or failure to render any 'professional services.' \" (Exclusion \u00b6 1 (alteration added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    2. Reimbursement of Defense Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiffs argue the reservation-of-rights letters sent throughout the underlying litigation created a right to seek reimbursement for defense-related payments made defending FIGG against the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot 17-18). The letters each allegedly include a full reservation of rights, which in Plaintiffs' view entitle them to seek reimbursement under Florida law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   FIGG makes numerous arguments in response. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. 16-20). First, FIGG argues the issue is premature because Plaintiffs failed to obtain a declaration stating they had no duty to defend. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   16 (citing\n   <em>\n    James River Ins. Co. v.

The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Certainly, Plaintiffs cannot seek reimbursement for fees without the Court first concluding the absence of a duty to defend. But, FIGG cites no authority stating Plaintiffs cannot seek reimbursement within the same motion that seeks declaratory relief on the duty-to-defend question. Curiously,\n   <em>\n    James River\n   </em>\n   - the very case on which FIGG relies - seems to undercut FIGG's position.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12140118\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/188/1246/\">\n    188 F.

The Court declines FIGG's invitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Where there is no Florida Supreme Court precedent to follow on an issue of Florida law, federal courts \"are bound to adhere to decisions of the state's intermediate appellate courts absent some persuasive indication that the state's highest court would decide the issue otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. v.

FIGG recognizes that the \"present case law available in Florida finds that it is possible for an insurer's reservation of rights to create a right to recoup defense costs that would not otherwise exist.\" (Def.'s Mot. 18 (citation omitted)). Because FIGG fails to point to any persuasive authority suggesting the Florida Supreme Court would decide the issue differently, the undersigned will not ignore Florida's intermediate appellate courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240893\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/1008/#p1021\">\n    746 F.3d at 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   FIGG next argues Plaintiffs' reservation-of-rights letters are inadequate under Florida law because they (1) fail to fairly inform the insured that the insurer is seeking to shift the risk to the insured if it is determined a defense was not owed, and (2) fail to inform the insured that it must object within a specified time period or its silence will be deemed an acceptance. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. 18 (alteration added) (citing\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v.

Plaintiffs disagree, contending they reserved the right to seek reimbursement through their reservation-of-rights letters, FIGG continued to accept the defense related payments, and \"Florida law requires no more.\" (Pls.' Reply 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court must again agree with Plaintiffs. FIGG's argument the reservation-of-rights letters fail to \"fairly inform\" of Plaintiffs' intention to seek reimbursement is wholly baseless. FIGG expressly acknowledges the \"[i]nsurers attempt to reserve the right to seek reimbursement of any defense related payments ...\" in its September 24, 2018 letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FIGG's September 24, 2018 Letter [ECF No. 152-1] 6 (alterations added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Royall\n   </em>\n   also fails to persuade. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Royall\n   </em>\n   , FIGG argues a reservation-of-rights letter must include language stating a failure to object constitutes an acceptance.

FIGG contends Plaintiffs' position \"that FIGG's September 24, 2018 letter did not 'unequivocally reject' Travelers' attempt to reserve its right to reimbursement\" creates a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment on the issue. (Def.'s Reply 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs disagree, explaining FIGG's letter is not a rejection of Plaintiffs' reservation of rights, and, in any event, FIGG's September 24, 2018 letter pre-dates Plaintiffs' October 22, 2018 reservation-of-rights letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls. Reply 18). \"After receipt of the October 22, 2018 letter, FIGG remained silent, did not object to the reservation, and continued to accept defense-related payments from Travelers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted)). Plaintiffs state \"[i]f FIGG's counsel had wanted to 'unequivocally reject' Travelers' reservation of its right to seek reimbursement, he certainly knew how to do it; he just didn't.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiffs are once again correct. The Court does not need to determine whether FIGG's September 24, 2018 letter constituted a rejection of Plaintiffs' reservation of rights. The Motions request a determination of Plaintiffs' duty to defend FIGG against the MWC and the MCC. Plaintiffs' reservation-of-rights letter dated October 22, 2018 is the relevant letter acknowledging receipt of the Underlying Complaints at issue and agreeing to defend FIGG as to those allegations, subject to a reservation of rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ivanis Affidavit [ECF No. 146-1] \u00b6 8; Plaintiffs' October 22, 2018 letter [ECF No. 146-1] 81-83).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   FIGG's September 24, 2018 letter expressly acknowledges it is a response to prior correspondence, stating FIGG is not waiving \"its rights to contest each and every reservation set forth in the\n   <em>\n    above referenced correspondences\n   </em>\n   .\" (FIGG's September 24, 2018 Letter 10 (emphasis added)). Whether FIGG rejected the prior reservation-of-rights letters is irrelevant to the Court's disposition. Plaintiffs sent a reservation-of-rights letter to FIGG on October 22, 2018, regarding the Underlying\n   Complaints in this case; FIGG accepted Plaintiffs' defense; and FIGG failed to object to the reservation after receipt of the letter. Florida law requires nothing more from Plaintiffs to be reimbursed for defense-related payments determined to be outside the scope of Plaintiffs' duty to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colony Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11139043,11139101\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/777/1034/\">\n    777 So. 2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1039 ;\n   <em>\n    Jim Black &amp; Assocs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420292\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/932/516/#p518\">\n    932 So. 2d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The only remaining issue is the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of reimbursement owed to Plaintiffs. The parties do not dispute Plaintiffs have made defense-related payments of $840,893.61 on behalf of FIGG - $270,343.52 of which have been paid since the filing of the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' SOF \u00b6 18; Def's Opp. to Pls.' SOF \u00b6 18). Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to reimbursement of the full amount of defense-related payments made on FIGG's behalf - including payments pre-dating the Underlying Complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. 18 n.1). Plaintiffs state \"the same arguments that compel the conclusion that Travelers has no duty to defend the [Underlying Complaints] apply with equal - if not greater - force to the earlier iterations of those complaints.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added)). FIGG disagrees, stating \"it is truly remarkable that Plaintiffs would attempt to seek recovery of anything beyond the amounts expended towards FIGG's defense related to any pleadings other than the Third Amended Master Complaints.\" (Def.'s Mot 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In this, FIGG is correct. As the Court noted in its March 19, 2019 Order, Plaintiffs can seek a \"declaration of the lack of a duty to defend FIGG and their entitlement to reimbursement of fees and costs advanced to FIGG based on\n   <em>\n    the state court pleadings attached to the SAC\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3 (emphasis added)). The Court will not award fees for defense-related payments made regarding state-court complaints the Court has not considered and which are not the subject of the SAC. Presumably, the parties can review the prior - and later - state court complaints, compare them to the Underlying Complaints, and guided by the Court's analysis here, determine whether a duty-to-defend argument can be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
