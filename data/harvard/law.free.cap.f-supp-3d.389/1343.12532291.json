In\n   <em>\n    NEXTEEL I\n   </em>\n   , the court considered seven Rule 56.2 motions for judgment on the agency record and fourteen issues presented by the Parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529186\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/1336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529186\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/1336/\">\n    355 F.

Relevant here, the court held that: (1) Commerce's determination to set SeAH's ocean freight expenses of Canadian shipments equal to the weighted average for Canadian bulk shipments was supported by substantial evidence, (2) Commerce's application of its differential pricing analysis was supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law, and (3) Commerce's decision to apply a particular market situation adjustment to NEXTEEL's reported costs of production was unsupported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529186\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/1336/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529186\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/1336/\">\n    355 F.

Rule 59(e) states that a \"motion to alter or amend a judgment must be served no later than 30 days after the entry of the judgment.\" USCIT R. 59(e). In contrast, Rule 59(a) allows the court, \"on motion,\" to \"grant a new trial or rehearing on all or some of the issues -- and to any party\" after a nonjury trial. USCIT R. 59(a)(1)(B). Rule 59 applies when a judgment has been entered in a case, which has not occurred yet in this action because the court remanded Commerce's determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NEXTEEL I\n   </em>\n   , 43 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529186\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/355/1336/\">\n    355 F.

The court finds that Rule 59 is not the proper avenue for bringing a motion for reconsideration under the current circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court considers both SeAH's and Defendant-Intervenors' motions for reconsideration under Rule 54(b), which addresses\n   actions that adjudicate multiple claims for relief. The rule reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [A]ny order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and\n   <em>\n    may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment\n   </em>\n   adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   USCIT R. 54(b) (emphasis added).
