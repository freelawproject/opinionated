WILLIAMS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   is before the Court on Plaintiff's motion for leave to file an amended complaint. (DE 26). Defendant University of Miami filed a response in opposition to the motion. (DE 27). Plaintiff also filed a reply in support of her motion. (DE 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 28, 2018, Plaintiff filed her initial Complaint in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County. (DE 1). On September 21, 2018, Defendant removed the action to this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Now, one day before the close of discovery, Plaintiff seeks leave to file an Amended Complaint to assert new claims against the Defendant under Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2 (\"Title VII\"). (DE 26). Plaintiff argues that she should be granted leave to amend because she only recently received a notice of right to sue from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    29 CFR \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , she could not have filed her Title VII claims until having received the Notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant opposes the motion and argues that Plaintiff did not exercise sufficient diligence to warrant leave to amend and that it would be unduly prejudiced and forced to initiate discovery against any new claims. (DE 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) states that courts should freely give leave to amend \"when justice so requires,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2), \"a motion to amend may be denied on numerous grounds such as undue delay, undue prejudice to the defendants, and futility of the amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Maynard v.

Fla. June 5, 2014) 12 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, Plaintiff was aware of the evidence supporting her proposed amendment as of May 10, 2018-at least three\n   months prior to bringing this action-when she filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. And Defendant argues that Plaintiff could have requested a right to sue letter prior to the Court's November 2, 2018 deadline for amending pleadings. (DE 27). In her Reply, Plaintiff argues that the EEOC \"was, or appeared to be, actively investigating her claims ... through the end of November 2018 ... [and] [h]ad Plaintiff failed or refused to cooperate with these investigative efforts-including by requesting an early right-to-sue notice-she could have adversely affected her rights to later pursue her claims in court.\" (DE 28). Even if the Court accepts Plaintiff's argument, Plaintiff still had nearly seven months before the discovery deadline to attempt to comply with the Court's scheduling order, whether by requesting leave to amend the Court's deadlines prior to the eve of the discovery deadline or by requesting a stay until the EEOC issued the requisite notice.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moyer v. Walt Disney World Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093087\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/146/1249/#p1252\">\n    146 F.

Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff should not be allowed to amend her complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Upon review of the motion and the record, and for the reasons set forth above, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED AND ADJUDGED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiffs' motion (DE 26) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE AND ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in chambers in Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    17\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of July, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
