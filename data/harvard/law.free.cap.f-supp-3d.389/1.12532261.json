All parties recognize the serious national public health problem posed by OUD and the need for effective treatment options for patients with this addiction. Braeburn's product, Brixadi, delivers buprenorphine through an injectable depot that releases buprenorphine over either a weekly or monthly period. In July 2017, Braeburn applied to the Food &amp; Drug Administration (\"FDA\") for approval of Brixadi and, on December 21, 2018, received tentative approval for both Brixadi Weekly and Monthly. The critical hitch prompting this lawsuit is that, while Brixadi Weekly could receive final approval once Braeburn submitted proposed labeling to the FDA, Brixadi Monthly was not eligible for final approval until November 30, 2020, upon expiration of a three-year right to exclusivity, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(E)(iii), belonging to Indivior's buprenorphine drug product, Sublocade, which also is an injectable depot that releases buprenorphine over a one-month period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Braeburn instituted this action on April 9, 2019 against the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the heads of those agencies in their official capacities, challenging the FDA's\n   determination that Brixadi Monthly cannot be finally approved until Sublocade's three-year exclusivity expires.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   , Compl., ECF No. 1.

FDA Approval of Drugs to Treat Opioid Use Disorder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Opioid use is a public health emergency, with millions of Americans misusing prescription opioids, leading to 33,091 deaths in 2015 alone. AR 162 (sealed). Two million adults have been identified as suffering from OUD, AR 162 (sealed), which \"is a chronic, relapsing disease characterized by the repeated, compulsive seeking or use of an opioid despite adverse social, psychological, and physical consequences,\" AR 158 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   One effective method of treating OUD is through prescription opioids themselves. AR 163-64 (sealed). Buprenorphine is one such opioid, which operates as a \"partial agonist,\" AR 163 (sealed), by attaching to, and activating, a nerve cell's opioid receptor and creating the same effect as an illicit opioid, thereby relieving the urge to use opioids, AR 164 (sealed). A partial agonist such as buprenorphine has effects like a full agonist, but the effects \"are understood to reach a 'ceiling' at moderate doses, beyond which increasing doses of the drug do not produce the increased effect that would result from full opioid agonists.\" AR 165 (sealed). A supposed benefit of that ceiling is to \"limit its attractiveness as a drug of abuse.\" AR 165 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Early Approval of Buprenorphine Drugs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The FDA first approved buprenorphine in 1981 as a pain medication.

Additionally, the euphorigenic effects of even a partial agonist like buprenorphine\n   are strong enough to create an illicit market. AR 165 (sealed). Furthermore, unintentionally exposing children to buprenorphine may be harmful. AR 156 (sealed), 165 (sealed), 1221. Separate from risks associated with a partial agonist, daily-dosing delivery systems pose difficulties attendant to requiring that a patient self-administer the drug for an extended period at home. AR 1221. Accordingly, the FDA has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to devise methods of administering buprenorphine that mitigate these risks, specifically promoting \"well-tolerated, less burdensome treatments, with reduced liability for abuse, misuse, and overdose.\" AR 156 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    (a) Probuphine\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Probuphine, which the FDA approved in May 2016, is one drug that satisfies some of those criteria. AR 404-06 (sealed). Probuphine is a \"6-month subdermal implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability on [8mg per day or less] of a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product.\" AR 404 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    (b) Sublocade\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Sublocade is a second drug to treat OUD that mitigates some of the risks associated with daily, self-administered doses of buprenorphine. Sublocade is an injectable depot that \"provides sustained plasma levels of buprenorphine sufficient to block the effects of exogenous opioids over a minimum of 28 days and is intended for the treatment of moderate to severe ... OUD in patients who have undergone treatment initiation and dose-stabilization with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product.\" AR 12. On May 30, 2017, Indivior filed a new-drug application under \u00a7 355(b)(2) for Sublocade, AR 1, which the FDA approved on November 30, 2017, AR 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Two new clinical investigations were essential to Sublocade's approval. AR 420 (sealed). The first tested how well Sublocade inhibited the subjective effects of opioid use. AR 31, 407 (sealed). Before participants in that study were treated with Sublocade, they were treated for up to 14 days on 8mg to 24mg per day of Suboxone, a drug that administers buprenorphine sublingually, to achieve dose stabilization, AR 31, which is the brief process of identifying the dose of buprenorphine needed to mitigate precipitated withdrawal symptoms, AR 65, 407 n.21 (sealed). Participants able to complete the stabilization phase received a 300mg injection of Sublocade on the first and twenty-ninth days of the study. AR 31-33. At different days across the study, participants were injected with either a narcotic or a placebo and asked to measure their \"drug liking.\" AR 33. This study showed that \"drug liking\" scores for participants receiving Sublocade were not higher than participants receiving a placebo. AR 33 (sealed). The second investigation tested the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of multiple Sublocade injections over a 24-week period. AR 43. Again, participants started on Suboxone for three days, and then dose adjusted for between four and 11 days. AR 43, 407 (sealed). Participants who managed the stabilization phase (and who were not randomly selected for a placebo) were randomized between a path on which they received a 300mg dose of Sublocade once per month for six months or a path on which they received two monthly doses of 300mg Sublocade, followed by four monthly doses of 100mg Sublocade. AR 43, 407 (sealed). This study showed that Sublocade blocked the effects of opioid use for the entire period between doses. AR 45, 408 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    (c) Brixadi\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Brixadi is a third drug that treats OUD while addressing the risks associated with\n   daily, self-administered doses of buprenorphine. Braeburn submitted a \u00a7 355(b)(2) application in the summer of 2017 for Brixadi, shortly after Indivior had filed its application for Sublocade. AR 142 (sealed), 152 (sealed). Like Sublocade, Brixadi is an \"extended-release formulation of buprenorphine ... for the treatment of moderate to severe ... OUD in adults.\" AR 152 (sealed). Unlike Sublocade, Brixadi comes in both a weekly and monthly depot version. AR 152 (sealed).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Braeburn's application for approval of Brixadi relied on three of its own clinical investigations of the drug's safety and effectiveness in both versions. AR 409 (sealed). The first study involved stabilizing participants with an oral opioid for three to seven days, AR 185 (sealed), and then administering Brixadi Weekly for seven weeks, AR 183 (sealed), and showed that 24mg and 32mg doses of Brixadi Weekly inhibit the subjective effects of opioid use, AR 183 (sealed), 409 (sealed). The second study involved participants who were new to buprenorphine treatment, each of whom received a 4mg test dose of buprenorphine, AR 194-196 (sealed), 200 (sealed), 409 (sealed), followed by an injection of Brixadi Weekly, AR 194 (sealed), 199 (sealed), 202 (sealed). After taking the weekly product for 12 weeks, participants transitioned to Brixadi Monthly. AR 194 (sealed), 202 (sealed). This investigation demonstrated that Brixadi \"would be appropriate for use from the first patient visit ... so that no take-home house of sublingual buprenorphine would be necessary in the real-world setting.\" AR 194 (sealed). A third study confirmed the safety of Brixadi Weekly and Monthly over an extended period, AR 178 (sealed), 180 (sealed), 225 (sealed), and involved participants, who were both new-to-treatment and transitioning from prior buprenorphine treatment, AR 178-180 (sealed), 225 (sealed), with new-to-treatment patients all starting on Brixadi Weekly, AR 234 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On December 21, 2018, the FDA tentatively approved Braeburn's application for Brixadi. AR 270. Prescribing information included with the tentative approval specified that before taking Brixadi, patients new to buprenorphine should take a 4mg transmucosal test dose to confirm their buprenorphine tolerance without experiencing precipitated withdrawal. AR 278. If the test dose is tolerated, patients may then receive a 16mg dose of Brixadi Weekly, followed three days later by an 8mg dose of the weekly product. AR 278. In the first week of treatment, the patient can receive one more 8mg dose if needed. AR 278-79. After the first week, the patient receives Brixadi Weekly at a volume that matches the total amount of the drug administered in week one. AR 278-79. While new-to-treatment patients may not use Brixadi Monthly, patients already being treated with either a transmucosal buprenorphine product or Brixadi Weekly may transition to one of Brixadi Monthly's doses: 64mg, 96mg, or 128mg. AR 278-79. Approval for Brixadi Weekly, however, was only tentative pending the FDA's receipt of appropriate labeling from Braeburn, a step Braeburn has not taken, AR 403 (sealed), and approval for Brixadi Monthly was only tentative because that product \"is subject to expiration of a period of patent protection and/or exclusivity\" and so final approval \"may not be granted before the period has expired,\" AR 270.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     FDA's Letter Decision Blocking Final Approval of Monthly Brixadi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The same day that the FDA sent Braeburn the tentative approval letter, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Exclusivity Board issued a letter decision (\"Letter Decision\") explaining why Brixadi Monthly was not eligible for final approval.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   AR 402-36 (sealed). The agency assessed whether Brixadi Monthly was blocked by the three-year exclusivity, under \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii), belonging to Probuphine or Sublocade. AR 403 (sealed). While Probuphine's exclusivity, the FDA decided, did not bar market entry for either Brixadi product, Sublocade's exclusivity, which does not expire until November 30, 2020, prevented final approval of Brixadi Monthly. AR 403 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Letter Decision explained that the FDA interprets the phrase \"for the conditions of approval,\" the operative language in \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii)'s bar clause, to mean that the FDA may not approve any application under \u00a7 355(b) for a drug product that shares the exclusivity-eligible drug's \"innovation represented by its approved drug product that is supported by new clinical investigations essential to approval.\" AR 416 (sealed). Thus, \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) prevents the FDA from approving a drug application if the applied-for drug shares a quality that the FDA deems another drug sponsor to have innovated and to have obtained approval for in the prior three years. AR 416 (sealed). At the same time, \"[e]xclusivity does not extend beyond the scope of the approval and does not cover aspects of the drug product for which new clinical investigations were not essential.\" AR 415-16 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For Probuphine, the protected innovation was a \"subdermal implant product for a 6-month period, for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who have achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability on low-to-moderate doses of a transmucosal buprenorphine containing product.\" AR 420 (sealed). Brixadi's did not share that innovation because it was not \"a 6-month subdermal implant, but rather, [a] weekly and monthly depot injection[ ] of buprenorphine.\" AR 420 (sealed). Moreover, Brixadi is \"for use in a different patient population than that for which Probuphine is approved, not limited to patients who have been stable on a low to moderate dose of buprenorphine for multiple months.\" AR 420 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For Sublocade, the clinical studies essential to Sublocade's approval demonstrated only that a monthly depot would be effective and only to treat moderate to severe OUD. AR 421 (sealed). Consequently, Sublocade's innovation, and exclusivity, extended only to \"the dosing interval provided by the monthly depot product that delivered an appropriate amount of buprenorphine over a one-month period to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 421 (sealed). The agency found that Sublocade's exclusivity was not, however, \"constrained by the use of the specific treatment initiation or dose adjustment schedule, or to the strengths for which it is approved\" because the drug's ability to deliver the right amount of buprenorphine through a monthly depot \"is not necessarily limited to or dependent on the particular treatment initiation, dose adjustment schedule, or strengths.\" AR 421-22 (sealed). In the agency's view, if Sublocade's innovation were limited by those features, the drug's exclusivity would be narrower than its innovation. AR 422 (sealed). Sublocade blocked Brixadi Monthly because both are \"a monthly depot buprenorphine product to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 422 (sealed). Sublocade did not block the\n   weekly product because of the different dosing interval. AR 422 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While Braeburn had argued that \"certain features of the way the Sublocade studies were conducted impacts whether Sublocade's exclusivity blocks approval of Brixadi,\" the agency disagreed. AR 427 (sealed). Those features of the clinical studies were found to be \"not meaningfully different when comparing Sublocade with the monthly version of Brixadi,\" AR 427 (sealed), or irrelevant because Brixadi Monthly still \"shares the exclusivity-protected conditions of approval,\" AR 429 (sealed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 429 n.89 (sealed) (rejecting clinical significance of differences between Sublocade and Brixadi Monthly). In other words, while acknowledging \"differences between Sublocade and Braeburn's proposed monthly depot products,\" the agency rejected Braeburn's position that those differences were significant for exclusivity since \"the relevant aspect of the subsequent application for purposes of this analysis is that it also seeks to deliver buprenorphine via a depot dosage form over a monthly period to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 430. Finally, the agency rejected Braeburn's contention that Brixadi Weekly and Monthly are an integrated system, determining that \"[u]se of the monthly product is not dependent on use of the weekly product, or vice versa.\" AR 435 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Independent of the FDA's determination that Sublocade's three-year exclusivity bars final approval of Brixadi Monthly, on April 5, 2019, Braeburn petitioned the FDA to \"revoke orphan drug designation ... for Sublocade ... injection for treatment of opiate addiction in opiate users.\" Citizen Petition from Goodwin Proctor, LLP on behalf of Braeburn, Inc.

To begin, as Indivior readily concedes, the FDA has not resolved whether Sublocade is entitled to ODE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Properly framed, then, Indivior's argument is that a hypothesized future event that might injure Braeburn in the same way as the challenged agency decision leaves Braeburn without standing. In that light, the frailty of Indivior's standing argument emerges. Braeburn's access to judicial relief does not require that it disprove any speculated alternative source of injury that Indivior conjures, but only that it marshals evidence of injury, causation, and redressability sufficient for the summary judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duke Power Co. v.

Contrary to Indivior's assertion, Sublocade did not have a fully intact right to ODE when\n   FDARA took effect.\n   <em>\n    Depomed\n   </em>\n   identified two conditions that, when both were satisfied, bestowed ODE: (1) orphan designation and (2) approval of the orphan-designated drug's \u00a7 355(b) application.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178558\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/66/217/#p226\">\n    66 F.

When FDARA added a third criterion-that the drug's sponsor shows clinical superiority to any already-approved version of same drug,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360cc(c)(1) -Sublocade had not yet been approved and thus had not satisfied both conditions of the pre-FDARA version of \u00a7 360cc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Alternatively, Indivior insists that even if Sublocade had no existing right to ODE at the time FDARA was passed, Sublocade's current right to ODE is certain because Sublocade is subject to the pre-FDARA version of \u00a7 360cc, and thus not beholden to the newly enacted clinical superiority requirement under \u00a7 360cc(c). Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 5-8. That argument relies on the FDARA's Rule of Construction, which directs that the statute's amendments shall not \"affect any determination under ... ( 21 U.S.C. 360bb, 360cc ) made prior to the date of enactment of the [FDARA].\" FDARA \u00a7 607(b), 131 Stat. at 1050. Indivior understands the Rule of Construction to require that Sublocade's right to ODE be assessed under the pre-FDARA version of \u00a7 360cc because, before FDARA, ODE followed from a single determination: the FDA's determination to orphan-designate a drug under \u00a7 360bb. Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 5-6. Not rewarding Sublocade with ODE would affect that determination. Further, Indivior reasons, FDARA amended only \u00a7 360cc, but the Rule of Construction directs that the amendments shall not affect any determination under \u00a7 360cc\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 360bb.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. According to Indivior, including a reference to \u00a7 360bb in the Rule of Construction respects the benefits attendant to a designation under that section.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Despite Indivior's reasoning, how to apply FDARA to a drug that had been orphan-designated before FDARA, but not approved under \u00a7 355(b) until after FDARA was enacted, is uncertain. Plausibly read, leaving intact Indivior's receipt of orphan designation while applying \u00a7 360cc(c)'s new standard respects the only actual\n   <em>\n    determination\n   </em>\n   made prior to FDARA (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the orphan-drug designation), even if application of this new standard affects a possible\n   <em>\n    consequence\n   </em>\n   of that determination. Either way, Sublocade is still orphan-designated. In the end, no resolution of how \u00a7 360cc applies here is reached, but FDARA's amendments are one reason that Sublocade's entitlement to ODE is not inevitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   If Sublocade's entitlement to ODE falls under the current version of \u00a7 360cc, the drug's right to ODE depends on the FDA finding that Sublocade is clinically superior to prior versions of the same drug that received ODE. Indivior points to nothing in the record showing that the FDA has made such a determination. Moreover, even if Sublocade were found to be clinically superior to past versions of the same drug, the FDA might determine that Brixadi Monthly is clinically superior to Sublocade and thus not subject to Sublocade's ODE.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20316.3\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 316.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(14), 316.31(a). Again, resolution of these issues is not necessary here, but merely recognizing them as possibilities adds layers of doubt to Indivior's prognostications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Finally, as of April 5, 2019, the FDA has under consideration a citizen petition filed by Braeburn to strip Indivior of the orphan designation received for buprenorphine, which dates back over 25 years.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Citizen Petition. In brief, the petition contends that buprenorphine should not be orphan-designated now because OUD is not a rare disease and the FDA's analysis of whether a buprenorphine\n   drug used to treat OUD would be profitable was inaccurate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20316.3\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20316.3\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If that petition succeeds, Sublocade will lose its predicate for ODE. Together, these considerations show that the prospect of Sublocade receiving ODE, and thus the possibility of an independent source of Braeburn's purported injury, is uncertain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Despite the current uncertainty of Sublocade's right to ODE, Indivior relies primarily on two cases as support for the proposition that Braeburn does not have constitutional standing.

Initially, at least, Braeburn tacks in this direction, suggesting that \"the conditions of approval\" unambiguously refers to all \"the conditions under which the drug is approved for patient use, as stated on the drug's label.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Still, that interpretation does not fit neatly enough to be unambiguously correct. Protecting exclusivity rights only if a follow-on product matches every condition listed in the first product's label would curtail exclusivity narrowly to exclude only precisely identical drug products, a result plainly at odds with Congress's goal of incentivizing research with market exclusivity. For example, Sublocade's labeling says not to store the product at room temperature and to wait 15 minutes for the drug to reach room temperature before injection. AR 99. If \"the conditions of approval\" encompasses all that appears in a drug product's label, then Braeburn would be out from under Sublocade's exclusivity for creating a product that was identical in all respects save for safe storage at room temperature. Beyond that troubling outcome, reading \"the conditions of approval\" to mean all restrictions and directions that appear on a label would equate this phrase with, and leave no space for, the phrase\n   \"conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling,\" which appears multiple times in the same statute,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), (e), (j)(2)(A)(i), and matches better as a reference to the full universe of directions and restrictions contained on a label.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Second, as Braeburn later suggests, \"the conditions of approval\" might encompass \"the conditions under which the FDA approved the exclusivity-protected drug for patient use, as reflected in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the FDA-approved labeling.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 7. Already, then, Braeburn has changed gears, strongly hinting at the phrase's uncertain meaning. Beyond that, Braeburn does not explain why the \"Indications and Usage\" section of a drug product's label is talismanic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   A third plausible reading is that \"the conditions of approval\" refers to \"the particular circumstances that the FDA finds relevant to its determination that a drug should be approved for marketing, such as its method of delivery, the class of patients to whom it is to be delivered, or the nature of the chemical substance involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Otsuka I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524494\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/302/375/#p382\">\n    302 F. Supp. 3d at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That interpretation has the virtue of linking \"conditions\" more closely to the FDA's \"approval\" determination, which in turn depends on investigations showing that the drug is safe and effective.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). From that angle, \"the conditions of approval\" might be each of the drug product's characteristics or indications that, if changed, would render the drug unsafe, ineffective, or unfit for approval. Problematically for this interpretative route, the statute does not guide how to discern which conditions necessarily inform whether the FDA approves a new drug product. While establishing the safety and effectiveness of a drug's chemical substance and method of delivery in a certain class of patients might be essential to the FDA's approval decision, so, too, might the safety of a drug product's dosage form or strength or the effectiveness with which the drug minimizes negative side effects. Thus, even if construing \"the conditions of approval\" as the circumstances that inform the FDA decision is plausible, the statute does not compel this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The structure of \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) indicates a fourth approach to identifying which of the drug product's features are the \"conditions of approval.\" As with other exclusivity-conferring provisions in the FDCA, \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) operates through complementary clauses. In a regulation not challenged here, the FDA has interpreted the phrase \"new clinical investigation\" in the eligibility clause to mean investigations that produce results \"which have not been relied on by FDA to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness of a previously approved drug product for any indication or of safety for a new patient population and do not duplicate the results of another investigation that was relied on by the agency to demonstrate the effectiveness or safety in a new patient population of a previously approved drug product.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20314.108\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Eligibility for exclusivity, then, is the result of scientific breakthrough demonstrating the effective, safe use of a drug product for a new indication or in a new patient population. If \"[t]he FDCA sets up a 'logical relationship between the change in the product for which the new clinical investigations were essential to approval of the [new drug application], and the scope of any resulting three-year exclusivity,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veloxis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365649\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/104/#p120\">\n    109 F.

Supp. 2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80 (D.D.C. 2012) ), then harmonizing the two clauses might mean interpreting \"the conditions of approval\" as tied to the specific characteristics of the drug that warranted\n   exclusivity in the first instance. In short, \"the conditions of approval\" would be the novel indications or patient populations for which the drug product may be used. That interpretation has the added benefit of serving the Hatch-Waxman Amendments' objective of finding an equilibrium that protects research and leaves room for market competition. On the other hand, separate exclusivity provisions in the FDCA bar subsequent approval \"of an application submitted ... for a change approved in\" a previously-approved supplemental application containing new clinical investigations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(E)(iv), (j)(5)(F)(iv). The phrase \"a change approved in\" does not appear in \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii), but more strongly signals that the scope of exclusivity should be regarded in reference to novel features of a drug product that begot exclusivity in the first instance. If \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) unambiguously was intended to work the same way, the bar clause more likely would have used language that specifically referenced the changes documented in the new clinical investigations, as was done in provisions conferring exclusivity to supplemental applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   All of this is to say that while Braeburn and the FDA agree that \"the conditions of approval\" refers in some way to the protected drug product's characteristics, how to determine the subset of characteristics that matters for purposes of exclusivity is ambiguous.

From there, the FDA defends its construction as consistent with Congressional intent because \"legislative history indicates that Congress intended 3-year exclusivity to protect only innovations that required the support of new clinical investigations essential to approval.\" AR 417 (sealed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 576 ( 54 Fed. Reg. at 28,896 ) (citing Congress's intention to award drug sponsor's with exclusivity only for significant developments). Defining \"the conditions of approval\" to protect an exclusivity-eligible drug product's innovative features \"strikes a balance between rewarding innovation and increasing access as Congress intended.\" AR 429 (sealed). Cognizant of the peril of the first plausible interpretation described in Section III.B.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Letter Decision explains that \"the conditions of approval\" cannot mean all the circumstances under which a drug product has been approved or modest changes to a drug product might save it from another's right to exclusivity, and render the right to exclusivity \"virtually meaningless.\" AR 429 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In the abstract, identifying \"the conditions of approval\" as the features of the drug that the clinical investigations essential to approval showed, for the first time, to be safe and effective-in other words, a drug's innovative features-respects the relationship between \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii)'s complementary clauses, Congress's intent, and is a first step toward filling the statutory ambiguity. In practice, however, describing a feature as an \"innovation\" risks becoming an empty label if the agency lacks a standard by which innovation is determined. To that end, the FDA adequately explains when a drug product's characteristics are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   innovative, namely: if the characteristic already has been proved safe and effective in conjunction with a prior drug application. AR 417 (sealed). Yet, that definition is incomplete as it provides only a threshold for a characteristic to be deemed innovative. If exclusivity under \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) protects innovation, the FDA needs a rationale, based in the statute, to define the boundaries of a drug product's innovation. On that front, the agency advances no principle-legal or scientific-that guides its determination. Without any intelligible decisional principle for identifying innovation, the FDA's standard simply supplants the ambiguous phrase \"the conditions of approval\" for the ambiguous term \"innovation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To see the FDA's innovation standard in action illuminates how this really is no standard at all. For Sublocade, the FDA began its exclusivity analysis by reciting how Sublocade is not novel relative to previous buprenorphine drug products. AR 420-21 (sealed). Focusing on Sublocade's essential clinical studies, the FDA then concluded that Sublocade was the first product demonstrated to safely and effectively treat moderate-to-severe OUD through a monthly buprenorphine depot. AR 421 (sealed). Thus, Sublocade's innovation was a \"monthly depot product that delivered an appropriate amount of buprenorphine over a one-month period to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 421 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Based on a review of the essential clinical studies, the FDA understood Sublocade's innovation as circumscribed both in terms of the dosing interval and severity of disease to be treated. Yet, in the next\n   paragraph of the Letter Decision the FDA appreciates additional ways in which the same studies were limited: Sublocade is available only \"to patients who have initiated treatment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product, followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of 7 days\" and is approved only for 300mg and 100mg doses. AR 421 (sealed). Still, the FDA dismissed these clinical study limits in defining the scope of the \"innovation\" and related exclusivity, stating, \"Sublocade's exclusivity is not constrained by the use of the specific treatment initiation or dose adjustment schedule, or to the strengths for which it is approved ... because the scope of an application's exclusivity covers the innovative change that is supported by the new clinical investigation.\" AR 421-22 (sealed). For reasons the FDA claimed already to have given, \"Sublocade's innovation, for which it received exclusivity, was that the dosing interval provided by the monthly depot product delivered an appropriate amount of buprenorphine over a one-month period to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 422 (sealed). Sublocade's specific treatment regime, including the required dose-initiation schedule and dosing strengths, the FDA explained, did not limit that Sublocade treats OUD through a monthly buprenorphine depot and \"[t]o determine that the scope of exclusivity encompassed those aspects would interpret Sublocade's exclusivity more narrowly than the scope of its innovation.\" AR 422 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The FDA's statements, however, leave the most important question unanswered: what\n   <em>\n    standard\n   </em>\n   -legal or scientific-has the FDA applied to define Sublocade's innovation in the broad manner set forth in the Letter Decision? Why is dosing interval a way in which Sublocade's innovation is limited, but the drug product's high-loading dose of 300mg, the patient population on which it was tested, or other details of its specific treatment regime, are not? Leaving questions like that unexplored is especially pertinent given that both the FDCA and the FDA appreciate that drugs' characteristics may differ in multiple important dimensions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j)(2)(A)(iii) (making approval of an abbreviated new drug application contingent upon the drug sponsor showing \"that the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the new drug are the same as those of\" an already-approved drug); AR 579 ( 54 Fed.

At a minimum, then, patient population seems to be a critical dimension for defining the scope of the \"innovation\" and related exclusivity. To say, as the FDA has, that differences between the strength of Sublocade and a second drug, or differences in the patient population to which Sublocade and a second drug are available, for example, cannot be considered without infringing Sublocade's innovation is self-referential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Rather than identifying a principle that guides how to conceive the limits of a drug product's innovation, the agency instead, at least here, defined innovation in the broadest possible sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 13. An example, taken from Braeburn,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 27-28; Pl.'s Opp'n at 17-18, illustrates the unreasonableness of that approach. Imagine that the FDA approves an application for a new drug product that is\n   supported by an essential clinical investigation documenting, for the first time, the safety and effectiveness of a drug that administers buprenorphine in a monthly depot formula as a treatment for patients with OUD. All participants in the underlying essential clinical study, however, were men, leaving the drug product unapproved as a treatment for women. Under the FDA's approach, the relevant innovation would be defined as a monthly buprenorphine depot to treat OUD, rather than a monthly buprenorphine depot to treat OUD in men. As a consequence of defining the innovation in such a fashion, the exclusivity-eligible drug product bars approval of a subsequent monthly buprenorphine product shown to be an effective treatment for a patient population that the first drug does not reach,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The FDA's response is that the second drug, which showed for the first time the safety and effectiveness of administering a monthly buprenorphine depot to women, would be entitled to its own three-year period of exclusivity for that innovation but only when free from the first-drug's exclusivity. AR 417 (sealed); Defs.' Reply at 14 n.7. The same result would obtain, according to the FDA, if Braeburn had, for example, demonstrated that Brixadi Monthly could be used without any titration period. Rough Tr. (July 15, 2019) at 55:7-16. Still, for the three-years that the initial drug product's exclusivity is effective, that exclusivity right keeps from the market a product that can serve an entirely distinct patient population or can be administered in a setting in which the first product categorically is unavailable. The disincentive for new innovations to expand available treatment options for new patient populations is obvious and appears to run counter to the over-arching goal of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The FDA does not answer how defining conditions of approval in a manner permitting those outcomes is reasonable. For a statutory construction, such as the FDA's, which identified only Congressional intent for support, those outcomes are tough to accept without any reasoned analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Indivior and the FDA each fall back on characterizing the agency's definition of innovation as a scientific judgment entitled to special deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Certainly, in the process of determining when one drug product's exclusivity bars another drug's final approval the FDA exercises a degree of scientific judgment to draw proper lines. Indeed, parts of the Letter Decision suggest when that expertise is appropriately dispatched. For example, the FDA described certain elements of Brixadi Monthly as not \"meaningfully different\" from those of Sublocade. AR 427 (sealed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 429 n.89 (sealed) (\"[W]e do not agree with many of the arguments Braeburn made regarding the clinical significance of differences between the two products.\"); AR 430 (sealed) (calling differences between Sublocade and Brixadi Monthly not \"meaningful distinctions\"). Yet, before the stage at which the FDA determines that differences between two drug products are not \"meaningful\" for purposes of exclusivity, the FDA must explain the standard, consistent with \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii), that informs how the innovation against which those difference are judged is defined. As it stands, the FDA's judgment about whether Sublocade and Brixadi Monthly are meaningfully different was made against the backdrop of an approach to defining Sublocade's innovation that lacked substantive guideposts, and, consequently, against a possibly overly narrow vision of what \"differences are relevant for\n   purposes of this analysis.\" AR 429 (sealed). Once the FDA made its unguided decision that Sublocade's innovation was a monthly depot to treat moderate-to-severe OUD, any other difference was necessarily irrelevant, even if those differences make Brixadi Monthly available to a patient population, for example, that Sublocade is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Indivior also argues, Intervenor-Def.'s Mem. at 29; Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 16, that the FDA's long-standing interpretation of \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) should be presumed reasonable because Congress has not changed the relevant provisions of the FDCA since the FDA first adopted its interpretation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lorillard v.

Pl.'s Mem. at 34-37. For Probuphine, the FDA limited the drug's defined innovation, in part, based on the patient population participating in the essential clinical investigation. Specifically, while \"Probuphine was the first buprenorphine product to deliver buprenorphine via a subdermal implant,\" the approved dose was shown \"to be effective for the treatment of opioid dependence only for a limited population of certain stable patients, so the scope of approval limited to such patients and therefore, the innovative change represented by Probuphine relates to the use of buprenorphine in that dosage form for that indication.\" AR 419 (sealed). Accordingly, \"the conditions of approval\" that defined the scope of exclusivity were \"[1] a single-entity buprenorphine [2] subdermal implant product [3] for a 6-month period, [4] for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence [5] in patients who have achieved and sustained prolonged clinical stability [6] on low-to-moderate doses of a transmucosal buprenorphine containing product.\" AR 420 (sealed). Brixadi Monthly was not barred by Probuphine because the drug product did not share at least four of those criteria. Specifically, Brixadi Monthly was not a \"6-month subdermal implant, but rather, for weekly and monthly depot injections of buprenorphine\" and was \"not limited to patients who have been stable on a low to moderate dose of buprenorphine for multiple months.\" AR 420 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As with Probuphine, Sublocade was tested only on an identified patient population: new-to-treatment OUD patients \"who have initiated treatment with a transmucosal buprenorphine-containing product, followed by dose adjustment for a minimum of 7 days.\" AR 421 (sealed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 14 (explaining that during Sublocade's development, Indivior had expressly elected to study its drug product in patient new to treatment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consistent with that approach, Sublocade was approved only for new patients who have undergone \"dose\n   adjustment for a minimum of 7 days.\" AR 97.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, Sublocade's innovation was not defined as limited by the patient group on which the drug was tested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The FDA acknowledged in the Letter Decision that Sublocade was tested on a specific patient population, and that Braeburn sought approval for both \"the induction and stabilization of patients that are new to buprenorphine treatment, as well as maintenance treatment for patients already receiving buprenorphine.\" AR 428 (sealed). Nonetheless, the agency characterized that difference as irrelevant to exclusivity because Brixadi Monthly shared Sublocade's exclusivity-protected innovation: a product that \"deliver[s] buprenorphine via a depot dosage form over a monthly period to treat moderate to severe OUD.\" AR 430 (sealed). That, however, does not answer why Sublocade's innovation had not been defined differently to account for the patient populations to which the drug could, and could not, safely be administered. By contrast, the patient population studied in Probuphine's clinical investigation was adopted into the statement of that drug product's innovation, and as a consequence narrowed the reach of Probuphine's exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In their respective briefs, the FDA and Indivior each argues that the agency's approach to exclusivity for Sublocade was consistent with that of Probuphine.

For kidney transplants, a product that established its safety and effectiveness in\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   patients did not bar subsequent approval of the same drug for conversion patients because the two groups have different \"inherent risks and goals.\" AR 431 (sealed). In contrast, the ways in which Braeburn suggested Brixadi Monthly is different from Sublocade \"are not differences that cause the monthly depot product proposed in the Brixadi application to fall outside the conditions of approval for which Sublocade received exclusivity.\" AR 432 (sealed). Despite those differences, \"Braeburn is still seeking approval of a monthly depot formulation that delivers an appropriate amount of buprenorphine to treat OUD.\" AR 432 (sealed). To substantiate that conclusion, the FDA referred to its earlier section defining Sublocade's innovation. AR 432 (sealed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   This treatment of Sublocade's exclusivity, Braeburn urges, failed to limit the scope of Sublocade's innovation by the patient population on which the drug was tested-in this case, patients who \"initiated with at least seven days of oral buprenorphine treatment,\" Pl.'s Mem. at 39-as had been done by limiting Astagraf XL's innovation to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   patients. In its brief, the FDA defends its consistency, commenting that the agency did not impose any specific patient population as a limit on Sublocade's innovation because the efficacy demonstrated in Sublocade's testing \"was not limited to a particular patient population.\" Defs.' Mem. at 34-35 (citing AR 421-22 (sealed)). Yet, in the cited portion of the Letter Decision, the FDA simply declared that \"the particular treatment initiation, dose adjustment schedule, or strength\" tested in Sublocade's studies cannot limit the scope of exclusivity or Sublocade's exclusivity would be tailored \"more narrowly than the scope of its innovation.\" AR 422 (sealed). That portion of the Letter Decision, however, does not answer why the FDA could define Astagraf XL's innovation as limited to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   patients without improperly depriving its sponsor of the benefit of the underlying innovation but the same could not be done for Sublocade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Indivior, for its part, tries to rebut Braeburn's assertion about the FDA's departure from precedent by arguing that Brixadi Monthly and Sublocade do not actually treat different patient populations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Intervenor-Def.'s Mem. at 35-43; Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 21-25. Braeburn disagrees. In its view, proper line-drawing would permit final approval of Brixadi Monthly because that product \"does not require take-home transmucosal buprenorphine for outpatient use\" prior to the first monthly injection, Pl.'s Mem. at 41-42, and because Braeburn has established, for the first time, the safety of efficacy of administering a monthly buprenorphine treatment to clinically stable OUD patients,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Whether Indivior or Braeburn is right, how Brixadi Monthly differs from Sublocade is an inquiry separate from the scope of Sublocade's innovation. Sure enough, the FDA's reply brief explains that \"[t]he patient populations included in the Brixadi clinical studies have no bearing on the scope of the new clinical investigations essential to\n   <em>\n    Sublocade's\n   </em>\n   approval.\" Defs.' Reply at 22 (emphasis in original). Whether Sublocade's innovation still would block Brixadi Monthly if the agency had applied its innovation standard consistent with precedent is up to the agency to decide in the first instance. Still, the possibility of that decision leading to the same end point does not absolve the FDA from consistently applying its interpretation of \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   For this final reason, the Letter Decision must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Additionally, the plural use of \"conditions\" in \u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(iii) suggests that the statute is contemplating some combination of the drugs' characteristics. Finally, Indivior's interpretation would expand the right to exclusivity by barring any follow-on drug using the same active ingredient to treat the same condition, no matter the first drug's limits and thereby potentially deprive too many people of necessary drugs, impairing the balance the Hatch-Waxman Amendments were intended to strike. Confusingly, Indivior's response to this overbreadth concern is that the FDA does not actually apply Indivior's interpretation. Intervenor-Def.'s Reply at 18. In any event, the phrase \"the conditions of approval\" is ambiguous in other respects and the FDA does not employ Indivior's hypothesized interpretation.
