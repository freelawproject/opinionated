(\"MRAB\") entered into two contracts with Defendant Applied Underwriters Captive Risk Assurance Company, Inc. (\"AUCRA\"), pursuant to which AUCRA provided workers' compensation insurance to MRAB. MRAB brought suit over fees AUCRA attempted to charge in relation to the two contracts. The parties engaged in arbitration that resulted in a final arbitration award (\"Final Award\") in March 2018. MRAB moved to confirm the Final Award. Because an outstanding issue remained regarding the second contract, this Court remanded the issue to the arbitrator to resolve in the first instance. In January 2019, the arbitrator issued a decision on\n   remand (\"Remand Order\"). MRAB now moves to confirm the Final Award and Remand Order, whereas AUCRA moves to vacate the Remand Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 62 (\"Pl. Mot.\"), 64 (\"Def. Mot.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES in part\n   </strong>\n   both motions. The Final Award, as supplemented by the Remand Order, is confirmed in full with the exception of the Remand Order provision increasing the interest rate applied to sums owed under the first RPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MRAB entered into two Reinsurance Participation Agreements (\"RPAs\") for workers' compensation insurance with AUCRA. The first RPA was entered into on October 1, 2009, and the second on October 1, 2012. Docket No. 1 (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19. Each RPA had a three-year term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 68-2, Exh. A (2009 RPA), Exh. B (2012 RPA). Under the RPAs, MRAB deposited money into a \"cell\" to pay employees' workers' compensation claims. Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2013, following the expiration of the first RPA and the closing of all claims it covered, MRAB demanded that AUCRA reimburse the $79,167 remaining in the cell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. AUCRA refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, following the expiration of the second RPA, AUCRA sent a statement informing MRAB that it owed $361,000 in additional collateral.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. The statement explained that the amount was \"due based on [MRAB's] actual claims applying run-off Loss Development Factors (LDFs) and an additional capital deposit of $44,441.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Loss Development Factors\" are factors AUCRA uses to calculate the potential costs associated with workers' compensation claims that may continue to accrue after the end of the active period of the RPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 23-24. Once an RPA expires, AUCRA applies LDFs to each open and closed claim to determine whether the employer needs to pay additional collateral to cover the potential future costs of claims. At this time, two claims under the second RPA remain active.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Order at 3. MRAB refused to pay the $361,000 requested by AUCRA.

The complaint also sought disgorgement of the money MRAB paid to AUCRA under the RPAs and damages for fraud, breach of contract, and unfair business practices.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   AUCRA moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clause in the RPAs.

The Final Award ordered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) AUCRA shall pay MRAB $79,167.00 and any return premium due on the first RPA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) AUCRA's claim for $361,024.41 on the second RPA is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) AUCRA is prohibited from using \"Run-off Loss Development Factors\" to calculate the amount owed by MRAB for claims under the second RPA. Instead, AUCRA must calculate the amount owed using \"Weekly Open Claims and Closed Claims Loss Development Factors.\" Any return premium generated by the application of the revised LDF calculation will be paid to MRAB.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) The amounts specified were due January 10, 2018, and subject to a 5% simple interest rate accruing beginning at January 10, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) Each party will bear the cost of its own legal fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (6) The administrative fees and expenses of the arbitration proceeding, totaling $5,750.00, and the compensation and expenses of the arbitrator, totaling $21,250.00, shall be borne by both parties equally. Therefore, MRAB shall reimburse AUCRA the sum of $1,125.01, representing the portion of said fees and expenses in excess of the apportioned costs previously incurred by AUCRA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   AUCRA did not comply with the Final Award, and MRAB moved to confirm it. Docket No. 56. However, the parties continued to dispute how to perform the LDF calculations for the second RPA. The Court accordingly denied MRAB's motion to confirm the Final Award without prejudice and remanded the dispute to the arbitrator for the limited purpose of resolving the outstanding issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [T]he matter is remanded to the arbitrator to resolve in the first instance the Parties' dispute over specific calculations for claims under the second Reinsurance Participation Agreement (Plan Period 10/1/12 to 10/1/15) discussed on page 3 of the Interim Order and pages 3-4 of the Final Award.

Over the course of December 2018 and January 2019, the arbitrator sent several emails to the parties requesting information about the mechanics of the RPAs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 68-1, Exhs. 17, 25, 27. During this period, AUCRA thrice suggested that the arbitrator schedule a hearing to address the issues raised in his emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhs. 29, 30, 39.

Docket No. 62-1, Exh. D (\"Disposition of Application and Remand\"). The arbitrator stated that in the Final Award, he had \"erred in assuming that only the Run-Off Loss Development Factors ... could increase the amount potentially due under AUCRA's calculations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. In fact, \"[t]wo other factors potentially come into play,\" including whether it was appropriate to \"[a]pply[ ] the LDFs in schedule 1 of the second RPA beyond the 36-month cut-off.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator determined that \"the LDFs in Schedule 1 of the RPA do not apply past\n   36 months\"-that is, AUCRA cannot apply LDFs in calculating ultimate claim costs for any claims older than 36 months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Accordingly, the arbitrator declined to apply LDFs to claims older than 36 months under the second RPA and recalculated the current charges under the second RPA as follows:\n  </p>\n  <table id=\"p-37\">\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Total Paid by MRAB\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     $1,439,090\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Outstanding Loss Reserves\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     ($179,585)\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Paid Losses\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     ($649,920)\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Base Fee to AUCRA\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     ($438,853)\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Taxes and Assessments\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     ($66,904)\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Total Deductions\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     ($1,335,262)\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n   <tr>\n    <td>\n     Funds available to be returned to MRAB\n    </td>\n    <td>\n     $103,828\n    </td>\n   </tr>\n  </table>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. The figure in the last row of the table reflects that MRAB paid $103,828 into the plan that was not needed to cover any claims or plan costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Remand Order ultimately ordered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1.

Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Disposition of Application and Remand to the parties, AUCRA will pay MRAB the award owed from the first RPA period of $79,167, plus 5% interest from January 10, 2018. If not paid when due, the interest rate will become 10% simple interest per annum, until paid;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3. At the time of this award, AUCRA held $103,828 in additional funds above and beyond the two claim reserves. Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Disposition of Application and Remand to the parties, AUCRA will pay MRAB $103,828. If AUCRA chooses to delay the payment of this amount, for additional collateral reasons, this amount will accrue at 10% simple interest from such date, until paid;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   4. MRAB is not excused from fulfilling its contract if the second period of the RPA develops beyond the amounts currently reserved by AUCRA. AUCRA will have the right to reduce the amount due to be returned to MRAB by any additional paid losses above and beyond the amounts that currently exist (approximately $179,585).

Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Disposition of Application and Remand to the parties, AUCRA will return any capital deposits not returned or contained within the amounts stated in item #2 and #3 above. This amount (if any) will accrue at 10% simple interest from such date, until paid;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   6. Article 11(L) of the RPA allows for the awarding of attorney fees, the cost of the arbitration and arbitration fees. Within thirty (30) days from the date of transmittal of this Disposition of Application and Remand to the parties, AUCRA will reimburse MRAB for attorney fees and expenses spent since March 19, 2018 pursuing its recovery, which are specifically associated with this application;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   7. The administrative fees of the ICDR were waived and the compensation of the arbitrator totaling US$3,825.00 shall be borne by AUCRA. Therefore, AUCRA shall reimburse MRAB the sum of US$1,912.50, representing that portion of said compensation in excess of the apportioned costs previously incurred by MRAB.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   AUCRA filed a motion to correct what it perceived as erroneous calculations underlying the Remand Order pursuant to the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (\"ICDR\") Procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICDR Art. 33.1 (\"Within 30 days after the receipt of an award, any party, with notice to the other party, may request the arbitral tribunal\n   to interpret the award or correct any clerical, typographical, or computational errors....\"); Docket No. 68-1, Exh. 46.

According to AUCRA, had the arbitrator signaled that he was concerned about the enforceability of the LDFs, AUCRA would have submitted pertinent materials addressing \"whether this interpretation is reasonable in light of the contract language as a whole and the circumstances of the case,\" \"extrinsic evidence that could bear on interpretation of the RPA,\" \"the parties' course of dealing and course of performance,\" and \"trade usages in the industry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010\">\n    at 13-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Arbitrators enjoy \"wide discretion to require the exchange of evidence, and to admit or exclude evidence, how and when they see fit,\" so long as they give \"each of the parties to the dispute an 'adequate opportunity to present its evidence and arguments.' \"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Life Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507965\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1167/#p1173\">\n    591 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sunshine Mining Co. v.

The arbitrator acted within his discretion in admitting evidence relevant to the proceedings on remand, and at no point did he exclude any evidence. To begin with, in the extensive proceedings leading up to the Final Award, the parties had already engaged in written discovery, agreed to submit written briefs in lieu of conducting an in-person hearing, and submitted evidence in response to specific requests by the arbitrator. Pl. Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.

In response, counsel for AUCRA stated that \"[t]he Weekly LDFs listed in the RPA stay the same after 36 months.

Mike Rose also has received Plan Analyses for multiple years showing LDFs being applied to claims older than 36 months. In addition, the RPA expressly states that the LDFs will be applied to all claims, and that the LDFs are subject to change without notice....

First, he did not apply any LDFs to claims older than 36 months even though the \"RPA states that [LDFs] would be applied to all claims, and that the LDFs are subject to change without notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.

The arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Applying LDFs to Claims Older Than 36 Months\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is apparent from the Remand Order that the arbitrator determined that LDFs cannot be applied past 36 months by interpreting and applying the terms of the RPA, not by disregarding them. As discussed in the previous section, the arbitrator noted that \"Schedule 1, Table A [of the second RPA] shows LDF factors through Claim Age 36 months,\" but ended at 36 months. Docket No. 68-1, Exh. 25. He therefore asked the parties, \"What determines factors used by Applied for Claim Age months greater than 36 months?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   AUCRA responded that the same LDFs applied between 34 to 36 months continue to apply after 36 months, and submitted records showing that this was how AUCRA had been applying the LDFs to MRAB's claims.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Exhs. 26, 30. MRAB disputed this characterization, and echoed the arbitrator's observation that the RPA \"is silent with respect to month 37 and thereafter,\" and alleged that \"AUCRA is attempting to enforce an obligation not set forth in the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The arbitrator ultimately concluded that \"the LDFs in Schedule 1 of the RPA do not apply past 36 months.\" Remand Order at 2. It is clear that his conclusion turned on the express terms of the RPA-that, on the face of Schedule 1, the LDFs do not extend past 36 months. AUCRA complains the arbitrator did not explicitly address its arguments about the parties' course of dealing in the Remand Order, but an arbitrator's award \"may be made without explanation of the reasons and without a complete record of [the] proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Biller v.

That provision merely states that AUCRA \"will calculate loss development factors ('LDF's') for each loss under the Policies.\" Docket No. 62-1, Exh. G, Sched. 1 \u00b6 1(b). It does not specify that LDFs will be applied to each claim indefinitely. It makes the commonsense point AUCRA will calculate LDFs for each claim, which it undisputedly does for claims between 0 and 36 months. AUCRA also points out that the same provision cautions that \"LDF's are subject to change without notice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719211\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/655/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the arbitrator observed that the RPA specifically provides that \"any\n   <em>\n    Schedules\n   </em>\n   hereto may not be modified, amended or supplemented in any manner except in writing signed by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719211\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/655/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4 (emphasis added). Thus, to extend the LDF schedule past 36 months (as opposed to merely changing the LDF rates), a written amendment would have been required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Order at 2. Because \"[n]o such amendment has been produced in this matter,\" the arbitrator concluded that AUCRA cannot simply apply LDFs to claims older than 36 months without notice to MRAB.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3719211\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/668/655/#p666\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In short, the arbitrator did not disregard express terms of the RPA, but rather disagreed with AUCRA's interpretation of them. This case is thus different from\n   <em>\n    Aspic Engineering\n   </em>\n   on which AUCRA heavily relies. There, the Ninth Circuit held that an arbitrator had exceeded his authority and issued an \"irrational\" award because he \"disregarded specific provisions of the plain text [of the contracts at issue] in an effort to prevent what the Arbitrator deemed an unfair result.\"\n   <em>\n    Aspic Eng'g\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519742\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1162/#p1166\">\n    913 F.3d at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The arbitrator in\n   <em>\n    Aspic Engineering\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that an express contractual provision obligated the plaintiff to comply with certain federal regulations, but refused to give effect to the provisions because he considered it \"unjust\" to enforce the regulations against \"a seemingly less sophisticated contractor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519742\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1162/#p1166\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, the arbitrator here did not displace express terms of the RPA with his own notions of fairness. His decision drew its essence from the RPA, as \u00a7 10(a)(4) requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Calculating Charges Without LDFs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   AUCRA next argues that the arbitrator disregarded terms of the RPA in calculating two other charges MRAB owed to AUCRA under the second RPA-the \"capital deposit,\" and the \"base fee.\" Per the RPA, the capital deposit is 10% of the \"Estimated Annual Loss Pick Containment\n   Amount.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Docket No. 62-1, Exh. G, Sched. 1 \u00b6 3. The base fee is \"equal to the premium earned under the Policies in excess of the Loss Pick Containment Amount multiplied by the applicable Exposure Group Adjustment Factor multiplied by the Allocation Factor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. There is no dispute that MRAB was required to pay AUCRA a capital deposit and base fee. However, AUCRA contends that in the Remand Order, the arbitrator: (1) neglected to include the capital deposit at all, and (2) failed to account for the fact that eliminating LDFs for claims older than 36 months affects the calculation for the base fee. After the Remand Order issued, AUCRA moved the arbitrator to correct these \"computational errors.\" Docket No. 68-1, Exh. 46 at 6. The arbitrator denied the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 53. AUCRA now argues that these computational errors reflect that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in issuing the Remand Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The capital deposit issue is fairly straightforward. Per AUCRA's uncontroverted calculation, the capital deposit for the second RPA should be $44,429 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 10% of the Loss Pick Containment Amount of $444,287). Def. Mot. at 9. The breakdown of charges in the Remand Order for the second RPA does not contain an individual line item for the capital deposit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Order at 3. However, as MRAB noted, the breakdown\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   include an item denoted \"Taxes and Assessments\" for an amount of $66,904.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After AUCRA moved the arbitrator to recalculate the charges, MRAB pointed out that \"Taxes and Assessments\" appeared to subsume the capital deposit, as no other charge could account for that item. Docket No. 68-1, Exh. 50 at 3. MRAB made a request to the arbitrator that \"the Disposition be modified to delete the 'Taxes and Assessments' amount and to include the capital deposit\" if in fact that item did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include the capital deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator did not modify the Remand Order, suggesting that MRAB's understanding that the capital deposit was already included within the \"Taxes and Assessments\" amount was correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The base fee issue is more complicated. In the Remand Order, the arbitrator did not apply LDFs in calculating the collateral owed by MRAB under the second RPA because the two remaining active claims were both older than 36 months. However, the arbitrator did not then adjust the base fee. AUCRA sets forth at length why it believes this was error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mot. at 9-11. Summarized briefly, AUCRA contends the base fee is calculated in part by reference to the Exposure Group Adjustment Factor, which in turn depends on the \"loss ratio,\" which depends on the \"ultimate loss,\" which depends on the LDFs. Thus, the arbitrator's decision not to apply the LDFs to the outstanding claims has a trickle-down effect on the other components of the base fee calculation and ultimately corresponds to a higher base fee ($499,442 instead of $438,853).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   AUCRA presented the same calculations to the arbitrator, who declined to modify the Remand Order to conform to them. Although the arbitrator did not explain why he did not adopt AUCRA's accounting, he could well have concluded that it would be inappropriate to retroactively adjust the base fee for a contract that had already ended. MRAB told the arbitrator that AUCRA's recalculation of the base fee\n   is effectively \"a new claim for a new amount of additional administrative fees requested approximately 40 months after the end of the coverage period.\" Docket No. 68-1, Exh. 50 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In any event, the arbitrator's decision is a matter of contract interpretation, because the calculation of the base fee turns on the interpretation of Schedule 1 of the RPA. \"If on its face, the [arbitration] award presents a plausible interpretation of the contract, judicial inquiry ceases and the award must be enforced.\"\n   <em>\n    Sovak v.

Article 34 of the ICDR Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award(s)\" and \"may allocate such costs among the parties,\" including \"the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties.\" In the Remand Order, the arbitrator ordered AUCRA to \"reimburse MRAB for attorney fees and expenses spent since March 19, 2018 ... specifically associated with this application.\" Remand Order at 4. Because the arbitrator did not specify a dollar amount for the fee award, AUCRA argues that he \"did not fix the amount\" as required by Article 34. Def.

G \u00a7 13(L).

The arbitration clause in the RPA confers broad discretion on the arbitrator to award fees. The arbitrator did not exceed his authority in exercising\n   his discretion to award attorneys' fees to MRAB. Moreover, the ICDR Rules do not define what it means to \"fix the costs of arbitration.\" AUCRA cites no authority in support of its contention that an arbitrator's failure to specify the exact dollar amount of the fees violates Article 34 of the ICDR Rules or provides a basis for vacatur of an award under the FAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court thus concludes that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in issuing the fee award. However, the arbitrator retains authority to resolve any disagreement between the parties about the fee amount requested by MRAB.
