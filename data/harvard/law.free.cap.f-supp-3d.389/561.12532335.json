JORGE L. ALONSO, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff, the United States of America, brings this action against surviving family members of Que Te Park to collect a financial penalty assessed against him for failing to report his foreign bank accounts. His children, defendants Charles C. Park, James Park, and Nina Park, have moved\n   to dismiss the claims against them. Additionally, James Park has moved to quash service of process on behalf of his mother, Jung Joo Park. For the following reasons, the motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are taken from the government's Third Amended Complaint and are assumed true at this early stage of the proceedings. Que Te Park (\"Mr. Park\") was a businessman who lived in Inverness, Illinois. Through his business entities, QT, Inc., and Q-Ray Company, Mr. Park sold \"Q-Ray\" bracelets. A Q-Ray bracelet was an ionized piece of jewelry that purported to relieve pain and arthritis by affecting the wearer's \"chi.\" Mr. Park's businesses sold Q-Ray bracelets via television infomercials, websites, and trade shows, generating net sales figures of approximately $87 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Park's wife, Jung Joo Park (\"Mrs. Park\") served as Secretary of QT, Inc. and Q-Ray Company. Their son Charles was an officer, shareholder, and director of QT, Inc., as well as a shareholder of Ion Ray Co., Ltd., a corporation that distributed Q-Ray bracelets. The Parks' son James was a full-time employee of QT, Inc., and served as a director, and he was also a shareholder of Ion Ray Co., Ltd. The Parks' daughter Nina was a shareholder of Ion Ray Co., Ltd., and Ion Ray, Inc., another corporation that marketed and sold Q-Ray bracelets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2003, the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") filed suit against Mr. Park, his business entities, and Mrs. Park for false and misleading advertising of the Q-Ray bracelets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.,\n   <em>\n    FTC v. Que Te Park et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=03%20Cow.%203578\">\n    03 C 3578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2022331260\">\n    2003 WL 22331260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. May 27, 2003), ECF No. 1. Following a bench trial, the court entered final judgment against Mr. Park and the business entities, granting relief that included disgorging approximately $16 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FTC v. QT, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070850\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/858/#p860\">\n    512 F.3d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (7th Cir. 2008). Mr. Park allegedly returned to consumers only $11.8 million of the $16 million due to them, and the FTC moved for the appointment of a receiver to conduct an accounting, prevent dissipation of assets, recover fraudulently transferred assets, and repatriate foreign assets to satisfy the FTC's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Park filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in February 2007, just two days after the FTC filed its motion for appointment of a receiver. On May 3, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the trustee's appointment of an examiner to investigate Mr. Park's affairs and determine whether he had concealed assets. The bankruptcy court ordered Mr. Park to surrender his property and sit for an examination, but sometime in late 2007 or early 2008, Mr. Park fled the country. The trustee filed an adversary proceeding to contest the discharge of Mr. Park's debts, alleging that he had concealed assets to defraud creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 30, 2008, the United States Department of Justice sought an order from a federal court in Miami to authorize the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to use a John Doe summons to request information from Swiss bank UBS AG about United States taxpayers who may be using Swiss bank accounts to evade federal income taxes. Following service of the summons on July 21, 2008, the government received banking information for accounts of which Mr. and Mrs. Park were beneficial owners. Their tax returns did not reflect their interest in these Swiss bank accounts. The government alleges that Swiss banks' compliance with its attempts to obtain information from them was receiving publicity in 2008 and thereafter, which drove taxpayers such as Mr. Park to\n   disclose foreign bank accounts they had not previously disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 10, 2010, Mr. Park filed amended tax forms for the years 2007 and 2008. Mr. Park had timely filed a 2007 Report of Foreign Bank Accounts (\"FBAR\") form, but he had only disclosed three foreign bank accounts on that form, and his 2007 Form 1040 reported interest income of only $9,900 from an HSBC bank account in China. In 2010, his amended form 1040X for 2007 showed additional income from foreign bank accounts totaling nearly $240,000. For 2008, Mr. Park had not timely filed any FBAR form, but in 2010, he filed a delinquent 2008 FBAR form, which disclosed not three but ten foreign bank accounts-the UBS account, four other Swiss bank accounts, two Chinese accounts, and three Korean accounts-containing more than $7 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between 2008 and his death in 2012, Mr. Park made numerous transfers to Nina. From June 7, 2010, to May 4, 2012, he transferred $43,017 to Nina through her Chase bank account. In June 2008, through Mrs. Park, he provided Nina and Mrs. Park $280,000 to purchase a condominium at 2101 West Rice Street in Chicago, titled in the name of Nina and Mrs. Park. In 2009, Mrs. Park transferred her interest in the condo to Nina, making her the sole title holder, and Nina has earned rental income from the condo ever since.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2011, the IRS initiated an audit of Mr. Park's tax accounts. During the audit, the government learned that Mr. Park died in July 2012. Under the terms of a will executed and notarized in Illinois, his assets were to be placed into a revocable trust, which became irrevocable upon Mr. Park's death. The beneficiaries were the four defendants in this case. Mrs. Park was the Successor Trustee to Mr. Park; if she was unable to act as trustee, then Charles, James, and Nina (\"the Park children\") were Successor Co-Trustees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Park owned substantial property in South Korea. After Mr. Park's death, despite the existence of the Illinois will and without probating it, Mrs. Park and Charles arranged with South Korean probate attorneys between November 2012 and January 2013 to oversee a sale of the South Korean property and a distribution of the proceeds of over $3.6 million to the Park children and Mrs. Park. Each of the Park children received $400,000 from the sale of the South Korean property. Mrs. Park received $2,300,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 21, 2014, the IRS assessed a penalty against Mr. Park of $3,509,429.50, fifty percent of the value of his foreign bank accounts, for his willful failure to file a timely FBAR form for 2008. The penalty remains unpaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government's complaint consists of six counts: Count I, against Charles and Mrs. Park, as representatives of Mr. Park's estate, to reduce the 2008 FBAR civil penalty to judgment; Count II, against Mrs. Park, for fiduciary liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203713\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Count III, for fiduciary liability of Charles Park under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203713\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Count IV, to set aside fraudulent transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203304\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Count V, to set aside fraudulent transfers under the Illinois Fraudulent Conveyances Act; and Count VI, for federal common law restitution/unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mrs. Park now resides in South Korea, and the government has not served her there. The government attempted to serve her at James's home in Georgia. James moves to quash service. The Park children move to dismiss the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) tests whether the complaint states a claim on\n   which relief may be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

The government need only allege sufficient facts to make plausible the conclusion that the government assessed a valid penalty, and it does so by making detailed allegations of the underlying conduct for which the penalty was assessed. The government need not, for example, attach documentation of the assessment to its complaint; that sort of evidence need only be introduced at later stages of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartholet v.

But the government points out that the\n   <em>\n    Pomerantz\n   </em>\n   court later held in a subsequent decision that the government's amended complaint contained sufficient allegations of a willful FBAR violation because the penalized party had properly filed FBAR forms in prior years, so he clearly knew of the requirement and how to satisfy it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   In its amended complaint, the Government alleges that Mr. Pomerantz filed timely FBAR Forms, reporting his interest in the CIBC accounts for the years 2001-2002, and again in 2005. This allegation is sufficient to demonstrate that Mr. Pomerantz understood the reporting requirements regarding the CIBC accounts long before 2007, the first year that the Government alleges Mr. Pomerantz willfully failed to report his income in these accounts. The Government's other allegations-that Mr. Pomerantz signed tax returns in the years 2007 through 2009, and reported income from the CIBC accounts when that income was less significant, but failed to report higher maximum account balances-support the inference that Mr. Pomerantz acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful. The Government's\n   amended complaint therefore pleads sufficient factual content to allow the Court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant willfully failed to file FBAR Forms for the CIBC Accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wash. Oct. 5, 2017) (internal citations omitted). This case is similar. Mr. Park filed a timely FBAR form for the year 2007, but he only disclosed three foreign accounts on it, and on his original, timely-filed 2007 tax return, he reported interest income of less than $10,000 from a HSBC account in China. In 2008, he did not file a timely FBAR form, and in his timely-filed tax return he reported a similar amount of income from the Chinese HSBC account. In the amended tax forms he filed in 2010, he reported\n   <em>\n    ten\n   </em>\n   foreign bank accounts in 2008, as well as 2008 interest income several times what he had initially reported. A reasonable factfinder could conclude from these facts, as in the second\n   <em>\n    Pomerantz\n   </em>\n   decision, that Mr. Park knew of the FBAR filing requirement (after all, he filed an FBAR form in 2007) and willfully failed to file one in 2008 to prevent the government from learning of foreign assets and income. Also supporting the inference are the facts that plaintiff was experiencing financial difficulties due to the judgment against him, which caused him to declare bankruptcy and flee the country. These facts might signal to a reasonable factfinder that plaintiff did not file an FBAR form in 2008 because he was trying to preserve as much of his assets and income as he could, rather than exhaust them by paying debts to the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Charles's arguments are without merit because he overstates the government's pleading burden and because, based on the allegations the government has made, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that he willfully failed to file a FBAR form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The government alleges not only that Charles knew of the FTC lawsuit, the bankruptcy, and his father's flight to South Korea, but also that he knew of efforts Mr. Park had made to put assets such as the family home beyond the reach of creditors and that he held assets in foreign bank accounts and other valuable foreign property.

Even if the complaint is ambiguous, the Court is bound to resolve the ambiguity by construing the allegations so as to permit reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, so long as the allegations give rise to a reasonable expectation that discovery will yield evidence supporting them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Olson v.
