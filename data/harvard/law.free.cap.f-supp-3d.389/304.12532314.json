Viewed in the light most favorable to Goodwin, a reasonable jury could return a verdict in her favor on Counts 1 and 3. Goodwin, however, has failed to show how she was injured by the customs and policies she identified in Counts 2 and 4. Summary judgment is granted on both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts in the Light Most Favorable to Goodwin\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December 2014, Goodwin was a sophomore at Pennridge High School (\"PHS\"). PSOF \u00b6 2. H. and his friends N., B., and C. were all juniors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Goodwin claims she was raped by H. over Christmas break of her sophomore year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def. Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   PHS was administratively structured so that Goodwin's assistant principal was Scott Hegen, while the assistant principal for H., N., B., and C. was David Laboski.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. Principal DeBona had delegated responsibility for investigating disciplinary issues and imposing discipline to Hegen and Laboski.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Although Hegen could participate in an investigation of an incident reported to him by Goodwin about H., N., B., or C., Laboski had responsibility for interviewing and ultimately imposing any discipline on H., N., B., or C. Laboski Dep. at 51-53. Guidance counselors sometimes interviewed students in disciplinary investigations, but never disciplined students. Henrysen Dep. at 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When Goodwin returned to school after Christmas break, H. and his friends N., B., and C. spread rumors that she had voluntarily slept with multiple boys on the night of the alleged rape. Goodwin Dep. at 65. In response to the trauma of the attack and the repeated traumas of being called a \"slut,\" Goodwin became depressed, anxious, and began cutting herself. Axe Dep. at 49. Goodwin began therapy and told her therapist about the rape on February 10, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 259, 268. He immediately reported the rape to child services and directed\n   Goodwin to disclose it to her mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although the rape was reported to authorities, an investigation was not immediately undertaken. Goodwin Dep. at 50. On March 13, 2015, Goodwin reported the rape to Peter Cortazzo, her guidance counselor. PSOF \u00b6 10. He immediately reported the rape to his supervisor, Hegen, who verified that Goodwin had reported the rape to police before meeting with her. Def. Ex. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Even after Hegen verified Goodwin's police report, and after Goodwin explained the trauma and the ongoing harassment to Cortazzo, PSD made no safety accommodations for at least two weeks. On March 31, 2015, Goodwin's mother requested that Cortazzo \"make teachers aware\" of Goodwin's \"situation,\" prompting Cortazzo to email Goodwin's teachers and ask them to allow Goodwin to leave class without explanation if she experienced anxiety. Def. Ex. 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   H. avoided a police interview for several weeks, during which time Goodwin's anxiety increased. Def. Ex. 5. On April 6, 2015, H. spoke with police and gave his version of events, which largely comported with Goodwin's account. Def. Ex. 5. H. agreed that Goodwin repeatedly said no and tried to stop the sexual activity, and that he physically moved her head to resume the activities she had declined.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Their stories diverged in that H. said he observed no bleeding or bruising and insisted the sexual activity was consensual, despite Goodwin's attempt to stop it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   H. later told Laboski he had not raped Goodwin. Laboski Dep. at 134. Laboski accepted this answer and did not discipline H.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 132-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PSD's only other accommodation for Goodwin was to allow her extra time between her third and fourth period classes to avoid seeing H. in the hallways, Def. Ex. 31. On April 21, 2015, Goodwin was in tears in the guidance office, Def. Ex. 30, after reporting to Cortazzo that H. had been boasting about sexually assaulting girls, and that she could \"feel\" his presence at school,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 20, 2015, Goodwin confronted B. in the lunch room, demanding that he stop spreading rumors that she was a \"slut\" and had \"snitched\" on him and his friends. Goodwin Dep. at 85; Def. Ex. 41. Later, in a text to his girlfriend, B. threatened to \"jump\" Goodwin so she would \"learn her place.\" Def. Ex. 40. B.'s girlfriend forwarded the text to Goodwin,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , who told Hegen, Def. Ex. 46. Laboski suspended B. from school for three days, and reported the threat to police. Def. Exs. 46, 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 27, 2015, B.'s first day back in school after his out-of-school suspension, Goodwin had a panic attack and left school. Def. Ex. 30. On June 1, 2015, Goodwin's mother informed PHS that mental health issues precluded Goodwin from returning to school, and asked that Goodwin be allowed to complete schoolwork for the year at home and take her finals. Def. Ex. 34. Hegen rejected the request. He claimed that Goodwin's absence would require a doctor's note and said she would need alternative, homebound instruction and would not be permitted to continue her classwork from home. Def. Ex. 35. Goodwin's mother obtained a note from Goodwin's nurse practitioner, and Goodwin's attendance was excused on June 5, 2015. Def. Ex. 37. Hegen then began assisting Goodwin in obtaining schoolwork from her teachers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In July 2015, Goodwin received a text from N., who was with B. and C., accusing Goodwin of snitching on them. Goodwin Dep. at 102-03. N. called Goodwin \"redickulous,\" and noted he had chosen this spelling because she was a \"hoe\" and a\n   \"cunt.\" Def. Ex. 49. Goodwin's mother reported the threat to police. Goodwin Dep. at 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 18, 2015, Goodwin's mother emailed Hegen and asked for the name of PSD's Title IX coordinator. Def. Ex. 52. She explained Goodwin had been receiving \"threats\" and \"bullying text messages,\" and requested that H., N., B., and C. not be put in Goodwin's lunch or gym classes. Def. Ex. 52. Hegen was unable to identify the Title IX coordinator without further research. Def. Ex. 53. Moreover, he suggested to DeBona that Title IX protection may not apply to Goodwin because criminal charges had not been filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 24, 2015, Goodwin's mother informed Title IX coordinator Jacqui McHale about Goodwin's harassment by H., N., B., and C., including that the boys had spread rumors about Goodwin's sexual history in January and February 2015. Def. Ex. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 31, 2015, the first day of Goodwin's junior year, she shared a lunch period with N., B., and C. PSOF \u00b6 38. Hegen erroneously advised McHale, DeBona, and district administrator Troy Price that Goodwin's mother \"did not provide [him] with the names\" of the boys. Def. Ex. 54. That day, Goodwin, DeBona, and Hegen met and called Goodwin's mother to outline three options for accommodating Goodwin during the lunch period: (1) change her lunch period; (2) eat elsewhere; or (3) remain in the lunch period with N., B., and C., and supervising personnel would monitor the situation. Def. Ex. 50. Goodwin and her mother were dissatisfied with the options, Pl. Ex. 37, and arranged to meet with McHale on September 2, 2015, Def. Ex. 55. Before the meeting, Goodwin's mother sent McHale a powerpoint presentation outlining Title IX's requirements and a timeline of events that included the sexual rumors the boys had been spreading about Goodwin in January/February 2015. Pl. Ex. 17; Def. Ex. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the September 2, 2015 meeting, Goodwin informed DeBona, Hegen, Henrysen, and Price that she was encountering H. in the hallways \"three times a week.\" Pl. Ex. 42. She was offered only the same three accommodation options. Def. Ex. 58. Administrators explained that lunch was \"usually excluded as a separation area.\" Def. Ex. 57. Goodwin was assured, however, that N., B., and C. were on \"zero tolerance,\" Pl. Ex. 42, that H.'s counselor had been made aware of her return to school, and had directed H. to \"stay away\" from Goodwin, Pl. Ex. 46. Goodwin reported she spent most lunch periods by herself in the library or other areas because she was intimidated by her harassers. Goodwin Dep. at 152. Goodwin's mother requested that she and Goodwin be informed in advance if Goodwin was going to encounter the boys. Def. Exs. 42, 46, 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Six days later, on September 8, 2015, Goodwin found she was scheduled for a study hall in the cafeteria with H. PSOF \u00b6 40. Her mother immediately emailed the administrative team. Def. Ex. 60. Goodwin's guidance counselor, Henrysen, explained that Goodwin and H. had been placed in different study hall sections, with different teachers, but unfortunately, both sections had been located into the cafeteria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He pledged a resolution of the scheduling issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The following day, Goodwin was in study hall with B. PSOF \u00b6 40. Goodwin's mother again emailed the administrative team, and Price responded that they were working on moving the boys' study halls out of the cafeteria. Def. Ex. 62. He instructed someone from the administrative team to respond to Goodwin's mother when the schedule had been sorted out. Def. Ex. 61. No one contacted Goodwin or her mother.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   When Goodwin's mother emailed a week later, Hegen said the school had moved the boys' study hall sections from the cafeteria. Def. Ex. 63. Hegen told Goodwin, however, that the boys were not moved to accommodate her concerns, but for an unrelated reason. Goodwin Dep. at 146. He did not explain until later that H. and B. would maintain access to the cafeteria, where Goodwin's class was located, because they had a \"right to ... get breakfast.\" PSOF \u00b6 42. Price instructed Goodwin and her mother to contact DeBona directly with any further Title IX accommodation issues. Goodwin Dep. at 214. On September 17, 2015, following these unexpected encounters with H. and his friends, Goodwin's PTSD was rated \"severe\" by her medical providers. Pl. Ex. 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 15, 2015, Goodwin reported to the auditorium for a mandatory assembly. Hegen Dep. at 250-52. H. also attended. DeBona Dep. at 295. When Goodwin saw H., Hegen Dep. at 250-52, she immediately went to the administrative offices, Def. Ex. 77, where Hegen and DeBona informed her that nothing could be done to accommodate her,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Henrysen attended the assembly with her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The next day, Goodwin's mother complained about H.'s unexpected presence at the assembly and the administrators' lack of sensitivity to Goodwin's fears. Def. Ex. 78. A week later, Goodwin's mother again complained that Hegen was insensitive to female students in general, and cited an incident Goodwin had heard about from other students in which Hegen rewarded H. with a \"high five\" after he pushed another girl off a chair during a game of \"musical chairs.\" Def. Ex. 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 19, 2015, H. and Goodwin passed on a staircase. Def. Ex. 79. Goodwin said to her friend, \"speak of the devil,\" and H. told his friends that Goodwin was a \"f*cking b*tch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goodwin reported this incident in writing to Henrysen and Hegen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   H. was not asked to submit a written report, and no other witnesses' accounts were solicited. Laboski Dep. at 160. When interviewed by Laboski, H. admitted using foul language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the PHS Handbook permitted discipline, Pl. Ex. 15, H. received none, Laboski Dep. at 160. When Henrysen noted that Goodwin's mother was likely to follow up on the incident, DeBona commented that Goodwin's mother was \"not privy to the outcome. She only needs to know it's handled.\" Def. Ex. 80. Laboski assured H. that the interaction was not H.'s fault, and counseled him to stay away from Goodwin for his own good. H. Dep. at 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 4, 2016, Goodwin informed Henrysen that she had received a text from C. near the anniversary of the alleged rape, asking her to \"hang out.\" Def. Ex. 82. Hegen did not recommend moving C. out of the lunch period he shared with Goodwin because there had been no \"face to face issue.\" Def. Ex. 81. Laboski spoke with C., C.'s parents, and C.'s probation officer, and instructed C. to delete Goodwin's contact information from his phone. Def. Ex. 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Goodwin continued to endure daily \"very obvious teasing, pointing, [and] laughing\" by H., N., B., and C. Goodwin Dep. at 122. On April 5, 2016, C.'s and Goodwin's shoulders bumped in the hallway. Def. Ex. 86. Goodwin completed an incident report and told Henrysen that C. had intentionally bumped into her, explaining that C. had been moving closer and closer to her over several weeks as they passed each other in the hallway. Goodwin Dep. at 113-15. Although Henrysen watched video of the event with Goodwin, the camera did not \"capture the exchange.\" Def. Ex. 88. Laboski met with C. and emailed C.'s parole officer. Def. Ex. 88. Another staff member was assigned to monitor the hallway for a\n   week, and Henrysen also monitored it the following day. Def. Ex. 89. McHale questioned why Hegen, rather than DeBona, was managing the incident. Def. Ex. 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DeBona denied Goodwin's request to be present when an administrator instructed C. to stay away from her. Def. Ex. 90. Instead, Henrysen and Price set up a voluntary student \"mediation\" with both Goodwin and C. on April 10, 2016,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , during which DeBona instructed them to stay away from each other, and complained that Goodwin had wasted all of their time. Goodwin Dep. at 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The next day, Goodwin's mother informed PSD that she was removing Goodwin from PHS. Def. Ex. 90. PSD offered no alternative options to accommodate Goodwin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeBona suggested \"private schools, cyber schools, and home-school options,\" but noted that \"if you choose to attend a public school, you will need to reside in [the school's] boundaries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Goodwin's mother warned that PSD might be legally obligated to send Goodwin to another public school district, Goodwin was offered an opportunity to be the first student in a pilot cyber program at PHS. Def. Exs. 91-92. This allowed Goodwin to technically remain a PHS student, but complete the fourth quarter of her junior year outside the building.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 20, 2016, DeBona barred Goodwin from the building when she returned to empty her locker. Def. Ex. 93. Henrysen later explained that although Goodwin technically was a PHS student in the pilot cyber program, she could not enter the building without an appointment during the school day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 27, 2016, Goodwin and her mother met with Henrysen and another PSD staff member to set up the pilot cyber program for Goodwin. Def. Ex. 94. Goodwin was unable to continue taking French III, Physical Education, and Broadcast Journalism in the cyber program, and was also unable to continue serving on student council. PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 70-71. Goodwin participated in the pilot cyber program during the fourth quarter, but ran into a conflict with PSD when she was required to take a state examination in Algebra. The day of the exam, Goodwin's mother emailed PHS that Goodwin had only received notice of the examination the day before, and could not attend. Def. Ex. 98. Henrysen admitted he had failed to follow up with Goodwin about the exam, and suggested that Goodwin take the examination on the make-up dates in the guidance office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeBona did not, however, provide Henrysen's option to Goodwin's mother, who decided to have Goodwin \"opt out\" of the state examination. Def. Ex. 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Goodwin returned to PHS her senior year, after H., N., B., and C. had graduated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. During the first six weeks of school, both H. and B. entered the building when Goodwin was not there. Def. Ex. 103. H. had been authorized to enter by Laboski, who was aware that Goodwin had returned to PHS. Laboski Dep. at 198. H. even visited Goodwin's classroom that day, although she was absent that morning. PSOF \u00b6 73. B. was permitted to enter as part of a military recruitment event, although PHS was not notified of his presence in advance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 13, 2016, Goodwin's mother asked that Goodwin be notified before H., N., B., or C. was permitted to enter the building. Def. Ex. 103. After she was informed of these visits, DeBona emailed Goodwin's mother and assured her that H. would no longer be permitted in the building during school days and Goodwin would be notified before any future military recruitment events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In May 2017, Goodwin learned that a classmate had invited B. to attend their senior prom. Def. Ex. 104. When Goodwin\n   informed Hegen, he assured her B. would not be permitted to attend. Goodwin Dep. at 224. Before any non-student attends the PHS prom, they must fill out paperwork identifying their home school, principal, age, etc. Hegen Dep. at 353. Guests over age 21 and students with extensive disciplinary records are not permitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 355. Once B.'s paperwork was officially submitted, DeBona permitted B. to attend part of the prom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 224-25. Goodwin was given the option of staying throughout, and a staff member would be assigned to provide emotional support for her and ensure her safety, but B. and his date would be permitted to attend after 8:30 p.m. Def. Ex. 104. During a May 18, 2017 meeting, Goodwin warned PSD that this restriction would elicit retribution from B.'s friends.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DeBona stated PSD would only forgo the prom-splitting plan with consent, in writing, from Goodwin's mother.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After the written consent was provided, administrators persisted with the prom-splitting plan, even though they knew B. could only attend the second half of the prom anyway. Def. Ex. 105.

Pl. Mem. at 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Whether the district's response to Goodwin's claims constitutes deliberate indifference is the closest question in a case full of close questions. Although PSD took some steps to address the issue, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Goodwin, a reasonable jury could find in her favor. Even if PSD had no obligation to investigate the off-campus rape, it was required to respond promptly to the ensuing hostile environment. 2001 Guidance at 16. Instead, the school did nothing in response to Goodwin's reported rape, even after she complained she was traumatized by seeing H. and suffered from anxiety following the harassment from H. and his friends. Cortazzo only emailed Goodwin's teachers to allow her to leave class when she was experiencing anxiety on April 1, 2015, after being requested to do so by Goodwin's mother. Def. Exs. 29-30. It took another two weeks before Hegen tried to separate Goodwin from H. in the hallways by emailing her teachers to allow her to leave early and/or arrive late. Def. Ex. 31. Even this accommodation put the onus on Goodwin to miss class time and explain her absence to other students. Department of Education Title IX guidance directs districts to devise accommodations that do \"not penalize the student who was harassed.\" 2010 Dear Colleague Letter at 3. PSD did not investigate or respond to Goodwin's allegations that H. was bragging about sexually assaulting her and potentially others, and it never investigated the source of the sexual rumors about her or tried to stop them during school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Although PSD responded quickly to the May 2015 threatening text from B., it failed to instruct B. to stay away from Goodwin. Def. Ex. 46;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2001 Guidance at 16 (\"it may be appropriate to ... direct[ ] the harasser to have no further contact with the harassed student\"). During the investigation, PSD reviewed a text from Goodwin stating that \"all the 'sluts' and laughs\" and rumors were making Goodwin feel suicidal. Pl. Ex. 24. Nonetheless, its response to B.'s threats did not include measures designed to prevent future rumor-mongering. PSD knew that Goodwin suffered a panic attack on the day B. returned to school following his suspension, Def.

Ex. 52, and requested a meeting on August 24, 2015, Def. Ex. 54, no meeting was scheduled until after the school year had begun on August 31, 2015. By that time, Goodwin had found herself sharing a lunchroom with N., B., and C., despite her mother's requests that she be separated from them during lunch and gym. Pl. Ex. 17. The safety plans PSD offered to address Goodwin's lunchtime fears included changing her lunch period or notifying adult monitors of potential conflicts between Goodwin and the boys, putting the boys on \"zero tolerance,\" Def.

Department of Education guidance, however, specifically instructs that the burden of schedule changes should not fall on victims of harassment. 2010 Dear Colleague Letter at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Goodwin and her mother repeatedly requested prior notice before she would be required to be in the boys' presence.

Henrysen Dep. at 215-16. PSD essentially denied the request for prior notice by never providing it, and ineffectively monitored the boys' schedules. H. and Goodwin were unexpectedly in the same location for study hall, and the following day, Goodwin found she also shared a study hall location with B. Goodwin's mother immediately complained. Despite being instructed by Price to follow-up with her, Hegen failed to do so. Def. Ex. 58. Even assuming relocating the study halls was part of the safety plan, the move granted H. and B ongoing access to the cafeteria, the location of Goodwin's study hall, without any obligation to warn Goodwin. A jury must determine whether the accommodation was part of a safety plan and, if it was, whether the safety plan, which made no provision for prior notice to Goodwin, was \"clearly unreasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The extent to which the scheduling confusion contributed to Goodwin's mental health concerns is also disputed, but a reasonable jury could attribute the increased severity of Goodwin's PTSD to PSD's failure to keep her separated from H., N., B., and C. There are also disputed material facts about the October 2015 assembly. Although PSD cannot be found \"clearly unreasonable\" for failing to foresee that Goodwin and H. might attend a single assembly together, its actions could be considered unreasonable if administrators offered no assistance after she sought help, as Goodwin claims. Def. Ex. 77. Whether Henrysen's actions were an impromptu act of kindness or part of the safety plan organized by the district is a disputed material fact that must be determined by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Whether PSD's responses to the November 2015 hallway incident with H., the December 2015 anniversary text from C., and the April 2016 hallway incident with C. were \"clearly unreasonable\" also merits resolution by a jury. H. used language that clearly violated PHS's behavioral standards, but was not disciplined. Further, DeBona instructed Hegen that Goodwin did not need to be informed of how H. was disciplined. Def. Ex. 80. DeBona's instructions directly conflict with federal Title IX guidance. 2001 Guidance at vii. Since H. was not disciplined and was apparently told that his conflicts with Goodwin were not his fault, a reasonable jury could conclude that Goodwin and her mother were misled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   After the December 2015 incident with C., no change was made to the lunch period safety plan, despite the \"zero tolerance\" that PSD had supposedly imposed. Pl. Ex. 42. Hegen decided not to change C.'s lunch before the incident had been investigated. Def. Exs. 81, 85. A reasonable jury could find Hegen was deliberately indifferent to Goodwin's concerns because even PSD's Title IX coordinator questioned why Hegen was still making decisions about Goodwin's safety plan. Def. Ex. 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Goodwin has produced evidence from which a reasonable jury could find DeBona was deliberately indifferent to her harassment. After the April 2016 hallway incident with C., Goodwin was told she could not be present while an administrator instructed C. to stay away from her, which led to the meeting in which DeBona instructed Goodwin and her harasser to stay away from each other. Goodwin Dep. at 121. Department of Education guidance, in contrast, specifically notes that it may be necessary to instruct a harasser to apologize to a victim. 2001 Guidance at 16. A reasonable jury could further find DeBona deliberately indifferent because she barred\n   Goodwin from school even though she remained a PHS student while a few months later, H. and B. were admitted after they had already graduated. Def. Ex. 93. It could conclude that DeBona was deliberately indifferent when she failed to offer any alternative placements for the final quarter of Goodwin's junior year until Goodwin's mother disclosed that the district might be legally obligated to pay for Goodwin to attend an alternative public school, and when DeBona failed to offer an available accommodation for Goodwin's state exam. Def. Exs. 91-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, a reasonable jury could find DeBona was deliberately indifferent by overruling Hegen's initial conclusion that B. should be excluded from Goodwin's prom, and then insisting on the time-sharing \"accommodation\" even after Goodwin, her mother, and Goodwin's lawyer explained that the proposed accommodation could exacerbate the harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krebs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206820402\">\n    2016 WL 6820402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    C.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202371413\">\n    2013 WL 2371413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vance v.

Ex. 54. Further, after Goodwin and her mother requested McHale's involvement in August 2015, PSD kept McHale involved. To the extent PSD failed to keep McHale informed, Goodwin's mother made up for that failure. PSD's failure to submit any written reports of harassment investigations to McHale could not have harmed Goodwin because the reports would not have provided additional information beyond what administrators and Goodwin herself were providing. Even assuming PSD had unwritten policies of not notifying McHale of all harassment complaints and not submitting written reports of investigations to her, Goodwin cannot show those policies - her first and fourth theories of liability - were the proximate cause of her injuries.

Three years later, the Department reiterated that schools must \"process all complaints of sexual violence, regardless of where the conduct occurred,\" and that \"[t]he mere presence on campus or in an off-campus education program or activity of the alleged perpetrator of off-campus sexual violence can have continuing effects that create a hostile environment.\" Dep't of Educ.
