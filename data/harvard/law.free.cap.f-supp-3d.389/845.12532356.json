In the due process complaint, Plaintiff asserted that the District unnecessarily delayed in bringing its own due process complaint against Plaintiff and his parents; the District's due process complaint had alleged that Plaintiff was seeking an independent vision therapy evaluation, a form of an independent educational evaluation (an \"IEE\") that the District must offer to students at public expense, from an evaluator of Plaintiff's choice who did not meet the District's requirements under its IEE policy. The District ultimately withdrew its due process complaint shortly before a hearing before the ALJ, and following the hearing, the ALJ ruled that the District did not unnecessarily delay in filing its due process complaint against Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 25, 2019, the Court held a pretrial conference to better assess the parties' substantive arguments regarding Plaintiff L.C.'s claim for review of the administrative hearing. Following the pretrial conference, the Court continued the bench trial date and requested supplemental briefing regarding outstanding issues not addressed at the pretrial conference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 50. After the parties submitted their supplemental briefs, the Court vacated\n   the bench trial and took the case under submission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Having carefully reviewed and considered the administrative record, supplemental evidence presented, and the parties' trial briefs, the Court issues the following findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following findings of fact are based on (1) the administrative record for the underlying proceedings before OAH, lodged by Plaintiff on February 14, 2019, see Dkt. 37; (2) the declaration of Tania L. Whiteleather, Dkt. 28-4 (\"Whiteleather Decl.\"), and accompanying Exhibits 1-6, Dkts. 28-5-28-10;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the declaration of Maryam Rastegar, Dkt. 43-3 (\"Rastegar Decl.\"), and attached Exhibits A-F; and (4) the declaration of Jonathan P.

Plaintiff Requests an IEE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the relevant time period at issue in this case, Plaintiff was 11 years old and attended sixth grade at a school within the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Record (\"AR\") 356.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 10, 2017, Plaintiff's advocate, Peter Attwood, emailed the District and represented that Plaintiff had not received a proper assessment for special educational needs over at least the prior two years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 341. Attwood conveyed Plaintiff's interest in having the District agree to assess Plaintiff in all suspected areas of suspected disability, including assessments for neuropsychological issues, auditory processing, motor coordination, and other communication skills.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 341-42. In response, the District sent a letter to Plaintiff's parents on August 17, 2017, attaching a proposed assessment plan for Plaintiff. AR 337-40. Attwood responded to the District's letter by email on August 21, 2017, finding the District's proposed assessment plan \"largely acceptable\" but requesting that Plaintiff receive an IEE for visual processing and other assessment areas not relevant to the instant dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 342-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 31, 2017, the District sent Plaintiff a \"prior written notice\" letter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to address Plaintiff's request for an IEE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 310-11. In the letter, the District agreed to allow Plaintiff to receive an IEE for visual processing, provided that the IEE satisfied the IEE policy (the \"Policy\") for the West End SELPA (the \"SELPA\"), which is the special education local plan area of which the District is a member.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 311. The District attached the Policy to the letter for Plaintiff's review, including the SELPA's list of qualified independent evaluators, along with a revised proposed assessment plan for the District's assessment that omitted the areas of assessment for independent evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 312-13 (the revised assessment plan); AR 314-36 (the Policy and the SELPA's list of independent evaluators).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Policy provides that, if a student's requested IEE exceeds the maximum allowable cost for that form of evaluation as set forth in the Policy, the student's parent must demonstrate \"unique circumstances\" that justify exceeding the cost criteria. AR 321. The cost of the evaluation is considered to include \"observations, administration and scoring of tests, report writing, and attendance ... at the [individualized education plan] team meeting to discuss the findings if invited by the school district.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Policy does not identify a single maximum cost for a visual processing evaluation, instead identifying the following three categories of visual-based assessments: (1) Visual Motor Integration, with a maximum cost of $300; (2) Visual Acuity, with a maximum cost of $350; and (3) Visual Perception, with a maximum cost of $250. AR 323. These cost maximums added up to a cost cap for visual processing evaluations of $900.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 357 (the ALJ finding this amount to be the relevant cost maximum for a visual processing assessment under the Policy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff Selects a Visual Processing Evaluator\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 12, 2017, Plaintiff's mother emailed the District, stating that she selected Dr. Douglas Stephey, who was not on the SELPA's list of independent evaluators, as her preferred independent evaluator for visual processing. AR 252. On September 26, 2017, the District requested that Plaintiff's mother provide a copy of Dr. Stephey's curriculum vitae and rate sheet so that the District can determine whether Dr. Stephey satisfied the IEE criteria in the Policy. AR 255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dr. Stephey emailed the District directly on October 3, 2017, noting that Plaintiff's parents asked him to forward his curriculum vitae and rate sheet to the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 307. Dr. Stephey explained to the District that \"I work collaboratively with about 30 districts and have never had a parent have to track down this information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Stephey attached to his email a rate sheet for Dr. Stephey's vision therapy fees, but the rate sheet did not identify a flat fee for a visual processing evaluation as requested by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 307-09. In the email, Dr. Stephey noted that his visual processing evaluation and attendance at an individualized education program (\"IEP\") meeting for Plaintiff would not exceed a fee of $2,500. AR 307. The ALJ found that, in reviewing Dr. Stephey's rate sheet, the District estimated that Dr. Stephey's visual processing evaluation would cost around $2,400. AR 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On October 13, 2017, the District sent a letter to Plaintiff's parents, informing them that Dr. Stephey \"does not meet the cost maximum\" under the Policy. AR 256. The District requested that Plaintiff's parents provide written justification as to the unique circumstances warranting an assessment above the cost cap in the Policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, in the letter the District did not identify the specific cost cap for visual processing under the Policy, nor did the District represent the rates Dr. Stephey proposed to charge for such an evaluation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 19, 2017, Attwood emailed the District to contest the District's position regarding Dr. Stephey's IEE for visual processing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 258. Attwood requested additional information on what the District interpreted to be the Policy's cost cap for visual processing, as well as what Dr. Stephey represented to the District regarding his charged rates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, the District directed that Attwood contact Royal Lord, the SELPA's program manager, regarding Dr. Stephey's IEE arrangements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Attwood took issue with this response, arguing that the District should not require Plaintiff and his representative\n   to \"chase around for information when you ... have demanded a response from us without providing the needed information ... You could have just responded to my queries, if you wanted to get the job done.\" AR 259. However, Attwood did not attempt to provide any written justification for exceeding the Policy's cost cap, as requested by the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 2, 2017, the District sent another letter to Plaintiff's parents, again requesting written justification for Dr. Stephey's evaluation exceeding the Policy's cost cap. AR 280-81. The District followed up with another letter requesting this information on November 7.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Parties File Due Process Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 15, 2017, Plaintiff's mother emailed the District, stating her intention to cancel an upcoming IEP meeting because Plaintiff had not yet received all of his IEE assessments. AR 278. Plaintiff's mother repeated that the District has not identified how Dr. Stephey does not satisfy the Policy's cost cap, and Plaintiff's mother asserted that the District's continued efforts to seek written justification as to unique circumstances justifying an IEE in excess of the cost cap \"make[s] it clear that you simply do not intend to respond\" to Plaintiff's parents' request for an IEE from Dr. Stephey.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The District responded the same day by offering that the parties attend an alternative dispute resolution meeting to resolve the parties' \"misunderstanding or a difference of opinion on how these matters are to be handled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Attwood responded to the District's email by rejecting the District's proposal for a meeting, asserting that \"[y]ou don't want to approve IEEs by appropriate independent assessors. You won't even tell us specifically what you have in mind by a comprehensive visual processing assessment, and how the assessors on your list perform one, and how Stephey's is too expensive.\" AR 277. Attwood argued that because the District refused to document their specific objections to Dr. Stephey's proposed IEE, the District \"needed long ago to file for a hearing to prove [Dr. Stephey] unqualified,\" and that the District should \"[j]ust file for hearing, although you have already unnecessarily delayed in doing it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The ALJ determined that the District was on Thanksgiving break between November 18 and November 26, 2017, and therefore the District did not imminently respond to Attwood's November 15 email. AR 357.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 30, 2017, Plaintiff's mother emailed the District in response to a letter from the District dated November 17, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 265. The District's letter, which does not appear to be part of the administrative record in this case, purportedly made the same requests as the District's prior letters asking for written justification as to why Dr. Stephey's visual processing IEE should exceed the Policy's cost cap.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's mother again expressed frustration that the District has refused to answer Plaintiff's questions regarding the Policy's cost cap and Dr. Stephey's charges, and Plaintiff's mother suggested that \"[p]erhaps the best thing for the district to do is to file for a hearing to avoid anymore [sic] unnecessary delays.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next day, December 1, the District emailed Plaintiff's mother, stating that \"the District will request a due process hearing regarding your request for Dr. Stephey to conduct a vision therapy IEE\" but invited Plaintiff's mother to select other assessors that meet the Policy's cost criteria or to schedule an alternative dispute resolution meeting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 4, 2017, the District sent Plaintiff's parents\n   another letter, informing them that the District conducted an IEP for Plaintiff without their presence in order to adhere to the District's required timelines for conducting IEPs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 263. The District again asserted that Dr. Stephey's visual processing IEE did not satisfy the Policy's cost criteria and requested written justification for exceeding the cost cap \"as soon as possible.\" AR 264. Neither Plaintiff's parents nor Attwood responded to the District's correspondence from December 1 and December 4 about Dr. Stephey's IEE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Interestingly, Plaintiff and the District were able to resolve a disagreement about the cost of a different IEE Plaintiff requested, regarding neuropsychological issues. The District had represented in the December 1 email that the costs of the neuropsychological IEE to be performed by Plaintiff's selected evaluator, Dr. Robin Morris, exceeded the Policy's cost criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 265. In the December 4 letter, the District changed course and approved Dr. Morris's IEE. AR 263. In email correspondence that same day, the District explained that Lord, the SELPA's program manager, had contacted Dr. Morris directly, and Dr. Morris agreed to adjust her rate sheet to fit within the Policy's cost criteria. AR 267. When Plaintiff's mother asked if such a solution would be possible for Dr. Stephey as well, the District responded that it would \"inquire at our SELPA and if the situation changes, I will contact you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, it is unclear from the record whether the District actually contacted the SELPA about Dr. Stephey, or whether the SELPA reached out to Dr. Stephey as it had done for Dr. Morris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Nevertheless, on December 5, 2017, the District filed a due process complaint against Plaintiff, which was designated OAH Case No. 2017120261.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1-8. In the complaint, the District requested a hearing regarding the issue of whether Plaintiff is entitled to a vision therapy IEE \"by an evaluator of [Plaintiff's] choice who does not meet the requirements of the IEE policy.\" AR 6. In the complaint, the District asserted that the Policy's cost cap for visual perception IEEs was $1,000, and that Dr. Stephey's proposed IEE would cost $1,380 above the cost cap. AR 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ found that Attwood did not know that Dr. Stephey's fee was around $2,400 until reading the District's complaint. AR 358. At the hearing, Attwood opined that such a fee was \"high,\" and Attwood apparently reached out to Dr. Stephey to convince him to lower his fees after the District filed its due process complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On December 19, 2017, Dr. Stephey emailed Lord and attached a revised fee schedule with a single inclusive fee for a visual processing IEE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 274. Dr. Stephey stated that he was told to include time for classroom observations in his initial rate sheet and fee estimate, although he represented that no other districts with which he contracts require classroom observations to be included.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Recognizing that adding classroom observations to his IEE assessment \"would drive up the cost substantially,\" Dr. Stephey removed that item from his revised fee schedule, which \"has reduced the cost substantially.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Dr. Stephey's revised fee schedule stated that his visual processing IEE, which included a vision therapy assessment, written report, review of other records for up to one hour, and participation in one IEP meeting via teleconference for up to one hour, would be conducted \"for a fee not to exceed $1400.00.\" AR 275.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On December 26, 2017, Plaintiff filed his own due process complaint against the District, designated OAH Case No. 2017120979.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 74-78. Plaintiff raised two issues, the first pertaining to whether Plaintiff was denied meaningful assessment\n   prior to August 17, 2017 and the second regarding whether the District unnecessarily delayed in filing its due process complaint about Dr. Stephey's IEE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 77-78.

The District opposed Plaintiff's request for a continuance as untimely, AR 213, and the ALJ ultimately denied Plaintiff's motion, AR 216-17. The hearing proceeded as scheduled on May 2, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 395 (the first page of the transcript for the May 2 hearing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At the hearing on May 2, the ALJ did not allow Whiteleather to introduce into evidence certain settlement communications, including drafts of the settlement agreement, between Whiteleather and counsel for the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 577-78. Thus, the administrative record did not contain most of the settlement correspondence between Whiteleather and the District's counsel over the period of time between February 2018 and April 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The ALJ's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Following the May 2 hearing, on June 14, 2018, ALJ Sabrina Kong issued a decision denying Plaintiff's due process complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 355-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   First, the ALJ made several evidentiary rulings, finding that Plaintiff's characterization of the evidence of communications between Plaintiff and the District during the pendency of the administrative proceedings was less persuasive than the District's characterization of the same evidence. The ALJ determined that Attwood's assertion that Plaintiff and his parents communicated to the District in mid-February 2018 that Plaintiff was willing to accept only $1,000 for the IEE from Dr. Stephey was \"not persuasive,\" because Plaintiff did not provide any documents to support that contention. AR 358-59. The ALJ also found Attwood's argument that the District never offered to pay $1,000 for Dr. Stephey's evaluation without conditions, such as waivers of Plaintiff's claims or other rights, to be unpersuasive in light of the emails from late April 2018 indicating that the District was withdrawing its due process complaint and would fund Dr. Stephey's evaluation at the $1,000 cost cap. AR 359.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the ALJ concluded that the District did not unnecessarily delay in filing its due process complaint between August 21, 2017 and December 5, 2017. AR 363-64. The ALJ found that the District timely agreed to fund an IEE within 10 days of Plaintiff's initial request, and when Plaintiff selected an evaluator who did not meet the District's cost criteria, the District \"actively communicated with Parent and Mr. Attwood about the [ ] cost criteria and provided Mr. Attwood and Parent the opportunity to demonstrate any unique circumstances justifying an independent evaluation that did not fall within the [ ] cost criteria.\" AR 363. Because Plaintiff never\n   offered a justification warranting the District to pay for an IEE in excess of the cost cap and instead suggested \"unequivocally\" that the District file for due process in November 2017, the ALJ held that the District's filing of a due process complaint on December 5, 2017 was reasonable in light of the District being closed over the Thanksgiving holiday. AR 364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, as to the period between December 6, 2017 and April 25, 2018, the ALJ construed the parties' frequent communications from February 2018 (when Plaintiff retained an attorney) and late April 2018 as \"negotiat[ing] a settlement of the consolidated matter\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , both the District's due process complaint and Plaintiff's due process complaints against the District.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ again rejected Plaintiff's argument that in February 2018 he communicated to the District a willingness to accept only $1,000 for Dr. Stephey's evaluation, because Plaintiff \"never provided any documents, emails or otherwise, supporting that he accepted the [ ] cost criteria before late April 2018.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ continued that, even if Plaintiff had made such an offer in February 2018, such an offer was \"irrelevant\" because Plaintiff never provided any evidence that a delay between February and April 2018 impeded Plaintiff's educational rights, deprived Plaintiff of educational benefits, or significantly impeded the ability of Plaintiff's parents to participate in the decision-making process, showings which are necessary for Plaintiff to be successful in his due process complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 365 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3)(E)(ii) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n    Cal.

The ALJ noted that it was Plaintiff, not the District, who sought numerous continuances of the OAH hearing before the ALJ, and that Plaintiff did not provide any evidence showing that the delays in resolution of the administrative proceeds \"were anything beyond the normal and brief periods to accommodate good faith discussions, negotiations, including resolution session and mediation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The ALJ also found that Plaintiff \"conflated District's duty to file and maintain its case to decision with resolving [Plaintiff's] complaint in the context of a settlement agreement which included paying [Plaintiff's] attorneys' fees without releases.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Importantly, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff \"did not present evidence supporting that District was required to offer the [IEE] in the context of a formal settlement agreement along with payment of [Plaintiff's] attorney's fees when agreeing to fund an independent evaluation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the ALJ recognized that after the District withdrew its due process complaint on April 25, 2018, \"[Plaintiff's] only dispute with District was its refusal to pay him attorneys' fees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But ultimately, the ALJ held that \"[w]hether District was required to pay for [Plaintiffs'] attorneys' fees in conjunction with funding the [IEE] is not before this ALJ, and beyond the scope of the issue in this hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, based on the administrative record, the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff did not meet his burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the District unnecessarily delayed in filing its due process complaint or was unreasonable in its efforts to continue negotiating with Plaintiff's team up until the time that the parties agreed on the amount to be paid for the IEE performed by Dr. Stephey. AR 365-66. The ALJ found the District to be the prevailing party as to the sole issue remaining in Plaintiff's due process complaint. AR 366.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    G.

The Court also explained the lack of clarity as to what legal standards should apply to the thrust of Plaintiff's argument in this case, that the District unnecessarily delayed in resolving its due process complaint by failing to agree to the cost cap of $1,000 for Dr. Stephey's IEE after Plaintiff first indicated his willingness to agree to the cost cap in February 2018.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2056505\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   After the parties submitted their supplemental briefs, the Court vacated the bench trial and took the case under submission without holding a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The ALJ did not address this specific argument in its decision, and Plaintiff has not identified any authority for the proposition that the District was required to identify any particular information for Plaintiff's parents upon request. Nevertheless, Plaintiff's argument holds merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Because the inquiry into whether unnecessary delay existed is a fact-intensive inquiry, see\n   <em>\n    C.W. v. Capistrano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180521\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1237/#p1247\">\n    784 F.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it is necessary to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the parties' ongoing communications in an effort to resolve the IEE dispute. The case law cited in this Order does not suggest that the existence of merely\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   communications\n   between parents and a school district regarding the provision of an IEE automatically tolls the clock for the district's obligation to fund or file without unnecessary delay. The Court is persuaded by OSEP's characterization of the term \"unnecessary delay\" as allowing for \"a reasonably flexible\" period of time to \"accommodate\n   <em>\n    good faith\n   </em>\n   discussions and negotiations\" regarding the requested IEE.\n   <em>\n    See Letter to Anonymous\n   </em>\n   , 56 IDELR 175 (OSEP 2010) (emphasis added). Thus, if a school district communicates with parents about an IEE in a manner that suggests bad faith or dilatory tactics, rather than a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute over the IEE amicably, there is no reason why those communications should be afforded the same weight when evaluating the reasonableness of the district's conduct and the justification for its delay in filing for due process at an earlier date. In other words, a district's unreasonable actions during attempts to resolve a dispute with parents regarding an IEE, including the withholding of pertinent information necessary for the parents to defend their position, could fairly amount to \"unnecessary delay\" under the particular circumstances of a given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In this case, the District had information available to it that would have assisted Attwood and Plaintiff's parents in assessing how to respond to the District's October 13, 2017 letter asserting that Dr. Stephey did not meet the \"cost maximum\" under the Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 256. That letter was purportedly issued to satisfy the District's obligations to send Plaintiff's parents a \"prior written notice\" letter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which requires the District to include \"an explanation of why the [District] proposes or refuses to take the action\" requested by the parents.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). In the letter, the District requested written justification of the unique circumstances warranting a departure from the Policy's criteria for Dr. Stephey's evaluation, but the District did not explain what the cost maximum under the Policy was, nor how much Dr. Stephey's evaluation would exceed that maximum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   That missing information is obviously vital to the discussions between the District and Plaintiff's parents that would inevitably follow after the District's October 13 letter. To illustrate, had Dr. Stephey charged one dollar over the Policy's cost maximum for a visual processing IEE, Plaintiff's burden to justify the use of Dr. Stephey would have been substantially diminished, and Plaintiff's parents almost assuredly would have offered to pay the excess immediately, without the need for the District to resort to a due process hearing. And the events that transpired following the District's filing for due process further illuminates the repercussions of depriving Plaintiff's parents of this information in a timely manner. As the ALJ found, Attwood did not know that Dr. Stephey's purported fee from the rate sheet sent to the District would be around $2,400 until after the District identified that amount in its due process complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 358. Attwood then promptly \"convinced [Dr.] Stephey to assess [Plaintiff] for one thousand four hundred dollars,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.503\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , thereby substantially reducing the difference between Dr. Stephey's rates and the District's cost cap. Plaintiff's parents ultimately express their willingness to pay the amount of Dr. Stephey's fees in excess of $1,000, an option of which Plaintiff's parents were entirely deprived before the District filed for due process on December 5, 2017 due to the District's unwillingness to share even the most basic information about how Dr. Stephey's rates did not comply with the District's cost cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The District argues that \"[t]here is no legal authority that requires a district to provide a sufficient break-down of a particular independent assessor's costs in order to facilitate\" negotiation between the district and parents requesting an IEE.

By directing Plaintiff's advocate to collect that information from a third party, rather than fully explaining the basis for its rejection of Dr. Stephey as required under \u00a7 300.503(b)(2), the District impermissibly attempted to foist its own responsibility to ensure compliance with the procedures under the IDEA onto Plaintiff's parents and expected Plaintiff's parents to expend needless energy tracking down the necessary information already in the District's possession.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Amanda J.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499969\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/877/#p887\">\n    267 F.3d at 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the school district \"blatantly violated one of the [IDEA's] procedural requirements\" because the district \"had information in its records, which, if disclosed, would have changed the educational approach used for [the student]\").

Between October 19, 2017 and November 15, 2017, the District continued to request written justification of unique circumstances from Plaintiff's parents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 280-81 (November 2 letter); AR 262 (November 7 letter); AR 265 (December 1 email, which also acknowledged that the District sent another letter on November 17); AR 263-64 (December 4 letter). During this timeframe, Plaintiff's parents continued to request the District to provide more information about how Dr. Stephey's IEE would not satisfy the District's cost maximum, but the District never did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 259 (follow-up email from Attwood on October 19); AR 277-78 (November 15 emails); AR 265 (November 30 email). The fact that Plaintiff's parents never responded to the District's letters from November 2 and November 7, and never offered the written justification that the District sought, is immaterial because the parents\n   could not respond effectively to the District's request for justification without the missing information they had requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The District also argues that, because Dr. Stephey did not identify a specific charge for a visual processing IEE in the rate sheet sent to the District and could not identify a single charge until after completing the evaluation, \"it would have been impossible for [the District] to do so\" in response to Attwood's email on October 19, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 39 at 17. Yet the District had no problem representing unequivocally to Plaintiff's parents that Dr. Stephey \"does not meet the cost maximum\" for visual processing IEEs under the Policy, after merely looking at Dr. Stephey's rate sheet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 256. It is wholly inconsistent for the District to argue before this Court that it could not estimate what Dr. Stephey's charges would be based on the rate sheet he provided, or even send Plaintiff's parents the rate sheet itself, and at the same time represent to Plaintiff's parents in October 2017 that Dr. Stephey did not meet the cost cap without qualification. The absurdity of the District's argument is further revealed by the fact that Dr. Stephey ultimately billed only $800 for the IEE.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 268. The District simply has not articulated a legitimate reason why it refused to cooperate with Plaintiff's parents' simple request for more information, which the District had readily available at its disposal, about how the District determined that Dr. Stephey did not meet the District's IEE criteria, even if an answer could not be provided to the precise dollar amount of Dr. Stephey's yet-to-be-performed evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Neither has the District provided for justification why it could not feasibly reach out to Dr. Stephey directly to obtain a more precise estimate of his fees for Plaintiff's IEE; the SELPA evidently did the same thing for Dr. Morris, another evaluator chosen by Plaintiff's parents, which resulted in Dr. Morris \"adjust[ing] her rate sheet so that Royal Lord could approve her for the neuropsych assessment for [Plaintiff].\" AR 267. Plaintiff's parents even requested that the District reach out to Dr. Stephey in this regard,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499969\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/877/#p887\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but the District has not explained why it did not do so-or alternatively, why the District's efforts to do so proved ineffective. Again, the onus is on the District, not Plaintiff's parents, to ensure that the IEE dispute is resolved without unnecessary delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    William S. Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2012493766\">\n    2014 WL 12493766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (affirming the ALJ's conclusion \"that \u00a7 300.502(b) places the onus on the District to act without unnecessary delay upon the parent's request\" for an IEE).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In fact, even earlier in the parties' correspondence about a visual processing IEE for Plaintiff, the District showed that it was unwilling to be proactive to satisfy its duties under the IDEA. After Plaintiff's parents selected Dr. Stephey as their preferred visual processing evaluator in a September 12 email, see AR 252, the District did not contact Dr. Stephey directly despite the fact that Plaintiff's parents included contact information for Dr. Stephey in their email. Rather, the District waited until September 26-two weeks after receiving the email-and sent a letter to\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's parents\n   </em>\n   asking for Dr. Stephey's curriculum vitae and rate sheet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 255. Dr. Stephey himself noted to the District on October 3, 2017 that, in Dr. Stephey's experience, it was unusual for parents to be asked to collect information from a selected independent evaluator rather than the school district reaching out to the evaluator directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 307 (\"I work collaboratively with about 30 districts and have never had a parent have to track down this information.\"). The District's decision to send Plaintiff's parents a letter on September 26 asking for Dr. Stephey's rate sheet and curriculum vitae could also\n   be seen as an unnecessary dilatory tactic in response to the parents' selection of Dr. Stephey as their preferred evaluator, given that the District was responsible to ensure that Dr. Stephey's IEE would be funded-or alternatively, that the District would file a due process complaint challenging Plaintiff's parents' selection of Dr. Stephey-without unnecessary delay. The District has provided no explanation for why it chose to task Plaintiff's parents with the responsibility to communicate with Dr. Stephey about his qualifications and fees in response to the selection of Dr. Stephey, and no legitimate explanation emerges from the record before the Court. Therefore, because the District failed to coordinate directly with Dr. Stephey in response to Plaintiff's parents selecting Dr. Stephey as their preferred visual processing evaluator, the District's unnecessary delay actually began on September 12, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In sum, nothing in the record suggests that it was somehow \"necessary\" for the District to withhold information about how Dr. Stephey's fees exceeded the District's cost cap, or that the resulting delay between the date Plaintiff's parents first requested that information and the date the District ultimately filed for due process was a \"necessary\" delay that encompassed good faith negotiations between the parties to resolve the IEE dispute amicably. Therefore, Plaintiff has met his burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the District unnecessarily delayed in filing for due process over the 84-day time period between September 12, 2017 and December 5, 2017. Such a timeframe is a relatively short but consistent with other case law finding an unnecessary delay.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pajaro Valley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203734289\">\n    2006 WL 3734289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (finding an unexplained delay of three months to be unnecessary).

To the extent that Plaintiff purports to rely on the fact that Plaintiff's parents were excluded from the IEP meeting held by the District on December 1, 2017, see AR 263, that meeting occurred prior to the District's filing for due process on December 5. Therefore, even if the District unnecessarily delayed in resolving its due process complaint between February 2018 and April 2018 in light of a clear offer from Plaintiff's parents to pay all costs of Dr. Stephey's IEE above the District's cost cap, Plaintiff has not identified that this delay caused a denial of a FAPE or impeded with Plaintiff's parents' ability to participate in the IEP process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Because any potential substantive repercussions of the District's unnecessary delay occurred prior to the District's filing of the due process complaint, Plaintiff did not meet his burden of proof to show entitlement to relief in his due process complaint for the period between February 12, 2018 and April 25, 2018, even if the District unnecessarily delayed in resolving its own complaint over that period in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Therefore, the Court need not address the parties' various arguments about the legal significance of Plaintiff's parents' offer to pay the excess of the District's cost cap in February 2018, or whether the settlement negotiations between the parties from February to April 2018 constituted \"unnecessary delay\" on the part of the District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   the Court AFFIRMS the ALJ's decision on this secondary issue addressed in the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Based on the evidence in the record, the District unreasonably refused to provide Plaintiff's parents with necessary information about how Dr. Stephey's IEE exceeded the District's cost criteria after the parents requested such information. The Court REMANDS to the ALJ for the limited determination, consistent with the findings in this Order, of whether the District's unnecessary delay affected Plaintiff's or his parents' substantive rights under the IDEA, and if so, what is the appropriate remedy for Plaintiff's due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   However, the Court AFFIRMS the ALJ's conclusion that, even if the District\n   unnecessarily delayed in prosecuting its due process complaint between February 2018 and April 2018, Plaintiff did not meet his burden of proof to show that such an unnecessary delay affected Plaintiff's or his parents' substantive rights.

The District points out that the IDEA's implementing regulations allow for a parent to obtain an IEE at \"public expense,\" which \"means that the public agency either pays for the full cost of the evaluation or ensures that the evaluation is otherwise provided at no cost to the parent.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n     34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3)(ii). OSEP has issued an advisory letter addressing the situation of when a public agency is asked to fund an IEE that exceeds the agency's cost criteria.\n    <em>\n     See Letter to Petska\n    </em>\n    , 35 IDELR 191 (OSEP 2001). In the letter, OSEP states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n    If the total cost of the IEE exceeds the maximum allowable costs and the school district believes that there is no justification for the excess cost, the school district cannot in its sole judgment determine that it will pay only the maximum allowable cost and no further. The public agency must, without unnecessary delay, initiate a hearing to demonstrate that the evaluation obtained by the parent did not meet the agency's cost criteria.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n     at 2-3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The importance of a public agency initiating a due process hearing is vital for the agency to protect itself against unnecessarily expensive IEEs; as OSEP explained in a different advisory letter, \"[i]f the public agency chooses not to initiate a due process hearing [to demonstrate that the parents' chosen evaluator does not meet the agency's IEE criteria], it\n    <em>\n     must\n    </em>\n    ensure that the parent is reimbursed for the evaluation,\" regardless of the cost of the IEE.\n    <em>\n     Letter to Parker\n    </em>\n    , 41 IDELR 155, at 2 (OSEP 2004) (emphasis added). The District relies on this authority to argue that, even if Plaintiff's parents were willing to pay all amounts in excess of the District's cost cap, the IEE itself still would not satisfy the District's criteria for independent evaluations, and therefore \"the District's obligation to ensure that parents receive an IEE at public expense pursuant to section 300.502 would not be satisfied if it agreed to fund the IEE up to [its] $1,000 cost cap.\" Dkt. 48 at 19. The District takes the position that a written agreement between Plaintiff's parents and the District would be necessary to confirm that Plaintiff's parents were willing to forego their right to an IEE wholly at public expense.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20300.502\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Plaintiff essentially argues in response that a school district must prosecute its due process complaint to completion without unnecessary delay as part of the district's obligations to \"fund or file\" under \u00a7 300.502(b)(2), and that as soon as the District received notice of Plaintiff's parents' willingness to pay the excess of Dr. Stephey's cost cap, the District no longer had a basis to assert that Plaintiff sought an IEE inconsistent with the Policy's cost criteria and was obligated to withdraw its due process complaint immediately.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The Court has found no authority that addresses this issue directly. One district court acknowledged the same argument raised by a different school district but declined to address the argument because it was not presented to the ALJ in the underlying administrative proceedings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goleta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20700082\">\n     2017 WL 700082\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6-7 (\"[T]his court does not reach the question whether a school district must, or may, pay a portion of an independent educational evaluator's fees up to the district's reasonable cost cap where the evaluator's fee exceeds that cap and the parent agrees to pay the difference.\"). Similar to\n    <em>\n     Goleta\n    </em>\n    , here the parties did not expressly raise this argument before the ALJ, and the ALJ did not issue a ruling on this question. This issue is one of substantive education policy under the IDEA, and for the Court to issue an interpretation of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions without a decision from the ALJ on this subject would be unnecessary and would amount to the Court substituting its \"own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which [it] review[s].\"\n    <em>\n     Ojai\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11941100\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/1467/#p1471\">\n     4 F.3d at 1472\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The Court previously noted that Plaintiff does not seek to have the Court issue a ruling in this action declaring that Plaintiff's parents were the prevailing party with respect to the District's withdrawn due process complaint, and that therefore the Court would not entertain argument on that subject.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 50 at 2. Indeed, the ALJ noted that Plaintiff had conflated the District's duty to file for due process without unnecessary delay with the issue of whether attorneys' fees would be appropriate for the District's withdrawn due process complaint against Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 365. Plaintiff again evinced the same misunderstanding in his trial briefing submitted to the Court in this action, by citing to the standards for an award of attorneys' fees under the IDEA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 31 at 10-12. Because Plaintiff does not seek a prevailing party determination on the District's withdrawn due process complaint in the Complaint filed in this action, such relief is outside the scope of issues to be resolved in this action, in which Plaintiff seeks only a review of the ALJ's decision denying Plaintiff's due process complaint against the District.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    Nevertheless, the Court is inclined to believe that Plaintiff's parents may fairly be determined to be the prevailing party as to the District's withdrawn due process complaint, and therefore Plaintiff's parents may be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection with that due process complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     J.B. v. San Jose Unified Sch. Dist.\n    </em>\n    , No. C 12-06358 SI,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201891398\">\n     2013 WL 1891398\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2013) (rejecting the argument that a school district's voluntary withdrawal of a due process complaint does not amount to a \"judicially sanctioned change in the parties' relationship\" as necessary to award attorneys' fees under the IDEA since the district's dismissal of its complaint without prejudice \"precluded [the district] from refiling its complaint after waiting seven months, because to do so would constitute 'unnecessary delay' \" and \"would have essentially eliminated the right of the [d]istrict to further contest the IEE\"). Nothing prevents Plaintiff from filing a new action seeking a prevailing party determination and an award of attorneys' fees for the District's withdrawn due process complaint within the state statute of limitations period applicable to such requests for attorneys' fees.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Meridian Joint Sch.
