(\"Beechwood\"). BCLIC and WNIC ask this Court to order Beechwood to post $250 million in security under New York and Indiana security statutes, or to strike Beechwood's pleadings and enter default judgment against it. Because the parties dispute whether BCLIC and WNIC's motion is precluded by prior orders in a pending arbitration between them, and because the Court concludes that the arbitration panel must resolve this dispute in the first instance, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Much of the background to this case has been set forth in various Opinions and Orders of this Court, familiarity with which is here assumed. As relevant here, BCLIC and WNIC are insurance companies that invested nearly $600 million with Beechwood pursuant to Reinsurance Agreements signed in February 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer, Cross-Claims and Third-Party Complaint of Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company and Washington National Insurance Company \u00b6\u00b6 478-80, 593-94 (\"TPC\"), ECF No. 75. Each of the Reinsurance Agreements contains a broad arbitration clause providing for arbitration of \"all disputes or differences between the Parties arising under or relating to\" the Reinsurance Agreements. ECF No. 308-1, at 24, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 29, 2016, BCLIC and WNIC terminated the Reinsurance Agreements with Beechwood,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63, and on the same day, BCLIC and WNIC demanded arbitration against Beechwood in connection with \"Beechwood's incurable material breaches of the Reinsurance Agreements, and breaches of fiduciary duties and the obligation to deal honestly and in good faith, and conversion and fraud,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 121.

ECF No. 308, Ex. 8, at 2. BCLIC and WNIC argued, inter alia, that this security was required by New York and Indiana statutes that prevent unauthorized foreign insurers like Beechwood from filing any pleading in an action against them unless they (1) become licensed insurers or (2) post sufficient security to cover any judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%201213\">\n    N.Y.

ECF No. 209. The Court is currently scheduled to hear argument on those motions on August 12, 2019. ECF No. 315. In the meantime, however, BCLIC and WNIC have filed another motion - now before the Court - to enforce the New York and Indiana security statutes mentioned above. ECF No. 244. Under these statutes, BCLIC and WNIC argue, Beechwood cannot file its partial motion to dismiss or its motion to compel arbitration without posting $250 million in security, an amount equal to the $180 million that BCLIC and WNIC seek in breach of contract damages and the $70 million that they seek in contribution and indemnity. If Beechwood fails to post this security, BCLIC and WNIC argue, then its pleadings should be stricken, and default judgment should be entered against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beechwood opposes BCLIC and WNIC's motion on several grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beechwood Re's Response to CNO's Motion to Enforce State Security Statutes (\"Beechwood Opp.\"), ECF No. 306. As a threshold matter, Beechwood argues, the New York and Indiana security statutes do not apply to insurers like Beechwood that are in pending liquidation proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-4-4-4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-4-4-4\">\n    at 24-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if the statutes did apply, Beechwood continues, BCLIC and WNIC's motion would be precluded by the arbitration panel's prior orders requiring security, which were reduced to judgment when this Court confirmed them on April 24.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-4-4-4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2027-4-4-4\">\n    at 11-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the Security Statutes Apply to Insurers in Pending Liquidation Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court begins by addressing the threshold question of whether the New York and Indiana security statutes apply at all, given that Beechwood is currently in liquidation. Under section 1213(c) (1) of the New York Insurance Law :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Before any unauthorized foreign or alien insurer files any pleading in any proceeding against it, it shall either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (A) deposit with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending, cash or securities or file with such clerk a bond with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the court, in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to secure payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in the proceeding, but the court may in its discretion make an order dispensing with such deposit or bond if the superintendent certifies to it that such insurer maintains within this state funds or securities in trust or otherwise sufficient and available to satisfy any final judgment which may be entered in the proceeding, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (B) procure a license to do an insurance business in this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Likewise, section 27-4-4-4(a) of the Indiana Code provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Before any unauthorized foreign or alien insurer shall file or cause to be filed any pleading in any action, suit, or proceeding instituted against it, such unauthorized insurer shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) deposit, with the clerk of the court in which such action, suit, or proceeding is pending, cash or securities, or file with such clerk a bond with good and sufficient sureties, to be approved by the court, in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to secure the payment of any final judgment which may be rendered in such action; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) procure a certificate of authority to transact the business of insurance in this state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There is no dispute that these statutes apply to reinsurers like Beechwood. There\n   is also no dispute that \"pleadings\" under the statutes include motions to dismiss and motions to compel arbitration. And there is no dispute that failure to comply with the statutes' requirements may result in stricken pleadings and the entry of default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Instead, Beechwood and the\n   <em>\n    Cyganowski\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trott\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs argue that the security statutes should not apply because Beechwood is currently in liquidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beechwood Opp. 24-25; Pls.

The\n   <em>\n    Cyganowski\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trott\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs make a similar point, arguing that \"BCLIC/WNIC's request ... is nothing more than an improper attempt by BCLIC/WNIC to place themselves at the front of the line of potential judgment creditors of Beechwood.\" Pls.

To the extent that\n   <em>\n    Laitasalo\n   </em>\n   decided to read an equitable exception into state security statutes, that decision is not binding on this Court. Moreover, as BCLIC and WNIC note, the Bankruptcy Code specifically provides that a \"court may not grant relief under [Chapter 15] with respect to any deposit, escrow, trust fund,\n   <em>\n    or other security required or permitted under any applicable State insurance law or regulation\n   </em>\n   for the benefit of claim holders in the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201501\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third-Party and Cross-Claim Plaintiffs Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company's and Washington National Insurance Company's Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Motion to Enforce State Security Statutes 7 (\"Reply\"), ECF No. 326.

Beechwood Opp. 11-16. At a minimum, Beechwood contends, the preclusion issue must be decided by the panel in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201501\">\n    at 10-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted above, the Reinsurance Agreements contain broad arbitration clauses providing for arbitration of \"all disputes or differences between the Parties arising under or relating to\" the Reinsurance Agreements.

The Second Circuit has previously held that such language \"is sufficiently broad to encompass disputes about what was decided in a prior arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

BCLIC and WNIC resist this conclusion by arguing that the arbitration panel already considered and rejected Beechwood's preclusion arguments in an emergency hearing held on April 5, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 327, Ex.

Moreover, the hearing occurred before this Court confirmed the panel's prior orders, and the panel therefore did not have an opportunity to address the preclusive effect of the Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   If the panel concludes that BCLIC and WNIC are not precluded from bringing the instant motion, then the parties may return to this Court for further proceedings on the matter. Until that time, however, the Court will not stay consideration of Beechwood's pending motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that the New York and Indiana security statutes apply to Beechwood, notwithstanding Beechwood's pending liquidation proceedings. However, because the arbitration panel must decide in the first instance whether BCLIC and WNIC are precluded from bringing the instant motion, the motion in its present posture is hereby denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Clerk is directed to close the entry at docket number 244.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, in quoting cases all internal quotation marks, alterations, emphases, footnotes, and citations are omitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Court is also unpersuaded by the\n    <em>\n     Cyganowski\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Trott\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs' argument that the New York security statute \"is wholly inapplicable to the types of claims at issue in this consolidated litigation.\" Pls. Opp. 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    BCLIC and WNIC also argue that\n    <em>\n     Belco\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable because it \"involved\n    <em>\n     successive arbitrations\n    </em>\n    between the same parties.\" Reply 3 n.4. BCLIC and WNIC do not explain the legal significance of this distinction, however, and they do not address\n    <em>\n     Citigroup\n    </em>\n    at all, even though\n    <em>\n     Citigroup\n    </em>\n    is directly applicable to the instant case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
