(SAC \u00b6 27.) Founded in 2009 by Su, Sky began by developing and selling solar power systems to operators, which would generate revenues by selling electricity to power grid operators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 57.) In 2013, Sky began to shift its business model away from developing solar projects for sale in favor of becoming an independent power producer (\"IPP\"), which would develop solar projects and operate them, producing revenue through the sale of electricity to grid operators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Su was Sky's largest shareholder, as well as its CEO, and executive director, controlling 49.5% of Sky's voting shares as of 2014. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 28, 83-84.) Prior to founding Sky, Su had worked in the solar power industry since 2005, founding several companies that developed and constructed solar power projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Prior to and throughout his tenure with Sky, Su has had an interest in or affiliation with 37 companies, including many in the solar power sector in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87-90.) From 2011 through June 2014, various Chinese courts entered at least seven judgments against him for a cumulative liability of $44 million for avoiding civil debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77, 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A confidential witness, who apparently did not reveal himself until after the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC,\" Docket Entry No. 34) was filed, informed Plaintiffs that, in January 2011, Su engineered a transaction to transfer the stock held indirectly by Sky's predecessor in Sky Solar Deutschland GmbH (\"SSD\") to Minquan Fu, a close associate who was the managing director of another Sky subsidiary, for one euro, in exchange for a waiver of receivables, purportedly to reduce Sky's \"net liabilities and focus its resources and working capital on geographic areas.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 94, 96-98; Prospectus at F-65.) The confidential witness asserts that Fu then transferred the stock to other Sky subsidiaries and that the transaction was engineered to avoid creditors. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 96, 99.) On November 18, 2010, the confidential witness, who was at the time a managing director of SSD, confronted Su about the propriety of the transaction. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 102-106.) The confidential witness asserts that Su cheated him out of his ownership interest in Sky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2008, Su supervised the largest solar project in Spain through Sky Global, a predecessor of Sky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142, 145.) According to Plaintiffs' confidential witness, who worked for Su on the project, \u20ac30 million went missing from Sky Global's accounts and a subsequent 2010 investigation concluded that two of Sky Global's local partners had diverted this money through fraudulent means. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-47.) The confidential witness asserts that, after this incident, Sky and other companies associated with Su were no longer able to secure construction financing from banks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 148.) Sky was only able to secure financing through vendors that produced low quality solar modules that were used to construct the projects, resulting in Sky's\n   subsequent sale of low-quality solar projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-49)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to November 2014, Sky began developing solar projects in Japan and started to develop such projects in Chile. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17, 73, 193.) Following the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, Japan engaged in an effort to decrease its reliance on nuclear energy in favor of a diverse group of other sources, including solar power. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168.) The Japanese government enacted the Act on the Purchase of Renewable Energy Sourced Electricity by Electric Utilities, which introduced a program of feed-in-tariffs (\"FIT\") in July 2012 that subsidized the generation of electricity from renewable sources through surcharges on electricity customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169, 181 (citing Daniel Cusick, \"Power Companies in Japan Move to Restrict Solar,\" Scientific American, E&amp;E News (October 2, 2014) (\"Cusick Article\"), available at https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/power-companies-in-japan-move-to-restrict-solar/ (last visited May 22, 2019)).) The first iteration of this subsidy was set at 40 yen/kilowatt hour and spurred the private sector to build 11,000\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   MW of solar generation between 2012 and September 2014, with an additional 72,000 MW of capacity in development as of October 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (\"METI\") lowered the FIT rate to 36 yen/kilowatt hour in 2013 and 32 yen/kilowatt hour in April 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In September 2014, five of Japan's 10 utility companies suspended consideration of procurement of electrical power from renewable sources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 170;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cusik article.) In addition to these developments, other trends were undermining the market for solar power in Japan, including: (1) a sudden glut of solar power generation projects, which were being developed too rapidly and were also using up too much of Japan's open spaces\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) the inability of the Japanese power transmission grids to accommodate the increased generation of solar power;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) government policy, embodied in the April 2014 Strategic Energy Plan, to diversify Japanese power generation capabilities with a greater emphasis on nuclear and coal-fueled plants in order to provide a more stable and economical power supply, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 176-180); and (4) increasing concern about funding the FIT payments through burdensome surcharges on the end-user of the electricity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181-83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that FIT rates in the Japanese market continued to fall, and that these reductions were enacted in a manner intended to apply the lower rates to projects that were in the pipeline and\n   dissuade solar builders from seeking quick approval to lock in a favorable FIT rate while delaying construction in anticipation of falling construction costs. (SAC \u00b6 185(c).) Plaintiffs allege that this dynamic had the effect of incentivizing Sky to accelerate construction, forsaking probable future reductions in construction costs, to secure favorable FIT rates before they were further reduced, but Plaintiffs do not allege that such acceleration actually occurred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Chile in 2014, grid access for solar power providers was restricted due to increased solar production in that country, thus limiting the number of new solar projects that could be undertaken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A report on the trends to expect in 2015 noted that, in 2016, the lack of grid capacity would limit new solar projects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Sky sought to build projects in northern Chile, where the power grid was not connected to the grid serving the more populous central region of the country. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 197, 202.) In 2016, the general manager for Accoina SA's Chile energy unit stated that this situation, arising from a lack of grid capacity, was expected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 201 (quoting Dezem Article).) Plaintiffs further allege that electricity prices in Chile were depressed due to oversupply. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 15, 2014, Sky filed its first draft registration statement, including a draft prospectus, with the SEC in connection with an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of American Depositary Shares (\"ADS\"). (SAC \u00b6 66.) The registration statement and prospectus were amended five times; the final registration and prospectus, dated November 13, 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Prospectus,\" Docket Entry No. 66-2), was filed on November 14, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In its third draft of the registration statement, Sky contemplated offering 12.5 million ADSs at a maximum price of $12 per ADS, with an overallotment option for 1,875,000 shares, which would raise approximately $121.9 million dollars. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70; Registration Statement Form F-1, Amendment 3, Docket Entry No. 66-3, at 48.) Due to lower than anticipated demand, Sky offered, in its final registration statement, 6,353,750 ADSs (including the overallotment purchased by the underwriters) for $8 per ADS, raising approximately $46.1 million. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72.) In the third draft of the registration statement, Sky stated that it intended to allocate $40 million to shovel-ready projects\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Japan, $40 million to shovel-ready projects in Latin America, and $10 million for projects elsewhere, with the balance of its proceeds to be allotted to general corporate purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Registration Statement Form F-1, Amendment 3 at 48.) The third amendment also stated that Sky had \"257.1 MW of shovel-ready projects ... [and] 1,053.3 MW of solar projects under development, including 543.4 MW of advanced and qualified pipeline projects which [Sky] expect[ed] to be ready for funding within 12 to 18 months.\" (SAC \u00b6 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Prospectus contains several passages describing Su's experience and credentials. The Prospectus characterized Su as a \"successful businessman\" who was \"primarily responsible for [Sky's] strategic planning\" and was \"essential to [Sky's] continuing success.\" (Prospectus at 4, 20, 144.) The Prospectus also asserted that Su had founded several solar companies and \"supervised the largest solar park in Spain.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144.) The Prospectus asserted more generally that Sky had a \"proven track record ... operating under local conditions, developing local relationships and managing a global platform,\" a \"highly experienced management team supported by strong, localized execution capabilities across all key functions and locations,\" and experienced \"local engineering and project management teams.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 2, 101, 104.) The Prospectus represented that Sky had \"broad geographic reach and established presence across key solar markets.\" (Prospectus at 1, 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Prospectus further asserted that Sky was \"well positioned to create efficient financing solutions that are responsive to local regulatory conditions and financial markets\" and that it sought to arrange financing by leveraging relationships with its partners. (Prospectus at 1, 62.) The Prospectus characterized Sky as experienced in securing efficient financing for its projects, tailored to local conditions, and represented that Sky had ready access to financing, increased financing capabilities, and strong relationships with international financing sources. (Prospectus at 1, 2, 62, 104, 123.) The Prospectus also stated that, despite the goals of various governments to reduce subsidies, Sky expected that profitability in the solar industry would increase as the costs of solar technology decreased and/or the spot price of electricity increased. (Prospectus at 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Prospectus disclosed that Sky had identified \"material weakness and other control deficiencies in [its] internal control over financial reporting, which ... have not been remediated\" and which might undermine Sky's ability to prevent fraud. (Prospectus at 31-32.) Sky stated that, to address these deficiencies, it planned,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to form an audit committee of independent directors, to be supported by an audit department, to oversee the operation of Sky's finance department and review all related-party and other significant transactions, but noted that the identified internal control deficiencies over financial reporting had not yet been remediated and that the failure to do so could affect Sky's ability to prevent fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75.) The new audit committee would also be charged with \"reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of [Sky's] internal controls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148.) The Prospectus also described fiduciary duties of a corporate director under Cayman Islands law. (Prospectus at 147, 174.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Prospectus disclosed a multitude of related-party transactions that Sky had entered into with companies in which Su held an interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 41, 42, 156-61.) The prospectus also warned that Su's interest might not align with those of other shareholders and that he might not act in the best interests of other shareholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) The Prospectus further stated that Sky and Su had entered into a non-competition agreement in which Su agreed to give Sky the right of first refusal to purchase Su's interest in solar companies that compete with Sky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sky's board of directors promulgated a code of ethics, to be adopted upon the filing of its registration statement. (SAC \u00b6 135.) The code stated that Sky \"is committed to conduct its business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.) The code was designed to promote \"full, fair, accurate, and understandable disclosure\" in documents prepared for the Securities and Exchange Commission and other parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137.) The Code required all Sky employees to disclose any conflict of interest and comply with all relevant reporting requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Prospectus also contained a discussion of Sky's current and planned future operations, both in general and with respect to specific regions, countries, and individual projects as well as the conditions in certain national markets. With respect to Japan, the Prospectus made several statements extolling the appeal of the national market for solar power including that: (1) Japan \"introduced an attractive FIT price support regime to encourage the development of solar parks\"; (2) Sky intended to focus on \"markets, such as Japan, that have high demand for power, low domestic fossil fuel reserves, high energy costs, a highly favorable FIT policy and attractive local financing sources\"; and (3) Sky expected to continue to expand its Japanese capacity because of the \"highly favorable FIT price support scheme and ... generous target for the percentage of national power generated from renewable sources.\" (Prospectus at 61, 104-105, 113.) The Prospectus also stated that Sky intended to focus its operations in Japan, Chile, Uruguay, and other markets with \"highly attractive solar radiation, regulatory environments, power pricing, land availably, financial access, and overall power trends.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) The Prospectus further stated that \"[r]ecent government investigations and rulings should accelerate the development of solar parks within [Sky's Japanese] pipeline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113.) The Prospectus also noted that several countries had reduced solar subsidies, providing examples that did not include Japan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Prospectus included a discussion of media reports that METI was considering measures such as the suspension of new projects, reduction of FIT for future projects, and encouraging other types of renewable energy, but stated that Sky believed that the measures would not affect projects already approved for connection to the grid and expressed uncertainty as to whether Sky's projects that had not yet been approved for grid connection would be negatively affected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Prospectus contained warnings that, in light of the popularity of FIT subsidies, Japanese power transmission grids were suffering from a shortage of transmission capacity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) The original FIT rate and the two subsequent reductions were all noted in the Prospectus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130.) The Prospectus disclosed that five of Japan's utilities had temporarily suspended review of new solar projects and that other utilities might also have suspended reviews without making formal announcements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to Sky's projects in Chile, the Prospectus characterized the country as a \"core growth area\" with a strong power market, a favorable regulatory environment, and access to financing, partly due to the large and energy intensive mining industry. (Prospectus at 101, 115.) The Prospectus named Chile as a market upon which Sky had a \"near-term focus.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100.) The Prospectus disclosed that Sky had 44 MW of shovel-ready projects and 341 MW of projects in its \"pipeline\" that Sky expected to be shovel-ready in 12 to 18 months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16.) The Prospectus also asserted that Sky had \"secured project\n   funding from a number of major international institutions\" for projects in several countries and, specifically, that Sky \"entered into a mandate with [the Inter-America Development Bank (the 'IADB') ] worth US$72 million to construct [Sky's] first project in Chile.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.) As of 2016, the terms were still being negotiated with the IADB and no projects in Chile were built. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the final Prospectus, Sky stated that it would allot $20 million for shovel-ready projects in Japan, $10 million for shovel-ready projects in Latin America, and the balance for projects in Sky's \"pipeline\" in Japan, Latin American, and elsewhere, as well as for general corporate purposes. (Prospectus at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Prospectus contained a description of Sky's current and future projects, including a recitation of projects in operation, under construction, in its \"pipeline,\" and those that were considered shovel-ready, that was unchanged from the third amended registration statement. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 240-241; Prospectus at 108-116.) This list was accompanied by a map of global operations. (Prospectus at 111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although the Prospectus listed 44 MW of Sky solar projects in Chile as shovel-ready, Sky lacked grid connection permits, but the Prospectus noted that such permits are not granted in Chile until construction is complete and the connection can be tested. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 198; Prospectus at 132-34.) Plaintiffs allege that Sky did not secure construction or other sectorial permits and that, although such permits were granted upon meeting certain technical requirements, these were complex and required a significant amount of work to secure. (SAC \u00b6 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Prospectus also enumerated a number of Japanese shovel-ready projects that could be constructed upon the receipt of funding and approval of various forestry and land use permits. (Prospectus at 109, 112-13.) Sky stated that it had already applied for these permits and submitted the required administrative notifications, and that it expected the permits to be granted within nine months of their application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112-113.) Sky then stated that it \"intended to apply for any outstanding permits upon the receipt of funding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Prospectus also stated that, in Japan, Sky \"normally submit[s] certain administrative notifications at the time [it] receives funding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   According to Plaintiffs' forensic accountant, Sky's Japanese subsidiary, Sky Solar Japan Co. K.K., entered into a silent partnership agreement with outside investors, who provided Sky with financing for 21 solar projects on distressed terms. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 226-30.) As of the date of the Prospectus, Sky had raised $49.4 million in cash from this partnership. (Prospectus at 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Prospectus recited numerous risks, with respect to Sky's business as a whole and in specific markets. Sky stated that its growth depended on its ability to raise financing at acceptable terms, which it could not guarantee. (Prospectus at 16-17.) Sky stated that its\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ability to obtain external financing is subject to a number of uncertainties, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 [Sky's] future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 the general condition of global equity and debt capital markets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 regulatory and government support in the form of tax credits, rebates, FIT price support schemes and other incentives;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 the continued confidence of banks and other financial institutions in ...

Although Sky stated that it expected the price of solar power generation to decrease and/or that the spot market price for electricity in some countries would increase, it did disclose, on the same page, that its growth could be negatively affected by the price of solar power components and engineering services and the price of and market demand for solar power.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   This cautionary language is sufficient to make the forward-looking statement not misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted with respect to the statements made in connection with the Japanese market and Sky's operations there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Item 303 and 503 Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Sky had an independent obligation under Items 303 and 503 of SEC Regulation S-K to disclose the state of the Japanese regulatory environment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Sunedison Secs.

Plaintiffs also point to Sky's positive statements about the condition of the Chilean solar power market and Sky's prospects in that market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Sky's characterizations of the Chilean solar market and Sky's prospects to prosper within it, like Sky's statements regarding the attractiveness of the Japanese market, were statements of opinion, and the challenges cited by Plaintiffs are not so inconsistent with the view expressed as to support an inference that Sky could not have believed its own statements of optimism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Sky's representation that it had 44 MW of shovel-ready projects in Chile was false because it did not have grid connection permits for those projects and the Prospectus defined shovel-ready projects as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , ones having \"all permits required for construction and grid connection,\" except certain non-discretionary permits that are granted if the technical or administrative requirements are met. (Prospectus at 6.) Plaintiffs allege that, under Chilean regulations, a grid connection permit cannot be granted until after construction is complete and the connection can be tested. Although Plaintiff thus pleads plausibly that Sky's Chilean projects did not meet the Prospectus's definition of shovel-ready,\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   they have not\n   pleaded that the Prospectus, which disclosed that grid connection permits for projects in Chile cannot be granted until after construction, was materially misleading in this respect. (Prospectus at 132-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegation that designating these projects as shovel-ready was misleading because the technical permits were very complicated and time-consuming to obtain is also without merit. The definition of a shovel-ready project only specified that permits that had not yet been granted were non-discretionary, not that they would be easy to obtain. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim that Sky's statements about the status of Sky's Chilean projects were misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Sky falsely claimed to have secured financing from the IADB for one of its Chilean projects, implying that the project would soon be built, when no such financing was in place and the project was not in fact built. The Prospectus states, in a paragraph introduced by the assertion \"[w]e have secured project funding from a number of major international institutions,\" that the IADB \"has also entered into a mandate with us worth US$72 million to construct\" a project in Chile. (Prospectus at 104.) The parties disagree as to whether a \"mandate\" implies a commitment of financing or an undertaking to advise on or arrange financing. Both parties cite specialized dictionaries; Defendants cite the Nasdaq Glossary of Stock Market Terms, which defines a mandate as the \"[a]llocation of funds to an investment manager to be managed for a specific purpose or style\" or \"the formal appointment to advise on or arrange project financing,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   whereas Plaintiffs cite a definition in the Financial Dictionary, by the Free Dictionary by Farlex, that characterizes a mandate as \"[a] standardized, contractual agreement outlining the rights and responsibilities a bank and a customer have toward each other.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the paragraph discussing the mandate begins by stating that Sky had \"secured\" financing from international institutions to construct several projects, the reference to an IADB \"mandate\" to construct the project in Chile could plausibly be read to state that Sky had secured funds to build that project. Furthermore, because the determination of this issue may involve analyzing competing definitions of an ambiguous term through the examination of extrinsic evidence, it is inappropriate to rule on this aspect of Plaintiffs' claim at this stage and the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss on the merits as to this statement, although Securities Act claims based upon this statement will be dismissed as being brought outside the relevant repose period, as later explained. Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted with respect to the other alleged misrepresentations made in connection with Sky's activity in Chile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Statements About Sky's Geographic Reach and Projects\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Sky also made several misrepresentations in the Prospectus about its \"broad geographic reach and established presence across key solar markets\" as well as about the state of its \"established pipeline projects.\" (See Prospectus at 100.) Plaintiffs contend that Sky was actually scaling back its presence in or divesting from operations in several of the countries in which it operated. Defendants assert that these statements amount to immaterial puffery, characterizing\n   them as vague statements upon which no reasonable investor would rely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717182\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/187/#p206\">\n    553 F.3d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees that no reasonable investor would read statements about Sky's purportedly global presence as describing a certain minimum presence in a threshold number of countries, and in fact, despite Sky's allegedly reduced operations, Plaintiffs do not allege that Sky's operations became strictly local to one geographic area. Furthermore, the true scope of Sky's operations, projects under construction, and pipeline projects, was disclosed within the Prospectus, including a depiction on a world map. Sky's statements about the scope of its operations are thus immaterial and, because the information on which they were based was disclosed, these statements would not alter the mix of information already available to a reasonable investor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benzon v.

Plaintiffs allege that, in fact, Sky had limited access to financing, raising over $75 million less than originally anticipated from the IPO (SAC \u00b6 225) and only being able to obtain financing from vendors selling inferior solar equipment and from Japanese \"silent partners\" on \"distressed terms.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   These statements are not actionable, however, because they constituted forward-looking statements accompanied by appropriate cautionary language, and/or were puffery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   To the extent these statements described Sky's future ability and intentions to use financing in the future, they were forward-looking statements conveying predications about Sky's ability to secure financing. The Prospectus generally disclosed the status of Sky's financing sources, including reduced projections of IPO revenues and related plans for allocation of those revenues, and disclosed that Sky's ability to build its projects was contingent on its ability to secure financing, stating that financing could not be guaranteed and was subject to numerous uncertainties including the confidence of the market and banks in Sky and the relevant political, financial, and regulatory climate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Sky's cautionary language was \"boiler-plate\" and did not contain warnings that were specific enough so as to be meaningful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Slayton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053525\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/758/#p768\">\n    604 F.3d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"To avail themselves of safe harbor protection under the meaningful cautionary language prong, defendants must demonstrate that their cautionary language was not boilerplate and\n   conveyed substantive information.\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053525\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/604/758/#p768\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Conference Report at 43, 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 742).

It was specific to risks affecting access to financing, and enumerated such relevant risks. Plaintiffs' argument that Sky's failure to change these warnings between the third draft of the Prospectus and the final version notwithstanding the drop in projected IPO revenues renders the warnings boilerplate is without merit. Although the amount Sky forecasted it would raise from the IPO did change during that period, Sky changed the relevant financial figures in the disclosure and Plaintiffs proffer no facts that would plausibly support an inference that the risks Sky faced with respect to access to loans from third parties changed between drafts. The cautionary language was also closely tied to the risks that caused Plaintiffs' loss, namely that lenders would lose confidence in Sky and that the political, regulatory, and market environment for solar power had deteriorated, resulting in Sky's diminished ability to raise funds to develop more solar projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   To the extent some of these statements can be construed as statements of existing conditions, Plaintiffs have not alleged plausibly that they were false or misleading. Plaintiffs concede that Sky had some access to financing under certain circumstances, which, when coupled with the aforementioned disclosure of risk that it might not be able to obtain additional financing, is consistent with Sky's circumstances as described by Plaintiffs. Thus, at most, Sky's vague and optimistic statements about its present financing relationships were puffery upon which no reasonable investor would rely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims based on allegations that Sky misrepresented its ability to secure financing will, therefore, be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   h.\n   <em>\n    Statements Regarding Sky's Ability to Expand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Prospectus misrepresented Sky's ability to expand its assets and operations. Specifically, Sky stated in the Prospectus that it was developing certain projects around the world, including several that were shovel-ready, which Sky expected to be ready for funding in 12 to 18 months, and that certain projects could begin construction upon the receipt of administrative permits. Plaintiffs contend that these statements, which implied that several projects would be built within a relatively short time frame, were misleading because Sky failed to adjust its project development forecast based on the vastly reduced proceeds from the IPO, thus supporting an inference that Sky no longer had the ability to expand such assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Sky's statements made in connection with its ability to develop its shovel-ready and pipeline projects constituted forward-looking statements tempered by appropriate cautionary language. Although Sky did not alter its projections for the development of its shovel-ready and pipeline projects, Sky did accurately reduce its allocations\n   for the funds it expected to raise through the IPO amongst its broad spending categories. The fact that the final IPO resulted in a reduced amount of cash on hand for investments supports the simple inference that Sky intended to accomplish the same development goals by increasing its reliance on loans and on financing from other sources. The Prospectus described Sky's ability to secure financing as an uncertainty that could affect its ability to grow. The risk that Sky would not secure adequate financing was, in turn, disclosed in the Prospectus, as discussed above in connection with Sky's access to financing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiffs also proffer a variation of this argument, positing that Sky misrepresented the status of some of its projects in Japan by labeling them shovel-ready and stating that Sky had commenced the process of obtaining certain non-discretionary permits, which allegedly implied that financing was in place because, as stated in a footnote in the Prospectus, Sky \"normally submit[s] certain administrative notifications at the time [Sky] receive[s] funding.\" (Prospectus at 109.) The cited statements do not, however, imply that financing was secured, because the same paragraph goes on to state that Sky intends to apply for any additional required permits for the Japanese projects upon the receipt of funding. As previously discussed, Sky included meaningful cautionary language identifying the specific risks that could imperil its ability to secure financing and, thus, its ability to expand its project roster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claim based on its contention that Defendants misrepresented Sky's ability to expand its operations will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Sky's Disclosure of its Reasons for Shifting to an IPP Business Model\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Sky's statement in its Prospectus that the IPP model would generate a more \"stable and recurring long-term cash flow\" concealed Sky's true rationale for moving from a model in which it developed and sold solar projects to an IPP model, and that the omission of the alleged true rationale was material. Plaintiffs contend that Sky was only able to build projects with inferior solar modules because these vendors were the only parties willing to extend financing to Sky, thus diminishing the appeal of Sky's solar projects to potential project buyers. Defendants argue that, even if Plaintiffs' contention as to Sky's motivation were true, disclosing Sky's decision to turn away from a failing business model in favor of another model would not add material information. Indeed, Plaintiffs have not alleged, and the Court finds no basis upon which to draw a reasonable inference, that disclosure of Sky's alleged reasoning for abandoning its previous model based on the sale of projects would have significantly altered the total mix of relevant information available to an investor who was considering investing in Sky's new IPP model. Plaintiffs' Securities Act claims will therefore be dismissed with respect to Sky's statements related to its reasons for switching to an IPP model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   j.\n   <em>\n    Other Alleged Misrepresentations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Sky's disclosure that it was subject to lawsuits and other hostile conduct was misleading because it did not disclose that Plaintiffs' confidential witness also \"contend[ed] that he too was ... cheated by Su of his ownership interest in Sky Solar.\" (Comp. \u00b6 107.) The Prospectus, however, cannot be found false or misleading on this basis because the disclosure of the lawsuit and attendant conduct was given by way of example and was the same type of malfeasance that Plaintiffs' confidential witness alleges Su\n   committed. If anything, the Prospectus supports an inference that other suits against Sky were ongoing or at least possible. Plaintiffs' Securities Act claims based on this conduct will therefore be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that the Prospectus's characterization of Fu as an independent, rather than a related, third party in connection with the SSD transaction was materially misleading. Plaintiffs further allege that, contrary to the representation in the Prospectus that this transaction was undertaken to \"reduce [Sky's] net liabilities and focus its resources and working capital on geographic areas,\" it was actually undertaken to defraud creditors according to the confidential witness. (SAC \u00b6 100.) Plaintiffs have offered only a conclusory recitation of the belief of their confidential witness that the purpose of the transaction was to defraud creditors, without specifying any basis for that belief whatsoever. Accordingly, the SAC does not contain sufficient allegations that the purpose of the transaction stated in the Prospectus was false and, without allegations showing that the transaction was undertaken for a fraudulent purpose, provides insufficient information to support an inference that the alleged misrepresentations would be material to an investor. Plaintiffs' Securities Act claim based on this disclosure will also, therefore, be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiffs contend that the allegedly improper nature of the transaction as well as Su and Wang's presumed knowledge of the process based on their corporate positions implies that they\n   knew that the reviews conducted after the 2014 and 2015 statements would not be \"rigorous.\" Characterizing the related-party transaction review as \"rigorous\" or \"strong,\" however, amounts to non-actionable puffery; it is unreasonable to infer that an investor who was informed that the Chinese transactions would be subjected to board approval would have found the addition of these adjectives material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The 2017 related-party transactions were not, however, subjected to prior review, rigorous or otherwise.

Plaintiffs\n   assert that Wang knew the approval process was \"severely lax and deficient\" because it enabled Su to engage in the 2016 management fee transaction and to cause Sky to enter into transactions, without board approval, worth $15 million with entities affiliated with him in April of 2017. (SAC \u00b6 289.) Wang's statements on the conference call predated both the allegedly improper 2016 transaction and the April 2017 transactions. Because only Su is alleged to have profited from these transactions, Plaintiff has pleaded no facts that plausibly support an inference as to an improper motive on the part of Wang in making the challenged statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Tr. of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717182\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/187/#p206\">\n    553 F.3d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The SAC also fails to allege sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding that Wang was reckless or engaged in conscious misbehavior in making these statements. Plaintiffs contend that Wang's duties as CFO, including compliance functions, and his position on Sky's board, which approved the 2016 transaction, demonstrates that he knew or should have known that Sky's internal control procedures were deficient when he stated on a conference call in 2015 that the potential Chinese transactions would be subjected to Sky's approval process. Defendants contend that the more likely explanation for Wang's actions was that he was aware of the prior weaknesses in the related-party approval process, but expected Sky to adhere to the new procedures in its expansion into the Chinese market. Defendants assert that Sky's board's decision to approve the 2016 transaction was unwise, but otherwise compliant with the prescribed process and note that, when Sky became aware of the true nature of the 2016 transaction and the existence of the 2017 transactions, it removed Su from his executive positions and disclosed the transactions. There is no allegation that Wang had advance knowledge of the 2017 transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs have therefore failed to offer a sufficiently cogent basis for an inference of scienter on Wang's part. Plaintiffs' theory that Wang offered assurance that the approval process would be followed when he in fact believed that it would not be followed is implausible in light of Plaintiffs' failure to allege any facts suggesting that Wang knew that Su would engage in transactions by circumventing the approval process and that the board would approve a questionable 2016 related-party transaction benefitting Su at the expense of Sky, without any personal benefit accruing to Wang. The more likely inference is offered by Defendants, that Wang offered these assurances because he was not aware that Su wished to circumvent the approval process\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or engage in transactions detrimental to Sky for Su's own benefit. Nor have Plaintiffs alleged any facts sufficient to demonstrate that Wang's behavior was so unreasonable or deviated so significantly from the applicable standard of care as to constitute recklessness. Plaintiffs only allege that Wang knew or should have known about these deficiencies based on his position as CFO and director and knowledge of Su's conduct prior to the imposition of controls, which does not support an inference that Wang had access to any information that would have alerted him that the board would eventually approve a potentially unwise transaction and certainly does not support an inference that he could have known that Su would\n   circumvent the approval process entirely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Novak v.

The approximately two years between the statement and 2017 transactions and the fact that the 2016 transaction was put before the board further undermine the plausibility of any inference that Su intended to circumvent the approval procedures at the time the statements were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   To the extent that Plaintiffs assert that Su's scienter can be inferred from his motive and opportunity, this argument also fails. Given the extended time that elapsed between the misstatements and the 2017 transactions and the fact that he did submit the 2016 transaction to the board for approval, the more cogent theory is that Su intended to comply with approval requirements when the alleged misrepresentations were made, but later changed his mind or took advantage of an emerging opportunity to circumvent the applicable procedures. Plaintiffs have thus failed to allege plausibly a basis for inferring scienter on the part of Sky. Therefore the Exchange Act claims against Sky will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Accordingly, all of Plaintiffs' claims pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act will be dismissed as against the Moving Defendants. Finding no primary violation, the Court also dismisses the control person claim pursuant to Section 20 of the Exchange Act against Wang.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acticon AG v.
