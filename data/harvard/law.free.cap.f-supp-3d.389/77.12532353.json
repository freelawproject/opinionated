The plaintiff alleges that during her employment, the Office of the Attorney General discriminated against her based on her sex [ ], and retaliated against her because she opposed [the] District['s] ... discriminatory employment practices\" in a number of ways. <em>Id.</em> \u00b6 10. She claims that (1) \"a male co-worker, who had communication and performance issues with customers, was not disciplined, while [she] ... was disciplined because she had filed a [prior] charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC\" in August 2010, <em>id.</em>; (2) the District allegedly \"permitt[ed] male employees to transfer to other departments ...

Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that (1) a male co-worker who \"had weekly communication problems and performance issues with customers\" was not disciplined, but when she had a \"single incident with a customer,\" she \"was suspended for [four] days\"; (2) this same male co-worker was granted a transfer to another department, while the plaintiff was \"denied [a] transfer in the past\"; and (3) her \"caseload was taken from [her] and [she] was reassigned to another unit without being given proper training.\" <em>Id.</em>, Ex. 6 (Charge of Discrimination No. 570-2011-00598) at 1.</p><p id=\"p-12\">On November 20, 2014, the plaintiff initiated this civil action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Complaint at 1.

The plaintiff disputes the District's contention that \"[t]here is also no evidence that [the] [p]laintiff suffered a loss in pay,\" Def.'s Mem. at 13; <em>see</em> Pl.'s Opp'n at 26, and argues that \"the evidence is clear\" that \"she has been harmed ... because she has been prevented from receiving a promotion as a Support Enforcement Specialist and will now be delayed in receiving a within grade increase,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 22, 26. However, she has neither produced nor cited a single piece of evidence supporting her positions. In fact, the record is completely devoid of evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that she suffered any harm, let alone any material adverse consequences that \"affect[ed] the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or future employment opportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could find objectively tangible harm.\" <em>Forkkio</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11441169,3700523\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/306/1127/\">306 F.3d at 1131</extracted-citation> (citations omitted).

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the District's denial of the plaintiff's transfer request does not constitute an adverse action either under Title VII's anti-discrimination or anti-retaliation provisions and therefore finds that the District is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiff's claim that she was subjected to discrimination and retaliation <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"94\" href=\"#p94\" id=\"p94\">*94</a>when the District denied her a transfer.</p><p id=\"p-36\"><strong>IV.

The Court further concludes that the plaintiff failed to establish that she suffered harm as a result of the District's alleged denial of a transfer.

However, on April 6, 2017, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's hostile work environment claim with prejudice \"because the allegation of other facts consistent with the [Second Amended Complaint] could not possibly cure the [failure to exhaust administrative remedies].\" <em>Chambers v.

Therefore, the Court need not address the plaintiff's hostile work environment claim because, as the District notes, \"th[is] claim is not part of this litigation.\" Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of the District of Columbia's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Def.'s Mem.\") at 9 n.4.</p><p id=\"p-42\">In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the District of Columbia's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Dispute (\"Def.'s Facts\"); (2) Plaintiff Mary Elizabeth Chambers'[s] Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant District of Columbia's Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\"); (3) Plaintiff Mary Elizabeth Chambers'[s] Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is a Genuine Dispute (\"Pl.'s Disputed Facts\"); (4) Plaintiff Mary Elizabeth Chambers'[s] Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Dispute (\"Pl.'s Undisputed Facts\"); (5) Defendant District of Columbia's Reply Memorandum (\"Def.'s Reply\"); and (6) the Defendant's Response to [the] Plaintiff's Statement of Material Facts as to Which There is No Genuine Issue (\"Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts\").</p><p id=\"p-44\">The District also argues that \"[the] [p]laintiff has no factual support for her [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1981(a) claim.\" Def.'s Mot. at 1. However, although the Court previously misconstrued the plaintiff's Amended Complaint as alleging a violation of subsection (a) of \u00a7 1981 due to an oversight, <em>see</em> <em>Chambers I</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274142\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/249/66/#p72\">249 F.

Supp. 3d at 114</extracted-citation>. The Court is troubled by counsel's less than ideal pattern of behavior. Earlier this year, the Court directed that \"the plaintiff's counsel show cause to the Court as to why the Court should not hold him in contempt for allegedly making false representations to the Court,\" Order at 2 (Jan. 9, 2019), ECF No. 57, after the plaintiff's counsel, in his request for an extension of time to respond to the District's motion for summary judgment, represented that he had \"conferred with [the] [ ] District ... and [that the] [ ] District ... stated that it d[id] not have any objections to [the] [p]laintiff['s] ... request,\" Motion to Extend Plaintiff Mary E[l]izabeth Chambers' Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment Until January 19, 2019 at 2, when, in fact, he did \"not reach out to [the District's counsel] ... prior to filing\" the request for an extension and the District \"did not provide consent to [the] [p]laintiff's request,\" Response to Plaintiff's Consent Motion to Extend Deadline to File Her Opposition to Defendant'[s] Motion for Summary Judgment at 2. Although the Court is sympathetic to the plaintiff's counsel's medical circumstances, it remains apprehensive about the explanation offered by the plaintiff's counsel in response to the Court's show cause Order, particularly in light of the exhibit that the plaintiff's counsel submits purportedly justifying his alleged misrepresentations to the Court. Nevertheless, because these alleged misrepresentations can be attributed to a misunderstanding, the Court will discharge the plaintiff's counsel's obligations pursuant to the Court's prior show cause Order.</p><p id=\"p-46\">The plaintiff's opposition is replete with unsupported conclusory statements. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Pl.'s Opp'n at 21 (claiming that she \"has made out a prima facie case of sex (female) discrimination\" because she \"has shown that she is a female, that she [ ] requested and was qualified for a transfer[, and was] treated different[ly] tha[n] her m[a]le co-workers\"); <em>id.</em> at 22 (declaring that the plaintiff not only has \"presented a prima facie case of employment discrimination based on sex (female), ... and retaliation,\" which, as she claims, defeats the District's motion for summary judgment, but also has presented \"evidence of pretext [that] is sufficient to obtain judgment [in favor of her]\"); <em>id.</em> at 28-29 (same); <em>id.</em> at 22 (stating that she \"has established a prima facie case of retaliation because she participated in protected activity by filing complaints of discrimination with the EEOC and [the] District ... knew and was provided with the charges of employment discrimination\"); <em>id.</em> at 28 (same); <em>id.</em> at 24 (reiterating that she \"can prove a prima facie case of employment discrimination based on sex (female) and retaliation for her opposition to [the] District['s] ... discriminatory employment practices and her participation in the filing of a charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC against [the] District\"); <em>id.</em> at 25 (maintaining that she \"has made [a] prima facie showing of discrimination based on [sex] (female)\" because she can establish that \"(a) she is a female; (b) she was qualified for [a] transfer; (c) [the] District ... had openings in various units and allowed male employees to transfer to those units; (d) [the] District ... refused to allow [the] [p]laintiff ... to transfer to those units; (e) took an adverse action against her based on her sex by continuing to refuse her requests for transfers; and (f) [the] District ... continued to transfer its male employees to other units even when they did not request a transfer\").</p><p id=\"p-47\">The Court notes that the plaintiff, in support of her opposition to the District's summary judgment motion, submits a twenty-page affidavit in addition to a number of depositions. However, her proffered affidavit does not raise any genuine issue as to any material fact that defeats the District's motion for summary judgment because it either addresses claims that are not alleged in the Second Amended Complaint, <em>see, e.g.</em>, Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex. A (Affidavit of Mary Elizabeth Chambers (\"Chambers Aff.\")) \u00b6 11 (\"I have been threatened by two co-workers.\"); <em>id.</em>, Ex.

A (Chambers Aff.) \u00b6 58 (\"[The] District ... did not have a non-discriminatory reason for recommending my suspension because the allegations against me were false and fabricated.

This evidence along with the evidence regarding the discriminatory treatment I have receive would indeed be more than enough for a reasonable jury to believe that CSSD did assign me more cases than my co-workers.\"), or, similar to her opposition, contains \"conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data,\" <em>see, e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, Ex.

However, the plaintiff, in her Second Amended Complaint, does not allege that she was discriminated against on this basis.

However, nowhere in her Second Amended Complaint does the plaintiff allege that the District denied her an audit of her time and attendance sheets or an opportunity to receive donated time. <em>See generally</em> 2d Am.
