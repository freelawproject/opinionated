In its preliminary findings, the Department determined that: (1) the Export Buyer's Credit Program was countervailable based on an adverse inference that Guizhou used and benefited from the program, PDM at 14-17; (2) the Processing Trade Program was countervailable because the GOC failed to demonstrate that it had a system or procedure in place to determine the quantity of natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, and nylon cord Guizhou consumed in the production of OTR tires,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (3) there was \"no basis to find the domestic synthetic rubber market to be distorted,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (4) benchmarks for synthetic rubber, natural rubber, carbon black, and nylon cord inputs appropriately included actual ocean freight and import duty costs,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 33-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Commerce continued to find that the market for synthetic rubber was not distorted during the period of review. I &amp; D Mem. at 10-12. Commerce also employed both Tier 1 and Tier 2 benchmarks in relation to certain less-than-adequate remuneration (\"LTAR\") findings for synthetic and natural rubber (Tier 1), carbon black (Tier 2), and nylon cord (Tier 2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 12-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These benchmarks included ocean freight and import duties. Additionally, Commerce applied an adverse inference to find that Guizhou used and benefited from the Export Buyer's Credit Program and concluded that \"the record does not support finding non-use of the [Program].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Commerce concluded that Guizhou received a countervailable subsidy from\n   the Processing Trade Program because \"the record [did] not support a finding that the GOC has an effective system in place to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production of exported products and in what amounts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2046%2C754\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the\n   <em>\n    Amended Final Results\n   </em>\n   , Commerce assigned Guizhou a countervailable subsidy rate of 31.48%.\n   <em>\n    Amended\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   , 83 Fed.

Commerce's finding that \"the record does not support [ ] non-use,\" I &amp; D Mem. at 14, is itself unsupported by substantial evidence because the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence on the record supports non-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 55, ex.

Further, because Commerce failed to explain\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   information the GOC has failed to provide and\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   that information was required for verification of the respondent's claims and declarations demonstrating non-use of the Export Program, Commerce's finding that the GOC did not provide information necessary to develop a complete understanding of the program was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its review, Commerce examined whether Plaintiffs potentially benefited from the PRC's Export Program, which provides loans to foreign companies to promote the export of Chinese goods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Reviews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2078%2C778\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 78,778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Dep't Commerce Nov. 9, 2016) (initiation). Commerce issued several questionnaires to the respondents seeking information regarding the Export Program, and both Guizhou and the GOC responded that none of Guizhou's customers used the Program. Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 54-55; GOC Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 139-140. Guizhou also submitted affidavits from its United States customers confirming non-use as exhibits to the initial questionnaire responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 54, ex. I38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2078%2C778\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2078%2C778\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ex. I39. In a subsequent questionnaire response concerning the operation of the Export Program, the GOC responded that the \"question [was] not applicable\" because \"none of the U.S. customers of the respondents used the Expert Buyer's Credit from [Export-Import] Bank during the [period of review].\" GOC First Supp. Resp. at 10-11. Nonetheless, Commerce determined in its preliminary results that the GOC both withheld requested information and significantly impeded the proceeding such that the Department applied an AFA rate for each respondent based on Plaintiffs' alleged benefit from the Export Program. PDM at 15-16 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , 19 U.S.C. 1677e(a)(2)(A), (C) ). In its\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   , Commerce continued to apply the AFA because it was \"without a complete and verifiable understanding of the program's operation.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Commerce may select from facts otherwise available when necessary information is not available in the record or when a party to a proceeding: (A) withholds information that is requested; (B) fails to provide such information in the form and manner requested; (C) significantly impedes a proceeding; or (D) provides information which cannot be verified. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a). Once it has identified a basis under \u00a7 1677e(a), the Department may then select from facts available in a matter adverse to the respondent-that is, apply AFA-only if the gap in the record was caused by a failure of a respondent to cooperate to the best of its ability. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b). Therefore, before Commerce can apply AFA, it must first determine under \u00a7 1677e(a) that information is missing from the record\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that the gap was caused by a respondent's failure to cooperate. Once again, Commerce missed the mark and applied AFA to the Export Program without first establishing the statutory prerequisites of such a determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, upon requests from Commerce, Guizhou indicated it did not benefit from\n   the Program and provided declarations from its U.S. customers stating as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp., at 54, ex. I38. The GOC also informed Commerce that it \"contacted the responding companies to ask for their customer lists\" and the GOC confirmed that \"no listed importers of the respondent companies obtained any Export Buyers Credits from [the Export-Import Bank],\" indicating that the importers did not use the Program. GOC Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 140. Additionally, in its supplemental questionnaire responses, the GOC further confirmed that Plaintiffs received no benefit from the program. GOC First Supplemental Resp. at 11. Despite this, Commerce sought information on the operation of the Export Program-a program which all record evidence indicated Plaintiffs did not use. Based upon the GOC's non-compliance with this final, unrelated request, Commerce applied AFA. Because the findings underlying Commerce's application of AFA are unsupported by substantial evidence, the court cannot sustain the ultimate AFA determination.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co. v.

Cir. 2016). Instead, Commerce concluded that \"the record does not support finding non-use of the [Program] by Guizhou Tyre.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 14. In so doing, however, the Department blatantly ignored the eighty-five U.S. customer declarations that were submitted as exhibits to Guizhou's questionnaire responses, each of which stated that the customers \"did not finance [their] purchases through either the use of the ... export buyer's credit program or any other Chinese banks' export buyer's credit program.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 55, ex. I39. The Department contends that the \"GOC has not provided the requested information and documentation necessary for Commerce to develop a complete understanding of this program\" and therefore, \"absent [this] information, the GOC's claims that the respondent companies did not use this program are not verifiable.\" I &amp; D Mem. at 14. But more than just uncorroborated claims, Guizhou stated that it, first, \"confirmed non-usage\" by \"contact[ing] all of its export customers and confirm[ing] that none of them applied for, used, or benefited from this program during the POR,\" and second, by \"contact[ing] all of its unaffiliated export customers in the United States in 2015 and inquir[ing] whether the companies used the export buyer's credit program or otherwise received credit facilities from EXIM.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guizhou Initial Questionnaire Resp. at 55. The corresponding U.S. declarations then\n   <em>\n    affirmed\n   </em>\n   those claims made by Guizhou.

The Department had the tools at its disposal to substantiate the accuracy of the declarations-and it had to try to do so before claiming that the record evidence is unverifiable. Second, it is unclear how or why the information about the program's operations are even necessary to verify Guizhou's claims of non-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Changzhou Trina Solar Energy Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528903\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/352/1316/#p1327\">\n    352 F.

Calculation of LTAR Benchmarks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs raise several challenges to the Department's calculation of benchmarks measuring whether adequate remuneration was paid for synthetic rubber, natural rubber, carbon black, and nylon cord. First, Guizhou argues that the Department failed to use the proper benchmark to determine the extent of the subsidy received by Guizhou with regard to synthetic rubber. Specifically, Guizhou urges the court to compel Commerce to further provide an explanation for its change in position from its 2014 Administrative Review on market distortion for synthetic rubber. Second, Guizhou argues that Commerce's failure to adjust the input benchmarks to reflect market conditions-including domestic production of the inputs-was not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

But because that ratio would include Guizhou's domestic purchases-\n   <em>\n    which were found to be an inappropriate comparative for benchmarking\n   </em>\n   -their inclusion would distort the benchmark analysis. This same analysis was echoed in the Department's\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   : in light of the AFA finding that the domestic producers of the inputs\n   are authorities, Commerce only used import prices (for synthetic rubber, for example), to calculate a Tier 1 benchmark, and not its domestic prices.

First, Guizhou argues that it submitted detailed records as to unit consumption of raw materials, receipt of raw materials under the program, re-export of goods produced from those raw materials, and any entry of such materials into the domestic market. Pls.' Br. at 34. According to Guizhou, the Department ignored these submissions during its review when it countervailed duty exemptions on the premise that the Program failed to satisfy the requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(i). Second, Guizhou argues in the alternative that the submitted records can also demonstrate that the GOC has \"carried out an examination of actual inputs involved to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production of the exported product, and in what amounts,\" pursuant to section 351.519(a)(4)(ii).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As before, when prompted to explain how the GOC determined the quantity of the materials consumed in the production process, the GOC first referred Commerce to the Customs Measure, attached as Exhibit E.7 to its questionnaire response.

As to Guizhou specifically, the GOC referred Commerce to \"Guizhou Tire's response for a more comprehensive response and for sample documentation supporting its explanation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.519\">\n    at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
