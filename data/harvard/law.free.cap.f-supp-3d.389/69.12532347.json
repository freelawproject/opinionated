COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In January 1997, Wilbur Hiligh was seriously injured while working at a Federal\n   Express facility in Washington, D.C. He retained a law firm, Duncan and Hopkins, P.C., to represent him in seeking remedy. In 2000, the firm filed a civil suit on his behalf but dismissed it after realizing it had sued the wrong defendants. Nearly two decades later, Hiligh has sued the firm and several of its attorneys, alleging malpractice. One Defendant, William S. Sands, Jr., moves for summary judgment, contending he was not Hiligh's lawyer at the time and thus could not have committed malpractice. The firm itself, along with one of its named partners, John C. Duncan, III, moves to dismiss the case or, in the alternative, asks for summary judgment, insisting that the three-year statute of limitations for Hiligh's legal malpractice claim elapsed long ago. Because Sands did not have an attorney-client relationship with Hiligh during the alleged malpractice, the Court will grant his motion. However, the Court will deny the other Defendants' motion because the statute of limitations was tolled while the firm continuously represented Hiligh through 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Rather, they insist that, whatever occurred in 2000, the statute of limitations for Hiligh's claim has long since passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   District of Columbia law provides a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2012-301\">\n    D.C.

This exception is key to Hiligh's case.

The continuous-representation rule is designed to achieve two goals.

Application of the continuous-representation rule here serves its principal purpose of freeing Hiligh from that dilemma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court, of course, expresses no view on whether Duncan and Hopkins actually breached a duty of care to Hiligh.

But at this early stage of litigation, accepting as true the facts in that Complaint and without the benefit of any written agreements between the parties, the Court concludes that Hiligh has plausibly alleged that Duncan and Hopkins's continued work on his behalf sufficed to toll his cause of action until 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The Court understands this argument to reflect a separate basis for tolling the statute of limitations. But to the extent that Hiligh believes it constitutes a separate allegation of malpractice, it does not suffice to state a claim against Sands. As explained, Sands played no role in the civil case and Hiligh does not suggest that Sands represented him until years later. While Hiligh contends that attorneys have a duty to alert a client of a potential malpractice claim against them, he provides no authority to suggest that an attorney has a duty to advise clients of potential malpractice by\n    <em>\n     another\n    </em>\n    attorney especially where, as here, there is no indication that the attorney knew of it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Hiligh all but concedes that he has not alleged a claim against Sands, insisting instead that \"[i]t is simply too early for defendant Sands to seek dismissal,\" because Hiligh \"has the right to obtain insurance coverage information\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.
