In managing the trees, leadership at the Lake was sensitive to the need to balance natural habitat and aesthetic with the safety of the public. I was empowered by leadership to remove hazardous and fallen trees, especially those which impacted campsites.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Second, \"Lake Mendocino does not have standard inspection lists,\" and Mr. Shull relies on his \"personal knowledge in [his] inspections.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Third, special training is required to remove hazardous trees safely, and only two United States Corps of Engineers staff members - Mr. Shull and John Dane - handled removal of hazardous trees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Mr. Shull was unsure about a tree, he asked Mr. Dane to provide his opinion, and if other staff members \"notice[d] a tree,\" they told Mr. Shull or Mr. Dane.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fourth, \"there is no requirement to document tree maintenance,\" and he \"did not personally document [his] maintenance activities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fifth, for the past nine years, Mr. Shull has \"conducted foot patrols at Lake Mendocino\" and \"would inspect trees visually for potentially hazardous conditions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A Project Staff member would patrol every recreation area every day, including Kyen campground. During these daily foot patrols, I personally spent time looking for trees with noticeable defects such as dead spots, lack of foliage, cankers, fungi or with a large amount of dead branches. If I spotted a tree that concerned me, I would usually take a closer look at the tree. If the tree posed an immediate threat, I would remove the tree that same day or first thing the following morning. If the tree was not\n   an immediate threat, I would make a mental note of the tree and return when I had time to remove it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.3 Tree-Inspection Practices - Christopher Schooley's Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Christopher Schooley, the current Area Operations Manager for Lake Mendocino and Lake Sonoma, and the supervisory park ranger at the time of the accident, explained tree maintenance at Lake Mendocino as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   (At the time of the accident, he handled day-to-day management at the Lake, including ranger staffing, and he worked with park ranger Wayne Shull and maintenance worker John Dane to coordinate tree-maintenance activities such as scheduling hazardous tree removals, ensuring that they had the resources and training for the task, and scheduling the removals during non-peak recreation seasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   7. The Corps manages and operates Lake Mendocino in accordance with its Operational Management Plan (\"OMP\"), attached as Exhibit A. The 2013 OMP does not specify mandatory requirements for the Corps and its employees as they inspect and maintain trees at Lake Mendocino. Instead, they provide guidance on how to balance competing policy considerations that impact tree management decisions, including: public safety, employee safety, ecology, wildlife preservation, staffing and budgetary constraints, and park aesthetics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   8. The OMP is a \"continuing and dynamic document\" that \"guides use, development, and management of the natural and man-made resources\" in the region.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   9. Regarding natural resources management, the OMP lays out several long term policy objectives that include safety, health, and preserving \"a diversity of ecological communities.\" The \"objectives are to improve or enhance or restore or rehabilitate vegetation and other environmental conditions, including existing structures and features, for wildlife, fisheries, recreation, aesthetics, woodland, and grassland to promote compatible multiple uses in the park.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   10. The OMP states that the goal of the Lake Mendocino recreation program is to \"provide quality recreational experiences to a wide spectrum of the public, while ensuring maximum sustained use of park resources consistent with their carrying capacity and aesthetic and biological values.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   11. Consistent with Lake Mendocino's safety goals, the OMP says staff will maintain \"an active tree pruning program ... to insure that all dead trees, limbs, and 'snags' are removed before they present a hazard to the public.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   12. The OMP does not set a particular schedule or procedures for hazard tree mitigation, other than to avoid cutting trees during peak season whenever possible because it is \"esthetically undesirable and conflicts with recreational usage.\" The OMP also set a goal of removing 40 hazard trees a year from fiscal years 2013-2017, without specifying locations or other guidelines for removal. Ultimately, the document gives significant discretion to park staff regarding hazard tree mitigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   13. The OMP identifies several policy considerations related to tree management.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   For example, when conducting maintenance operations, \"it is extremely important to minimize negative impact on trees because \"a mature tree, if destroyed, will leave a void that will take years to replace.\" And staff can consider saving \"older trees with unsound limbs and trunks\" if they provide shelter for animals, except when it presents a safety hazard at recreation sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mr. Schooley addressed certain engineering manuals and the American National Standards Institute standards for tree maintenance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   14. The Corps does not have written policies mandating certain standards for tree maintenance at Lake Mendocino. Prior to this litigation, I was not intimately aware of the American National Standards Institute (\"ANSI\") standards and had never personally read them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   15. Engineering Manual 385-1-1 \"Safety and Health Requirements,\" attached as Exhibit B, prescribes occupational safety standards for Army Corps of Engineers employees. It does not set standards for ensuring visitor safety. Accordingly, Section 31 \"Tree Maintenance and Removal\" requires employees to follow certain safety standards to protect themselves when performing tree maintenance, like wearing protective gear, examining for electrical hazards, and clearing the fall area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   16. I understand that Section 31 references several standards for worker safety while felling and pruning trees, including \"ANSI Z133, American National Standard for Arboricultural Operations\" and \"ANSI A300, American National Standard for Tree Care Operations - Tree, Shrub, and other Woody Plant Management - Standard Practices,\" and \"ANSI/SIA A92.2, American National Standard for Vehicle-Mounted Elevating and Rotating Aerial Devices.\" However, there is no requirement for the Corps to build a tree maintenance program utilizing these ANSI standards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   17. Engineering Manual 1110-1-400, attached as Exhibit C, primarily governs the design of new facilities and major rehabilitation of existing facilities. It does not prescribe standards for ongoing, day-to-day maintenance. The manual requires a Project Design Team to generally follow ANSI guidelines \"throughout the designation of recreation areas or facilities.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   18. As part of the litigation, I have been made aware of ANSI A300 (Part 9), attached as Exhibit D. I understand that ANSI A300 (Part 9) suggests best practices for tree risk assessment, such as what to include in an assessment report and what tools to use. However, no regulation requires Lake Mendocino staff to follow ANSI A300 (Part 9)'s standards for identifying hazard trees. Regardless, ANSI A300 (Part 9) says that the entity conducting tree maintenance has ultimate discretion to \"select and implement the mitigation, schedule repeat or advanced assessments, and to schedule future monitoring and maintenance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Other Tree Assessment - Plaintiff's Expert Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To counter the government's declarations, the plaintiff submitted a declaration from Kent Julin, Ph.D., a certified arborist with 32 years of professional experience inaboriculture\n   and forestry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   He provides \"professional arborist and forester services throughout Northern California,\" has undergraduate and graduate degrees in Forestry, and is familiar with the industry standards for tree-risk assessment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   He examined photographs and videos taken of the tree cluster about one month after the accident and identified a \"large, central trunk cavity (significant structural defect) in the lower trunk are of the subject tree revealed by and clearly visible through two large openings - one 10\" diameter and the other 22\" diameter....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the proximity to nearby campsites and the condition of the tree, he \"would have recommended removal of the subject tree which is critical to minimize personal injury and property damage when hazard trees fail.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Julin offered the following opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   In my opinion, based upon scientific and expert professional judgment, I found clear evidence that the visual condition of the lower trunk of the subject tree demonstrated two large openings (one 22\" diameter, and the other 10\" diameter) in the lower trunk of the subject tree, that existed for at least 20 years prior to the accident. A level 2 inspection should have been done, and the hazard tree should have been removed to avoid impact upon campers and other occupants of the campsite. Had the ANSI A300 Standards for Tree Management been followed and implemented by the Kyen Rangers, the subject hazard tree would have been removed and the injury to Mr. Lam would not have occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   He disagreed with Mr. Shull's opinion that signs of rot in the center bole would not be visible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   He disagreed with Mr. Pool's opinion - that Armillaria mellea in oaks is difficult to diagnose because the fungus does not display distinct signs except internally - because the 10- to 22-inch holes revealed a significant visible tree hollow in the lower trunk, which in his opinion \"was obvious and should have been noticed by any of the rangers ... and existed on that tree cluster for more than 20 years, and would have been visible to any person inspecting the tree.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   He points out that the photograph attached to the Shull declaration shows the cavity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Julin disagreed with Mr. Schooley's conclusion that the Lake Mendocino 2013 Operational Management Plan did not specify mandatory requirements for the Army Corps regarding tree inspection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Julin said that the plan specified the following on \"its 'priority list' of tasks for 'Hazard Tree Removal': the time period to conduct the hazard tree removal, the cost of removal, the numbers of hazard trees removed, the number and type of staff involved, the equipment to be used[,] and the cost of removing trees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this argument, the plaintiff attaches the Operational Management Plan's five-year program setting the priority lists and task\n   descriptions for fiscal years 2013 to 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   He references Task 9 - Hazardous Tree Removal, with an initiation date of October 2013, a completion date of May 2015, a cost of $ 2,800, and a description requiring removal of approximately 40 hazard trees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Julin also disagreed with Mr. Schooley's conclusion that the Army Corps did not have written policies mandating standards for tree maintenance at Lake Mendocino and identified that the Corps' Engineering Manual 385-1-1, section 31, sets forth ANSI A309 practices, which include standard practices on tree-risk assessment to remove \"defective hazard trees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   To support this opinion, the plaintiff excerpts Section 31 of the Operational Management Plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   SECTION 31\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Tree Maintenance and Removal\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   31.A.1 General.
