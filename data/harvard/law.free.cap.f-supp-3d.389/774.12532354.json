The first moves to dismiss Counts 1-3, 5-7, and 9-10 based on a statute of limitations issue that arises out of the sealing of the Indictment for 3 months. (Doc. 40, \"SOL Motion\";\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 52 (sealed Opposition), Doc. 54 (\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   Habben Declaration), and Doc. 58 (Reply).) The second motion seeks dismissal of counts 9-10 of the Indictment, arguing that the Travel Act charges are not properly supported by the state-law predicate alleged in the Indictment. (Doc. 43, \"Travel Act Motion\";\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 56 (Opposition) and Doc. 59 (Reply).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As set forth below, the Court DENIES both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Tiffany Rogers is an orthopedic surgeon who performed spinal surgeries and who was indicted as part of the Drobot/Pacific Hospital kickback conspiracy/fraud scheme. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1, Indictment.) Defendant is alleged to have received kickbacks in exchange for referrals of patients needing spinal surgeries and other procedures. (Indictment \u00b6 16(a)-(k).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Indictment alleges Defendant is associated with kickbacks totaling $35,000. (\u00b6 18.) The payments were allegedly disguised as payments pursuant to a bogus contract entered into for the purposes of concealing the kickback payments. (\u00b6 16(h)-(j).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these allegations, Defendant is charged with conspiracy, mail and wire fraud involving deprivation of honest services, and violations of the Travel Act by the use of a facility of interstate commerce in aid of an unlawful activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy alleged in the Indictment range from June 21, 2012 through April 4, 2013. (Indictment at 5 &amp; 9-13.) The substantive offenses range from April 2, 2013 through July 3, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-19.) The Indictment was filed on March 21, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Indictment was sealed the same day it was filed. (Doc. 4.) In sealing the Indictment, the Magistrate Judge relied on the Government's Ex Parte Application to Seal (\"Application\"). (Doc. 3.) The Application purported to incorporate an \"attached declaration\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   of the prosecutor, but no declaration was attached. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Indictment remained sealed until June 21, 2018, when the Magistrate Judge unsealed it at the request of the Government. (Docs. 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. SOL Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss Counts 1-3, 5-7, and 9-10 as untimely. The Government contends the statute of limitations was tolled from the time the Indictment was filed under seal to the time the seal was lifted, that is, from March 21, 2018 to June 27, 2018 (\"the seal period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statute of Limitations and Sealed Indictments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The limitations period as to all counts is five years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203282\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"Generally speaking, the return of an indictment tolls the statute of limitations with respect to the charges contained in the indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pacheco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9044957\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/912/297/#p305\">\n    912 F.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (9th Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). However, sealed indictments toll the limitations period from the date of the return of the indictment only if that indictment was sealed for \"legitimate prosecutorial objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416567\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1421/#p1426\">\n    67 F.3d 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1426 (9th Cir. 1995). Otherwise, the tolling period begins with the indictment's unsealing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this case, if the Indictment was sealed and maintained under seal for legitimate prosecutorial objectives, then no count is barred by the statute of limitations. However, if the Indictment was not maintained under seal for any legitimate prosecutorial objective, or if its unsealing was unreasonably delayed, then only Counts 4 and 8 are timely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Legitimate Prosecutorial Objectives\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Where the limitations period expires on charges in an indictment under seal, the Government bears the burden of establishing its sealing serves legitimate prosecutorial objectives.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Srulowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710176\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/37/#p41\">\n    819 F.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (2d Cir. 1987) (explaining that \"the government, if challenged, must demonstrate legitimate prosecutorial purposes for the secrecy of the indictment\"). The Government contends that legitimate prosecutorial objectives in this case tolled the statute of limitations during the seal period. Specifically, the Government describes an ongoing criminal investigation and the ongoing involvement of cooperating witnesses, including covert activity by those witnesses. These reasons were not proffered by the Government when it sought the Magistrate Judge's Order to seal the Indictment, and although the Government referred to a declaration intended to be offered in support of the seal application, the declaration was (presumably inadvertently) omitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   However, as the Court held previously in a related case, the question of whether a sealed indictment tolls the limitations period is determined by a consideration of the record after a defendant challenges the sealing, which is necessarily after the seal is lifted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530547\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/370/1139/#p1143\">\n    370 F.Supp.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1143-46 (C.D. Cal. 2019). Therefore, the Court focuses on the current record to determine whether maintaining the Indictment under seal served legitimate prosecutorial objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the Government describes two related legitimate prosecutorial objectives that were served by the sealing of the Indictment. First, the Government presents\n   evidence that there was an ongoing criminal investigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 15-20; Habben Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9 &amp; Ex. B (describing the ongoing investigation, activities, and actual and anticipated results).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Government presents evidence that the ongoing investigation included continuing covert activity by cooperating witnesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23-25; Habben Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-19 &amp; Ex. C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant argues that the investigation into related charges against her or against alleged co-conspirators was not a legitimate basis to seal the existing charges against her. (SOL Mot. at 7-12.) Defendant argues that tolling the limitations period based on investigation of related charges gives the Government the ability to unfairly circumvent the limitations period to serve its own \"investigative convenience,\" to avoid triggering the Speedy Trial Act deadlines, and to otherwise deprive the accused of the benefit of the limitations period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Defendant relies upon cases holding that the limitations period is not tolled while the Government continues to investigate conduct not yet charged but that could lead to related charges against the accused.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gigante\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3289485\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/436/647/#p658\">\n    436 F. Supp. 2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 658 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (\"Whatever the legitimate prosecutorial purposes are that justify the sealing of an indictment, surely they do not include the need for additional time to decide whether to bring an additional charge.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stehl\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 12-995 ABC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012170491\">\n    2013 WL 12170491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2013) (citing\n   <em>\n    Gigante\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant argues that this authority, developed where the Government continued to investigate a defendant whose indictment was under seal, applies with even greater force to continued investigations into a defendant's alleged co-conspirators. (SOL Mot. at 8-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the Ninth Circuit, however, the investigation of related charges constitutes a legitimate prosecutorial objective justifying the sealing of an indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bracy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416567\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1421/#p1426\">\n    67 F.3d at 1426-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no abuse of discretion where district court relied on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"the ongoing nature of [the Government's] investigation into\" a related illegal organization to toll the limitations period of charges in a sealed indictment as to four individual defendants). Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Stehl\n   </em>\n   did not determine that an ongoing investigation could not provide the basis for maintaining an indictment under seal, but rather that the government had failed to offer any evidence as to why its ongoing investigation took as long as it did.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%2012170491\">\n    2013 WL 12170491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, the Government has provided evidence that sealing the Indictment promoted the legitimate prosecutorial interest in protecting the integrity of the evidence related to the investigation. The Government points out that unsealing the Indictment gives rise to the duty to disclose discovery that can include the statements of alleged co-conspirators and witnesses regarding the matters still under investigation. The case agent explains the danger associated with a witness's exposure to others' statements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habben Decl. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Likewise, facilitating the ongoing covert activity by cooperating witnesses described by the Government is a legitimate prosecutorial objective. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 23-25; Habben\n   Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-19.) As Agent Habben recounts, the more public the Pacific Hospital investigation became, the less effective the covert activity became. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 16-17 &amp; 19.) He also notes that the efficacy of covert activity experienced an uptick during the seal period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, as noted by the Court at the hearing, this case arises out of a much larger investigation involving many defendants who either engaged in or are alleged to have engaged in complicated financial transactions and contractual arrangements specifically designed to cover up illegal conduct. The participants in this scheme are alleged to have set up entire systems of deceit to cover up the primary deceit. The participants devised sophisticated means of distributing the illegal profits of their scheme and obscuring the illicit nature of the kickback payments. With this level of planning and sophistication on the part of the defendants, the Government's continued interest in limiting the release of information about the ongoing investigation was legitimate, and its continued caution was understandable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In sum, the Government has met its burden of establishing that sealing the Indictment served legitimate prosecutorial objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Effect of Delay After Unsealing of Indictments Charging Alleged Co-Conspirators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant argues that even if sealing the Indictment served a legitimate prosecutorial objective at the time it was sealed, that justification ended before the Indictment was unsealed. (SOL Mot. 22-25.) Defendant contends that the Government unreasonably delayed in seeking to unseal the Indictment, and this delay requires dismissal of the challenged counts of the Indictment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Once there is no longer a legitimate prosecutorial objective that is served by maintaining an indictment under seal, the Government must take steps to have it unsealed.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Benavides\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 06-62-M-DWM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010679152\">\n    2009 WL 10679152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (D.

(SOL Mot. at 22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court has already rejected the argument that the unsealing of Defendant Tantuwaya's indictment significantly weakened the justification for maintaining the indictments of other alleged co-conspirators under seal.\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530547\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/370/1139/#p1143\">\n    370 F.Supp.3d at 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nevertheless, the Government ... can choose to ... make some general representations regarding an ongoing investigation, or even to release some specific details thereof, without incurring the duty to make all the details public.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As to the May 18, 2018 unsealing of the indictment of Gross and Payne, the same rationale applies. The Government's decision to make additional charges public does not compel the same decision as to Defendant. The legal standard requires only that maintaining the Indictment under seal serves a legitimate prosecutorial objective. Moreover, as to Defendant Rogers, the record reflects a more specific reason for maintaining the Indictment under seal after other indictments were unsealed on May 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habben Decl. Ex. A (\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ) (entries from June 2018).) In examining the record, the Court finds that the sealing of the Indictment served a legitimate prosecutorial objective until at least the date of its unsealing on June 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The cases cited by Defendant do not convince the Court otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOL Mot. at 22-25; SOL Reply at 7-9.) Notably, those cases deal with months-long delays. More specifically, Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    United States v.

An action by the prosecutor that gives rise to a violation of the legal rights of the accused does not constitute an impermissible encroachment by the Executive Branch on the prerogative of the Legislative Branch to make laws. Here, as a check on the power of the Executive Branch, the accused has moved the Court to determine whether the prosecutor has stayed within the bounds of the law in the exercise of his duties. Therefore, presently before the Court is the ordinary question of whether an action by the prosecutor in the role of enforcing the nation's laws has infringed upon the legal right of the accused conferred upon her by a statute enacted by Congress. In this manner, all three branches of the government of the United States are functioning exactly as intended, each well within its routine role and established boundaries, and all at work within the heart of the symbiotic structure envisioned by the framers of the Constitution.

Thereafter, Defendant argues that \u00a7 650 and \u00a7 750 are both overbroad and cannot serve as Travel Act predicates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10.) The cases upon which Defendant relies did not use the categorical approach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Travel Act Opp. at 10-13.) In the Reply, it becomes clear that Defendant argues by analogy that the categorical approach should be applied to Travel Act predicate offenses. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Travel Act Reply.) Specifically, although the categorical approach is most familiar to courts when prior convictions must be considered for sentencing or immigration purposes, Defendant argues that courts have also routinely applied the categorical approach to cases in which contemporaneous conduct is relevant in some manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As an example of the application of the categorical approach to contemporaneous conduct, Defendant offers the firearm-related offense that enhances the sentence for persons who are convicted of \"any crime of violence.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1 (referring to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ).)

Therefore, in this manner, the Defendant is correct that the categorical approach may be applied to contemporaneous conduct or, more precisely, to contemporaneously charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   However, this example does not support application of the categorical approach in this case.

The Purpose of the Categorical Approach is to Effectuate Congressional Intent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Government contends that the traditional reasons for applying the categorical approach arose because the examination of predicate offenses \"were largely specific to ... prior convictions.\" (Travel Act Opp. at 7.) In a case involving a prior conviction, the Supreme Court has observed that \"[t]he categorical approach serves the practical purpose[ ]\" of limiting the inquiry to elements of the offense of conviction, thereby \"precluding the relitigation of [the factual basis underlying] past convictions in minitrials conducted long after the fact\" and \"promot[ing] judicial and administrative efficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    569 U.S. at 200-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/#p190\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The categorical approach indeed serves this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nevertheless, the primary purpose of the categorical approach is to effectuate the intent of Congress. In the words of the Fourth Circuit: \"Although categorical analysis may be complicated,\n   the rationale for it is simple and long-established: if Congress has conditioned a statutory penalty on commission of an offense generally-rather than on specific acts-courts must consider the crime as defined, rather than the offender's conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519907\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/914/229/#p242\">\n    914 F.3d at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the Supreme Court's development and application of the categorical approach \"has always [been] rooted ... in the statutory language chosen by Congress.\") A long line of Supreme Court precedent consistently demonstrates that congressional intent is the driving force behind the categorical approach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    495 U.S. at 590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (\"Nor is there any indication that Congress ever abandoned its general approach, in designating predicate offenses, of using uniform, categorical definitions to capture all offenses of a certain level of seriousness that involve violence or an inherent risk thereof, and that are likely to be committed by career offenders, regardless of technical definitions and labels under state law.\");\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p25\">\n    544 U.S. at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p25\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Nor does the [Armed Career Criminal Act's] legislative history reveal a lesser congressional preference for a categorical, as distinct from fact-specific, approach to recognizing ACCA predicates in cases resolved by plea.\");\n   <em>\n    Descamps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    570 U.S. at 267-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698469\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/254/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If Congress had wanted to increase a sentence based on the facts of a prior offense, it presumably would have said so; other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.\");\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Congress Intended a Conduct-Based Approach for Travel Act Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In contrast to the Travel Act, the language of \u00a7 924(c) clearly reveals that the intent of Congress was to make relevant the defendant's conviction of certain categories of offenses (rather than making relevant the conduct underlying those offenses). Specifically, under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the \"crime of violence\" is defined as a felony that \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     has as an element\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\" This statutory language is unmistakable: It clearly establishes the relevant inquiry is an elements-based inquiry, not a conduct-based inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519907\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/914/229/#p242\">\n    914 F.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying the categorical approach to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) and stating \"[t]o be more precise, we will refer to ... the\n   <em>\n    elements-based\n   </em>\n   categorical approach, because it begins and ends with the offense's elements.\") (emphasis in the original).

Instead, the focus is on the \"unlawful activity\" of the defendant. Specifically, as noted previously, the Travel Act prohibits a defendant's use of a facility of interstate commerce with a specific intent, coupled with the defendant's commission of an act related to \"unlawful activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most fundamentally, the Travel Act's reference to \"unlawful activit[ies]\" (rather than any reference to specified \"elements\" or \"offenses\") is significant, as the Travel Act's \"unlawful activit[ies]\" language is not conducive to application of the categorical approach, which the\n   <em>\n    Simms\n   </em>\n   court aptly called the \"\n   <em>\n    elements-based\n   </em>\n   categorical approach.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519907\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/914/229/#p242\">\n    914 F.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in the original). Indeed, the Travel Act's conduct-based definition of \"unlawful activit[ies]\" would seem to completely foreclose the application of the elements-based categorical approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   However, other Travel Act language lends itself a comparison between the prohibitions of the Travel Act and the elements of state-and federal-law predicates. The Travel Act also expressly defines \"unlawful activity\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   (1) any business enterprise involving gambling, liquor on which the Federal excise tax has not been paid, narcotics or controlled substances ..., or prostitution offenses in violation of the laws of the State in which they are committed or of the United States, (2) extortion, bribery, or arson in violation of the laws of the State in which committed or of the United States, or (3) [violations of certain financial reporting requirements].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201952\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This definition clearly evinces an intent to limit the Travel Act's applicability based on an underlying body of law including, relevant to the present case, state criminal law prohibiting bribery. Nevertheless, this particular limitation does not require application of the categorical approach for reasons unique to the Travel Act. As discussed in the next section, the Supreme Court has interpreted this language as an intent to provide a federal enforcement mechanism for conduct that violates state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In any event, the structure of the statute clearly requires a conduct based-approach. The conduct reached by the express definition of \"unlawful activity\" that is quoted above, already quite broad, is further broadened by the Travel Act's reference to a wide variety of \"acts\" that can be taken in furtherance of the \"unlawful activity,\" including \"(1) distribut[ing] the proceeds of any unlawful activity; ... [or] (3) otherwise promot[ing], manag[ing], establish[ing], carry[ing] on, or facilitat[ing] the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on[ ] of any unlawful activity.\" Thus, the Travel Act is clearly intended to address a wide range of conduct rather than to merely address the commission of certain state-law offenses. Accordingly, the Court concludes that use of the categorical approach for state-law Travel Act predicates is not consistent with the intent of Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    H. The Supreme Court Twice Applied a Conduct-Based Approach to Determining Whether Certain State Law Violations Constitute Travel Act Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court also notes that this conclusion is consistent with two Supreme Court\n   cases interpreting the Travel Act.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nardello\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Perrin\n   </em>\n   both strongly suggest that a conduct-based approach applies to Travel Act predicates. Having preceded the development of the now-familiar categorical approach, these cases had no occasion to expressly address its applicability. Nevertheless, the focus of these cases on the conduct of the defendants rather than on the nature or elements of the relevant offenses is telling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Nardello\n   </em>\n   considered whether two defendants could be prosecuted under the Travel Act for their conduct in luring individuals into compromising situations and then threatening them with exposure unless defendants' silence was purchased.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11314176\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/286/#p287\">\n    393 U.S. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 287,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11314176\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/286/#p287\">\n    89 S.Ct. 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11314176\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/393/286/#p287\">\n    21 L.Ed.2d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1969).
