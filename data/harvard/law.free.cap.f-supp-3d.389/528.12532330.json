First, Article III provides that \"the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed.\" U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. Second, the Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a ... trial[ ] by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.\" U.S. Const. amend VI.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is readily apparent that Article III was concerned with establishing a jury trial right in criminal cases and venue for criminal trials, while the Sixth Amendment reconfirmed these rights and added the right to a jury from the locale of the crime, known as vicinage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When it comes to federal capital cases in particular, the venue of the trial has been further limited by legislation. Section 29 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 once provided that, in \"cases punishable with death, the trial shall be had in the county where the offence was committed, or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience, twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence.\" Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2088\">\n    1 Stat. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The latter vicinage requirement that twelve jurors in capital cases be summoned from the county of the crime was later repealed in 1862.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zicarelli v.

According to Defendants, the phrase \"had in the county where the offence was committed\" in Section 29 of the Judiciary Act expressed Congress's intent to guarantee a \"county-level vicinage right to those facing capital punishment ....\" Defs. Mot. at 9-10. Defendants argue that, although it was later amended in 1862, the unaltered clause in Section 29 is virtually identical to the language in \u00a7 3235, and, therefore, it should similarly be interpreted to mean that \"a federal capital defendant is entitled to a jury drawn from that county's residents as well as to proceedings within its geographic boundaries.\" Defs. Mot. at 12. The Court finds Defendants' argument meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court begins with the text of \u00a7 3235, ascribing the statute's words with their plain and ordinary meaning, while, at the same time, ensuring that any construction of \u00a7 3235 would not render any part of it inoperative, superfluous, void, or insignificant.\n   <em>\n    Corley v.
