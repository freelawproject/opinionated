(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81, 85-86, 88.) Plaintiff also alleges that the DOD unreasonably has insisted that he revoke his Indian citizenship and become a \"stateless person\" before his naturalization application can proceed, rendering him an unauthorized immigrant and possibly subjecting him to deportation proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79 n.3.) Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, requesting that the DOD complete his required background investigation and the DHS process his naturalization application, and seeking \"specific enforcement\" of his enlistment contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-27.) Plaintiff also seeks monetary damages for \"the past and ongoing breach of his enlistment contract[,]\" as well as attorneys' fees and costs.

U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-0998 (ESH) (D.D.C. filed May 24, 2017). Defendants argue that, in addition to being barred by\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's claims for breach of contract, estoppel, and violation of the \"statutory right to naturalize\" should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons stated below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' motion to dismiss the case without prejudice, and grants in part and denies in part a stay of the case pending the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    The Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts are undisputed except as indicated. Plaintiff is a citizen of India, and currently resides in Medford, Massachusetts. (#1 \u00b6 1.) On August 17, 2010, Plaintiff lawfully entered the United States after being admitted on an \"F-1\" student visa. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) He graduated from Columbia University College of Dental Medicine in 2014 as a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), after which he applied for and received H1B \"non-immigrant\" worker status, allowing him to remain lawfully within the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.) Plaintiff's first H1B was issued on May 14, 2015, and his current H1B was issued on November 22, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 12, 2015, Plaintiff signed an enlistment contract and took an oath of service with the United States Army through the Military Accessions Vital to National Interest (MAVNI) program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 57.) In his November 12, 2015 enlistment contract, Plaintiff agreed to apply for citizenship \"as soon as\" the Army had certified his honorable service. (#1 \u00b6 55; #20-1 at 5 \u00b6 5.) However, in signing the contract, Plaintiff acknowledged his understanding that \"the Army does not grant U.S. citizenship,\" and the Army would not be able to guarantee that his application for citizenship would be approved. (#1 \u00b6 55; #20-1 at 5 \u00b6 5.) Approximately ten months later, in September 2016, Plaintiff began serving as a Specialist (E-4) in the\n   Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve (Selected Reserve).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (#1 \u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, only United States citizens or those having legal permanent residency may enlist in the United States Armed Forces.

Those enlisting under the MAVNI program would be afforded an expedited path to citizenship.

(#1 \u00b6 70.) The MAVNI applicant could begin the process of applying for naturalization as soon as the armed services certified his or her honorable service, by submitting to USCIS a standard Form N-400 naturalization application, as well as a USCIS Form N-426, certifying his qualifying military service. (#15-A-6 \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   #1 \u00b6 59.) Serving in the Selected Reserve was considered \"qualifying military service.\" (#15-A-6 \u00b6 44) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Until recently, it was USCIS' general practice to process MAVNI naturalization applications in the same way as other \u00a7 1440 naturalization applications, by initiating an FBI criminal background check and conducting a Defense Clearance Investigative Index (DCII), (separate from the required military background checks), with the DOD. (#1 \u00b6\u00b6 70, 77 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); #15-A-6 \u00b6 65.) Once the FBI criminal background and DCII checks had been completed, a MAVNI naturalization applicant was eligible for an examination by a USCIS officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio v. Dept' of Homeland Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273287\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/49/#p55\">\n    270 F.

Although there was no specific time period for completing the FBI criminal background checks and DCII checks, USCIS was required by statute to adjudicate all naturalization applications within 120 days of completing the examination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273287\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/49/#p55\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 67 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hamandi v.

Supp. 2d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50 (D.D.C. 2008) ). As of May 2017, the average processing time for all military N-400 naturalization applications, including those of the MAVNI applicants, was slightly more than four months.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547872\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/550/46/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547872\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/550/46/#p50\">\n    at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, as of July 2017, USCIS had naturalized \"at least\" 10,000 MAVNI applicants through this process. (#15-A-1 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff submitted his N-400 Naturalization Application pursuant to USCIS' general practice in September 2016. (#1 \u00b6 59.) On September 11, 2016, Plaintiff's Company Commander, Lieutenant Colonel\n   Edwardo Olegario, signed Form N-426, certifying Plaintiff's honorable military service. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 4, 2017, Plaintiff submitted an additional N-426 Form, this time signed by Colonel John McCabe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   n.2.) All parties agree that Plaintiff's N-400 and N-426 forms were received and submitted in the proper form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff's naturalization application has since been in limbo. Beginning on September 30, 2016, the DOD started requiring all MAVNI applicants to complete an enhanced military security screening before they could receive a favorable military service determination, qualify for active-duty status, or ship to basic training. (#15-A-2; #15-A-4 at 1.) While this enhanced military security screening requirement for MAVNI applicants did not necessarily impact the adjudication of the MAVNI naturalization applications on its face, in April 2017, the DOD informed USCIS of its concerns regarding the naturalization of MAVNI applicants whose enhanced military screenings were still pending. (#15-A-1 \u00b6 18.) Thereafter, on July 7, 2017, Daniel Renaud, then the Associate Director, Field Operations Directorate, of USCIS Headquarters, provided final agency guidance, stating that all pending and future MAVNI naturalization applications \"may not proceed to interview, approval, or oath until confirmation that all enhanced security checks [were] completed.\" (#15-A-5 at 1-2.) Accordingly, USCIS would no longer be permitted to examine any pending MAVNI naturalization applications until the DOD completed its enhanced military security screenings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Neither the DOD nor USCIS has provided any guidance regarding how long these enhanced security screenings will take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 17, 2016, USCIS initiated Plaintiff's background check for naturalization. (#1 \u00b6 61.) While a USCIS field officer has informed Plaintiff that his FBI criminal background check has been complete since January 2017, USCIS has repeatedly advised him that his enhanced military security screening is incomplete and has failed to provide any estimated time for completion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.) On March 19, 2018, Plaintiff was again informed that \"his case was on hold due to pending background checks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id. \u00b6\n   </em>\n   68.) Therefore, as of the time his complaint was filed, USCIS had not scheduled Plaintiff's naturalization interview. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 24, 2017, before the instant suit was filed, various foreign national soldiers who, like Plaintiff, had enlisted in the Selected Reserve through the MAVNI program and filed naturalization applications pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201440\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (District of Columbia) against the DHS, the DOD, and USCIS, and their agency and sub-agency heads.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-0998 (ESH). Following USCIS' July 7, 2017 guidance, the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs amended their complaint, specifically challenging the DHS/USCIS' decision to put their naturalization applications on hold pending the DOD's completion of enhanced military security screenings. (#15-A-6.) Like Plaintiff in the present case, the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs brought multiple claims under the Constitution and the APA, seeking mandamus, due process, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief \"to compel and enjoin Defendants ... to properly and timely act upon, and to otherwise cease interfering with, the processing of [p]laintiffs' naturalization applications.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 27, 2017, the District of Columbia granted the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs' motion for class certification, defining the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class to include individuals who have:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (i) enlisted in the Selected Reserve through the MAVNI program before October 13, 2017;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (ii) served honorably in the United States military through participation in at least one Selected Reserve drill period or in an active duty status;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (iii) received from the military executed Form N-426s certifying their honorable service;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-28\">\n   (iv) submitted N-400 Applications for Naturalization to USCIS; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n   (v) had the processing or final adjudication of their naturalization applications withheld or delayed, due to either the DOD's enhanced military security screenings, a final USCIS processing hold for MAVNIs, a DOD N-426 policy review, the DOD N-426 recall/decertification policy, a DOD Consolidated Actions adjudication, a national security determination, and/or a military service suitability vetting or determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (#15-A-7 at 1-2);\n   <em>\n    Nio v.

While the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   court acknowledged the factual differences among the class members, it noted that the plaintiffs were all challenging whether USCIS could delay their naturalization applications pending the outcome of the DOD's enhanced military security screenings, or whether the DOD could rescind MAVNIs' N-426s based on additional \"October 13th Guidance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (#15-A-7 at 8);\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%2028\">\n    323 F.R.D. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, because the parties were challenging \"the application of standardized policies that generally apply to the class[,]\" none of the class members' factual differences impacted \"the overarching questions common to the class[.]\" (#15-A-7 at 8, 13);\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%2028\">\n    323 F.R.D. at 32, 34-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class is a nationwide class certified under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(1)(A), and (b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (#15-A-7 at 7-13);\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=323%20F.R.D.%2028\">\n    323 F.R.D. at 32-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(#15 at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   #15-A-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants argue that, because Plaintiff is a member of the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class, and his complaint seeks to litigate the same claims covered in\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , his complaint in this Court should be dismissed, or alternatively, stayed, pending the District of Columbia's resolution of\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   . (#15 at 1-2.) Defendants also contend that, in addition to being barred by\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's claims for estoppel, breach of contract, and violation of the \"statutory right to naturalize\" should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and/or 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Without explaining how this affects the relief he is seeking, Plaintiff responds by arguing that he is not sufficiently similar to the other MAVNI enlistees in the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   class because he is a \"medical\" MAVNI, and the\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   lawsuit \"appears\" to involve \"language\" MAVNIs, who are subject to different enhanced military security screenings than he is. (#20 at 4.) Plaintiff further argues that his statutory right to naturalize, breach of contract, and equitable estoppel claims are different from the claims of the class action members in\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   . (#20 at 12-13.) Plaintiff also contends that equity mandates denying Defendants' motion because\n   <em>\n    Nio\n   </em>\n   is \"proceeding at a snail's pace[,]\" and there is no prospect of any \"practical relief\" any time soon.

While Plaintiff maintains that the portion of his enlistment contract, requiring him \"to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as the Army ... certified [his] honorable service,\" implied that the Army wanted him to become a citizen and was \"contractually bound not to thwart those efforts[,]\" (#20 at 5), Plaintiff cannot cite any specific portion of the enlistment contract which required Defendants to adjudicate his naturalization application within any specific time, provide him with a pay raise, or promote him from a Specialist Fourth Class to a Captain.

While Plaintiff may be able to make an argument that the DOD, the DHS, and USCIS have aided in the alleged breach by failing to adjudicate his naturalization application, this argument is tenuous at best, given that Plaintiff fails to\n    cite the \"specific contractual promise\" related to his allegations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Furthermore, to the extent that Plaintiff is asking for monetary damages not to exceed $ 10,000, \"money damages are not an available remedy for the government's breach of an enlistment contract.\"\n    <em>\n     Jablon v.

While courts generally apply common law principles to determine whether a military enlistment contract has been breached and can provide remedies such as release, courts \"have no authority\" to order the government to pay damages for a breach of a military enlistment contract, because those in the military are paid under statutory, rather than contract, principles.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1191890\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/657/1064/#p1066\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1067 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bell v.

Defendants further argue that, even if federal courts did have the authority to naturalize citizens through equitable estoppel, the remedy of estoppel is not available against the government under these circumstances.

Specifically, the decision to require MAVNIs to undergo enhanced military security screenings before their N-400 applications can be processed \"is not and cannot possibly be construed as 'affirmative misconduct[.]' \" (#15 at 13 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Frillz, Inc. v.
