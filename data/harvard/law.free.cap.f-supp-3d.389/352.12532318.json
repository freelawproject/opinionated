July 23, 2019) (discussing history and objectives of the Fair Sentencing Act and the First Step Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2018, Congress passed the First Step Act, which made certain provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactive. Pub. L. No. 115-391, \u00a7 404(b)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n    132 Stat. 5194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5222 (2018). Section 404(b) of the First Step Act provides, \"A court that imposed a sentence for a covered offense may, on motion of the defendant, .... impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 404(a) defines \"covered offense\" as \"a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 ..., that was committed before August 3, 2010.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404(a). The imposition of a sentence reduction is discretionary-Section 404(c) states, \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a court to reduce any sentence pursuant to this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A court has the discretion to reduce a defendant's sentence under the Fair Sentencing Act if (1) he committed the underlying offense before August 3, 2010, and (2) his sentencing exposure would be different under Section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%205194\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404(b), (c). Defendant's criminal offenses occurred in the late 1990s, well before August 3, 2010. The Court thus turns to the question whether defendant's sentence would be different as a result of the Fair Sentencing Act, and if so, whether the Court should exercise its discretion to reduce the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Government asserts that the discrepancy between the actual amount of crack for which defendant was criminally responsible, at least 250 kilograms, and the quantity of crack charged in the indictment, 50 grams or more, stems from the Government's practice of charging the threshold quantity under the relevant statute, rather than the actual quantity of crack.

Def. Reply 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In this case, the Court need not reach the question whether actual or charged quantity of crack controls application of the First Step Act. Even if defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction with respect to his drug conviction, and the Court does not so rule, the First Step Act makes clear that such a reduction is not mandatory-it is within the Court's discretion whether to reduce a sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Moreover, in this case, defendant was not simply sentenced subject to a statutory mandatory minimum that arguably was decreased by the Fair Sentencing Act.

According to defendant, because he was not convicted of the new threshold under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii), the sentence for his\n   murder conviction predicated on his drug conviction should be lower.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20848\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the Sentencing Guidelines were amended to reflect changes to elements of crack offenses following the Fair Sentencing Act, the guidelines for offenses under \u00a7 848(e) were not changed-convictions under \u00a7 848(e) continue to fall under the \"First Degree Murder\" section of the Sentencing Guidelines, which, by itself, suggests a guideline sentencing range of life imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2A1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2002)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2A1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm'n 2018).

An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW\n   </strong>\n   , this 26th day of July, 2019, upon consideration of\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant's Motion for Reduction of Sentence (Document No. 810, filed January 14, 2019), Government's Response to Defendant's Pro Se Motion for a Sentence Reduction Pursuant to the First Step Act of 2018 (Document No. 822, filed July 2, 2019), and Response of Defendant to Government's Response to Defendant [sic] Pro Se Motion for a Sentence Reduction Pursuant to the First Step Act of 2018 (Document No. 823, filed July 15, 2019), for the reasons set forth in the accompanying Memorandum dated July 26, 2019,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendant's Motion for Reduction of Sentence is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The facts are drawn from this Court's previous Order of May 18, 2016, denying\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    defendant's Motion for Reduction of Sentence Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2) and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20994\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (O).

That offense level, in Criminal History Category I, the lowest criminal history category, resulted in a guideline sentencing range of life imprisonment.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20994\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20994\">\n     \u00b6\u00b6 117, 137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Defendant avers that his trial attorney stipulated with the prosecutor that his criminal activity involved 1.5 kilograms of crack.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.
