Defendant Doe and Defendant Horner Lawsuits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 25, 2018, Defendant Doe filed a Class Action Complaint against Defendant\n   Smith in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas on behalf of herself and others similarly-situated. (Exhibit B, ECF No. 1-3). Defendant Doe filed an Amended Class Action Complaint on May 31, 2018, alleging claims of: (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) medical negligence or chiropractic malpractice, (4) negligence for failure to obtain informed consent, (5) negligent invasion of privacy, (6) false imprisonment, and (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (Exhibit C, ECF No. 1-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In her Amended Class Action Complaint, Defendant Doe alleged that Defendant Smith, a chiropractor, sexually assaulted her and over 40 other female patients during the course of his chiropractic treatment. (Amended Class Action Compl. \u00b6 1, Exhibit C). Defendant Doe further alleged that Defendant Smith \"acted negligently, and committed additional common law torts\" against the potential class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, Defendant Doe claimed that at treatment sessions between May 2017 and June 2017, Defendant Smith touched her breasts and \"positioned [her] hand behind her back at waist level ... and holding [her] arm firmly in place, pressed his genitals into [her] hands.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Defendant further claimed that Defendant Smith once required her to wear a medical gown so that he could \"manipulate the gown to expose both of her breasts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   123).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 1, 2018, Defendant Horner filed suit against Defendant Smith in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. (Exhibit D, ECF No. 1-5). In her Complaint, Defendant Horner asserted claims of: (1) assault, (2) battery, (3) negligence, (4) negligence for failure to obtain informed consent, and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendant Horner alleged that in May 2017, Smith touched the \"pectoralis muscle of [her] left breast in a way that made [her] feel uncomfortable\" and \"guided [her] hand behind her back and placed his penis in her hand.\" (Horner Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11 &amp; 15, Exhibit D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

(Pl.'s Compl. \u00b6 A-H). On July 31, 2018, Defendant Doe filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint, or alternatively, a Motion to Stay Proceedings pending the conclusion of the underlying state court litigation. (ECF No. 8). The Court denied Defendant Doe's Motion to Dismiss or Stay Proceedings on March 21, 2019. (ECF No. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On January 31, 2019, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on its declaratory claims. (ECF No. 41). Defendant Smith and Defendant Horner each filed a Response in Opposition on February 20, 2019 and February 21, 2019 respectively. (ECF Nos. 46 &amp; 47). On February 21, 2019, Defendant Doe filed a Motion for Discovery Pursuant to Rule 56(d). (ECF No. 48). In response, Plaintiff filed a joint Reply in Support of its Motion for Summary Judgment and Response in Opposition to Defendant Doe's Discovery Motion. (ECF No. 49). On May 2, 2019, the Court denied Defendant Doe's Discovery Motion. (ECF No. 58). Defendant Doe subsequently filed her Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 59). Plaintiff filed a Reply brief and Motion to Strike the Affidavit of Brandon Zoller D.C. on May 14, 2019. (ECF No. 60). All motions are ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant has the burden of establishing there are no genuine issues of material fact, which may be achieved by demonstrating the nonmoving party lacks evidence to support an essential element of its claim.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Defendant Homer agrees, noting that \"[e]ven if the Court were to find that the claims based on assault and battery ... fall outside the coverage provided by the [Policy], that does not excuse [Plaintiff] from providing a defense to [Defendant] Smith where other claims are arguably within the scope of the coverage.\" (Def.

According to Defendant Doe, \"even if the [C]ourt concludes that [Plaintiff] has no obligation to\n   <em>\n    defend\n   </em>\n   [Defendant] Smith, summary judgment is entirely inappropriate with respect to indemnification.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2) (emphasis in original).

The Policy further states that, to invoke coverage: \"[t]he\n   <strong>\n    injury\n   </strong>\n   must be caused by an accident arising from an\n   <strong>\n    incident\n   </strong>\n   during the\n   <strong>\n    policy period.\"\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis in original).

An intentional tort cannot be reasonably characterized as a \"negligent omission, act or error.\" (Exhibit A at 5). Moreover, the Policy excludes the following intentional acts from coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   A. An act or omission violating any federal or state statute, or any county or municipal ordinance governing the commission of a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   B.

Here, Defendant Smith's alleged assault, battery, false imprisonment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress fit squarely within the Policy's exclusions. False imprisonment is explicitly excluded from coverage in provision B. In addition, intentional infliction of emotional distress unambiguously constitutes an \"intentional infliction of\n   <strong>\n    injury\n   </strong>\n   \" under provision D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the actions underlying the claims of assault and battery are rooted in sexual misconduct-including allegations that Defendant Smith exposed patients' breasts, touched then-breasts, and placed his genitals in contact with patients while performing chiropractic procedures. Consequently, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that the underlying complaints \"unquestionably allege a pattern of sexual assault and impropriety,\" therefore triggering exclusion C.

In contrast, Defendant Doe argues the word \"claim\" only encompasses pre-litigation demands for money or services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

Smith's Response to Request for Admission, Exhibit A at 5, ECF No. 59-1). Defendant Smith denies that he intentionally touched Defendant Doe's breasts, or intentionally caused his genitals to come in contact with her hand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   At this stage in the litigation, no jury has resolved whether Defendant Smith acted intentionally, negligently, both, or neither. Because an insurer's duty to indemnify is fact dependent, the Court cannot conclude that Plaintiff has no duty to indemnify Defendant Smith as a matter of law. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to its duty to indemnify is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED without prejudice.\n   </strong>\n   The Court may revisit Plaintiff's arguments, on motion, at the conclusion of the underlying state court actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Court did not consider the Affidavit of Brandon Zoller, D.C. when reaching its decision. (Def Doe's Opp'n at 8-9). Therefore, Plaintiff's Motion to Strike the Affidavit of Brandon Zoller D.C. is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot.\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 41); and Plaintiff's Motion to Strike is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   (ECF No. 60). The Court\n   <strong>\n    DECLARES\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff has a duty to defend Defendant Smith against all state court claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The \"Persons Insured\" section of the Policy notes that \"[t]he persons insured under this policy are ...
