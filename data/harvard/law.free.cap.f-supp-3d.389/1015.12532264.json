For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that judgment on the pleadings should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") filed this action alleging that Defendant Austal USA, LLC (\"Austal\") discriminated against Jimmy Cooper by failing to provide him leave as a reasonable accommodation in violation of the ADA. (Doc. 1). According to the complaint, Mr. Cooper began working at Austal in 2007 as a Warehouseman. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 14). In 2008, Cooper was diagnosed with Type II Insulin-Dependent Diabetes which sometimes required him to be absent or\n   late to work or to need to leave work early or on short notice. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 15). In late 2013 or early 2014, Cooper became a Logistics Associate and received additional duties which resulted in increased physical stress that made it more difficult for Cooper to control his blood sugar levels and resulted in an increased number of days Cooper was tardy or absent. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 17). On May 6, 2014, Cooper's blood sugar spiked and he lost consciousness at work and injured his wrist. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 18). Following the incident, Cooper was absent from work several days due to his disability. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 18). Cooper also missed time from work in December 2014 due to his blood sugar becoming elevated. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 19). Austal terminated Cooper on or about January 27, 2015 pursuant to Austal's attendance policy. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 21). On March 5, 2015, Cooper filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC alleging violations of the ADA by Austal. (Doc. 1, \u00b6 7, Doc. 26-2). The EEOC filed a complaint in this Court seeking injunctive relief regarding Austal's general attendance policies as well as relief specific to Cooper, to make Cooper whole by providing back pay, front pay, compensation for Cooper's pecuniary losses, reinstatement, and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Austal moved for judgment on the pleadings asserting that Cooper waived any right to recover individual relief from Austal via releases he executed on April 17, 2015. (Doc. 26). Austal attached copies of the releases to its motion. The first release, titled \"SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL OF AGREED SETTLEMENT UNDER LHWCA SECTION 8(i)(1)\" (hereinafter \"LHWCA Settlement Agreement\"), states that the parties agree \"to settle all issues and claims between themselves whether arising under the AWCA, the LHWCA, or any other statute or law...\" (Doc. 26-1, \u00b6 J). The USDOL approved the LHWCA Settlement Agreement on May 7, 2015. (Doc. 26-4). The second release, titled \"AGREEMENT AND GENERAL RELEASE\" (hereinafter \"General Release\"), included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Employee hereby voluntarily resigns any employment relationship he may have with the Company and waives any right to employment or re-employment with the Company and also agrees he will not in the future apply for employment or re-employment with the Company, either directly or indirectly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of the Settlement, Employee also waives and releases any and all rights or claims, whether presently known or unknown, he may have against the Company as of the date of his signing this Agreement, including any rights or claims which arise out of or are related in any way to his employment with, or separation of employment from, the Company. This release includes, but is not limited to, all rights or claims which arise under federal, state, or local law for discrimination, including all claims made or which could have been made in EEOC Charge 425-2015-00523, ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Notwithstanding anything suggested herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to interfere with the Employee's rights under either the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act or Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act; to prohibit Employee from filing a charge with or participating in any investigation or proceeding by any federal, state or local agency charged with enforcement of any law, though under such circumstances Employee agrees to waive his right to recover monetary damages or individual relief in any charge, complaint or lawsuit filed by him or by anyone else on his\n   behalf; or to waive any claims arising after the date of execution of this Agreement, including but not limited to claims for breach of this Agreement, or to any claims that may not be released as a matter of law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Doc. 26-3, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Consideration of Extrinsic Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Austal contends judgment on the pleadings should be granted based on the LHWCA Settlement Agreement and the General Release. Generally, the Court may not consider matters outside the pleadings without converting the motion into a motion for summary judgment. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(d). However, \"[a] copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\" FED. R. CIV. P. 10(c). Also, the Court may consider an extrinsic document if it is \"(1) central to the plaintiff's claim, and (2) its authenticity is not challenged.\n   <em>\n    SFM Holdings, Ltd. v. Banc of Am. Sec., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223862\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/1334/#p1337\">\n    600 F.3d 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1337 (11th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). \"In this context, 'undisputed' means that the authenticity of the document is not challenged.\"\n   <em>\n    Day v.

The General Release was reportedly submitted by Austal to the EEOC on May 20, 2015 and Austal contends it is part of the EEOC's administrative record. The Complaint references the EEOC Charge but does not mention any release or settlement of Cooper's claims. Courts have found that an EEOC charge attached to a motion to dismiss may be considered where it was central to a complaint brought by a charging party and the authenticity of the charge was not disputed.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Cochran v.

Moreover, while Ramsey did not file his EEOC charge with this court, and his complaint does not reference the document, it is well-settled that prior to filing an ADA action in federal court, the ADA plaintiff must have 'timely filed' a charge with the EEOC. The court therefore concludes Ramsey's EEOC charge is \"central\" to his claim, and properly considered at the pleading stage without converting Greenbush's motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" (internal citation omitted)).

However, it is questionable whether the exception would extend to a settlement or release agreement. A plaintiff's Title VII or ADA claim clearly does not require a settlement or release agreement. Thus, a settlement or release agreement is not central to a plaintiff's claims and where, as here, such agreements were not attached to or referenced in the pleadings they cannot be considered on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neely v.

Nov. 14, 2005) (\"the Court finds that the General Release submitted by the Defendants with their Motion to Dismiss is a matter outside the pleadings because Plaintiff neither referenced nor included the document in his Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Austal contends that the documents at issue can be judicially noticed by this Court. EEOC charges and related documents have been found to be public records of which a court may take judicial notice in ruling on a motion to dismiss without having to convert the motion into one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. City of Alabaster, Ala.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20988874\">\n    2013 WL 988874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 n.5 (N.D. Ala. Mar. 12, 2013) (\"when considering a motion to dismiss, the court may take judicial notice of the contents of relevant public records, which include EEOC Charges and Right to Sue Letters\" (citations omitted)). However, it is questionable whether the agreements at issue are part of the administrative record. The EEOC argues that the release document was not verified or otherwise authenticated and that Austal's report that it sent the release to the EEOC does not make it part of the EEOC's administrative record for purposes of judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The EEOC argues that even if the Court takes judicial notice of the Release and Settlement Agreement, the Court should not assume that the statements contained in the documents are accurate and undisputed. The EEOC does not dispute that Cooper signed the agreements. (Doc. 31, p. 5 n.3). However, the EEOC argues that the Court does not have to take as true statements in the documents that the agreements were knowingly and voluntarily assented to after having had time to consider the releases and consult with an attorney, that the compensation was adequate, or that the agreements were not procured by duress. Since Austal has the burden of proof on its waiver and\n   release affirmative defense and the facts must be construed in favor of the non-moving party, the EEOC contends that this Court has no basis to find that Cooper knowingly and voluntarily assented to the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Southern District of Florida has ruled that at the dismissal stage a release would not support a defendant's motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Duvall v. Sun-Sentinel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203310073\">\n    2013 WL 3310073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Fla. July 1, 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   , the court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   At this stage of the proceedings, the Court is forced to side with Duval. Sun-Sentinel has not established that the release bars his Title VII claim in this case. While the release is framed broadly and, by its plain language, would seem to encompass Duval's employment discrimination claim, that is not the end of the matter. The Eleventh Circuit has cautioned that the waiver of remedial statutory rights under Title VII \"must be closely scrutinized\" under \"the totality of the circumstances\" to ensure that \"the release [was] knowing and voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bledsoe v. Palm Beach Cnty. Soil &amp; Water Conserv. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22435\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/816/\">\n    133 F.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). So, while Sun-Sentinel contends that the state court action and the release are subject to judicial notice, the Court cannot dismiss on the basis of those documents alone, no matter how broad the release's language. Instead, Eleventh Circuit case law instructs that the Court must make fact-intensive inquiries to determine whether, under \"the totality of the circumstances,\" Duvall made a \"knowing and voluntary\" waiver of federal remedial rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myricks v.

The Court finds the\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning to be persuasive. Extrinsic documents \"may only be considered to show their contents, not to prove the truth of matters asserted therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v.

The current case is complicated by the fact that it is brought by the EEOC, not the charging party. Austal argues that the EEOC does not have standing to challenge the knowingness and voluntariness of Cooper's execution of the settlement and release since the EEOC was not a party to the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Supreme Court discussed the effects of a settlement between a charging party and his employer in\n   <em>\n    E.E.O.C. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Waffle House\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that an arbitration agreement signed by the charging party did not limit the remedies available to the EEOC.

And, in this context, the statute specifically grants the EEOC exclusive authority over the choice of forum and the prayer for relief once a charge has been filed. The fact that ordinary principles of res judicata, mootness, or mitigation may apply to EEOC claims does not contradict these decisions, nor does it render the EEOC a proxy for the employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 297-98. While the\n   <em>\n    Waffle House\n   </em>\n   case is instructive and discusses at length the authority of the EEOC and the remedies it has available, the case does not answer the question whether the EEOC can challenge a charging party's settlement agreement, nor does it fully explain the effect such a settlement, if binding, would have on the EEOC's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    Waffle House\n   </em>\n   case, the Supreme Court indicated that the EEOC does not stand in the shoes of the employee in all instances. If the EEOC was found not to stand in the shoes of the employee with regard to a settlement or release agreement, that might limit its ability to challenge Cooper's agreements here since the EEOC is not a party to those agreements. However, the\n   <em>\n    Waffle House\n   </em>\n   case also instructs that we must look to the statutes that grant the EEOC's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The EEOC's authority to bring suit arises from 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f), which states that the EEOC may bring a civil action after a charge is filed with the Commission \"if the Commission has been unable to secure from the respondent a conciliation agreement\n   <em>\n    acceptable to the Commission\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (emphasis added). Thus, the EEOC's right to bring a claim is based on its own determination of the adequacy of the respondent's response or resolution of the matter. This express authority over the acceptability of the employer's conciliation agreement indicates that the EEOC is authorized to challenge a settlement by an employer. The EEOC is tasked with determining whether the resolution was acceptable; and, if it decides the resolution was not acceptable, is given the authority to bring suit. Thus, in the instant case, if the EEOC believes that the settlement agreement and release were not entered into knowingly and voluntarily and that the agreements did not adequately compensate Cooper, the EEOC should have authority to bring suit to address the employer's unacceptable resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Austal cites three cases, none of which are in the Eleventh Circuit, to support its argument that the EEOC cannot challenge Cooper's settlement and release of his claims.

In\n   <em>\n    CVS Pharmacy\n   </em>\n   , the agreement at issue was not the employer's conciliation to a charge that was filed, but a severance agreement that the employee entered into prior to filing a charge of discrimination. The employee filed a charge alleging he had been fired on the basis of his race and sex after entering into the severance agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058838\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058838\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/335/\">\n    at 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Ninth Circuit cited to general principles that one must be a party to or beneficiary of a contract or must be harmed by the alleged wrong to have standing. In the instant case it could be argued that the EEOC is harmed by the alleged wrong because its interest is the public's interest in employers resolving discrimination claims appropriately. The public's interest is harmed if an employer forces employees to settle their EEOC claims without giving the employees all of the appropriate information or allowing them a meaningful opportunity to seek legal counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The last case Austal cites is\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

This Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Pan American\n   </em>\n   case does not support Austal's argument.

The individual objectors in\n   <em>\n    Pan American\n   </em>\n   had lost their right to assert their individual claims long before\n   the settlement was proposed and did not have the statutory authority given to the EEOC to investigate and ensure that claims are appropriately resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties have not presented (and this Court has not found) any binding caselaw that determines what right, if any, the EEOC has to challenge a charging party's settlement and release of his ADA claims.
