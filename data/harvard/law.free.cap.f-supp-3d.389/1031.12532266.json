Plaintiff 3Lions Publishing, Inc. responded on March 10, 2019. (Doc. # 13). For the reasons that follow, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   3Lions Publishing, Inc. (3LP) is a Florida corporation \"that provides...information, solutions, and guidance to the healthcare industry regarding the implementation of safeguards to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\" (Doc. # 1 at 1). Interactive Media Corp. (IMC) is a \"Massachusetts Corporation that describes itself as 'an industry leader in providing secure hardware encrypted USB solutions, quality portable data storage, fully-integrated secure remote management, duplication equipment to organizations and businesses around the world.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2). The Complaint alleges that IMC \"blatantly committed trademark infringement on its website.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 25, 2017, 3LP received a federal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the phrase \"HIPAA Survival Guide\" in International Classes 9, 35, and 42. (Doc. # 1-3). That registration lists a \"first use\" date of August 31, 2009, and \"first use in commerce\" dates of March 15, 2013, as to Class 35 and March 16, 2016, as to Classes 9 and 42. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   3LP alleges that IMC infringed on the trademark when IMC used the phrase \"HIPAA Survival Guide\" within a blog post dated October 31, 2012, on its website \"to sell its healthcare compliance products and services\" for which \"it receives a financial benefit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The blog post is entitled \"HIPAA Survival Guide\" and contains four sentences. (Doc. # 1-2). The first sentence states, \"Healthcare Informatics has a link to a HIPAA Survival Guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The remaining three sentences reference IMC/Kanguru-branded products that may help healthcare companies comply with HIPAA requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3LP further alleges that IMC's use of 3LP's trademark on IMC's website \"attract[s] larger amounts of internet traffic, often by misleading consumers into believing [IMC] [is] associated, affiliated with, or authorized by 3LP.\" (Doc. # 1 at 3). Further, 3LP indicates that it \"never entered into any agreement with [IMC] that would permit [IMC] to adapt or otherwise use the [trademark].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). 3LP also alleges that IMC's \"acts of trademark infringement were willful and deliberate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3LP initiated this action on January 28, 2019, asserting two claims under the Lanham Act for false designation of origin and trademark infringement. (Doc. # 1). IMC moved to dismiss on March 4, 2019. (Doc. # 11). 3LP has responded (Doc. # 13), and IMC has replied. (Doc. # 26). The Motion is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court accepts as true all the allegations in the complaint and construes\n   them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

(Doc. # 11 at 17-19). In support, IMC provides a Declaration from its founder and president, Donald Brown. (Doc. # 11-1). Brown states in the Declaration that IMC does not employ any representatives within Florida, does not solicit business in Florida, does not maintain offices in Florida, does not pay taxes to Florida, does not avail itself of the laws of Florida, and had no reason to foresee it would be sued in Florida. (Doc. # 11-1 at 2). Further, IMC argues that 3LP's assertions that IMC engaged in tortious acts are mere legal conclusions without any factual support and therefore are not entitled to a \"presumption of correctness.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a preliminary matter, 3LP's allegations contained within the Complaint are sufficient to meet the initial pleading requirements to establish personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wash.

While IMC's argument is well-taken, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of 3LP.

Further, 3LP contends that IMC utilized the exact trademarked phrase in a blog post without crediting 3LP as the owner of such term.

It is not clear on the face of the Complaint that IMC's usage of \"HIPAA Survival Guide\" constitutes fair use given that the blog post's title included the same phrase trademarked by 3LP and within the context of IMC promoting its products. Therefore, the Court declines to dismiss the Complaint based on IMC's fair use affirmative defense and denies the Motion. However, IMC may raise its fair use defense again at the summary judgment stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED, ADJUDGED,\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DECREED:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (1) Defendant Interactive Media Corp.'s Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Failure to State a Claim, or in the Alternative for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (Doc. # 11) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (2) Interactive Media Corp.'s Answer to the Complaint is due within 14 days of the date of this Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   in Chambers in Tampa, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    10th\n   </em>\n   day of June, 2018.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
