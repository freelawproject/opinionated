R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). TelexFree, Inc. (\"TelexFree\") was a pyramid scheme that operated from February 2012 to April 2014 and involved approximately two million participants worldwide, nearly a million of whom suffered a net financial loss. The Plaintiffs filed actions in federal district courts across the United States seeking to recover their losses against dozens of defendants, ranging from financial service providers, including banks, payment processing companies, investment services providers such as WFA, and the principals of the fraudulent scheme. As the actions involved common questions of fact, the Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation joined the actions into a multidistrict litigation and ordered transfer of all actions to the District of Massachusetts for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that Mauricio Cardenas, (also a Defendant) was a financial advisor and an employee of WFA who was responsible for hiding and/or laundering illicit funds for TelexFree principal Carlos Wanzeler. Cardenas was primarily responsible for handling Wanzeler's WFA investment accounts, knowing full well that he was running an illegal pyramid scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   WFA discharged Cardenas in April 2014 as a direct result of his involvement with TelexFree and Wanzeler, and it is alleged that WFA, through their Regulatory Account Monitoring Department, knew that Cardenas was laundering money for Wanzeler. It is alleged that WFA oversaw Cardenas investment activities and maintained a detailed account of profits made on behalf of his client. (FCAC \u00b6 1136). When WFA terminated Cardenas in 2014 it filed the following disclosure with the \"Financial Industry Regulatory Authority\" (\"FINRA\").\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   \"The firm determined that it would not do business with certain business entities due to potential AML risks. Thereafter, FA (Financial Advisor Cardenas) opened two brokerage accounts for individuals directly related to the entities. The FA stated that he did not know the relationship existed. Management determined that representative demonstrated a lack of judgment in recognizing and managing the potential AML risks.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiffs further allege that WFA was aware of the TelexFree pyramid scheme and determined not to do business with TelexFree due to the AML risks. However, Cardenas continued to establish brokerage accounts with WFA for the purposes of secreting funds from TelexFrees' illegal operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must allege a claim that plausibly entitles the plaintiff to relief.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Knowing and Actual Assistance\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The primary tort elements of the aiding and abetting allegation is not disputed by the Defendants. The parties agree that TelexFree established an illegal Ponzi scheme and thus committed a relevant underlying tort. Any analysis of the claims contained in the FCAC begins by examining the allegation that the Defendant either actively participated in and/or substantially assisted in TelexFree's tortious and fraudulent scheme. Participation that is not active, (i.e. passive) does not constitute aiding and abetting\"). Similarly, mere assistance, less than substantial, also fails to meet the relevant threshold.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Our Court in\n    <em>\n     In re State Street Cases\n    </em>\n    outlined why passive assistance and inaction does not rise to the level of substantial assistance. Specifically, in State Street, a fraudster used bank accounts in the execution of a fraudulent scheme. The Court found that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    The mere settling of a transaction or providing of a platform, without more, cannot sustain a charge of substantial assistance. Although conventional banking services made it easier to effectuate [a] fraudulent scheme, there was no showing of substantial assistance ... [although] ... participants in the ... scheme used [bank] accounts ... to perpetrate it ... These allegations are precisely the sort of passive assistance and inaction that, without more, does not rise to the level of substantial assistance.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <em>\n     In Re State Street cases\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20550815\">\n     2013 WL 550815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at *23.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    WFA urges the Court to find that the complaint does not sufficiently allege that they have pled the level of substantial assistance necessary for aiding and abetting.

Appeals Feb. 10, 2014). The conduct of WFA acting by and through it's employee Cardenas establishes that the investment activities provided a mechanism to further the pyramid scheme, particularly by keeping illegal operations hidden from authorities and investors. Further, that WFA was aware of Cardenas' activities and continued to process Wanzeler's investments.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     2. Actual Knowledge\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The FCAC alleges that Cardenas, with knowledge by WFA (at some point in 2014), was opening and servicing WFA accounts after it had determined to cease services to all TelexFree related activities. Further the services were provided during the time when TelexFree's accounts were being closely examined by government regulatory agencies, and other financial service providers were refusing to do business with TelexFree. TelexFree's operations in Brazil, for example were shut down in mid-2013, that shut down was highly publicized, and WFA had knowledge of it. (FCAC \u00b6 1131). I find that the FCAC sufficiently pleads the necessary elements of tortious aiding and abetting.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    For the reasons set forth above, the Defendant WFA's Motion to Dismiss (Document No. 614) is granted as to the Third and Fourth Claims for Relief and denied as to the Tenth Claim for Relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
