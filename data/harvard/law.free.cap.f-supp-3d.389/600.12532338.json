Kitchin, Jr., North West Auto Body Company, and Mary Menke are property owners seeking damages and injunctive relief for radioactive contamination of their respective properties allegedly caused by neighboring West Lake Landfill, located in North St. Louis County, Missouri. Plaintiffs assert that their property has been damaged by soil, dust, and air contamination from improper generation, handling, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials by four corporate defendants who are landfill owners and operators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs originally filed this suit in St. Louis County Circuit Court on behalf of themselves and all other others similarly situated, pleading various state-law tort theories. Defendants removed the action to this Court arguing that the allegations arise under federal law - specifically the Price-Anderson Act (PAA) as amended in 1988,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202011\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which provides a federal compensation regime for damages resulting from a nuclear incident; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , which established a federal \"Superfund\" to clean up uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous-waste sites, and provides for liability of persons responsible for releases of hazardous waste at these sites.

I will grant the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 1942 to 1957, uranium ore was processed into various uranium compounds at a facility located in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, as part of the Manhattan Project - a United States research project designed to develop the first nuclear weapons. In the late 1940's, the Manhattan\n   Project acquired an additional tract of land near Lambert Airport - the St. Louis Airport Site (\"SLAPS\") - for storage of radioactive wastes from the uranium processing occurring at the downtown site. Contaminated scrap was also stored at the SLAPS site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the 1960's, some of the radioactive wastes were moved from SLAPS to a storage site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood, Missouri (\"Latty Site\"). In 1973, the defendant landfill owners and operators accepted over 46,000 tons of these radioactive wastes mixed with contaminated soil and used this mixture as daily cover for the West Lake Landfill located in Bridgeton, Missouri (\"Landfill\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Landfill is not a licensed nuclear facility. According to the plaintiffs, despite knowing that the Landfill was not permitted to accept radioactive material and was never an adequate storage or disposal site for radioactive wastes, the defendants nevertheless dumped the wastes into the Landfill and spread them over a large area. Plaintiffs claim that about 15 acres of the Landfill are filled with radioactive wastes at a depth of up to 20 feet. Plaintiffs contend that because of defendants' spread and improper storage of these wastes, radioactive material has contaminated soil, water, and air, resulting in the contamination of surrounding communities where their properties are located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A subsurface fire currently exists at the Landfill and emits noxious and offensive odors. Plaintiffs claim that defendants are permitting the fire to spread uncontrolled, which could affect the radioactively-contaminated areas of the Landfill and cause increased risk of radioactive exposure to persons in the surrounding area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As of December 31, 2004, the Landfill stopped accepting waste and is now used only as a transfer station. The Landfill is currently a Superfund site under the regulation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursuant to CERCLA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   None of the defendants have entered into indemnification agreements with the United States government with respect to the complained-of activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs' Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1995, plaintiff Kitchin purchased real property in Bridgeton, Missouri, adjacent to the Landfill. His family-owned-and-operated business, North West Auto Body Company, is located on the property. Kitchin first learned in 2017 that the property and the building housing the business were contaminated with radioactive material. Kitchin and his company contend that the auto body shop has lost significant business, revenue, and customers as a result of the contamination, and will lose future business and incur relocation costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff Menke owns real property in Bridgeton, Missouri. She learned in 2018 that her property and the structure on it were contaminated with radioactive material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs frequently experience offensive odors emanating from the Landfill. Samples taken on and around plaintiffs' properties confirm a highly-elevated presence of radioactive particles matching the fingerprint of the radioactive wastes dumped at the Landfill. Trees in the vicinity of the North West Auto Body property contain radiological and organic contamination. Plaintiffs claim that the radioactive contamination of their property migrated from the Landfill and was caused by defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   improper handling, storage, and disposal of radioactive materials. They claim that such contamination and offensive odors render their properties unfit for normal use and enjoyment, and have destroyed the fair market value of the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    The Amended Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their original petition in state court on February 20, 2018, and an amended petition on April 2, 2018. The case was removed to this Court on April 27, 2018. The amended petition remains the operative petition in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Named as defendants in the amended petition are the owners of the Landfill - Bridgeton Landfill, LLC and Rock Road Industries, Inc.; and the operators of the Landfill - Republic Services, Inc. and Allied Services, LLC. Defendant Bridgeton Landfill removed the action from state court with the consent of defendants Republic Services and Allied Services. In the notice of removal, Bridgeton Landfill averred that named defendant Rock Road Industries merged into Bridgeton Landfill on April 9, 2018, after the amended petition was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their amended petition, plaintiffs assert the following state-law claims against all defendants: (1) trespass, (2) permanent nuisance, (3) temporary nuisance, (4) negligence, (5) negligence per se, (6) strict liability/absolute liability, (7) injunctive relief seeking scientific and medical monitoring, (8) civil conspiracy, and (9) punitive damages. As relief, plaintiffs seek damages resulting from the loss of use and enjoyment of their property, for annoyance and discomfort, for damage to personal property, and for diminution in the market value of their property. Plaintiffs also seek recovery of costs and expenses incurred as a result of their exposure to radioactive emissions, including the cost of remediation and relocation. They also seek statutory damages under Missouri law, punitive and exemplary damages, costs and attorneys' fees, and interest on all of the requested monetary relief. Finally, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief enjoining defendants from continuing in the unlawful conduct, directing defendants to identify members of the class for compensation, and compelling defendants to clean up all contamination and to provide medical monitoring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the following reasons, I do not have jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims or over this action. I will therefore remand this case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v.

Under the Price-Anderson system, there is a ready source of funds available to compensate the public after an accident, and the channeling of liability to a single entity and waiver of defenses insures that protracted litigation will be avoided. In short, the PAA provides a type of \"no fault\" insurance, by which all liability after an accident is assumed to rest with the facility operator, even though other parties (such as subcontractors or suppliers) might be liable under conventional tort principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The PAA was enacted in 1957 as an amendment to the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954. The purpose of the AEA was to open up nuclear development to civilian industry. But because of the risk of extensive liability potentially facing entities in the event of a nuclear accident, civilian response to the AEA was limited. Accordingly, to remove this deterrent to private participation in the development of nuclear energy, Congress passed the PAA to 1) assure adequate public compensation in case of a nuclear accident, and 2) set a limit on the liability of private industry. As enacted, the PAA established liability limits for commercial power plants licensed by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) (now licensed by the NRC) through a combination of private insurance and indemnification by the federal government. For contractor-operated activities of the AEC (now contractor activities of the DOE), liability limits were established by federal indemnification alone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When enacted in 1957, the PAA provided federal-question jurisdiction over \"extraordinary nuclear occurrences\" only. An \"extraordinary nuclear occurrence\" was defined in the AEA as \"an occurrence '[t]hat has resulted or probably will result in substantial damages to persons offsite or property offsite.' \" S.

With the renewal of the PAA in 1966, Congress required licensees and contractors to waive traditional defenses of state tort law against claims of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence in order to facilitate recovery by plaintiffs. S. Rep. No. 100-70, 15, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1424, 1427.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 1975, Congress added a provision to the PAA to phase out federal indemnity for NRC licensees and replace it with a self-insurance pool-type arrangement. Under this arrangement, in the event that damages from a commercial nuclear power plant accident were likely to exceed the coverage available from private insurance, each NRC reactor licensee would be assessed up to a capped amount to pay a pro-rated share of the damages in excess of private insurance available.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For such accidents, therefore, the limited liability plan consisted of a combination of the maximum amount of private insurance and contributions made by each of the reactor licensees. The federal-indemnification plan remained in place for DOE contractors for DOE-contractor-related accidents. S. Rep. No. 100-70, 15, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1424, 1428. However, whether to enter into indemnification agreements with such contractors was at the Energy Secretary's discretion, based on the Secretary's determination as to whether the contractor's activities involved the risk of public liability for a \"substantial\" nuclear incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In 1988, Congress passed the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (\"1988 PAA\"), which, among other things, removed the Energy Secretary's discretion to indemnify DOE contractors. Under the 1988 PAA, federal indemnification to DOE contractors was now required for all nuclear activities, regardless of whether the risk of a nuclear incident was \"substantial\" or not. The purpose of this amendment was to guarantee to the public that the Price-Anderson system would be available to provide compensation in the event of a nuclear incident. Accordingly, the DOE was now mandated to \"enter into agreements of indemnification...with any person who may conduct activities under a contract with the Department of Energy that involve the risk of public liability[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202210\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20950.7006\">\n    48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 950.7006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 952.250-70.

When considered with the plain text of \u00a7 2210(c) and (d) - that public liability actions can arise only from activities under a contract with the DOE or in connection with NRC-licensed activity - I must agree with the court's observation in\n   <em>\n    Strong\n   </em>\n   that \"the terms 'nuclear incident' and 'occurrence' are inextricably intertwined with 'licenses' and 'indemnification agreements,' thus suggesting licenses and indemnification agreements are an integral part of the PAA's statutory scheme[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Strong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522773\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/283/759/#p763\">\n    283 F.

Nothing in the PAA - either originally enacted or through its evolution - provides that it is, or was intended to be, the exclusive remedy for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims involving nuclear radiation. Instead, as defined by Congress itself, \"The Price-Anderson system is a comprehensive, compensation-oriented system of liability insurance\n   <em>\n    for Department of Energy contractors and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees\n   </em>\n   operating nuclear facilities.\" S. Rep. No. 100-70, 14, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1424, 1426 (emphasis added). The stated purpose of the 1988 PAA amendments was \"to modify and extend the portions of the Price-Anderson Act that provide for public liability coverage for contractors of the Department of Energy,\" S. Rep. No. 100-70, 12, 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1424, 1425, and the amendments achieved this in part by mandating federal indemnification to DOE contractors (and subcontractors) for all risks of nuclear incidents arising out of their DOE-contracted activities instead of only risks determined at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy to be substantial. The amendments further achieved the intended purpose by removing the requirement that incidents be \"substantial\" in order to fall within the federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction. However, nothing in the 1988 amendments altered the purpose of the PAA, which is to provide a compensation plan and liability assessment for nuclear incidents arising out of DOE-contracted activity and NRC-licensed activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201426259\">\n    2019 WL 1426259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [I]n light of the PAA's concerns related to liability limitation and indemnification, the Court is not convinced that the 1988 amendments were meant to extend the reach of the PAA to activities not covered by applicable licenses or indemnity agreements.

D.) As alleged by plaintiffs in their amended petition, their damages do not arise from the use of the radioactive material\n   <em>\n    at the Latty Site\n   </em>\n   , but rather from the defendants' unauthorized receipt of the material and their unauthorized use of the material at an unauthorized site, the Landfill. Cotter's Source Material License did not cover its delivery or transfer of the material to such unauthorized entities. Nor did it cover defendants' activities at the Landfill. Cotter's license therefore does not provide a basis for federal subject-matter jurisdiction under the PAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201426259\">\n    2019 WL 1426259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   None of the defendants here is an indemnitee or licensee as contemplated under the PAA, and their alleged conduct\n   does not arise from NRC-licensed activity or under a DOE contract with indemnification.

They further contend that because plaintiffs allege that the Landfill is the source of the radioactive contamination found on their properties, and the Landfill is a federal Superfund site over which the EPA has exclusive jurisdiction, then the EPA likewise has exclusive jurisdiction over their properties under CERCLA.

Defendants argue that this jurisdiction also includes plaintiffs' contaminated properties because a \"facility\" over which the EPA has exclusive jurisdiction under CERCLA is defined as \"any site or area where a hazardous substance has been deposited, stored, disposed of, or placed,\n   <em>\n    or otherwise come to be located\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%209601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9) (emphasis added). Accordingly, defendants argue, because hazardous materials allegedly came to be located on plaintiffs' properties, those properties are necessarily within the EPA's exclusive jurisdiction under CERCLA. To take defendants' argument to its logical conclusion, then, even with a properly-pled claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , private property owners could themselves be liable under CERCLA because their contaminated property, for which they otherwise would seek to recover reimbursement for response costs, would itself be a \"facility\" even without release of hazardous material from their property. This is not a logical reading of CERCLA, nor does it further CERCLA's intended purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As to defendants' argument that the EPA nevertheless has exclusive jurisdiction over the Landfill Superfund site, nothing in the amended petition shows that plaintiffs seek relief that would require defendants to take action that would overlap with, alter, or contradict any EPA remedy that is being reviewed and/or or taken at the site under CERCLA. Indeed, nothing in the amended petition takes away from the EPA's jurisdiction over the Superfund site. CERCLA does not completely preempt state tort liability for damages caused by the release of hazardous substances,\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v.

Their argument as to the two-thirds requirement can be disposed of easily. In the amended petition, plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of themselves and of the putative class. The named plaintiffs in this action are Missouri citizens. As for the putative class, plaintiffs identify two subclasses whose members are limited to \"Missouri citizens.\" Although defendants argue that this class\n   definition runs counter to plaintiffs' intention to seek relief for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   individuals and businesses in the vicinity of the Landfill, it is well understood that plaintiffs are the masters of their complaint.\n   <em>\n    The Fair v.

I will not read into the amended petition the existence of non-Missouri-citizen class members where they are expressly excluded. Since the only class members in this action are Missouri citizens, plaintiffs have met the two-thirds requirement of the local-controversy exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I also conclude that plaintiffs have met the local significant defendant requirement. When plaintiffs filed this action and at the time they amended their petition, named defendant Rock Road Industries was a Missouri citizen, having been incorporated in the State of Missouri and having its principal place of business in Missouri. Although defendants aver that Rock Road Industries has since been merged into Bridgeton Landfill, an LLC whose membership structure shows it to be a citizen of Delaware and Arizona, I look only to the removed petition to determine whether the local controversy criteria are met. Accordingly, because there is no dispute that Rock Road Industries was properly identified as a citizen of Missouri in the amended petition that was removed to this Court, and this class action was originally filed in Missouri, Rock Road Industries satisfies the \"local\" defendant element of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It likewise satisfies the \"significant\" element. The first criterion is whether \"significant relief is sought\" from the local defendant. The second criterion is whether the defendant's \"alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims\" asserted by the proposed class. Again, I look only to the removed petition in deciding whether both criteria are met.\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086851\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1010/#p1017\">\n    631 F.3d at 1017\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As to the \"significant relief\" provision, I look to the relief plaintiffs seek from the local defendant, and not the relief that may be obtained from that defendant.\n   <em>\n    Coffey v.

The amended petition in this case seeks damages equally from all defendants. There is nothing in the amended petition to indicate that Rock Road Industries is a nominal defendant or that its subsidiary status undercuts the substantial monetary relief sought by plaintiffs. In addition, the amended petition seeks injunctive relief from all defendants, and nothing in the petition indicates that the injunctive relief sought is in and of itself insignificant or that Rock Road Industries would be incapable of complying with an injunction.

Discovery had not yet begun. Other than a within-district transfer between judges, nothing else of note happened in the case. Further, CAFA was not the only basis upon which the defendants removed this case from state court.
