However, while not the only purpose of the Entitlement Programs, providing housing assistance to individuals with disabilities is\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   objective of these programs. This is reflected in part by the fact that Congress specifically incorporated the protections of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act into the HOME and CDBG statutes.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 22, 374.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court held in its previous order that the extent to which compliance with federal accessibility requirements was a core feature of the Entitlement Programs is a question that requires more factual development and therefore cannot be adjudicated on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Sept. 27, 2017). Nevertheless, the City makes three arguments for why the Court should reverse course and find at this stage that it is implausible that compliance with the accessibility laws was essential to the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The City first argues, rather puzzlingly, that there was no \"bargain\" because the Entitlement Funds are allocated by statutory formula and are not awarded competitively.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   20:22-25. However, while the funding amounts may be determined by formula, HUD retains authority\n   to take various administrative measures in the event that a funding recipient fails to comply with the program agreements.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 313. Therefore, there is still a \"bargain\" because in exchange for certifications of compliance, HUD agrees to release the funds without imposing further restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the City points out that accessibility, accessible housing, and compliance with federal accessibility requirements in housing are not listed among the nine statutorily enumerated national objectives of the CDBG program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205301\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). It contends that this is strong evidence that accessibility is not a core aspect of the program.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   20:26-21:10. The City also made this argument in its motion to dismiss the original complaint, but the Court rejected it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. The Court adheres to its previous conclusion here. While the absence of any mention of accessibility in the statutory objectives of the CDBG program may be evidence of a lack of materiality, it is not enough to render the Government's claim completely implausible on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the City argues that \"if the Government is going to embrace the essence of a program, it has to embrace the entire program, including the remedies the City is entitled to expect.\"\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   21:11-12. By this, it appears to mean that HUD cannot bring an FCA claim until it exhausts all potential administrative mechanisms for recovering the funds at issue. This logic is difficult to follow. It is not clear why the availability of administrative remedies to deal with noncompliance would be evidence that the noncompliance was immaterial. As the Government points out, the fact that administrative procedures were created to deal with noncompliance seems to lead to the opposite conclusion-that ensuring compliance\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   important.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   20:4-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In support of its argument, the City points to the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Southland Management Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314416\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/669/\">\n    326 F.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2003) (en banc). While the court in that case found that HUD could not bring an FCA case against apartment owners it contracted with because the contract provided for other remedies, it did so on the basis that the claims submitted were not false, not that they were not material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314416\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/669/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314416\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/669/\">\n    at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the case appears to be an outlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314416\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/669/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314416\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/669/\">\n    at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jones, J., joined by five other judges, specially concurring) (describing the majority's reasoning as \"unprecedented\"). The City has not identified any provision of the FCA that requires an agency to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing suit. Such a requirement would be odd because, as is the case with many FCA actions, the Government did not bring this case in the first instance; instead, it exercised its statutory right to intervene after the suit was initiated by private relators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, the Court is not convinced by the City's arguments. It therefore adheres to its previous conclusion that at this stage, materiality can be \"inferred from the fact that the Entitlement Programs sought (at least in part) to provide accessible housing, which Defendants allegedly did not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    c. Significance of the Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In its previous order, the Court found that the more than two hundred alleged accessibility violations at the City's housing projects, along with Defendants' failure at the programmatic level to create accessible programs and services over the course of a decade and a half, were more than enough to plead that the violations\n   were substantial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The City has not raised any arguments on this point in their current motions, so the Court adheres to its previous conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    d. The Government's Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court now turns to the factor upon which the Government's previous complaint fell short: the actions HUD took after learning about the City's noncompliance with federal accessibility laws. HUD has been aware of the City's alleged noncompliance since at least December 2011, when it conducted a review of City and CRA/LA projects funded with federal assistance and \"consistently observed accessibility deficiencies throughout the various units, developments, designated accessible routes and common areas.\"\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 407-11. However, even after learning of these alleged violations, HUD has continued to provide the City with funding under the Entitlement Programs to this day.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 504-05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court noted that \"if the Government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not material.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2003\">\n    136 S. Ct. at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its previous order, the Court found that the fact that HUD continued to provide Defendants with funding after learning of their noncompliance with accessibility laws was \"very strong evidence\" that compliance with those laws was not material.\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20. It further concluded that the allegations in the original Complaint-in-Intervention were insufficient to provide the \"very strong counterevidence\" necessary to rebut this presumption of immateriality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    1. Whether Consideration of This Factor is Necessary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In the FACI, the Government has provided additional allegations in an attempt to show that compliance with accessibility laws was material to HUD's decision to issue funding under the Entitlement Programs. But before determining whether these allegations are enough to cure the defects in the original Complaint-in-Intervention, the Court first confronts the Government's argument that the Court need not consider HUD's actions because the allegations regarding the other three\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   factors (condition of payment, essence of the bargain, significance of the violation) are sufficient on their own to plead materiality.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   21:6-22:18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As support for its position, the Government points to the Sixth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Prather v. Brookdale Senior Living Communities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n    892 F.3d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2018), which was issued shortly before the Court ruled on the previous motions to dismiss and was not mentioned in the parties' briefing on those motions. In\n   <em>\n    Prather\n   </em>\n   , the Sixth Circuit reversed a district court decision that had drawn a negative inference from the fact that a complaint did not allege that the government had ever denied a payment because of violations analogous to the ones at issue in the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n    at 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit held that an FCA relator \"is not required to make allegations regarding past government action\" because\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   made clear that \"none of the factors it enumerated were dispositive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court went on to find that the relator's allegations going to the condition of payment and essence of the bargain factors were sufficient to plausibly allege materiality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n    at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Government argues that the Court should follow\n   <em>\n    Prather\n   </em>\n   's lead and find that materiality is adequately pleaded on the basis of the other\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   factors alone, without considering HUD's actions after learning about Defendants' alleged noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   21:6-22:18. But\n   <em>\n    Prather\n   </em>\n   differs from this case in a key respect. There, the relator did not make any allegations about past government conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517274\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/892/822/\">\n    892 F.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Prather made no allegations regarding the government's past practice with respect to claims that the government knew did not comply with [the relevant regulation].\"). In contrast, the FACI here contains extensive allegations about HUD's conduct after learning about the alleged noncompliance in this case, as well as actions HUD has taken in other instances of similar noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 407-520. The Court cannot simply ignore these allegations, especially when the Supreme Court has said that they can provide \"very strong evidence\" of a lack of materiality at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2003\">\n    136 S.

The Court's Previous Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In its previous order, the Court began its analysis with the fact that the allegations in the complaint \"[left] no doubt that the Government knew of Defendants' alleged misconduct in at least 2011 or 2012\" but nevertheless \"continued to provide the Entitlement Funds regardless.\"\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18.

But before delving into the details of specific allegations, the Court pauses to clarify what exactly the Government must show to counter the \"very strong evidence\" of immateriality supplied by the fact that HUD continued to provide Defendants with Entitlement Funds even after learning of their accessibility violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   At times, the City talks about cutting off funding (at least in part) as if it were a step HUD\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   take to demonstrate materiality in an FCA case.\n   <em>\n    See Reply\n   </em>\n   13:13-16 (\"At the end of the day, it is not the City's job to show HUD how it can use its authority to limit or reduce the Entitlement Funds in a way that still preserves the City's affordable housing efforts, while demonstrating that the City's alleged noncompliance with accessibility laws is material ....\"). But cutting off funding is not a statutory requirement. The decision to cut off, or not cut off, funding is relevant only to the extent that it is probative of whether a specific false certification was material to the Government's decision to provide funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   To be sure, the probative value of this factor is generally high; the Supreme Court has instructed that payment of a claim after learning that certain requirements were violated is \"very strong evidence\" that those requirements were not material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2003\">\n    136 S.

The Court concludes that the additional detailed allegations in the FACI, accepted as true, are enough to render it plausible that compliance with federal accessibility laws was material to HUD's decision to provide funds through the Entitlement Programs, notwithstanding the fact that HUD has continued, to this day, to provide funds even after learning about the City's noncompliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court's conclusion is driven by several factors. First, it cannot be disputed that cutting off funds under the Entitlement Programs due to accessibility violations would have serious collateral consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *19. The Government has alleged that the Entitlement Programs meet \"varied, vital needs\" related to an \"absolute crisis in affordable housing\" in Los Angeles.\n   <em>\n    FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 477. In other words, while providing accessible housing is one piece of the programs, it is not their only goal. Given the deleterious effect that terminating or reducing the Entitlement Funds could have on housing throughout Los Angeles, it is no surprise that HUD is reluctant to take that step when other, less harmful means of achieving compliance remain possible. This is borne out by HUD's regulations and procedures, which, in practice, render it difficult to terminate, alter, suspend, or restrict current or future grants unless the agency has concluded \"that compliance cannot be achieved through voluntary means.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 406. The FACI alleges in detail that HUD has already entered into a VCA with CRA/LA and has engaged in extensive negotiations with the City in an attempt to reach agreement on a VCA that would remedy the accessibility violations.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 407-45. Importantly, it appears that the negotiations have taken place since August 2018, giving rise to an inference that HUD is still actively pursuing voluntary compliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 473.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   These allegations, taken together, provide a cogent explanation for why HUD's decision to continue providing Entitlement Funds to Defendants after learning of their accessibility violations is not fatal to establishing materiality in this case. Specifically, they render it plausible that the time for cutting off funding has simply not yet arrived. It appears that HUD is still in the midst of following its typical practice of attempting to secure voluntary compliance before reducing or cutting off funding on the Entitlement Programs. In other words, it is still offering the carrot before wielding the stick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   This proposition is supported by allegations describing HUD's actions in similar cases. In instances of noncompliance with accessibility laws in both Hawaii and Puerto Rico, HUD first sought to enter into VCAs to remedy the violations before unilaterally cutting off funding.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 511-16. In both of those cases, the housing authorities agreed to enter into VCAs with HUD-something the City has yet to do here.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   However, when the Puerto Rico authority failed to fully remedy its violations within the time provided by previous VCAs, HUD informed the authority\n   that it would execute the \"third and final VCA as a goodwill last opportunity\" to bring the authority into compliance but that failure to come into full compliance would put its federal subsidies \"in immediate peril.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 516. This supports the Government's position that while HUD's primary objective is to obtain voluntary compliance, its patience is not limitless, and it may be willing to terminate or reduce funding if a jurisdiction persists in failing to comply with federal accessibility laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   This position is further bolstered by the FACI's allegations that HUD has denied the City the opportunity to apply for funds under the Choice Neighborhoods program and two lead hazard mitigation programs, specifically citing the City's failure to resolve accessibility violations as the reason for the denials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 446-58. The Court previously described these denials as the \"most persuasive evidence\" in favor of materiality but found that the original Complaint-in-Intervention did not provide enough information about the context of the denials to allow the Court to determine their significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *20. Specifically, the Court noted that the Complaint-in-Intervention did not allege how much money was withheld, how that amount compared to the amount of Entitlement Funds disbursed around the same time, and whether the reason for the denial was communicated to Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The FACI has supplied this information. It alleges that the City could have been awarded up to $30 million per year under the Choice Neighborhoods program and up to $3 million per year under the lead hazard programs.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 447, 457. This $33 million that the City was denied the opportunity to apply for in 2016 is more than double the amount of money it received that year from the HOPWA program.\n   <em>\n    See Los Angeles HOPWA Data\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Lisa Palombo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ex. 26\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 233-26\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (reporting that Los Angeles received $13,700,201 in HOPWA funding in 2016). Finally, HUD specifically informed the City that its applications were being denied because it had failed to resolve outstanding findings of noncompliance with federal accessibility laws.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 451, 454. These allegations, which are significantly more detailed than the allegations in the Complaint-in-Intervention, show that HUD denied the City the opportunity to apply for a significant amount of federal funds explicitly because of noncompliance with accessibility laws. This supports the Government's assertion that compliance with those laws is material to the agency's funding decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the FACI plausibly alleges that compliance with federal accessibility laws was material to HUD's decision to grant Defendants funds through the Entitlement Funds. While an agency's decision to continue funding even after learning of violations may generally be \"very strong evidence\" of immateriality,\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597555\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1989/#p2003\">\n    136 S. Ct. at 2003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the allegations in the FACI temper the value of that evidence in this case by presenting an alternative explanation: that HUD is still trying to obtain voluntary compliance before reducing or terminating funding-a decision which could have harmful collateral consequences. That is not to say that the Government has already proven its case. Additional evidence may be uncovered through discovery that cuts for or against a finding of materiality. But at this stage, the Government need only plead non-conclusory allegations sufficient\n   to render it plausible that the alleged false certifications in this case were material. The Court concludes that it has done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    B. The City's Counterarguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court now addresses the City's counterarguments, none of which it finds persuasive. While proceeding along several axes, they largely drive at a single thesis: because HUD has not reduced or terminated Defendants' Entitlement Funds in the more than seven years since it discovered their noncompliance with accessibility laws, it is implausible that HUD has ever considered, or will ever consider, doing so-rendering the false certifications immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   22:25-23:4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The City first contends that HUD has overstated the extent to which regulatory and procedural requirements limit the agency's ability to reduce or terminate funding and that the agency has the authority to stop any further funding now, if it wants to.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   22:14-24. This argument flows from what the Court believes is a false premise: that violations cannot be material if an agency attempts to achieve voluntary compliance before exercising its regulatory authority to cut funding. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   , or in the FCA itself, creates such a rule, which would be akin to requiring the agency to shoot first and ask questions later or risk not being able to bring an FCA claim. The fact that an agency may choose to pursue voluntary compliance first so that it does not\n   <em>\n    need\n   </em>\n   to cut off funding does not mean that the violation at issue is completely immaterial to its funding decisions or that funding will never be terminated or reduced if violations continue. The Ninth Circuit has recognized as much after\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   in holding that an agency's successful attempts to recoup funds through voluntary settlement agreements can be evidence of materiality even though the agency did not take unilateral action to limit, suspend, or terminate the funds at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519226\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1012/#p1020\">\n    909 F.3d at 1022-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Having determined that attempts to achieve voluntary compliance before reducing or cutting off funding are not fatal to establishing materiality, the Court turns to the City's next argument: that the allegations in the FACI lead to the conclusion that voluntary compliance efforts are as far as HUD is willing to go. If HUD will never consider reducing or cutting off funding because of accessibility violations, the City argues that the alleged false certifications cannot have been material to its payment decisions, as the FCA requires.\n   <em>\n    Mot.\n   </em>\n   22:25-23:4. While acknowledging that HUD has threatened to terminate or reduce its funding under the Entitlement Programs, the City contends that the fact that the agency has taken no steps toward doing so over the course of seven years while pursuing only voluntary compliance renders the threats mere \"government speak\"-in other words, posturing that is not probative of the agency's true intentions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519226\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/909/1012/#p1020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The City asserts that this is borne out by the allegations about HUD's actions in Hawaii and Puerto Rico because in both of those situations, HUD pursued voluntary compliance and entered into VCAs instead of terminating funding.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   2:28-3:4 (\"In short, the VCAs are further evidence supporting the City's position: across the board, where HUD has found non-compliance with federal accessibility requirements, it does not revoke payment, instead it continues funding and pursues compliance through negotiations and mutual cooperation.\"). As further support of its argument that the alleged ongoing VCA negotiations between HUD and the City are merely a fig leaf, the City points out that it has reached a settlement agreement with private parties in another suit\n   in this District,\n   <em>\n    Independent Living Center of Southern California v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 12-551 FMO (PJWx) (C.D. Cal. filed Jan. 13, 2012), under which it has agreed to several of the same requirements the Government has alleged that HUD would seek to include in a VCA, such as converting five percent of rental units into accessible housing.\n   <em>\n    See City Mot.\n   </em>\n   18:13-20:7. According to the City, through the\n   <em>\n    Independent Living\n   </em>\n   settlement, \"the City already, in essence, has a VCA,\" such that the alleged ongoing negotiations with HUD should not be viewed as legitimately aimed at achieving any benefit that the agency has not already received.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20:6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   These arguments are unconvincing. The Court agrees with the City in principle that an extraordinarily long period of negotiations toward voluntary compliance, with no steps taken toward cutting funding, could indicate that voluntary compliance is all that an agency will ever seek. But under the circumstances of this case, the Court does not believe that the negotiations have gone on for so long that it is implausible that HUD will ever try to do more than negotiate. To be sure, seven years is a long time in real terms. But the length of the negotiations must be viewed in context. As alleged extensively in the FACI, HUD provides the City with hundreds of millions of dollars that the City itself has admitted are \"critical\" to efforts to address homelessness and other major social problems.\n   <em>\n    FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 503. It is understandable that HUD would want to exhaust every possible method of achieving voluntary compliance before terminating or reducing the Entitlement Funds, given the disastrous consequences that such a decision could have. Accordingly, it is at least plausible that the seven-year period of negotiations toward voluntary compliance is reflective not of HUD's unwillingness to go further but rather its legitimate desire to be absolutely certain that the City will not voluntarily comply before taking the drastic step of cutting off funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Importantly, the allegations in the FACI strongly suggest that HUD has not acquiesced in the City's noncompliance but is still investing significant resources in\n   <em>\n    actively\n   </em>\n   pursuing voluntary compliance that will remedy the accessibility violations. HUD and the City engaged in negotiations on at least a dozen occasions in 2018, including as late as August 2018, only four months before the FACI was filed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 468-73. Under these circumstances, it is plausible that HUD's current efforts to secure voluntary compliance are not as far as the agency is willing to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   HUD's VCAs with authorities in Hawaii and Puerto Rico do not undercut that conclusion. While HUD did not cut off funding in those cases, this can be explained by the fact that the relevant authorities agreed to VCAs that remedied HUD's concerns-in other words, they agreed to come into compliance before it became necessary to cut off funding. The series of VCAs HUD entered into with authorities in Puerto Rico supports, rather than undermines, the proposition that while the agency is willing to cooperatively work toward voluntary compliance, its patience is not unlimited and persistent noncompliance may put federal funding in immediate peril.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 516.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The settlement agreement in the\n   <em>\n    Independent Living\n   </em>\n   case also does not say anything about whether accessibility violations are material to HUD. As the Government correctly points out, HUD is not a party to this agreement and has no authority to enforce it, so it makes little sense to say that HUD's continued VCA negotiations with the City cannot provide the agency with any additional benefit.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   45:14-16. Further, the fact that the\n   City has accepted the\n   <em>\n    Independent Living\n   </em>\n   agreement but has refused to agree to the terms of HUD's proposed VCA belies the City's argument that the two agreements would be essentially identical.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As explained above, the Court finds it especially probative of materiality that HUD has twice denied the City the opportunity to apply for approximately $33 million per year in funding under the Choice Neighborhoods programs and two lead hazard programs, citing the accessibility violations.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 447, 457. The City attacks this conclusion on three grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   First, the City argues that these denials have little value because HUD only denied it\n   <em>\n    the opportunity to apply\n   </em>\n   for $30 million per year in Choice Neighborhoods funds-which are awarded in a competitive process-rather than withholding funds that the City was otherwise sure to have received.\n   <em>\n    See Reply\n   </em>\n   9:4-19 (\"It was not a denial of funds, rather it was a rejection of an application to compete for the [funds].\"). But this distinction makes little difference. The bottom line is that HUD affirmatively blocked the City from even entering the process through which it could have received funding. From the City's perspective, the end result is the same: its application seeking funding was denied because of its accessibility violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Next, the City argues that the Choice Neighborhoods funds would have gone to a project run by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (\"HACLA\"), a co-applicant with the City, so the denial should not be viewed as a denial of funds\n   <em>\n    to the City. See Mot.\n   </em>\n   17:3-19. But the FACI alleges that regardless of who would ultimately have received the funds, the application was denied because of\n   <em>\n    the City's\n   </em>\n   outstanding accessibility violations.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 451. Accordingly, the denial supports the Government's position that HUD viewed\n   <em>\n    the City's\n   </em>\n   accessibility violations as something worth denying funding over, a factor that is probative of materiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The City also argues that the funds HUD denied represent only a fraction-0.5 percent-of the total Entitlement Funding provided.\n   <em>\n    See Reply\n   </em>\n   1:12-19. But it reaches this calculation by ignoring the $30 million in Choice Neighborhoods funds and counting only the $3 million in lead hazard funds.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As explained in the preceding paragraphs, the Court concludes that it is proper to consider the Choice Neighborhoods funds, and the City does not argue that\n   <em>\n    these funds\n   </em>\n   were insubstantial. Accordingly, their argument based on proportionality is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the Government has supplied a plausible explanation for why compliance with accessibility requirements was material to HUD, notwithstanding the fact that HUD continued to make payments to the City even after learning of the violations. Because the other\n   <em>\n    Escobar\n   </em>\n   factors also weigh in favor of materiality, the Court concludes that the materiality element of the FCA claim has been adequately pleaded. The Court now turns to the City's other arguments for dismissal of the FCA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Falsity and Scienter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The City argues that the FACI fails to adequately allege the falsity and scienter elements of the FCA claims.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   26:10-31:16. The Court previously concluded that the Government had adequately pleaded these elements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-12, and nothing in the City's current motion has persuaded it to depart from that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   With regard to falsity, the City argues that the FACI does not allege the false claims with the particularity required by Rule 9(b) because it does not identify\n   \"the specific certifications made, the individuals who made them, when they were made, how they were made, and the specific language that was in each certification.\"\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   27:18-24. The Court has previously rejected this argument, and it does so once again. As noted in its previous order, the FACI \"identifies specific programs to which the City submitted allegedly false claims, specific applications that were submitted, specific requests for funding, and specific failures of the City to implement the requirements of federal accessibility laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. Because \"[t]he individuals who signed the claims and the statements can be divined by the City,\" Rule 9(b) does not require the Government to include allegations on these points in its complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up). Accordingly, falsity has been adequately alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   As for scienter, the City once again argues that the Government should not be able to rely on a theory of \"collective scienter.\"\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   30:5-31:16. But as the Court previously explained, other courts have held that allegations of collective scienter are sufficient to survive the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11. Accordingly, the allegations in the FACI are sufficient to establish scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Arguments for Partial Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the City asserts three \"grounds for partial dismissal\": (1) that the allegations in the FACI are not sufficient to allow the Government to attempt to recoup administrative costs expended in connection with administering the Entitlement Funds; (2) that the FACI fails to adequately plead that the City did not \"affirmatively further fair housing\"; and (3) that the allegations about the City's failure to appoint an ADA coordinator and conduct self-evaluations are insufficient because they are \"demonstrably false.\"\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   36:12-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    a. Administrative Costs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The City argues that because the relevant regulations allow for Entitlement Funds to be used for administrative costs, there was nothing false or fraudulent about it using the funds for these purposes.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   36:21-37:7. However, the Government points out that HUD regulations prohibit HUD funds from being used to administer a program that discriminates on the basis of disability.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   58:13-20;\n   <em>\n    FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%208.4\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4). The City has not responded to this persuasive argument in its reply, and the Court concludes that it is enough to support the Government's claims based on administrative expenses at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    b. The City's Alleged Failure to \"Affirmatively Further Fair Housing\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The FACI alleges that the City falsely certified that it would \"affirmatively further fair housing,\" which, under the relevant regulation, required the City to \"[1] conduct an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice within the area, [2] take appropriate action to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis, and [3] maintain records reflecting the analysis and actions in this regard.\"\n   <em>\n    FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 288-89 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2091.225\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 91.225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) ). The FACI then goes on to allege several things the City could have done, but did not do, to overcome impediments to fair housing, such as ensuring that owners or developers followed federal accessibility laws or sanctioning noncompliant owners or developers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2091.225\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2091.225\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 291-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The City argues that the Government has not alleged that HUD\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   that\n   these specific actions be taken to satisfy the regulatory requirement or that there is even a standard for what constitutes \"appropriate actions\" under the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   37:8-38:2. But the Court agrees with the Government that the myriad alleged accessibility violations can speak for themselves at the pleading stage.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   61:3-27. Given the allegedly widespread nature of the violations, it is at least plausible that the City did not take appropriate actions to overcome impediments to fair housing choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    c. Appointment of an ADA Coordinator and Self-Evaluations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Finally, the City disputes the truth of the FACI's allegations that the City did not appoint a Section 504/ADA coordinator before 2012 and did not conduct a self-evaluation of the program accessibility of its housing programs, as required by law.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   38:3-39:3;\n   <em>\n    FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 269-71. In support, it relies on various documents that it contends are subject to judicial notice.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   38:3-39:3. Regardless of whether these documents are appropriate subjects for judicial notice, the Court agrees with the Government that it is inappropriate to consider them on a motion to dismiss for the purpose of undercutting the truth of the FACI's allegations.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   60:16-24. While these documents may be relevant to the issues in question, the Court cannot be sure that they constitute the entire universe of relevant evidence. A holistic inquiry into the truth or falsity of the allegations must await a motion for summary judgment when both sides will have the opportunity to put all of their evidence before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (reaching the same conclusion in a similar context).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Government has adequately pleaded all elements of its FCA claims. Accordingly, the City's motion to dismiss the FCA claims is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Common Law Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The City argues that each of the common law claims for negligent misrepresentation, restitution (unjust enrichment), and payment by mistake should be dismissed because the Government has not adequately pleaded materiality.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   25: 21-26:7. As the Court previously held-and the City does not now contest-the materiality standard for these claims is the same as for the FCA claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *32, 35. Because the FACI adequately pleads materiality with regard to the FCA claims, it does so with regard to the common law claims as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Next, the City repeats its argument that the Government cannot allege claims for unjust enrichment and payment by mistake because there was a contract between HUD and the City in the form of funding agreements or grant agreements.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   35:14-36:10. However, as the Court previously held, the Complaint-in-Intervention, and now the FACI, characterize these funding agreements as \"claims for payment or approval,\" not contracts, and these allegations must be taken as true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mei Ling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n    2018 WL 3814498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *33-34. And even if they were contracts, \"restitution may be awarded in lieu of breach of contract damages when the parties had an express agreement, but it was\n   <em>\n    procured by fraud.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203814498\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , at *34 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Glenn v. Hyundai Motor Am.\n   </em>\n   , No. SACV 15-2052 DOC (KESx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207507766\">\n    2016 WL 7507766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2016) ). Accordingly, the purported existence of contracts between HUD and the City does not preclude the Government from bringing unjust enrichment or payment by mistake claims at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Finally, the City argues that it cannot be liable for unjust enrichment because it did not retain any benefit from the Entitlement Funds; instead, it passed the funds along to developers who used them to construct affordable housing.\n   <em>\n    See Mot.\n   </em>\n   33:1-35:10. It is true that retention of a benefit is an element of common law unjust enrichment claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Landis v. Tailwind Sports Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268240\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/180/#p205\">\n    234 F. Supp. 3d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 205 (D.D.C. 2017). But as the Government points out, money is fungible, so while the City may have passed along the Entitlement Funds to developers, this likely freed up City money for \"other City priorities\"-providing the City with a benefit that it retained.\n   <em>\n    See Opp.\n   </em>\n   67:24-27. The City counters that \"HUD funds only support HUD programs,\" and so the City did not save any money because had it not received any Entitlement Funds, the specific HUD programs they went to would not exist in Los Angeles in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See Reply\n   </em>\n   16:9-17:11. However, while perhaps not alleged as explicitly as it could have been, the allegations in the FACI give rise to a plausible inference that the City would have devoted its own funds to the\n   <em>\n    purposes\n   </em>\n   served by the HUD programs. For example, the City told HUD that the Entitlement Funds were \"a critical component\" of its efforts to combat homelessness and other major challenges.\n   <em>\n    See FACI\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 503. Given the undeniable importance of these efforts, it is at least plausible that absent the HUD funds, the City would have spent more of its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   money on them. Accordingly, the FACI adequately alleges that the City retained a benefit and therefore states a claim for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Government has adequately pleaded its common law claims.
