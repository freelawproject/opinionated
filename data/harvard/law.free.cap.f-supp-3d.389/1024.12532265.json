BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a product liability action concerning Defendant's MemoryGel Silicone Gel Breast Implant (\"MemoryGel Implant\"). (Dkt. 1) The MemoryGel Implant is a \"Class III\" medical device\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") as safe and effective through the premarket approval (\"PMA\") process.

(Dkt. 11 at 3 (citing Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6 7)) Thereafter, Plaintiff alleges that she developed \"severely disabling and life-threatening medical problems related to lupus-like syndrome within a few months after the insertion of the silicone breast implants.\" (Dkt. 1 at 4) Plaintiff also asserts that Defendant \"failed to inform [her] via an informed consent about the origin of the product from a foreign country with the highest failure potential for silicone breast implants, the nature of material used in the implant and the life-threatening health complications related to the product failure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As a result, Plaintiff contends, her left breast implant ruptured which \"led to a severe systemic-chemical and heavy metal toxicity adversely affecting [her] entire body.\" (Dkt. 11 at 3 (citing Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 2, 2019, Plaintiff underwent a bilateral removal of her implants.

(Dkt. 11) Therein, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's claims are both expressly and impliedly preempted by federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant seeks dismissal of the Complaint on the grounds of express and implied preemption. (Dkt. 11) First, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff's claims are \"state-law tort claims involving FDA-approved 'Class III' medical devices that seek to impose labeling or manufacturing requirements that are different from, or in addition to, those imposed by the FDA,\" and therefore, such claims are both expressly and impliedly preempted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/\">\n    552 U.S. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675984\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/312/\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008) ). Secondly, Defendant asserts that \"to the extent Plaintiff's claims seek to enforce federal requirements that are not grounded in traditional state-tort law, her claims also are impliedly preempted under\n   <em>\n    Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/\">\n    531 U.S. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/\">\n    148 L.Ed.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In her two-page response to the Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff asserts that she was adversely affected by her implants and that as a medical practitioner she can attest to the harm that she suffered. (Dkt. 13 at 1) Plaintiff filed an Addendum to her response, in which she asserts that Defendant's implants \"were porous which led to the gel-leakage or gel-bleed from the time of implantation\" and \"in turn precipitated multi-system involvement due to the severe, diffuse toxicity and chronic immune dysfunction.\" (Dkt. 16 at 1) Additionally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant's \"[f]ailure to report syndromes that mimic serious connective tissue diseases as a rare adverse event in the 'Information Booklet' of the manufacturer, has led to the misdiagnosis, delay in the proper diagnosis and unnecessary treatments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notably, however, Plaintiff does not provide any argument in either the Response or the Addendum to challenge Defendant's assertions that her claims are entirely preempted by federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 13, 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant is correct that Plaintiff's claims are preempted to the extent that Plaintiff is seeking to recover for Defendant's alleged labeling or manufacturing requirements that are different from, or in addition to, those imposed by the FDA. Similarly, Defendant is correct that Plaintiff's claims are preempted to the extent that Plaintiff is seeking to enforce federal requirements that are not grounded in traditional state-tort law. Such claims appear to be the sole basis for Count II, and at least a portion of the basis for Count I, of the \"Addendum\" to Plaintiff's bare bones form Complaint. (Dkt. 1-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 78-104; 124-173). Just by way of example, Plaintiff alleges that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant breached its duty under federal law, and its parallel state duty, in failing to warn the FDA, Plaintiff and her physicians by not reporting the risk of serious defects and life-altering complications described herein that Defendant knew or should have known were associated with Mentor's MemoryGel Silicone Gel Breast Implants prior to the time of Plaintiff's implantations, including the actual level of risk and failure to\n   communicate adverse events similar to the injuries suffered by Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Defendant] also failed to revise the product labeling or otherwise communicate the true rate of occurrence of adverse events to the FDA, the IRB or to physicians based upon the adverse event information available to it through, among other things, the studies which it was required to conduct and the reports of adverse events and effects which it received.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 84, 128 (Counts I, 2)). It is well-established that any claims based upon failure to provide warning are preempted by federal law; therefore, such claims cannot be sustained in this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Riegel v.

A Complaint must be sufficiently clear to permit defendants a fair opportunity to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 8, 10. Rule 8 requires claims and defenses to be pleaded in \"short and plain\" statements. FED. R. CIV. P. 8(A)(2), (B)(1)(A) .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In light of Plaintiff's failure to comply with the requirements of Rules 8 and 10 warranting the dismissal of the Complaint, the Complaint must be dismissed. For the reasons explained above, should Plaintiff undertake to amend her complaint to comport with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the amended complaint must exclude claims that are preempted by federal law, specifically any claim based upon any federal requirement not grounded in traditional state-tort law, or that are based on any alleged labeling or manufacturing requirements that are different from, or in addition to, those imposed by the FDA.
