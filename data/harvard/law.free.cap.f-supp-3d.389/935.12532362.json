The first is that the \"general provisions\" of Regulation 7 alleged to be violated in claims one, two, and three do not ban VOC emissions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

Section XII.C.1.b requires that all storage and processing operations \"shall be designed, operated and maintained\" to minimize leakage of VOCs in the atmosphere. Plaintiffs have offered sufficient factual allegations to support this allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b658-66. In these paragraphs, as highlighted above in the background section, plaintiffs detail the evidence that they obtained over a five-year investigation of defendant's facilities including the numerous incidents of observed VOC emissions. Although plaintiffs could have been more\n   specific, Rule 8 does not require that level of specificity at this stage of the proceeding.

Defendant cites no law that requires factual allegations to be contained in one particular section of the complaint. And it's not surprising. The Tenth Circuit has rejected such arguments. In\n   <em>\n    Stanko v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit reversed the district court where the district judge dismissed the complaint because the plaintiff did not present his claims in a manageable format.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3982743\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/297/746/#p748\">\n    297 F.

ECF No. 19 at 8. I see no reason to reject plaintiffs' second claim simply because the alleged failures appear in claim two as opposed to the factual background section. As such, defendant's arguments attacking claim two fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Claim Three\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The third claim for relief is a CDPHE-only claim in which CDPHE alleges violations of multiple sections of Regulation 7, including \u00a7\u00a7 XVII.B.1.b, XVII.C.2.a, XVII.C.2.b, and XII.D.2.a(x). First, \u00a7 XVII.B.1.b requires oil and gas facilities and equipment to be \"maintained and operated in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions.\" While I agree with defendant that this section does not outright ban VOC emissions, I find that the facts alleged in the complaint create a reasonable inference that defendant violated certain provisions of Regulation 7. Like plaintiff acknowledges in its motion, \u00b6\u00b659, 61, and 62 detail observations of VOC emissions at 41 unique KPK tank batteries\n   over a five-year period. The observations detailed in the complaint make clear that approximately 25% of its inspections resulted in observed emissions. Although the regulation does not quantify what requires adequate air pollution control to properly minimize emissions, whether a 25% hit rate supports an inference of systemic design problems at defendant's facilities or whether defendant operated its tank batteries to minimize leakage is a question of fact which I will not decide at this stage in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant next argues that CDPHE improperly attempted to shift the burden to defendant to prove that it has developed, certified, and implemented a STEM plan as required by XVII.C.2.a. But as CDPHE points out, once emissions from a storage tank are observed by CDPHE, Regulation 7 shifts the burden to the owner or operator to demonstrate that it is complying with the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 19 at 11-12. This is a fair reading of the regulation's history, and defendant does not counter CDPHE's reading in its reply. As such, I reject defendant's improper burden shifting argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, defendant's Rules 8 and 12(b)(6) arguments are unpersuasive. Accepting the well-pled factual allegations concerning defendant's maintenance, design, and operation of its storage tanks as true and viewed in light most favorable to plaintiffs, I find that plaintiffs have met the pleading requirements of Rule 8(a) and have sufficiently stated claims to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Accordingly, defendant's motion to dismiss the first three claims is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Having determined that plaintiffs have satisfied the pleading requirements, defendant's Rule 12(b)(1) argument necessarily fails. However, defendant challenges the third and fourth claims for relief on another ground. I turn to that argument next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs Were Not Required to Issue a Final Administrative Order\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Relying on \u00a7 25-7-115 of the APPCA, defendant argues that the third and fourth claims are not ripe for judicial review because CDPHE did not issue a final administrative order prior to filing suit in this Court. ECF No. 11 at 4. In response, CDPHE argues that \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-121 and 25-7-122 authorize direct judicial action for injunctive relief and civil penalties without first issuing an administrative order.

With this statutory framework in mind, I now turn to the merits of the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From the outset, I note that this specific issue appears to be a matter of first impression. Neither party cites any case law nor has the Court located any Colorado cases that have addressed whether CDPHE \"shall issue an order\" prior to filing a lawsuit under \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 122. While the issue of whether \u00a7 115 is permissive or mandatory potentially could be a candidate for certification to the Colorado Supreme Court, neither party has made that request. Moreover, I believe the basic canons of statutory construction provide adequate guidance to answer this narrow issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"A court's objective in interpreting statutes must be to determine legislative intent, as expressed in the language the enacting body has chosen to use in the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v.

For one thing, it goes against the plain meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 122. For another, it would render the language of those sections superfluous. Had the legislature intended to require CDPHE to issue a final order before requesting an injunction, the clause in \u00a7 121 that allows the commission to seek an injunction in the event any person violates any emission control regulation would be unnecessary if CDPHE could sue a person solely for failing to comply with a final agency order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Even more telling is \u00a7 122, which makes no mention of an agency order. Rather, it gets right to the point: any person who violates an emission regulation or the SIP shall be subject to civil penalties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-7-122\">\n    Colo.

The statute makes one exception: \"there shall be no civil penalties assessed or collected against persons who violate emission regulations promulgated by the commission for the control of odor until a compliance order issued pursuant to section 25-7-115 and ordering compliance with the odor regulation has been violated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-7-122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Both parties argue that this exception supports their position.

Otherwise, as plaintiffs suggest, there would be no need for a special exception pertaining to odor violations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-7-122\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant, perhaps making the best argument it can, suggests that all other violations require CDPHE to issue a final order, but the recipient need not violate that order prior to the State filing suit. ECF No. 22 at 5 n.3. I do not agree with defendant's reading of the statute because that would produce an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nieto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11476087\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/993/493/#p501\">\n    993 P.2d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Statutory interpretation leading to an absurd result will not be followed.\"). I cannot believe that the legislature would require CDPHE to issue an order but care not whether the recipient violates that order prior to CDPHE filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, \u00a7 115 itself provides some insight into the legislature's intent for the use of \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 122. First, \u00a7 115(1)(a) states that CDPHE shall enforce compliance with the emission control regulations and the SIP \"pursuant to this article,\" meaning the entire APPCA, not just \u00a7 115.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2025-7-115\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25-7-115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a). This leads me to conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 122 operate independently of \u00a7 115. Next, \u00a7 115(10) states that any orders or requirements \"under this section,\" meaning \u00a7 115, \"shall be in addition to\" any other orders or requirements \"of this article.\" CDPHE argues that the other orders and requirements of the APPCA include orders from a court authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 121 and 122. ECF No. 19 at 18. I agree. The legislature carefully chose its language when referring to a \"section\" of the APPCA as opposed to the entire \"article,\" again leading me to believe that \u00a7\u00a7 115, 121, and 122 work independently of each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To me, the Colorado legislature intended to allow the State, through its attorney general, to sue in a court of law without requiring a final order from\n   CDPHE. As a judicial officer, I must give effect to the intent of the legislature. As such, I conclude that plaintiffs were acting within their statutory authority when it brought suit seeking an injunction and civil penalties notwithstanding the fact that CDPHE did not issue a final agency order prior to filing suit.
