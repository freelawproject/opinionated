INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this ERISA class action on behalf of themselves and former participants in NCR Corporation's \"top hat\" retirement plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs are former NCR executives or spouses of executives who participated in one of NCR's nonqualified retirement plans. These plans allegedly promised NCR executives that upon retirement they would receive monthly or bi-weekly annuity payments for the remainder of their lives and provided for surviving \"eligible\" spouses to be paid a portion of participants' annuities following the participants' death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, NCR improperly terminated the Plans to avoid making annuity payments. Instead, NCR paid out benefits in lump sums to plan participants, reducing the benefits plan participants would have received over the life of their annuity. NCR also adopted an interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse\" contrary to the plan language to exclude from benefits those spouses who were married to the participants when their plans commenced but got divorced before NCR terminated the plans. Plaintiffs filed suit against the Plan Administrator of the Plans of NCR Corporation\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenging (1) the alleged improper termination of the plans in Count\n   I, (2) the alleged improper use of a discount rate to calculate lump sum payments that were not actuarially equivalent to their annuities in Count II, and (3) the alleged improper interpretation of the plan to require that \"Eligible\" spouses be married to plan participants when NCR terminated the plans in Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties have each moved for summary judgment on Count III of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint that challenges Defendant's interpretation of \"Eligible Spouses\" to deny benefits to spouses who were married to participants on the date benefits commenced but who had divorced prior to the date of termination of the plans. Plaintiffs seek judgment in their favor on the question whether they are \"eligible spouses\" under the terms of NCR's Senior Executive Retirement Death and Disability Plan (\"SERP\"), and therefore are entitled to a spousal benefit under the SERP. Defendant has cross-moved, seeking judgment in its favor, asserting that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required before asserting their claim in Count III in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs originally brought this action as a putative class action on behalf of former plan participants and spouses. The only named plaintiffs were plan participants. No spouses were named as plaintiffs in the original complaint. In response to Defendant's first motion to dismiss, the Court dismissed Plaintiffs' claim in Count III without prejudice for lack of standing because the original complaint contained no allegations from which the Court could reasonably infer that Plaintiffs - as opposed to their \"eligible\" spouses, or ex-spouses - suffered a cognizable injury as a result of NCR's elimination of the accrued benefits of spouses who were married to participants when benefits commenced under the plans, but who divorced participants prior to the plan termination and payment of lump sums. (Doc. 26 at 38, citing Compl. \u00b6 106.) Because the Plan participants are not the beneficiaries of the spousal death benefit survivor annuity under the express terms of the Plans at issue, the Court noted that \"Section 1132(a)(1)(B) would not provide Plaintiffs Hoak, Fano, and Quick the right to assert a claim as to those benefits but would provide their 'Eligible Spouses' with a statutory cause of action as to their right to those benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) The Court allowed Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response to the Court's Order, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint adding a claim for spousal benefits on behalf of Patricia Giering, the former spouse of an NCR executive, as a named Plaintiff. Defendant moved to dismiss Patricia Giering's claim in Count III of the Amended Complaint on the basis that she had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Defendant contended that (1) Patricia Giering never filed a claim with the Plan Administrator seeking payment of spousal benefits, and (2) her former spouse John Giering (in seeking the payment of an additional benefit for himself) did not purport to bring a claim for benefits on Patricia Giering's behalf as her authorized representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court denied the Defendant's motion, finding evidence in the administrative record indicating that: (a) John Giering, who made a claim for benefits also asserted Patricia Giering's rights to her vested interest in the spousal death benefits in the form of a lump sum payment upon termination of the plan, (b) the Plan Administrator interpreted John Giering to make such a claim, and (c) the Plan Administrator expressly made a determination\n   that Patricia Giering, as John's former spouse, was not entitled to the benefits because she was not an \"Eligible Spouse\" under its interpretation of the Plan language. The Plan Administrator never asked whether John Giering was authorized as Patricia's representative to assert a claim to benefits on her behalf and never asked John Giering to submit a written authorization prior to making its determination of Patricia Giering's \"eligible spouse\" status and denying her entitlement to the benefit. To the extent Patricia Giering was herself required to separately pursue an administrative claim as to her eligibility for post-termination plan benefits, the Court found that such an endeavor would be futile under the circumstances presented here and that Patricia Giering was therefore excused from ERISA's exhaustion requirement with respect to the eligible spouse claim. (Order, Doc. 70 at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs moved for class certification of their claims. The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class and subclass with respect to Counts I and II, but denied the motion to certify a class with respect to Count III - the eligible spouse claim. The Court found that class certification of Count III was not appropriate in light of the information presented by Defendant, unchallenged by Plaintiffs, that only two former spouses, Patricia Giering and Nancy Parin, were denied benefits based on Defendant's interpretation of the \"Eligible Spouse\" Plan language. The Court therefore allowed Plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add Nancy Parin, Plaintiff Allan Quick's ex-wife, to join as a named plaintiff along with Plaintiff Giering for adjudication of their individual claims. (Order, Doc. 83 at 30-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The day after filing their Second Amended Complaint to assert the eligible spouse claim on behalf of Nancy Parin, Plaintiffs Giering and Parin moved for summary judgment on Count III seeking a declaration that Defendant's interpretation of the term \"eligible spouse\" is invalid and that they are entitled a spousal benefit under SERP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendant's Motion to Strike Portions of the Second Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant has filed a Motion to Strike Certain Unauthorized Amendments to Plaintiffs' Second Amended Class Action Complaint [Doc. 90]. Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs were granted a limited right of amendment only \"to add Quick's former spouse to pursue claims as an eligible spouse,\" but the Second Amended Complaint \"made numerous additional allegations and requests for relief, including some concerning issues having nothing to do with spousal claims.\" (Def.'s Mot. to Strike at 1-2.) Defendant notes that it \"consents to and will answer, most of the additional alterations made by Plaintiffs. Defendant does not consent, however, to the several changes that Plaintiffs have made seeking to alter and expand the Complaint's request for relief concerning non-spousal claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) Because Plaintiffs were required to seek permission for these amendments \"which are highly objectionable at this point in the litigation, after a class has already been certified,\" Defendant requests that the Court strike the additions that Plaintiffs have \"improperly made to paragraph 6 of the Second Amended Complaint and to the Prayer for Relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the Prayer for Relief is a repeat of Paragraph 6, for ease of discussion, a red-lined version of both Paragraph 6 and the Prayer for Relief are shown below:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   5.6.

Plaintiffs contend that they \"have added no new claims, theories or factual allegations, unrelated to the spousal claim the Court gave plaintiffs leave to amend.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)

As the former CFO of NCR Corporation and as a person knowledgeable in interpreting contracts, I carefully reviewed the terms of the Plan during the negotiation of the divorce decree. Patricia and I reasonably relied upon our belief, based on the clear language of the Plan, that Patricia Giering had a vested right as an Eligible Spouse to the benefits, Including any benefits payable to Patricia Giering on my death. See, John Glaring Affidavit attached as Exhibit I. This interpretation, which was used to decide the division of assets, was entirely consistent with the Plan language and with prior NCR's interpretation of the Plan as demonstrated by Ms. Gallagher's email to Mr. Mays. The interpretation was fair and reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-27, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   On January 14, 2014, the Plan Administrator for NCR denied John Giering's administrative appeal, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   You also appeal the Plan Administrator's determination that neither you nor your former spouse is entitled to the Additional Lump Sum based on a spousal death benefit. Having carefully considered the points in your appeal, the Plan Administrator has determined that your appeal twist be denied. As of February 25, 2013, you were no longer married to the individual to whom you were married on the date your SERP benefit commenced. The Plan states that only an Eligible Spouse is emitted to a death benefit, and defines Eligible Spouse as the spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence. The Plan Administrator interprets this language to mean that the Eligible Spouse is the spouse (if any) who is married to the participant both on the date that benefits commence, and on the date of the participant's death, or, if earlier. February 25, 2013. The Plan Administrator has determined that this interpretation is comet, because the starting point of the definition of Eligible Spouse is the Participant's spouse, which the Plan Administrator has determined is best read as denoting current spousal status as of the participant's death (or February 25, 2013, if earlier), the date on which any spousal tights to a death benefit ripen.

Allan Quick indicated in his claim that he agreed to the court-ordered divorce settlement payment under the belief that the SERP benefit would continue throughout his lifetime based on the establishment of Benefit Protection Trusts based on documents he received from the NCR Law Department stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   NCR has established two trusts for the purpose of securing benefits for which you may be eligible under your severance agreement with NCR and the supplemental retirement plans for NCR Officers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   NCR has transferred, to each of these trusts, funds for the purpose of securing these benefits....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)

The lump sum payout will make continuing the court-ordered payments to his ox spouse very difficult. This constitutes a significant adverse financial impact to the Participant and jeopardizes his ability to continue to comply with the court ordered alimony payments he has made since the divorce in 1992 Therefore, it is proposed that the Additional Lump Sum payment of $244,844.22, allocated on the NCR Pension Flan Statement for the Eligible Spouse, be made to Theresa Quick, the original spouse named in the SERP documents. This can be viewed as payout for the alimony that has been placed in jeopardy by the termination of the SERP.

The Participant's assertion in the claim is that he was harmed by the SERP termination. The \"Additional Lump Payment,\" intended for the \"Eligible\n   Spouse,\" was mention[ed] only as one possible means of satisfying the damages incurred by the Participant as a result of the SERP termination and the existing court-order obligation. Therefore, the Administrator did not address the basic claim when he determin[ed] that Theresa Quick was not an \"Eligible Spouse\" and neither she nor the Participant are entitle[d] to the Additional Lump Sum payment. The basis of the claim is that the Participant's accrued benefit was adversely affected by the Lump Sum Payment with its 5% discount rate and single-year maximum income tax.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   On February 5, 2014, the Plan Administrator denied Allan Quick's appeal, in language identical to that in the Giering appeal denial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   You also appeal the Plan Administrator's determination that neither you nor your former spouse is entitled to the Additional Lump Sum based on a spousal death benefit.

My claim is based on the expectation, based on letters from NCR law department, that my SERP benefit had been secured by a Trust and that I was safe in assuming my benefit would continue throughout my lifetime, barring NCR's insolvency, when I committed to a lifetime alimony amount based on my SERP benefit expectation.

In no event should the benefit be payable to the participant;\" (ii) the \"prior interpretation of the plan is correct and the plan does not provide for this benefit;\" (iii) \"even though Ms. Gallagher was not the Plan Administrator and did not follow proper claims procedures, Mr. Clark and Mr. Mays might have reason to believe that she spoke for the Company with respect to their benefits,\" (iv) \"based on Ms. Gallagher's correspondence, the participants may have entered a side-deal and/or may have detrimentally changed their positions in [ ] reliance on this side-deal,\" and (v) as a result \"there was a litigation risk that the Company would be required to pay the additional lump sum to the claimants' ex-spouses.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For these reasons, the Plan Administrator decided to \"grant the claims, notwithstanding the plan's terms, and to pay the additional lump sum benefit to the respective ex-spouses of Mr. Clark and Mr. Mays.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pls.'

CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Plaintiffs Patricia Giering and Nancy Parin assert that the plain and unambiguous language of the NCR Senior Executive Retirement, Death and Disability Plan (\"SERP\") entitles each of them, as \"eligible spouses,\" to a lump sum spousal benefit payment as a result of NCR's early termination of the plan. Defendant, in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, offers no substantive response to Plaintiffs' arguments regarding the proper interpretation of the term \"eligible spouse.\" Instead, Defendant limited its response and cross-motion for summary judgment to the sole question of whether Patricia Giering and Nancy Parin exhausted their administrative remedies. Defendant asserts that because neither Patricia Giering nor Nancy Parin filed administrative claims for benefits with the NCR Plan Administrator, their claims should be dismissed, (subject to a right to re-file in federal court, if they fail to obtain relief through the administrative process). The Court will therefore first address the administrative exhaustion issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Defendant argues that the Court's determination that further administrative exhaustion of the \"Eligible Spouse\" benefit would be futile was based solely on the pleadings and a limited set of documents. Now on summary judgment, however, Defendant relies on evidence in the administrative record that \"of the four total former spouses with potential 'Eligible Spouse' claims, two of them (that is, the two other than Giering and Parin) had their claims adjudicated by the NCR Plan Administrator, and both were awarded lump sums.\" (Def.'s Resp. and Cross-Mot. at 2-3.) Defendant contends that \"Giering and Parin cannot possibly show they would have no hope of prevailing,\" and therefore, the evidence irrefutably shows that it would not be futile for Giering and Parin to pursue administrative claims with the Plan Administrator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   With respect to Patricia Giering, Defendant repeats the exhaustion arguments previously rejected by the Court in the Order denying the motion to dismiss Giering's claim for spousal benefits. Defendant once again asserts that Patricia Giering has not exhausted her administrative remedies because: (i) she never submitted an administrative claim with the NCR Plan Administrator; (ii) John Giering's administrative claim sought the benefit for himself rather than for Patricia; and (iii) there is no evidence Patricia authorized John Giering to file a claim on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Additionally, Defendant asserts that Nancy Parin cannot be deemed to have exhausted her administrative remedies with respect to her \"eligible spouse\" claim because: (1) Allan Quick's administrative claim makes no mention of Nancy Parin, but instead sought the benefit for his first wife, Theresa Quick; (2) Allan Quick's claim with respect to Theresa Quick was in an entirely different posture because he divorced Theresa Quick before his benefit under SERP commenced; (3) Allan Quick expressly stated in his administrative appeal that he was not raising an \"Eligible Spouse\" claim; and (4) Allan Quick was not seeking a benefit payment on behalf of Theresa Quick, but rather was seeking an increased benefit payment to himself. For these reasons, Defendant argues that the Plan Administrator \"has never had a chance to consider Nancy Parin's claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Plaintiffs assert, in response, that Defendant's cross-motion should be denied because this Court has already determined that Patricia Giering is not required to further exhaust her claim for spousal benefits in light of the Plan Administrator's interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse,\" and that determination applies equally to Nancy Parin. Thus, Plaintiffs argue that any further administrative review of Giering's or Parin's spousal benefit claims would be entirely futile because of NCR's adopted interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse\" as precluding benefits for the divorced. Additionally, Plaintiffs argue that because NCR's\n   Plan Administrator failed to meet ERISA's minimum claims procedure requirements, Plaintiffs' administrative remedies are deemed exhausted as a matter of law. Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that: (a) NCR failed to provide Giering and Parin adequate notice of adverse benefit determinations; (b) NCR failed to follow reasonable procedures for determining who is authorized to act on behalf of a claimant; (c) NCR failed to provide Plaintiffs with the reason (it now claims) the Plan Administrator denied the Giering and Quick claims for spousal benefits; (d) NCR failed to establish and follow \"administrative processes and safeguards designed to ensure and to verify that benefit claim determinations are made in accordance with governing plan documents;\" and (e) NCR failed to apply its plan provisions consistently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In the prior Order addressing the precise arguments Defendant repeats again on summary judgment, the Court acknowledged that the analysis of the administrative exhaustion question is complicated by the Plaintiffs' allegations that Patricia and Nancy's administrative claims were brought and exhausted by their former husbands. The genesis of this complication appears to be one created by the Plan Administrator, not by the Plaintiffs or their ex-husbands. When it terminated its retirement plans and administered benefits to Plan participants in lump sum payments, NCR advised John Giering and Allan Quick that\n   <em>\n    they themselves\n   </em>\n   may be entitled to the accrued spousal death benefit payable as an additional lump sum payment under the Plan Administrator's eligibility criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   As laid out in detail above, NCR sent its Plan participants written notification of the termination of the Plan notifying them that their unpaid accrued benefits would be made in a lump sum payment. The letters included Nonqualified Pension Plan Statements for each SERP participant detailing the amount of the lump sum benefit, including an additional lump sum as the unpaid accrued death benefit of the surviving eligible spouse under Article IX of SERP. The letters,\n   <em>\n    addressed to John Giering and Allan Quick\n   </em>\n   as the SERP Plan participants, expressly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    You\n   </em>\n   may also be entitled to the additional lump sum payment as shown on page 2 of the Nonqualified Pension Plan Statement in connection with\n   <em>\n    your joint &amp; survivor annuity\n   </em>\n   form of payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to confirm that\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   are eligible for the additional lump sum payment, we must confirm the information requested on the Payee Information Verification Form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   (Pls.' Ex. C) (emphasis added). The Plan Statements further provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   If\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   meet certain criteria,\n   <em>\n    you\n   </em>\n   are eligible to receive an additional lump sum payment.

These letters and notices were not sent to the ex-spouses at issue who were derivative plan participants. Thus, it is not surprising that the Plan participant's claim for benefits might be read as asserting a claim for benefits on his own behalf, rather than on behalf of his eligible spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   None of NCR's correspondence with its Plan participants during the administrative claims process ever informed the participant that he could not assert a claim for the spousal death benefit on his own behalf (or on behalf of his spouse/ex-spouse). Rather, in its claim denials, the Plan Administrator stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   The Plan Administrator has determined that upon your death your former spouse would not be entitled to a death benefit under the Plan ... Since your former spouse is not entitled to a death benefit under the Plan, the Plan Administrator has determined that you are not entitled to the additional lump sum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   (Doc. 23-2 at 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 12-5 at 16.) Additionally, for the 63 Plan participants who met NCR's eligibility criteria under its interpretation of the \"Eligible Spouse\" provision (i.e. were still married on the date of the Plan termination to their spouse at the time of their retirement), NCR paid out the spousal death benefit as an Additional Lump Sum directly to the SERP Plan participant (not to the eligible spouse).

In an e-mail dated September 22, 2003, responding to an Inquiry from Tom Mays, another Plan participant, as to whether a divorce would extinguish his former wife's eligibility for benefits under the Plan, Ms. Gallagher stated that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   We consider the spousal benefit to be inalienable, regardless of what is In the divorce decree.

As the former CFO of NCR Corporation and as a person knowledgeable in interpreting contracts, I carefully reviewed the terms of the Plan during the negotiation of the divorce decree. Patricia and I reasonably relied upon our belief, based on the clear language of the Plan, that Patricia Giering had a vested right as an Eligible Spouse to the benefits, including any benefits payable to Patricia Giering on my death. See, John Giering Affidavit attached as Exhibit I. This Interpretation, which was Used to decide the division of assets, was entirely consistent with the Plan language and with prior NCR's interpretation of the Plan as demonstrated by Ms. Gallagher's email to Mr. Mays. The interpretation was fair and reasonable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25, 27-28, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   On January 14, 2014, the Plan Administrator for NCR denied John Giering's administrative appeal, again interpreting the \"Eligible Spouse\" provision as inapplicable to Patricia Giering:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   You also appeal the Plan Administrator's determination that neither you nor your former spouse is entitled to the Additional Lump Sum based on a spousal death benefit. Having carefully considered the points is your appeal, the Plan Administrator has determined that your appeal must be denied, As of February 25, 2013, you were no longer married to the individual to whom you were married on the date your SERP benefit commenced. The Plan states that only an Eligible Spouse is entitled to a death benefit, and defines Eligible Spouse as die spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence. The Plan Administrator Wapitis this language to mean that the Eligible Spouse is the spouse (if any) who is married to the participant both on the date that benefits commence, end on the date of the participant's death, or, if earlier, February 23, 2013. The Plan\n   Administrator has determined that this interpretation is correct, because the starting point of the definition of Eligible Spouse is the Participant's spouse, which the Plan Administrator has determined is best read as denoting current spousal status as of the participant's death (or February 25, 2013, if earlier), the date on which any spousal rights to a death benefit ripen. The Plan Administrator has further determined that the cases cited in your letter apply to funded plans qualified under Code section 401 and ERISA section 205, and do not apply to an unfunded, nonqualified plans not covered by Code section 401 or ERISA section 205, such as the Plan. The Plan Administrator has further determined that any agreement individually negotiated in the past between any participant and the Company apply only to the participant covered by such individually negotiated written agreement and is not applicable or relevant to any other participant in addition, the Plan Administrator has determined that, under the Plan, it may not add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Plan, or change or add to any benefits provided by the Plan, or waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility to receive a benefit under the Plan, and hat butter determined due under the Plan's terms it is therefore not permitted to provide a spousal death, benefit on the basis of participants' reliance when such reliance is not based on a Plan provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   In addressing Giering's challenge to NCR's interpretation of the \"Eligible Spouse\" provision, the Plan Administrator expressly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   The above determination regarding your former spouse is based on information that was provided to the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator may reconsider this determination should yon provide any additional documentation demonstrating that your former spouse is an Eligible Spouse under the Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.) Finally, the denial letter advised Giering that he had \"exhausted the Plan's procedures\" and that any claim or action \"in connection with a Plan benefit by or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary\" must be filed in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   Although the Court has provided a lengthy explanation, the conclusion is relatively simple. The Plan Administrator has determined that Patricia Giering, John's former spouse, was not entitled to the benefits as an \"Eligible Spouse\" under its interpretation of the Plan language because she and John were divorced. Thus, Patricia Giering's claim (asserted in Count III) that she is entitled to the lump sum spousal death benefit as an \"Eligible Spouse\" has been exhausted. To the extent Patricia Giering was herself required to separately pursue an administrative claim as to her eligibility for benefits, the Court finds that such an endeavor would be futile under the circumstances presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Defendant's argument - that there is no evidence that Patricia authorized John Giering to file a claim on her behalf - does not affect the Court's conclusion. On the flipside, there is also no evidence that John Giering was not authorized to assert Patricia's interest in the spousal benefits. More importantly; however, the Plan Administrator construed John Giering's administrative claims as asserting his ex-wife's right to the benefit as an \"Eligible Spouse,\" yet never asked whether John Giering was authorized as Patricia's representative to assert a claim to benefits on her behalf and never asked John Giering to submit a written authorization prior to making its determination of Patricia Giering's \"eligible spouse\" status and denying her entitlement to the benefit. The evidence shows that NCR denied the claim\n   and appeal based on its determination that Patricia Giering was not an \"Eligible Spouse\" because she was no longer married to John Giering - not because Mr. Giering failed to submit a written authorization form in support of her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Patricia Gieiring is therefore excused from ERISA's exhaustion requirement with respect to the eligible spouse claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Nancy Parin's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Contrary to Defendant's representation that Allan Quick's administrative claim makes no mention of Nancy Parin, he filed a claim for benefits with the NCR Plan Administrator on May 15, 2013 and included an NCR Payee Verification Form along with his claim identifying \"Nancy Quick\" (Plaintiff Nancy Parin) as his spouse on February 1, 1998 (the benefit commencement date). (Pls.' Resp. to Def.'s XSMF \u00b6 21; Pls.' Ex. J, Doc. 105-4; Def.'s Ex. 15, Doc. 93-19.) NCR required its participants to complete the Payee Information Verification forms to provide certain \"spousal\" information including, the identity of the participant's spouse on the date that the benefits commenced and whether they were still married to that person as of February 25, 2013 (the date the plans were terminated). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Resp. to Def.'s XSMF \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Ex. C, Doc. 88-3 at 6.) The purpose of the Payee Information Verification Form was for NCR to \"confirm\" that the participant was \"eligible for the Additional Lump Sum Payment.\" (Ex. C, Doc. 88-3 at 5; Ex. D, Doc. 88-4 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Allan Quick did not substantively assert an administrative claim for benefits under the \"Eligible Spouse\" provision on behalf of Nancy Parin. In fact, it appears he advocated against her interest in his administrative claim by requesting that the Additional Lump Sum payment instead be made to his first ex-wife, Theresa Quick. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 12-5.) Prior to his marriage to Plaintiff Nancy Parin, Allan Quick was married for 29 years to Theresa Quick. Allan and Theresa divorced in 1992, three years prior to his retirement. According to his administrative claim, Allan and Theresa agreed to a divorce settlement that included payment of a portion of Allan's retirement income, $2,500 per month or $30,000 per year, as lifetime alimony. Allan Quick based the alimony portion of the divorce settlement on the belief that the biweekly SERP retirement benefits would continue throughout his lifetime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Allan Quick married Nancy Parin on January 28, 1995, three days before his retirement on February 1, 1995. The Prenuptial Agreement between Allan Quick and Nancy Parin provides that \"the parties have agreed to marry on January 28, 1995, which is prior to Quick's retirement date, solely so that Parin's survivor benefit rights\" as Quick's spouse on the date of his retirement under the NCR Senior Executive Retirement, Death &amp; Disability Plan (SERP) \"may vest prior to Quick's retirement.\" (Doc. 23-1 at 17-19.) Allan Quick and Nancy Parin later divorced on November 28, 1995.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   After NCR terminated the Plans in February 2013 and notified Quick of its decision to issue a lump sum payment, Quick objected that the lump sum payout constituted a significant adverse financial impact by jeopardizing his ability to comply with his court-ordered alimony payments. To offset this hardship, Quick proposed \"that the Additional Lump Sum payment of $244,844.22, allocated on the NCR Pension Plan Statement for the Eligible Spouse, be made to Theresa Quick, the original spouse named in the SERP documents,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   rather than to Nancy Parin to whom he was married on the date his benefits commenced as indicated on the Payee Information Verification form. (Doc. 12-5 at 9; Pls.' Ex. J.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The Plan Administrator construed Allan Quick as having made a claim for an Additional Lump Sum benefit and \"determined that neither [Mr.] nor Ms. Quick are entitled to an Additional Lump Sum based on the death benefit for spousal benefits.\" (Doc. 12-5 at 14, 16.) The Plan Administrator's denial of benefits was based on its interpretation of the \"Eligible Spouse\" provision of the plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   Under its authority to interpret the Plan, the Plan Administrator has determined that a death benefit is payable only to an \"Eligible Spouse\" as defined in the Plan, and has further determined that an Eligible Spouse is the individual currently married to the participant on the date of the participant's death, provided that this same individual was also married to the participant on the date benefits commenced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Allan Quick explained in his administrative appeal that: (i) the Plan Administrator did not address the actual basis of his claim; (ii) the basis of his claim was that his accrued benefit has been additionally \"adversely impacted\" by the SERP termination and associated lump sum payment as a result of his commitment to lifetime alimony based on a portion of his SERP benefit, and (iii) his request for \"the \"Additional Lump Payment,\" intended for the 'Eligible Spouse,' was mention[ed] only as one possible means of satisfying the damages incurred by the Participant as a result of the SERP termination and the existing court-order obligation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The Plan Administrator denied Allan Quick's appeal, again without discussion of the basis of his claim that the lump sum payment constituted an adverse impact based on his obligations to his ex-spouse. Using language identical to that of the appeal denial of John Geiring, the Plan Administrator stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   As of February 25, 2013, you were no longer married to the individual to whom you were married on the date your SERP benefit commenced. The Plan states that only an Eligible Spouse is entitled to a death benefit, and defines \"Eligible Spouse\" as \"the spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence.\" The Plan Administrator interprets this language to mean that the Eligible Spouse is the spouse (if any) who is married to the participant both on the date that benefits commence, and on the date of the participant's death, or, if earlier, February 25, 2013. The Plan Administrator has determined that this interpretation is correct, because the starting point of the definition of Eligible Spouse is the Participant's \"spouse,\" which the Plan Administrator has determined is best read as denoting current spousal status as of the participant's death (or February 25, 2013, if earlier), the date on which any spousal rights to a death benefit ripen ... In addition, the Plan Administrator has determined that, under the Plan, it may not add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Plan, or change or add to any benefits provided by the Plan, or waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility to receive a benefit under the Plan, and has further determined that under the Plan's terms it is therefore not permitted to provide a spousal death benefit on\n   the basis of participants' reliance when such reliance is not based on a Plan provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.) Finally, the denial letter concludes by advising Quick that he has exhausted the Plan's procedures and that any claim or action by or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary must be brought in this Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Following the denial of both his claim and appeal, Allan Quick wrote in a letter that the Plan Administrator had once again failed to address the basis of his claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   Let me state again that I am not basing my claim on the 'Eligible Spouse' death benefit provision. My claim is based on the expectation, based on letters from NCR law department, that my SERP benefit had been secured by a Trust and that I was safe in assuming my benefit would continue throughout my lifetime, barring NCR's insolvency, when I committed to a lifetime alimony amount based on my SERP benefit expectation ... Please note that this has nothing to do with whether or not Theresa Quick was an Eligible Spouse or not? It is purely a matter of 'was the Participant's benefit harmed by the lump sum payout because of the court-ordered lifetime alimony commitment he made based on the SERP expectation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   (Doc. 12-5 at 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Regardless of whether Allan Quick did, in fact, assert a claim for spousal death benefits in the form of an Additional Lump Sum Payment on behalf of himself, Nancy Parin, or Theresa Quick, the undisputed evidence in the administrative record shows that NCR's Plan Administrator determined that neither Quick nor his former spouse (which would include by definition Nancy Parin and Theresa Quick) were entitled to such benefits because Mr. Quick was no longer married to either woman on the date of the termination of the plans on February 25, 2013. Under the Plan Administrator's interpretation, the definition of Eligible Spouse \"is best read as denoting current spousal status\" as of February 25, 2013, as \"the date on which any spousal rights to a death benefit ripen.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Although the Plan defines \"Eligible Spouse\" only as \"the spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence,\" the \"Plan Administrator interprets this language to mean that the Eligible Spouse is the spouse (if any) who is married to the participant both on the date that benefits commence, and on the date of the participant's death, or, if earlier, February 25, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, while Theresa Quick was \"in a different posture\" than Nancy Parin, the result of the Plan Administrator's interpretation is the same. In Theresa Quick's case, she would not be entitled to benefits under the plan language because she was not married to Allan Quick on the date of his retirement (the date his benefit payments under the plan commenced). In Nancy Parin's case, she would not be entitled to benefits under the Plan Administrator's interpretation of the Plan language because she was not married to Allan Quick on the date of the termination of the plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   In Count III of the Second Amended Complaint, Nancy Parin asserts that NCR improperly denied her right to spousal benefits despite the accrual of her benefits in 1995 when her then-husband Allan Quick retired from NCR and began receiving benefits under SERP. Parin challenges NCR's interpretation of the term \"Eligible Spouse\" as imposing the additional requirement that she be married to the Plan participant when the Plan was terminated. Based on the record and the Plan Administrator's unwavering interpretation of the Plan language, Defendant's assertion that the Plan Administrator \"has never had a chance to consider Nancy Parin's claims\" is claptrap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Because the Plan Administrator interprets \"Eligible Spouse\" to preclude Nancy Parin's entitlement to the spousal death benefit, requiring her to submit an administrative claim to the Plan Administrator at this stage would be an exercise in futility. Nancy Parin is therefore excused from ERISA's exhaustion requirement with respect to the eligible spouse claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant's Arguments Against Futility Are Not Persuasive\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Defendant argues that it would not be futile to require Giering and Parin to pursue administrative claims because: (1) it is beyond dispute that the SERP claim procedures remain open to Giering and Parin; (2) the Plan Administrator has sworn that it will give full and fair consideration to their administrative claims; and (3) both former spouses who did have their \"Eligible Spouse\" claims adjudicated by the Plan Administrator were awarded lump sums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Defendant implies that the futility exception applies only where a claimant has no meaningful access to a plan's administrative claim procedures. This is incorrect. The Eleventh Circuit discussed ERISA's exhaustion requirement in\n   <em>\n    Perrino v. S. Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   [A] district court has the sound discretion \"to excuse the exhaustion requirement when resort to administrative remedies would be futile or the remedy inadequate,\" or where a claimant is denied \"meaningful access\" to the administrative review scheme in place ... [T]he exhaustion requirement for ERISA claims should not be excused for technical violations of ERISA regulations that do not deny plaintiffs meaningful access to an administrative remedy procedure through which they may receive an adequate remedy ... Our exceptions to this doctrine where resort to an administrative scheme is unavailable or would be \"futile,\" or where the remedy would be \"inadequate\" simply recognize that there are situations where an ERISA claim cannot be redressed effectively through an administrative scheme. In these circumstances, requiring a plaintiff to exhaust an administrative scheme would be an empty exercise in legal formalism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <em>\n    Perrino v. S.

Thus, while sometimes the courts have analyzed the futility exception in the context of the issue of meaningful access to administrative proceedings, as the cases make clear, futility is a broader consideration than mere access to the administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Here, the Plan Administrator for NCR has already expressly determined, \"under its authority to interpret the Plan ... that an Eligible Spouse is the individual currently married to the participant on the date of the participant's death [or, if earlier, the date of the termination of the plan], provided that this same individual was also married to the participant on the date benefits commenced.\" (Doc. 23-2 at 13.) As the Plan Administrator has decided that divorced spouses such as Patricia Giering and Nancy Parin are not eligible for spousal benefits under its interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse,\" requiring Plaintiffs to go back now and engage in further administrative review would be unproductive, would serve no purpose, and would not provide them with a \"fair and reasonable opportunity\" to pursue their claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perrino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11456814\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/209/1309/#p1318\">\n    209 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1318 ;\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204591191\">\n    2011 WL 4591191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

However, there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding as a basis to require Plaintiffs to trudge through the administrative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   First and most notably, despite Defendant's characterization, neither Sandra Black nor Kathy Mays submitted administrative claims for spousal benefits to the Plan Administrator. Rather, their ex-husbands, Darrell Clark and Thomas Mays submitted claims for the Additional Lump Sum payment. Clark and Mays each relied on separate correspondence from Julie Gallagher, NCR's Director of Executive Compensation, which provided an interpretation of the \"Eligible Spouse\" benefit that differed from the Plan Administrator's interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan Administrator viewed the Gallagher correspondence as creating a \"side deal\" with the plan participants that may have induced them to rely to their detriment in their property separation agreements at the time of their divorce. Therefore, the Plan Administrator concluded that \"there was a litigation risk that the Company would be required to pay the additional lump sum to the claimants' ex-spouses.\" (Ex. 5 to Jacob Decl.) Although the claims were submitted by Messrs. Clark and May, the Plan Administrator decided the additional lump sum payments should be paid to their ex-spouses. The Plan Administrator made the decision to pay spousal benefits to Sandra Black and Kathy Mays, not because the Plan Administrator treated them as entitled to the benefits, but because of a perceived risk that NCR would potentially be successfully sued if they did not pay. Thus, if a similar exception could be made for the claims of Patricia Giering and Nancy Parin, the Plan Administrator could have made that determination when it was presented with the administrative claims of\n   John Giering and Allan Quick, i.e. the Plan Administrator could have settled the claims outside of the administrative process as legal claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Second, there is nothing in the record that Defendant or Plaintiffs point to that would suggest that John Giering or Allan Quick personally reached similar \"side deals\" with NCR (or received similar correspondence from an NCR representative) in direct response to inquiries by them about the spousal death benefit. If they had, the administrative record suggests they would have presented such documentation to the Plan Administrator for consideration. Like Clark and Mays, both John Giering and Allan Quick explained that they relied on their understanding of the Plan language in negotiating their divorce settlements, and Giering cited NCR's prior interpretation of the spousal benefit provision from the Mays/Gallagher email in support of his administrative claim. But in response to Giering's and Quick's administrative claims, the Plan Administrator determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-263\">\n   that any agreement individually negotiated in the past between any participant and the Company apply only to the participant covered by such individually negotiated written agreement and is not applicable or relevant to any other participant [and] that, under the Plan, it may not add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Plan, or change or add to any benefits provided by the Plan, or waive or fail to apply any requirements of eligibility to receive a benefit under the Plan, and has further determined that under the Plan's terms it is therefore not permitted to provide a spousal death benefit on the basis of participants' reliance when such reliance is not based on a Plan provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   (Doc. 23-2 41; Doc. 12-5 at 37-38.) To conclude otherwise on a second review of Patricia Giering's and Nancy Parin's entitlement on the benefits, the Plan Administrator would have to adopt a 180-degree reversal of its interpretation of the Plan language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Whether Plaintiffs' Claims Are Deemed Exhausted Under ERISA For Defendant's Failure to Comply With Statutory Claims Procedures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that even if further administrative exhaustion would not be futile, Plaintiffs' administrative remedies are deemed exhausted as a result of Defendant's failure to comply with basic claims procedures under ERISA.

Under Article III(1) of SERP, all \"determinations, interpretations and actions by the Plan Administrator under the Plan or with respect to any benefits thereunder\n   shall be made subject to the sole discretionary authority of the Plan Administrator.\" Article III(3)(a) gives the Plan Administrator the power \"to construe and interpret the Plan, decide all questions of eligibility and determine the amount, manner and time of payment of any benefits,\" under the Plan. Under Article III(4) the Plan Administrator \"shall have no power to add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Plan, or to change or add to any benefits provided by the Plan, or to waive or fail to apply any requirement of eligibility to receive a benefit under the Plan.\" However, Article XII provides that the Compensation and Human Resource Committee of the NCR Corporation Board of Directors (\"the Committee\"):\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   shall have the right, without the consent of any Participant, former Participant, Eligible Spouse or any other person claiming under or through a Participant or former Participant, to amend or modify the Plan or any agreement between NCR and any Participant thereunder from time to time or to terminate or repeal the Plan or any such agreement entirely at any time; provided, however, that (a) no such action shall adversely affect any Participant's, former Participant's, or Eligible Spouse's accrued benefits prior to such action under the Plan ... and (b) no amendment may be made, to the extent it would result in a material modification .. of the benefit of any Participant or former Participant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   The Eligible Spouse of a Participant or former Participant is entitled to an annual spousal death benefit under Article IX of SERP. The plan defines \"Eligible Spouse\" as \"the spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence.\" (Article I.) For purposes of this case, a Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence at the time of his retirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Article VII (providing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that a Participant \"who retires at or after his or her 62nd birthday\" or \"who retires or terminates employment on or after his or her 55th birthday and prior to his or her 62nd birthday\" is \"entitled to receive benefits under the plan in an annual amount ...\" in various specified amounts).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-306\">\n   At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the term \"Eligible Spouse\" is defined under Article I of SERP to mean \"the spouse to whom the Participant is married on the date the Participant's benefit payments under the Plan commence.\" (Article I.) Under this definition, the only qualification for eligibility is that the spouse be married to the participant on the date his benefits commence. The provisions of Article IX determine whether an Eligible Spouse is entitled to benefits under the Plan and proscribe certain limitations on benefit eligibility, none of which include divorce. For example, under Article IX \"no benefits are payable to an Eligible Spouse,\" in the event of the death of a participant who was involuntarily terminated prior to his 52nd birthday, the participant's employment was terminated for reasons other than death or disability, or the participant was discharged by NCR for fraud or misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   Nonetheless, after NCR terminated the plans, the Plan Administrator adopted an interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse\" as \"the spouse (if any) who is married to the participant both on the date that benefits commence, and on the date of the participant's death, or, if earlier, February 25, 2013.\" (12-5 at 37; 23-2 at 41.) Plaintiffs assert that the Plan Administrator's interpretation is contrary to the Plan language. According to Plaintiffs, the term \"Eligible\n   Spouse\" means exactly what it says. While the term \"Eligible Spouse\" might be ambiguous standing alone, the definition of the term in the plan is not ambiguous: an Eligible Spouse is the spouse of the Participant on the day he beings to receive retirement benefits. Plaintiffs' interpretation of the term \"Eligible Spouse\" is reasonable, as it follows the literal terms of the plan's definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   The Plan Administrator's interpretation is not reasonable. The Plan Administrator rationalized that its interpretation \"is correct, because the starting point of the definition of Eligible Spouse is the Participant's 'spouse,' which the Plan Administrator has determined is best read as denoting current spousal status as of the participant's death (or February 25, 2013, if earlier), the date on which any spousal rights to a death benefit ripen.\" (Doc. 12-5 at 37; 23-2 at 41.) But this reasoning is directly contrary to the Plan's language which ties the spouse's eligibility to a single point in time. To qualify for the spousal death benefit under the express terms of the Plan, the only date that matters for eligibility is the date on which the Participant's benefits commenced. \"[T]he date on which any spousal rights to a death benefit ripen\" is irrelevant under the express terms of the Plan. To qualify for the spousal death benefit under the Plan Administrator's interpretation of \"Eligible Spouse,\" in addition to being married on the date a Participant's benefits commenced, spouses were required to remain married until their husbands died, or until February 25, 2013, the date NCR terminated the SERP. If NCR wanted to limit Eligible Spouse rights to spouses who were married to the participant both on the date benefits began and on the date of the participant's death (or the date the plan was terminated), NCR could have included such language in the plan when it was drafted. It did not. The Plan Administrator has impermissibly and unilaterally appended an additional requirement beyond what the Plan provides that adversely impacts the Plan's beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florence Nightingale Nursing Service, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413570\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/1476/#p1481\">\n    41 F.3d at 1483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A claims administrator's decision is arbitrary and capricious where new requirements for coverage are added to those enumerated in the plan.\");\n   <em>\n    Helms v.

Nothing in the Plan language requires the additional requirement that the spouse remain married to the participant after his retirement in order to receive the spousal death benefit.
