(ECF No. 56 at 4, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) The parties dispute the size of the hail. Plaintiff claims the storm produced hail of up to two-and-a-half inches in diameter at the Property. (ECF No. 69 at 9, \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant claims that the hail stones were approximately one inch in diameter.

(ECF No. 56 at 4, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) The hail stones were approximately one inch in diameter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Inspection for Hail Damage in Early 2017\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A new property manager, HOA Simple, began servicing Plaintiff and the Property on January 1, 2017. (ECF No. 56 at 5, \u00b6 13.) HOA Simple was, at that time, also managing a similar condominium building less than a mile from the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) HOA Simple had previously filed an insurance claim for hail damage on the other condominium building arising from the June 2015 storm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 16.) HOA Simple decided, based on proximity, that if the June 2015 storm damaged the other building, it probably damaged the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   HOA Simple hired a contractor, LR Contracting, to inspect the Property's roof in February 2017, and the contractor reported hail damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) On March 14, 2017, Plaintiff hired C3 Group as its public adjuster to assist it in filing an insurance claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) C3 Group and LR Contracting then \"had conversations regarding which date of loss to choose for the ... hail claim,\" with the two candidates being the June 2015 and June 2016 storms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant was Plaintiff's property insurer from December 30, 2014 through December 30, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 1.) A different insurer covered the Property in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11, \u00b6 45.) Through some process (not obvious in the record), C3 Group and LR Contracting elected to make a claim for the June 24, 2015 storm, meaning a claim on the policy issued by Defendant. Accordingly, on April 5, 2017-about twenty-one months after the June 2015 storm-Plaintiff submitted a claim to Defendant for hail damage caused by that storm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendant's Initial Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant assigned a claims coordinator, Mr. Daniel Fossen, to Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (ECF No. 69 at 10, \u00b6 8.) Fossen received from C3 Group a report of weather data for the evening of June 24, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) The report purports to document hail falling at the property on that date, with a maximum size of two-and-a-half inches. (ECF No. 69-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fossen inspected the Property's roof on May 15, 2017. (ECF No. 69 at 10, \u00b6 10.) He identified hail damage that, in his view, was serious enough to merit roof replacement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a May 20, 2017 inter-office memorandum directed to the \"home office,\" Fossen memorialized his findings, preliminarily estimated that replacement cost was $72,000, and recommend releasing at least the actual cash value of about $41,000. (ECF No. 69-4 at 1-2.) He further stated that he would \"continue to work with [C3 Group] in attempts to come to an agreed scope [of work].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) A claims examiner at the \"home office\" responded to Fossen on May 30, 2017, in an e-mail stating, among other things, \"We should be hiring an engineer to determine if we can conclusive[ly] determine if there is old versus new hail damage.\" (ECF No. 73-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In a letter dated May 31, 2017, Fossen informed Plaintiff that Defendant was \"continu[ing] to investigate [the claim] under a reservation of rights. We are reserving our rights to afford coverage for this loss under your policy due to potential issues with a delay in reporting the loss.\" (ECF No. 56-1 at 155.) The letter went on to quote various potentially applicable portions of the policy, including the requirement that the policyholder \"[g]ive us [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Defendant] prompt notice of the loss or damage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 156;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 56 at 3, \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 8, 2017, Defendant's retained engineer, Mr. William Templeton, inspected the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, \u00b6 41.) He observed hail damage on the roof and concluded it most likely came from the June 2016 storm. (ECF No. 56-10 at 21.) His conclusion as to timing was based on weather data stating that all the hail events since 2015 produced hail of approximately one inch in diameter, meaning it would be difficult to distinguish between damage caused by one storm or another, \"[s]o it was just a logical conclusion ... that the most recent was the likely candidate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. This Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on June 23, 2017. (ECF No. 1.) During discovery, Defendant propounded to Plaintiff the following interrogatory: \"State when and how YOU learned of YOUR LOSS related to the hail storm occurring on June 24, 2015.\" (ECF No. 56-7 at 5 (capitalization in original, indicating defined terms).) In a response dated January 19, 2018, Plaintiff, through its Rule 30(b)(6) representative, Ms. Molly McDonald, answered, \"To the best of information and belief, [Plaintiff] discovered its loss related to the wind and hail storm shortly after its occurrence on June 24, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 56 at 9, \u00b6 32 &amp; n.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant also propounded a request for admission seeking similar information: \"Please admit YOU were not aware of any LOSS caused by the INCIDENT until YOUR public adjuster (C3 Group, Inc.) informed YOU of such LOSS.\" (ECF No. 56-7 at 12.) In the same January 19, 2018 response to the interrogatories, Plaintiff, through McDonald, responded to this request for admission with, \"Denied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 2, 2018, Plaintiff served amended interrogatory responses. Concerning the interrogatory discussed above, Plaintiff, through McDonald, amended its response as follows: \"To the best of information and belief, Plaintiff discovered its loss related to the wind and hail storm\n   shortly after its occurrence on June 24, 2015. Plaintiff does not recall how it learned of the loss.\" (ECF No. 56-8 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   McDonald was deposed on June 19, 2018. Defendant's counsel asked McDonald whether the amended interrogatory response was \"your position today.\" (ECF No. 56-11 at 26.) McDonald responded, \"No. I wasn't-we were unaware of any loss related to the hailstorm until we had [a] professional opinion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She then volunteered, \"I think I was a little confused about the question itself.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As for the request for admission in which McDonald denied that the information from C3 Group was the first Plaintiff knew of hail damage, she said she did not remember making that denial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff has never amended its March 2, 2018 amended interrogatory response or its January 19, 2018 request for admission response. (ECF No. 73 at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted, Plaintiff's policy from Defendant required \"prompt notice of the loss or damage.\" (ECF No. 56 at 3, \u00b6 2.) Defendant's primary summary judgment argument is that (i) Plaintiff failed, as a matter of law, to fulfill the \"prompt notice\" requirement, and therefore (ii) coverage is excused. (ECF No. 56 at 14-21.) The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Did Plaintiff Fail to Fulfill the \"Prompt Notice\" Requirement, as a Matter of Law?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A prompt notice requirement in an insurance policy \"means that notice must be given within a reasonable length of time under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Clementi v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104860\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/223/#p226\">\n    16 P.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (Colo. 2001). In the property/casualty insurance context, the duty to give notice \"arises when an insured, with reasonable diligence, can ascertain that the [the property has been damaged by a covered event].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104860\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/223/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff's early written discovery responses stated that Plaintiff knew of its damage shortly after the June 2015 storm. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part II.D, above.) Defendant insists that Plaintiff must be held to these responses, and that Plaintiff's backtracking during McDonald's deposition must be disregarded. (ECF No. 56 at 19; ECF No. 73 at 12.) Defendant analogizes to the sham affidavit doctrine,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that \"courts will disregard [an affidavit contrary to deposition testimony] when they conclude [after weighing certain factors] that it constitutes an attempt to create a sham fact issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Nimmo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1619841\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/796/1230/#p1237\">\n    796 F.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1237 (10th Cir. 1986). The situation here is closer to the reverse: deposition testimony contradicting a prior affidavit-although in this case, it was not a prior affidavit but\n   written discovery responses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant does not cite, nor could the Court locate, any authority for this \"sham deposition\" variant on the sham affidavit rule. That said, the principles governing the sham affidavit rule conceivably apply to the present situation. In particular, the requirement that the about-facing party provide a plausible explanation for its about-face reflects the need to prevent parties from changing their stories out of expediency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Genberg v. Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515918\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1249/#p1263\">\n    882 F.3d 1249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1263-64 (10th Cir. 2018). Here, McDonald provided no explanation other than a brief, generic reference to confusion (ECF No. 56-11 at 26), but neither she nor her counsel has ever provided a plausible explanation for this confusion. The question was simple: \"State when and how YOU learned of YOUR LOSS related to the hail storm occurring on June 24, 2015.\" (ECF No. 56-7 at 5.) The Court cannot perceive how McDonald was\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   confused about this question: once in her initial response, and once in her amended response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court need not resolve whether the sham affidavit doctrine may extend to the \"sham deposition\" context, nor whether the doctrine would prevent Plaintiff from reversing its position in these circumstances. The question of reasonable diligence in reporting an insurance claim is an objective one.\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104860\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/223/#p226\">\n    16 P.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Plaintiff insists that the hail stones falling on June 24, 2015 reached sizes of two-and-a-half inches in diameter. Accepting Plaintiff's (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the non-movant's) version of the facts as true-as the Court must at summary judgment, if supported by competent evidence-Defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that Plaintiff was not reasonably diligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Two-and-a-half inches is the diameter of a tennis ball.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   International Tennis Federation,\n   <em>\n    ITF Rules of Tennis\n   </em>\n   19 (2019) (in most contexts, tennis balls must be between 2.57 and 2.7 inches in diameter),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.itftennis.com/media/298557/298557.pdf (last accessed June 13, 2019). No reasonable property owner could fail to suspect damage from hail of that size, nor wait approximately twenty months (late June 2015 to February 2017) to\n   <em>\n    consider\n   </em>\n   inspecting the roof for hail damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that hail damage to a polymer-modified bitumen roofing system \"manifests itself in the form of faint, hairline cracks in a concentric, circular [pattern].\" (ECF No. 69 at 21.) Thus, the damage may be hard to see without specifically looking for it, particularly when obscured by \"alligatoring,\" which is the natural cracking that occurs to that kind of roof over time due to weathering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But Plaintiff asserts as much to explain why roofing contractors it sent to the Property's roof in February and March 2016 (between the two hail storms) never reported hail damage. Plaintiff insists it was significant that those contractors were hired to address unrelated issues, and \"[n]either [contractor was] asked to inspect the roof for hail damage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 5.) In other words, Plaintiff establishes only that contractors\n   not asked to look for hail damage might not see it. Even accepting as much, there is no dispute that when Plaintiff asked a contractor (LR Contracting) to look for hail damage, the contractor quickly found it. Similarly, when Defendant's adjuster (Fossen) inspected the roof for hail damage, he saw it immediately. And both sides' experts appear to agree that the damage from the June 2015 storm, if any, would have been visible immediately or soon after the storm itself. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 56-3 at 28-29; ECF No. 56-9 at 31.) Indeed, one of Plaintiff's experts concludes that damage from the June 2015 storm can be distinguished from damage caused by the June 2016 storm, if any, because the \"June 24, 2015 event was more severe than the 2016 event.\" (ECF No. 56-3 at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Plaintiff waited twenty months to arrange for a roof inspection after a hail storm that brought two-and-a-half inch hail, a reasonable jury could only find that Plaintiff failed in its objective duty of reasonable diligence. Thus, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on at least this much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Must Defendant Prove Prejudice from Plaintiff's Failure to Provide Prompt Notice?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant argues that failure to provide prompt notice, by itself, excuses it from coverage under first-party property/casualty claims brought under HOA policies-as compared to certain other types of claims, where the Colorado Supreme Court has held that the insurer must prove prejudice from a lack of prompt notice. (ECF No. 56 at 19-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The general rule in Colorado from the early 1900s has been that the insurer need not prove prejudice to be excused from coverage when the insured failed to provide the notice required under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marez v.

Otherwise, a highly significant question of substantive law (whether an insurer must prove prejudice from late notice) might be answered differently based solely on the difference between suing in state court or federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if the discussion of Vermont law in\n   <em>\n    Bernhardt\n   </em>\n   somehow gives federal courts authority to prospectively overrule state supreme court holdings regarding state law, the Court would not exercise that authority against\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   , for three independent reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   First, Plaintiff has not argued that the\n   <em>\n    Bernhardt\n   </em>\n   considerations-\"confusion in the [state court] decisions,\" \"[a] developing line of authorities that casts a shadow over the established ones,\" \"dicta, doubts or ambiguities in the opinions of [state court] judges on the question,\" or \"legislative development that promises to undermine the judicial rule,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031975\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/198/\">\n    350 U.S. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031975\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/198/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -counsel in favor of treating\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   as overruled.

If\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   was the Colorado Supreme Court's only recent word on\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   , the Court might agree that a substantial \"shadow\" had been cast, given\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   's apparent approach of limiting\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   to its \"no-notice\" facts. Then the question would be whether that is enough, on its own, to authorize a federal court to treat\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   as overruled. But\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   is not the only word, or the most recent word. In\n   <em>\n    Friedland\n   </em>\n   , the Colorado Supreme Court explicitly asked itself whether it \"should overrule\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   in whole or in part,\" and it explicitly limited itself to \"overrul[ing]\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   to the extent it applies to liability policies involving late\n   notice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9029305\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/105/639/\">\n    105 P.3d at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   confirmed the scope of this ruling.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6887739\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/951/\">\n    343 P.3d at 956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the degree to which\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   has suffered a \"fracture,\"\n   <em>\n    Bernhardt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031975\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/198/\">\n    350 U.S. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031975\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/350/198/\">\n    76 S.Ct. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is a matter over which the Colorado Supreme Court has chosen to exercise conscious control. Although\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Friedland\n   </em>\n   certainly raise questions about\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   , they also represent a choice to keep\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   in place for the time being, save to the limited degree announced in\n   <em>\n    Friedland\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, there is no warrant for this Court to get ahead of the Colorado Supreme Court on this important issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, even if this Court could read\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Friedland\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Craft\n   </em>\n   as the Colorado Supreme Court's authorization to apply the three\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   policy factors to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   notice-prejudice question,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court could not, in these circumstances, hold that the\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   factors counsel in favor of applying the notice-prejudice rule to first-party property/casualty claims. This is so because Plaintiff's only argument in this regard-indeed, its only argument\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   on whether this Court has power to impose the notice-prejudice rule\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   on whether the case law would otherwise justify it-is a single sentence in its conclusion that lack of a prejudice requirement would create \"the sort of 'windfall' that the notice/prejudice rule seeks to avoid.\" (ECF No. 69 at 35 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hiland Hills\n   </em>\n   's conclusion to this effect).) This is only one of the three\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   factors. The other two are \"the adhesive nature of insurance contracts\" and \"the public policy objective of compensating tort victims.\"\n   <em>\n    Clementi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104860\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/16/223/#p226\">\n    16 P.3d at 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendant argues that these two factors do not apply to property/casualty policies, at least those purchased by homeowners associations. (ECF No. 56 at 20-21.) The Court need not fully agree with Defendant on this point because Plaintiff has not responded to the argument and is therefore deemed to concede it. Furthermore, Plaintiff has pointed to no case, nor is the Court aware of any, demonstrating that the \"windfall\" factor alone is enough to impose a notice-prejudice rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To be clear, the trend in Colorado, as in the nation, is toward imposing the notice-prejudice rule. The odds are probably better than even that the Colorado Supreme Court will someday overrule\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   as to all or mostly all occurrence-based policies. But thus far the Colorado Supreme Court has consciously and affirmatively avoided that outcome, and there is no sound basis for this Court to finish a job the Colorado Supreme Court chose not to take up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Following\n   <em>\n    Marez\n   </em>\n   , then, the Court holds that the notice-prejudice rule does not apply in Colorado to first-party property/casualty claims brought under HOA policies. Coverage is therefore excused in light of Plaintiff's unreasonably late notice, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Bad Faith &amp; Unreasonable Delay/Denial Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff has also alleged claims for common-law bad faith breach of insurance contract and unreasonable delay or denial of insurance benefits under Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 10-3-1115 and - 1116. (ECF No. 1 at 6-10.) \"Having concluded that [Defendant's] denial of coverage was proper as a matter of law,\" Plaintiff's other claims necessarily fail because there is no coverage Defendant was obligated to provide, and Defendant therefore could not have withheld coverage in bad faith or unreasonably.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MarkWest Hydrocarbon, Inc. v.
