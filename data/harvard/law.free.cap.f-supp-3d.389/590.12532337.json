Plaintiffs filed a response on April 11, 2019. ECF No. 38. The matter is fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Schneur Cadaner is an Orthodox Jewish Rabbi and a member of Chabad Lubavitch, an Orthodox Jewish Hasidic movement. ECF No. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. He and his wife live in a house in Bettendorf, Iowa, where the Rabbi conducts various personal and public religious activities, including shabbat services, prayer, and bible studies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22-25. Chabad Lubavitch of Bettendorf advertises these services to the public with a website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant City of Bettendorf has zoning ordinances in place that restrict what land may be used for in certain areas of the city,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, and Plaintiffs' house is located in an R-1 Single-Family Residence District that requires a special use permit for houses of worship, Bettendorf City Code \u00a7\u00a7 11-6A-1; 11-6A-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board of Adjustment also has broad authority to issue variances apart from special use permits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11-2B-4(c). The City, through its employees, has sent three letters to Rabbi Cadaner regarding the Chabad and the use of the house for religious services. ECF No. 20 \u00b6\u00b6 27-29. The first two letters indicate that Plaintiffs need a special use permit or variance from the Board of Adjustment in order to use the property as a house of worship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   20 \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29. The third states that Plaintiffs might need a business license for home occupation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Rabbi Cadaner does not allege he ever responded to these inquiries or applied to the Board of Adjustment for a special use permit or variance. After the first two letters were sent, the Bettendorf City Council approved a new zoning scheme that allows houses of worship in R-1 districts as of right.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Plaintiffs' assertion of futility, however, overlooks at least three uncertainties. First, whether the City in fact treats the streets the land sits on as primary or secondary thoroughfares appears to be pure speculation. The letters Plaintiffs received, written by the City Planner and the City Administrator, encourage Plaintiffs to apply for a special use permit, suggesting they did not believe such a permit would be necessarily unavailable. Second, the Board of Adjustment may authorize \"variances from the terms of this title\" unrelated to special use permits, upon showing: \"particular hardships;\" that the variance would be \"in harmony with the general purpose, intent and spirit\" of the zoning code; or that the variance would do \"substantial justice.\" Bettendorf Code \u00a7 11-2B-4(c)(1)-(4). In other words, the Board of Adjustment had the authority to allow Plaintiffs' desired use if asked. Many of the same arguments\n   Plaintiffs make to the Court regarding the relative size of Chabad's meetings and the nature of the activities as nondisruptive,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 38 at 6, 12, would also be more appropriately made first to the Board of Adjustment to justify a permit or variance. Third, the zoning ordinance was recently changed to allow the houses of worship in R-1 districts as of right, suggesting that the City might in fact have been amenable to such uses. Plaintiffs' bare allegations of futility and hostility to their desired use are not supported by any alleged, non-conclusory facts, and the Court finds that Plaintiffs' efforts to obtain a final decision would not have been futile. As such, Plaintiffs' RLUIPA claim is not ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Had Plaintiffs participated in the local process immediately, they could have obtained a decision sooner, and at less expense than the cost of filing this lawsuit. Because Plaintiffs have not obtained a final decision as to the use of their land, the Court finds that their RLUIPA claim is not ripe and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B. Constitutional Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, in Counts I, II, and IV-IX additional constitutional claims for violations of their rights to Free Exercise, Due Process, and Equal Protection under the Federal and Iowa Constitutions. Each of these claims arises from the same underlying facts as Plaintiffs' RLUIPA claim: City ordinances required permits or licenses for Plaintiffs to use the property as a house of worship. Other courts have held that the same finality requirement that applies to RLUIPA claims also applies to related constitutional claims arising from zoning laws or other land-use regulations. The finality requirement applies to related free exercise claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miles Christi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078159\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/533/#p537\">\n    629 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   536 ;\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9178508\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/342/#p351\">\n    402 F.3d at 350, 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Eighth Circuit has previously subjected due process and equal protection claims to the finality inquiry when those claims were based on land use challenges,\n   <em>\n    McKenzie\n   </em>\n   , 112 F.3d at 317 ;\n   <em>\n    Christopher Lake Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531496\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/1269/#p1273\">\n    35 F.3d at 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guatay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711354\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/957/#p979\">\n    670 F.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]uch procedural due process claims ripen only when it is clear that a distinct deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest in liberty or property has already occurred ....\");\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The nature of the finality requirement is also such that the final decision from the local authority informs the actual injury to Plaintiffs, and courts are not well-situated to address that injury prior to a final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs contend that they were distinctly harmed by both the requirements that they seek a permit or license, and by the receipts of the notices themselves, such that those claims are independently ripe.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 38 \u00b6\u00b6 33-37, 44-48.

Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants publicized the notices, for example, or interfered in any other way beyond referring Plaintiffs to them. And, as noted, an appeal to the Board of Adjustment would also have stayed other proceedings, limiting any immediate harm from the City's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When courts have chosen not to apply\n   <em>\n    Williamson County\n   </em>\n   's finality requirement, they have done so when the land-use regulation was changed to impose additional burdens\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff acquired the land, or when the regulation was targeted towards a specific plaintiff. The Eighth Circuit found a challenge to a city ordinance ripe when, after apparently being given approval for the use of property for a halfway house, \"the City amended the zoning ordinances by adding half-way houses to the list of conditional uses\" in the district after \"some opposition to it was raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Bannum, Inc. v.

To ignore the finality requirement in these circumstances would render it a nullity and undermine its purposes in both allowing local disputes to resolve themselves and complete the record for the reviewing court.

In\n    <em>\n     Knick\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court explained that it was \"not question[ing] the validity of [\n    <em>\n     Williamson County\n    </em>\n    's ] finality requirement.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202552486\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12620608\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/2162/\">\n     139 S.Ct. 2162\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202552486\">\n     2019 WL 2552486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4. Nor does the reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Knick\n    </em>\n    challenge the vitality of the finality requirement. The Supreme Court addressed the effect of later precedent holding that takings claims previously adjudicated in state court were barred by the full faith and credit statute from being litigated in federal court.\n    <em>\n     San Remo Hotel, L.P. v. City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209191\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/323/\">\n     545 U.S. 323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209191\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/323/\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2491\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209191\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/323/\">\n     162 L.Ed.2d 315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005). Therefore, \"[t]he adverse state court decision that, according to\n    <em>\n     Williamson County\n    </em>\n    , gave rise to a ripe federal takings claim simultaneously barred that claim, preventing the federal court from ever considering it.\"\n    <em>\n     Knick\n    </em>\n    , 139 S.Ct. at ----,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%202552486\">\n     2019 WL 2552486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5. Seeking a final decision from a local administrative body, however, does not implicate this state-litigation dilemma, and\n    <em>\n     Knick\n    </em>\n    does not affect the analysis here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Plaintiffs make no argument as to why further inquiry as to the business license application would be futile.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The zoning ordinance was changed after Plaintiffs received notice of the zoning laws, and any harm from their failure to seek a variance before the change is a result of their own inaction. \"[T]he Court finds that Plaintiff[s] cannot escape the requirements [of finality] simply by prematurely filing a case in federal court.\"\n    <em>\n     New Life Evangelistic Ctr.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206509338\">\n     2015 WL 6509338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
