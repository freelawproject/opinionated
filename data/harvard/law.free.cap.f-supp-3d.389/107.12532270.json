He was convicted on December 10, 2007. On June 9, 2008, relying on the presentence report (\"PSR\"), the Court imposed a sentence of 204 months imprisonment, which included a sentence enhancement pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"). The PSR deemed Charlton an Armed Career Criminal based on two Massachusetts state court convictions for \"serious drug offenses\" and three Massachusetts state court convictions for \"violent felonies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The two serious drug offenses identified by the PSR were convictions for the distribution of crack cocaine. Both drug sales occurred during the early morning hours of March 23, 1996 in the same location. At 12:25 AM, Charlton sold three plastic bags of crack cocaine to two individuals identified as Curtis Fitzpatrick and Malik Shabazz. Then, at 1:00 AM, Charlton sold one rock of crack cocaine to an individual identified as John Ward. Both sales were observed by Boston police officers and, following the second sale, the officers arrested Charlton. Charlton was sentenced for both drug offenses on the same date. The PSR drew the details of both incidents from the same Boston Police report. The three violent felonies identified by the PSR were convictions for (1) assault by means of a dangerous weapon (\"ADW\"); (2) assault and battery to collect a loan (\"ABCL\"); and (3) assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (\"ABDW\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 16, 2008, Charlton appealed his sentence on the basis,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the ACCA enhancement was inapplicable because the Government did not prove the ACCA predicate convictions beyond a reasonable doubt. The First Circuit denied Charlton's appeal and affirmed his sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Charlton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4224162\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/43/#p55\">\n    600 F.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (1st Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 5, 2011, Charlton then moved this Court to vacate his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2255. Charlton argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the ACCA enhancement was inapplicable because he did not have three qualifying predicate offenses. Specifically, Charlton argued that his only predicate offenses were (1) a single serious drug offense for distribution of crack cocaine, and (2) a single violent felony for ADW. On January 2, 2013, the Court denied Charlton's motion\n   to vacate his sentence. The Court found that Charlton's ABDW conviction also constituted a violent felony and, therefore, he had at least three ACCA predicate offenses. The Court did not address Charlton's argument that the two serious drug offenses identified in the PSR should be treated as a single offense for ACCA purposes. On October 28, 2014, Charlton appealed the Court's ruling on his \u00a7 2255 motion, but the First Circuit ultimately dismissed the appeal for want of diligent prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The present motion was initiated when Charlton filed a letter with the Court on June 3, 3016, seeking the appointment of counsel for assistance with a potential claim for relief under\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

(entry dated 7/22/2016) (one-page motion for reduction of sentence under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and request for appointment of counsel), the Court confirms that the operative date for Charlton's \u00a7 2255 motion was June 3, 2016. Therefore, his motion is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the alternative, the Government argues that the Court should deem Charlton's motion untimely to the extent it raises arguments that are not based on Johnson II. Specifically, the Government wants the Court to find that Charlton's argument concerning his two serious drug offense predicates is not timely because it was not expressly raised in his June 3, 2016 letter motion. Rather, it was first raised by Charlton's court-appointed attorney in a brief submitted on April 30, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court does not need to rely on relation back principles to find that Charlton's argument is timely. Charlton's June 3, 2016 letter motion expressed his intention to challenge his ACCA sentence enhancement in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Johnson II (and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   ). This can be fairly construed to encompass all his\n   arguments relating to his ACCA predicates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p106\">\n    429 U.S. at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p106\">\n    97 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After all, Charlton raised the exact same argument regarding his serious drug offense predicates in his original \u00a7 2255 motion. The Court did not address that argument at the time because it concluded that Charlton had three ACCA predicates notwithstanding the question of whether he had one or two serious drug offense predicates. The Supreme Court's subsequent decision in Johnson II not only provided Charlton with a fresh basis to challenge his violent felony predicates, but it also made his arguments related to his serious drug offense predicates relevant again. Because Charlton must succeed on both sets of arguments to vacate his sentence, the Court reads his June 3, 2016 letter as stating his intention to raise both sets of arguments in his \u00a7 2255 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even if this were not the case, however, Charlton's challenge to his serious drug offense predicates would relate back to the date of his letter motion. \" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 governs amendments to habeas petitions in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Charlton's \u00a7 2255 motion challenges his classification as an Armed Career Criminal based on the predicate offenses identified in the PSR and adopted by the Court at his sentencing.

This leaves three offenses in dispute, none of which can be deemed an ACCA predicate if Charlton is to succeed on his motion to vacate his sentence. Thus, Charlton's motion turns on two legal issues. First, whether his ABCL and ABDW convictions are valid predicate offenses under the ACCA's force clause. Second, whether his two convictions for serious drug offenses constitute separate ACCA predicates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a.

In both cases, the First Circuit had in mind the situation where the law changed between the time of sentencing and direct appeal, such that it would be unfair to shift the burden to the defendant because he had no incentive to hold the Government to its\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   burden in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Serrano-Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181250\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/838/#p847\">\n    784 F.3d at 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This same principle applies to a Johnson II -based \u00a7 2255 motion. Where, as here, Johnson II was decided after Charlton's original sentencing and direct appeal, the Court will not shift the burden from the Government to prove that the charged predicate offenses satisfy the ACCA's force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As it happens, there is one\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   -approved document already in the record from Charlton's prior \u00a7 2255 motion. The relevant portions of Charlton's ABDW plea colloquy, however, do not establish whether he pleaded guilty to the intentional or reckless form of the offense. The Government has not produced any additional\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents. Since it is the Government's burden to do so, and the only available\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   document is inconclusive as to whether Charlton was convicted of the intentional or reckless form of ABDW, the Court concludes that Charlton's ABDW conviction is not a valid ACCA predicate offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275117\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/14/#p19\">\n    881 F.3d at 23-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b.

As it stands, Charlton still has one violent felony and two possible serious drug offense predicates. There is no dispute that his convictions for the sale of crack cocaine are \"serious drug offenses\" within the meaning of the ACCA. Rather, Charlton contends that the convictions did not occur \"on occasions different from one another,\" and, therefore, they cannot be counted as separate predicate offenses.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In opposition, the Government first argues that Charlton cannot raise this argument in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. In its order allowing Charlton's \u00a7 2255 motion to proceed, the First Circuit noted that this Court still would have to resolve \"the question whether, given the history of his criminal and habeas proceedings, Charlton may challenge the treatment of his predicate drug convictions at this juncture.\" Dkt. No. 232. Although the Court concludes that Charlton has timely raised his challenge to his drug offense predicates, whether it can be raised in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion is a separate question. Section 2255(h) requires for a second or successive motion to proceed it must \"contain ... a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263628\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/72/#p78\">\n    871 F.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring district court perform gatekeeping function for second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions). There is no doubt that that Charlton's serious drug offences argument, standing alone, does not rely on a new rule of constitutional law. After all, Charlton raised precisely the same argument in his original \u00a7 2255 motion prior to the Supreme Court's decision Johnson II. But Charlton is re-raising his argument now in conjunction with other arguments that are newly available under Johnson II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The question, then, is whether Charlton's serious drug offences argument is sufficiently related to his Johnson II -based arguments to be permissible in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The Government argues that the Court must conduct a claim-by-claim analysis of Charlton's motion and reject any claims not based exclusively on a new rule of constitutional law, i.e., his argument regarding his serious drug offenses. The Court is not persuaded that \u00a7 2255(h) is that mechanistic, especially considering that the serious drug offenses argument in fact was raised in Charlton's original motion but not decided by the Court. The Government also cites to the unpublished opinion\n   <em>\n    Perez v. United States\n   </em>\n   in which the Eleventh Circuit held that a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion fails where there are at least three ACCA predicate offenses not susceptible to challenge based on a new rule of constitutional law, like Johnson II.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20F.%20App%27x%20804\">\n    730 F.

Here, that is the dispositive fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Had the Court addressed Charlton's serious drug offence argument when adjudicating his initial \u00a7 2255 motion back in 2013, it would be a non-issue now. Either the Court could have rejected the argument and there would be no viable second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion because Charlton would have three predicate offenses notwithstanding Johnson II. Or the Court could have accepted the argument and Charlton would now prevail on his second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Instead, the Court did not consider the argument because it was not necessary to its decision. But that decision was based entirely on the conclusion that Charlton's ABDW conviction was a violent felony which, for the reasons discussed above, has since been invalidated by Johnson II. Accordingly, the Court will not hold its previous decision not to consider Charlton's serious drug offense argument against him now. The Court finds the argument is sufficiently related to Charlton's Johnson II claims for him to pursue it in a second or successive\n   \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ACCA commands that predicate offenses be \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). \"[T]he 'occasions' inquiry requires a case-by-case examination of the totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The PSR draws its information from a single police report, which under\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   is not a\n   valid source for establishing ACCA predicates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    544 U.S. at 22, 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The difficulty with this argument is that\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   specifically applies in the context of establishing violent felony predicates,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   at 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5879404\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/13/#p26\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the First Circuit has not extended its holding to apply either in the context of establishing serious drug offence predicates or in the context of determining whether predicate offences occurred on different occasions.

Also, for the reasons already discussed in detail above, the Court sees no reason to shift this burden from the Government to Charlton on collateral review in the context of a Johnson II motion. The only\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents in the record concerning Charlton's drug offenses are the criminal complaints. The complaints indicate only that the offenses occurred on the same date at the same locations.

In\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    , the law changed between the time of sentencing and appeal, but the First Circuit found that\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    did not establish prejudice because he \"made no argument that the assault and battery was anything other than the harmful type.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3755229\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/3/#p10\">\n     676 F.3d at 9\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    predates both\n    <em>\n     Serrano-Mercado\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Bain\n    </em>\n    and, to the extent the cases conflict, the Court will follow the First Circuit's more recent precedent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In his supplemental brief filed after the hearing, Charlton suggests an alternative procedural maneuver to overcome this issue. He argues that the Court could re-open his initial \u00a7 2255 motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and decide the serious drug offences question. While this is a novel approach, the Court does not need to go down that path to grant the relief Charlton seeks.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The fact that the PSR treated Charlton's two drug convictions as a single sentence for the purposes of criminal history scoring does not influence the analysis of whether they are separate ACCA predicates.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
