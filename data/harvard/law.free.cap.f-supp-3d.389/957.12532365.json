Also appearing and testifying were Medical Experts (\"MEs\") Stephen Goldstein M.D. and Alfred Jonas M.D., who both opined that no listing is met or equaled. AR 527-67.

As set forth more fully below, the Court concludes that the ALJ's decision to give Dr. Hall's opinion limited weight based on these three reasons is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Inconsistencies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The ALJ first identified Dr. Hall's own forms as internally inconsistent. Specifically, Dr. Hall completed a mental residual functional capacity assessment form (\"MRFCA\") that instructed Dr. Hall to give \"an assessment of how the patient's mental/emotional capabilities are affected by the impairment(s).\" AR 441. The form is broken down into the familiar nonexertional categories (understanding and memory; sustained concentration and persistence; social interaction; and adaptation). AR 441-42. Under \"concentration and persistence,\" Dr. Hall assessed one \"slight\" limitation, two \"marked\" limitations, and four \"moderate\" limitations. AR 442. However, on the same day, Dr. Hall completed a form for the listing criteria for 12.04, Affective Disorders. AR 444. In that form, he assessed that Ms. Rush has \"marked difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9113086\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/758/#p764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ noted the same inconsistencies-that the MRFCA predominantly contained limitations that were moderate or less, while the listing forms indicated only a marked limitation-in the 2016 forms. AR 509;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1303-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Similarly, the ALJ noted that Dr. Hall's assessment for social functioning on the 2010 MRFCA form differed from Dr. Hall's assessment for social functioning on the 2010 listing form. In assessing the social interaction portion of the MRFCA, Dr. Hall found three \"slight\" limitations, two \"moderate\" limitations, and no \"marked\" limitations, AR 442. On the listing criteria form, however, Dr. Hall assessed \"marked\" difficulties in maintaining social functioning. AR 444. The ALJ noted the same inconsistencies in the 2016 forms. AR 509;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1303-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Ms. Rush argues that the ALJ's decision to reduce the weight given to Dr. Hall based on the ALJ's determination of inconsistencies in these forms is wrong for two reasons. First, she asserts that \"the forms do not convey the same information. They were constructed by different parties, for different purposes, and in different areas.\" Doc. 19 at 20. Ms. Rush, however, cites no authority in support of her contention that an ALJ should not compare information on the two forms. Moreover, while the forms may have been constructed for different purposes, the forms request similar information about a claimant's mental capabilities. To the extent a doctor provides conflicting information about a claimant's mental capabilities, it logically seems appropriate for the ALJ to consider this conflicting information when determining how much weight to give that doctor's opinion. Indeed, the regulations instruct that an ALJ should consider inconsistencies in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pisciotta v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700345\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1074/#p1078\">\n    500 F.3d 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078 (10th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, Ms. Rush argues that the assessments on the forms are not in conflict. She asserts that the listing forms cover\n   \"broad categories\" (such as activities of daily living, social functioning, and concentration, persistence and pace), whereas the MRFCA \"breaks down those areas into 20 activities within the categories.\" Doc. 19 at 20. Ms. Rush then argues that the limitations in activities Dr. Hall found on the MRFCA, when combined, support the marked limitations in broad categories that Dr. Hall found Plaintiff to have on the listing forms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Given the deferential substantial-evidence standard the Court must apply when reviewing an ALJ's decision, had the ALJ determined that the listing forms were not inconsistent with the MRFCA form, Ms. Rush's reasoning might support such a conclusion. But the ALJ concluded the opposite, and this opposite conclusion is also subject to the deferential substantial-evidence standard.\n   <em>\n    Biestek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12617389\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1148/#p1154\">\n    139 S.

Instead of conducting a de novo review of the ALJ's findings, the Court must determine whether his findings are supported by \"more than a mere scintilla\" of evidence.\n   <em>\n    Biestek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12617389\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/1148/#p1154\">\n    139 S. Ct. at 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Court must ask whether the ALJ has identified an internal discrepancy that is \"seemingly\" inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    Pisciotta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700345\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/500/1074/#p1078\">\n    500 F.3d at 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court answers this question in the affirmative. With regard to social interaction in particular, the record shows that Dr. Hall stated on one form that Ms. Rush has only slight to moderate limitations but then on a separate form he filled out the same day concluded that she is markedly limited. This is \"seemingly inconsistent,\" as the ALJ explained at length.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nor are these reports the only records that support the ALJ's finding of inconsistency in Dr. Hall's reports. The ALJ also found Dr. Hall made assessments inconsistent with the overall record when Dr. Hall opined that Ms. Rush \"experienced 'repeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration,' \" despite no evidence that Ms. Rush had ever been hospitalized or required inpatient treatment except for her one visit to the ER for anxiety. AR 509;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 439, 440, 444. \" 'Episodes of decompensation may be demonstrated by an exacerbation in symptoms or signs that would ordinarily require increased treatment or a less stressful situation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davison v.

This seeming inconsistency between Dr. Hall's medical opinion and the record as a whole further supports the ALJ's decision to discount the weight he gave to Dr. Hall's opinions. Accordingly, the Court finds no error in the ALJ's decision to discount Dr. Hall's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Unsupported by treatment notes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The ALJ found that Dr. Hall's own contemporaneous treatment notes failed to support the limitations he found. The\n   ALJ's discussion of Dr. Hall's treatment notes divided them into two different categories: treatment notes before September 26, 2012, which largely consisted of medication prescription orders and handwritten descriptions of the patient's subjective symptom evidence, AR 509-10; and treatment notes after 2013, which include mental status examination findings and psychomotor testing, AR 510.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Ms. Rush objects that the ALJ cannot reject a treating physician's opinion simply because he relied on subjective evidence from the patient. Doc. 19 at 21. Ms. Rush misses the point. The ALJ did not criticize Dr. Hall for relying on subjective evidence from Ms. Rush; the ALJ simply found that his notes prior to 2013 included no objective findings. AR 509-10. The record supports this finding. AR 270-85, 360-61, 363-88, 393-99, 447-80. Indeed, the ALJ was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to evaluate whether Dr. Hall's opinion was \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\"\n   <em>\n    Watkins v.

The ALJ's observation that, prior to 2012, Dr. Hall documented\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   clinical or diagnostic testing, then, is highly relevant to whether Dr. Hall's opinion is entitled to controlling weight.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White v.

Neuropsychological testing, however, revealed in 2010 and 2017 that Ms. Rush \"was functioning in the average range of intellectual ability, and performed in the average range of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, indicating no major memory problems.\" AR 510;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 314-22 (2010 testing report); AR 1312-23 (2017 testing report).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Ms. Rush does not specifically address this reason the ALJ gave for his rejection of Dr. Hall's opinion. She asserts elsewhere in her brief, however, that the results of the 2010 testing, performed by Dr. Barbara Koltuska-Haskin, Ph.D., were \"invalid\" because Ms. Rush was \"faking good,\" likely because CYFD ordered the test and Ms. Rush did not want to lose child custody. Doc. 19 at 13 &amp; n.10. It is true that Dr. Koltuska-Haskin found, with respect to the\n   <em>\n    personality\n   </em>\n   test she administered to Ms. Rush, that \"[i]t was a so-called 'faking good' profile, which indicates that she was generally denying symptoms and problems and was attempting to appear better off psychologically than was, in fact, the case.\" AR 319. \"This is probably related to CYFD involvement in her case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=748%20F.%20App%27x%20842\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    memory\n   </em>\n   test administered by Dr. Koltuska-Haskin, however, was not subject to any finding of invalidity.

Ms. Rush merely argues that LCSW Maggard's opinion is consistent with the opinions of Dr. Walker, Dr. Hall, and Dr. Russo. Doc. 19 at 24-25. But as discussed above, the relevant opinion of Dr. Walker is not that Ms. Rush has a host of \"moderate limitations\" which would prevent her from doing unskilled work. His opinion is that Ms. Rush \"can understand, remember, and carry out simple instructions, make simple decisions, attend and concentrate for two hours at a time, interact adequately with coworkers and supervisors, and respond appropriately to changes in a routine work setting.\" AR 288. The ALJ gave \"great weight\" to this opinion and, as discussed above, either incorporated every one of these restrictions into his RFC or developed an even more restrictive limitation.
