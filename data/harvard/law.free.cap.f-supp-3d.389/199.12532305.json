Plaintiff has sued four individuals-Kristin\n   Splain, Mark Schlechter, Jody Wood and Kathryn Muller-and the County of Steuben (New York), asserting claims relating to divorce proceedings between plaintiff and his now ex-wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants Splain, Schlechter, and Wood, all of whom are represented by the New York State Attorney General, have moved to dismiss the claims against them pursuant to Rule 12(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the amended complaint (Dkt. #3), the divorce action was commenced in Supreme Court, Steuben County, on August 10, 2016. On August 12, 2016, the court issued an order appointing defendant Splain as referee pursuant to N.Y. CPLR \u00a7 4311with authority to \"hear and determine all issues.\" (Dkt. #3 at 3, 16.) Plaintiff alleges that contrary to what was stated in that order, he had not consented to Splain's appointment, but that he did eventually consent in May 2017, during the child custody trial, \"under the threat of starting the trial over again ....\" (Dk. #3 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At one point in the divorce proceedings, Splain issued a decision concerning the distribution of the parties' assets. Plaintiff contends that the decision contains, and is based on, several factual errors. Further proceedings ensued, with results that were again not to plaintiff's liking, and which he again alleges were based on falsehoods and \"actual malice\" against him on Splain's part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that he filed a motion or objections to one of Splain's orders, and that he received a response from defendant Court Attorney Mark Schlechter. Plaintiff has attached to the amended complaint two letters to him from Schlechter stating that if plaintiff \"wish[ed] to contest the findings and conclusions made by the Court, [the appropriate] remedy would be to file an appeal to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department,\" and suggesting that plaintiff consider seeking the advice of counsel if he wished to pursue the matter further. (Dkt. #3 at 18, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges that in January 2019, he filed a motion to reconsider one of Splain's orders concerning the disposition of marital assets. Splain set a return date for the motion to be submitted on the papers, without oral argument. Later, he alleges, he learned that defendant Court Clerk Jody Wood changed the schedule, and set an appearance date, without notifying plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on these allegations, plaintiff seeks: (1) declaratory and injunctive relief and money damages against Splain, based on alleged due process violations discrimination; (2) damages against Schlechter, also based mostly on alleged due process violations; (3) damages against Wood, based on due process violations; and claims against (4) Steuben County Commissioner of Social Services Kathryn Muller and (5) Steuben County, based on their alleged actions relating to plaintiff's alimony obligations. Muller and Steuben County (who are represented by private counsel) have answered the complaint (Dkt. #6, #7) but have not moved against it at this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Domestic Relations Exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The moving defendants contend that plaintiff's claims against them should be\n   dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Defendants rely on the \"domestic relations exception\" to federal jurisdiction, which \"divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees.\"\n   <em>\n    Ankenbrandt v.

But they are meritless and must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is not clear from plaintiff's complaint whether he is alleging a violation of substantive\n   or procedural due process rights. Because some allowance must be made for the fact that plaintiff is proceeding pro se, the Court will consider both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A plaintiff states a claim for a denial of substantive due process when he alleges conduct that is \"so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\"\n   <em>\n    County of Sacramento v.

Sept. 30, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff has not alleged facts supporting a claim of a substantive due process violation. He has alleged nothing more than that defendants took certain actions, or failed to do certain things, that discomfited him or adversely affected him in the context of the divorce proceeding. But those acts fall far short of what is needed to make out a substantive due process claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kochan v.

He has done little more than repackage everything that he found objectionable in the state court, under the guise of a federal procedural due process claim. In some instances (such as Schlechter's letters to plaintiff), it is not even clear what the alleged deprivation consisted of, but in any event, plaintiff has not shown that he lacked constitutionally adequate avenues of relief in the state courts. Plaintiff does not allege that the state proceedings were fundamentally unfair, but that the individual defendants acted wrongfully. If that is correct, he can seek a remedy in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rivera-Powell v. N.Y.C.

That is not to say that state courts are free to trample on federal constitutional rights, but only that to state a federal claim, more is required than a bald assertion that the plaintiff was \"discriminated\" against, vis-a-vis the other party.

Probate Court\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-630,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204094188\">\n    2015 WL 4094188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.Conn. July 7, 2015). Thus, Schlechter and Wood are immune from liability as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although plaintiff has attempted to preempt an immunity defense by alleging by alleging that the \"nature of [defendants'] actions\" precludes such a defense,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. #3 at 8-10, that attempt is unavailing. The facts alleged by plaintiff show\n   that defendants were acting within the scope of their duties. That plaintiff was unhappy with their actions does not alter the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Official-Capacity Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent that any of plaintiff's claims are brought against defendants in their official capacities, those claims are dismissed. Such claims may only be brought to seek equitable relief, and for the reasons stated above, there is no basis for any relief here, legal or equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The motion to dismiss brought by defendants Kristin Splain, Mark Schlechter, and Jody Wood to dismiss the complaint (Dkt. #10) is granted, and the complaint is dismissed with prejudice as to those three defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    From the papers attached to the complaint, it appears that plaintiff's wife filed a cross-motion for contempt, and that it was her motion that was scheduled for an in-court appearance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Amended Complaint Ex. C.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Courts addressing the exception have discussed it both in terms of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and abstention, which are separate principles. A court cannot abstain from exercising jurisdiction unless it has jurisdiction in the first place. But the distinction is of no moment here, as explained in the body of this Decision and Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
