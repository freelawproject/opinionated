Prohibited Reasons for Abortion of Non-viable Fetuses\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The most challenging and novel of the issues in this case is the State's attempt to prohibit all abortions (including those of non-viable fetuses) for special reasons that are deemed contrary to public policy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20188.038\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 188.038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , effective August 28, 2019. The State would prohibit a pregnant woman's favoritism of males, for instance, or apparently healthy prospective infants while choosing to abort fetuses with disfavored characteristics. For present purposes I assume that almost everyone in our culture would be appalled by a pregnant woman's abortion of a fetus identified as female because the woman or the family preferred that she give birth to a boy. The legal issue is whether the public, through legislation, has a right to intervene and prohibit such a discriminatory or \"selective\" abortion of a fetus before viability. Plaintiffs do not challenge the validity of the prohibitions after viability, which duplicated existing law. Under existing Missouri law, no viable fetuses can be aborted, unless required by the woman's health.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20188.030\">\n    Mo.

Earlier this year, however, it declined to review a Seventh Circuit ruling that did prevent Indiana from restricting a discriminatory choice by pregnant women in that State.\n   <em>\n    Box v.

The Court described the legislation as \"barring the knowing provision of sex-, race-, or disability-selective abortions by abortion providers.\" Id at 1781. The denial of certiorari was explained by the novelty of the legal issues, which \"have not been considered by additional Courts of Appeals.\" Id. at 1782. The concurrence by Justice Thomas demonstrated great interest in the ultimate question of a State's authority, in his phrasing, to prevent \"abortion from becoming a tool of modern-day eugenics,\" citing the recent State laws seeking to\n   prevent abortions motivated by race, sex, genetic abnormality, and Down Syndrome.

Significant rulings on this issue may be imminent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although other Supreme Court language is relied on to invalidate any prohibition of pre-viability abortions, the \"essential holding\" most quoted is from the plurality opinion in\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    505 U.S. 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 846,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), containing the rule that \"[b]efore viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure.\" It was repeated, \"a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    Id. at 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p846\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, cases to date have accepted the woman's \"ultimate decision\" and have rejected prohibitions of certain reasons for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dissatisfaction has been voiced, as noted, perhaps most meaningfully by Judge Easterbrook in dissenting from the Seventh Circuit's close vote denying a rehearing en banc in the Indiana case.\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc. v. Commissioner of the Indiana State Dept. of Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520318\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/532/\">\n    917 F.3d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). He argued that \"Judges often said that employers\n   could fire workers for any or no reason,\" and thereafter \"regularly created exceptions when the discharge was based on race, sex, or disability.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520318\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/917/532/\">\n    Id. at 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course Supreme Court justices sometimes overstate principles, and then reword the rules. But an appellate court that modifies a rule is appropriately the court that announced the rule. Lower court judges do not often \"correct\" the language of the Supreme Court. While it can be speculated that the Supreme Court's language in\n   <em>\n    Box\n   </em>\n   implicitly invited appellate judges to review the merits of prohibitions of discriminatory abortions, any such invitation was not addressed to district judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   There are no pertinent factual disputes on this aspect of the case. For present purposes I assume, in accordance with declarations offered by the Missouri defendants, that there are adequate public policy reasons to adopt the prohibitions against aborting fetuses because they are disfavored by the pregnant woman on grounds of sex, race or Down Syndrome likelihood. I recognize that a Down Syndrome abortion is a very debatable subject, but it would likely be a legislative issue rather than a judicial issue if abortion jurisprudence, as established by the Supreme Court, permitted a legislative override of any aspect of a woman's right to abort a non-viable fetus. All judicial rulings so far preclude such a legislative override in this context. It is clear today that plaintiffs are likely to prevail in striking down the prohibited reasons law, insofar as it applies to non-viable fetuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Another legal point remains. The Missouri defendants argue that relief from a regulation of abortion cannot be obtained unless the statute imposes an undue burden on a large fraction of women seeking an abortion. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Arkansas &amp; Eastern Oklahoma v. Jegley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275922\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/953/\">\n    864 F.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Cir. 2017). The courts that have dealt with such an issue in cases like the present one, however, have limited that test to statutes that \"regulate\" abortion practice, not cases like this one that impose a complete prohibition of certain classes of abortions for non-viable fetuses.\n   <em>\n    Edwards v. Beck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190837\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/1113/\">\n    786 F.3d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Cir. 2015), ruled that the State cannot recharacterize a ban as a regulation, and thus lighten its obligation to respect the rights of pregnant women, as represented by providers.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190837\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/1113/\">\n    Id. at 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . See also the same rationale in\n   <em>\n    Isaacson v. Horne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047327\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1213/#p1225\">\n    716 F.3d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1225 (9\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Cir. 2013). In any event, at the preliminary injunction stage, the issue is whether plaintiffs are likely to prevail. With existing law as reviewed above, plaintiffs easily pass that test. But, as discussed below, that is not the only factor to be considered in exercising judicial discretion to grant or withhold a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. Prohibition of Abortions after 20 or Fewer Weeks\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   House Bill 126 attempts to make a second major change in abortion law - - it limits abortions after 8 weeks from the patient's last menstrual period (\"LMP\"). If this is deemed constitutionally forbidden, the weeks are extended to 14, then 18, and finally 20. Because viability has never occurred that early, so it is understood,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the effect of the legislation is to cut back the\n   viability test, as adopted by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Casey.\n   </em>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Little Rock\n   </em>\n   ruling on August 6 prohibits enforcement during litigation of very similar legislation in that State, although Arkansas stops at 18 rather than 20 weeks. However formulated, the legislation on its face conflicts with the Supreme Court ruling that neither legislative nor judicial limits on abortion can be measured by specified weeks of development of a fetus; instead, \"viability\" is the sole test for a State's authority to prohibit abortions where there is no maternal health issue. That is the lesson of\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   , previously quoted, as widely recognized by the lower courts, including the Eighth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   , the concurrence of Justice O'Connor in\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

As discussed below, the current ruling turns on two questions of law announced by a majority of the Supreme Court, as it was constituted when Justice Kennedy retired - that is, the viability test and the categorical right of women seeking abortions of non-viable fetuses.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    There is apparently much popular interest in this phase of the new legislation. See front page article in the\n    <em>\n     Kansas City Star\n    </em>\n    of August 4, 2019, with the sub-head, \"Missouri law denies abortion for fatal (\"fetal\"?) disorders.\" But the record here suggests that the proposed prohibition of certain controversial abortions affects only a small number of non-viable fetus abortions. Opening up the subject for legislation could, however, logically reach more common reasons for early abortions, such as the prospective illegitimacy of babies born to unmarried girls and women. Illegitimacy being a frequently disfavored status, perhaps it may be treated as comparable to health issues or disfavored sex or race characteristics. While there is no known legislation to protect the prospectively illegitimate, such legislation for non-viable fetuses could be legally evaluated similarly to the issues here. We are thus dealing with a potentially large problem, numerically as well as intrinsically important.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Plaintiff Reproductive Health Services of Planned Parenthood of the St Louis Region (\"RHS\") uses 21 weeks and 6 days LMP as its guideline for providing pre-viability surgical abortions.

I need also consider whether preservation of the status quo would be served by granting interim relief.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Enjoining new legislation pending litigation and before the effective date seems to be a method of preserving the status quo during the pendency of the lawsuit.\n    <em>\n     Association of Equipment Manufacturers v. Burgum\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%208791104\">\n     2017 WL 8791104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.N.Dak.). While federal courts should generally be very cautious before delaying the effect of State laws, the sense of caution may be mitigated when the legislation seems designed, as here, as a protest against Supreme Court decisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The hostility to, and refusal to comply with, the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence is most obviously demonstrated in the attempt to push \"viability\" protection downward in various weekly stages to 8 weeks LMP. This is contrary to repeated, clear language of the Court. The anti-discrimination section seeks to create novel exceptions to some plain but general language. That is a less questionable legislative practice. It does seem so likely wrong, however, that it should not be permitted to go into operation, unless the relief sought offers minimal demonstrable\n    practical benefit - or, in other words, the denial of immediate relief is not demonstrably harmful.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The greatest impact of House Bill 126 would be to prohibit abortions in Missouri after 8 weeks LMP. This would prohibit more than two thirds of plaintiff RHS's patients from obtaining abortions and about half the reported abortions in Missouri. McNicholas Decl. \u00b6 52. Crumbliss Decl. \u00b6 14. Docs. 3 &amp; 35. The impact of the 20-week rule seems likely to prohibit about 100 abortions performed each year. McNicholas Decl. \u00a7 52. I classify that as a significant interference with plaintiffs' service and the rights of its prospective patients, so it should be considered quite adequate as harm to justify immediate relief from the defective provisions of House Bill 126. The least impact would result from prohibiting the sex or race reasons for an abortion, the occurrence of which is unknown to the Chief Medical Officer of RHS. McNicholas Decl. \u00a7 59. An abortion before viability motivated by a Down Syndrome test would also be somewhat rare, given the window of time needed for adequate testing and consultation. Bebbington Decl. \u00a7\u00a7 9, 22-24, 43. And we do not know the frequency of those abortions in Missouri, where the testing rate might be greater or below testing elsewhere.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    There is an absence of any information from RHS that would allow me to assess whether, if final judgment is possible in several months, the inability to schedule \"Down syndrome abortions\" would be likely to interfere with the abortion rights of real-life women. I asked counsel early in the morning of argument, \"Why is there neither a disclaimer nor an estimate of 'Down Syndrome abortions' at RHS?\" This issue remains entirely speculative after argument, perhaps because no estimate is possible, since Down Syndrome is rarely mentioned by patients. If so, there could be no sanctions, since the law requires knowledge before a provider is in violation.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Caution suggests I withhold a preliminary injunction against the anti-discrimination section, but remain open to an adequately supported renewed motion on this narrow issue.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    In plaintiffs' reply brief (Doc. 47) they candidly change the emphasis to perceived harm that compliance might cause RHS and its officials and medical personnel. They suggest criminal penalties or loss of licenses. Prosecutions seem even more speculative or unlikely than the possible loss of an abortion opportunity during the next several months by some pregnant woman and her family. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney, a named defendant, does not oppose plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. Doc. 42, noted in Doc. 47, p. 1. License controversies on this subject also seem entirely unlikely. Both this court and the State Courts are open to RHS or any\n    other target of a license cancellation. Unlike many individuals who seek abortions, legal assistance seems available, and the views expressed here should reduce the likelihood of harassment issues concerning the anti-discrimination section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The public interest in this case at this time seems dominated by the analysis of which party is likely to prevail, which overwhelmingly favors plaintiffs, and seems unlikely to change dramatically in the next several months; that is, before final judgment can be entered.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    A preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiffs is appropriate here, except as to \u00a7 188.038, the anti-discrimination section.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    IV. Severability and Conditions\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The Missouri General Assembly has made clear that it wishes to preserve as much of House Bill 126 as can be saved under current law. The various sections specifying prohibitions on abortions at various weeks prior to viability cannot be allowed to go into effect on August 28, as scheduled. The existing prohibition against abortion of viable fetuses remains in effect, and is not challenged, so a preliminary injunction leaves Missouri with a public policy against abortions to the extent permitted by Constitutional law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The statutory prohibition of discriminatory or selective abortions is unqualified, thus applying to both viable and non-viable fetuses. If it were possible to sever the language to limit the coverage to viable fetuses I would do so, but that cannot be done without judicial re-writing of the section, a practice to be avoided when possible. The desired result could be achieved, however, by using an as applied rather than a comprehensive injunction. A full facial challenge is not appropriate here because RHS limits its practice to non-viable fetus abortions (21 weeks, 6 days, LMP).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    As is customary in cases of this nature, and consistently with Rule 65 (c), Fed. R. Civ. Proc., no bond will be required from plaintiffs in this case.\n    <em>\n     Little Rock Family Planning Services\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%203679623\">\n     2019 WL 3679623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at * 90.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    It is therefore ORDERED that the Missouri official defendants, their employees, agents, and successors in office are hereby PROHIBITED, pending litigation or further order of the court, from enforcing certain pre-viability bans on abortions, pursuant to H.B. 126; specifically,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20188.056\">\n     Mo.

But one can imagine that if there is a legally validated prohibition, providers would protect themselves by adding to medical paperwork a question such as \"Is this procedure being sought because of race, sex or Down syndrome ?\" One would guess this would lead to the effective discontinuance of \"Down syndrome abortions\" at RHS. Until there is finality on the legal issue, which currently tilts in favor of plaintiffs, one might suppose fewer questions would be asked, since they are not required, and that the status quo could be preserved without court order. At least this may be true for the next several months, which would diminish the likelihood of harm from denial of a preliminary injunction. If my supposition is mistaken, a further motion can be filed.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-48\">\n     The related issue of ripeness will apparently be the subject of further briefing. Doc. 33, p 12.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-49\">\n     The apparent absence of material facts that are in dispute suggests that summary judgment may be the most expeditious way to advance this case toward an appeal.\n    </p>\n    <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n     In offering this procedural suggestion I am aware that the Missouri brief proposes slowing the case for development and consideration of a factual record, advising that last Monday it submitted extensive newly developed evidence. Doc. 35. Missouri has offered material for the record (and perhaps appellate or Supreme Court consideration) regarding the \"discrimination\" issues. There is also a good deal of material relating to fetus development and other issues outlined in Doc. 31. But the two basic issues regarding (1) restricting reasons for exercising abortion rights before viability and (2) banning abortions at various weekly stages before viability seemingly present pure legal questions. Both prohibitions very likely conflict with current abortion jurisprudence. Because I was the district judge in the\n     <em>\n      Hawley\n     </em>\n     case, supra, and because the Missouri defendants seek to equate the need for factual development in that case with this one, I note that the \"factual issues\" here and there are unrelated. Here I express the view, with other judges, that certain Supreme Court legal rulings are binding. In\n     <em>\n      Hawley\n     </em>\n     , on the \"factual issues\" I was of the view that certain Supreme Court factual rulings on \"legislative facts\" or \"social facts\" were binding, and could not be relitigated at the district court. See Doc. 113 in Case 16-4313. For illustration, I quoted Judge Easterbrook that \"after a majority of the Supreme Court has concluded that photo ID requirements promote confidence, a single district judge cannot say as a 'fact' that they do not even if 20 political scientists disagree with the Supreme Court.\" Avoidance of facts here is thus in a different context, that is, whether a\n     <em>\n      legal\n     </em>\n     principle established by the Supreme Court can be rebutted by factual material offered in the lower courts.\n    </blockquote>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
