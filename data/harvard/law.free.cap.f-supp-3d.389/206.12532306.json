No party has submitted to the Court any evidence regarding Defendant's mental condition to contradict Dr. DuBois' assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 8, 2019, the Court held a hearing regarding Defendant's competency and the possibility that he could be restored to competency.

Here, the Court has already determined that Defendant meets this definition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 11 at 10). There is no evidence before the Court that Defendant's mental condition has meaningfully changed since the time the\n   Court made that determination, and the Court finds no reason to revisit or revise its earlier conclusion that Defendant is currently incompetent to proceed to trial. Accordingly, the question before the Court is \"whether there is a substantial probability that in the foreseeable future [Defendant] will attain the capacity to permit the [criminal] proceedings to go forward.\"\n   <em>\n    Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521639\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/928/210/#p216\">\n    928 F.3d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The evidence before the Court demonstrates that such a substantial probability does not exist. Dr. DuBois' forensic evaluation sets forth in detail the various assessments and tests that were performed on Defendant, which collectively revealed significant impairment in Defendant's cognitive functioning. Dr. DuBois noted that, most likely as a result of long-term chronic alcohol abuse, Defendant suffers from moderate cerebral atrophy and volume loss, and meets the criteria for \"an Alcohol-induced Major Neurocognitive Disorder, amnestic-confabulatory type, persistent.\" (Dkt. 34 at 9-10). Dr. DuBois further found that Defendant's prognosis is poor, explaining that Defendant's cognitive abilities are unlikely to improve with time and that what limited treatment options exist are aimed at preventing further injury, and not repairing past damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Based on these findings, Dr. DuBois opines that Defendant remains incompetent to proceed to trial and that \"he will not recover from his mental condition to the extent that he would become competent in the foreseeable future.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court finds Dr. DuBois' conclusions well-supported by the evidence of record, including the psychological and neurological tests and imaging that have been performed, as well as the Court's own observations of Defendant. Moreover, neither the Government nor Defendant contests Dr. DuBois' assessment, and no party has submitted any evidence to support a contrary finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that: (1) Defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense, and (2) there is not a substantial probability that Defendant can or will be restored to competency in the foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Assessment of Dangerousness Pursuant to\n     <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204246\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4246\n     </extracted-citation>\n     and 4248\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant is hospitalized at FMC-Butner pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Pursuant to that statute, upon the expiration of the commitment period, if \"the defendant's mental condition has not so improved as to permit the proceedings to go forward,\" the defendant then becomes subject to the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 4248.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). These two sections govern the civil commitment of a person suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another and the civil commitment of a sexually dangerous person, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Both \u00a7 4246 and \u00a7 4248 set forth procedures a court must follow in considering whether a person who would otherwise be released from custody should be civilly committed. Under \u00a7 4246, the first step is for the director of the facility where the individual is hospitalized to assess whether the individual \"is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Similarly, under \u00a7 4248, the first step is for the director of\n   the facility where the individual is hospitalized to assess whether the individual is \"a sexually dangerous person.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If the facility director finds that either of those two conditions exist, he must then issue a certificate of dangerousness and transmit that certificate to \"the clerk of the court for the district in which the person is confined.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If such a certificate is filed under \u00a7 4246, \"[t]he court shall order a hearing to determine whether the person is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204246\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), while the filing of such a certificate under \u00a7 4248 requires the court to \"order a hearing to determine whether the person is a sexually dangerous person,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Neither \u00a7 4246 nor \u00a7 4248 explicitly state that a person may be hospitalized for the purpose of permitting the facility director to perform an initial assessment of dangerousness. However, at least one federal circuit court has concluded that \"[i]n authorizing the director to file a dangerousness certification, \u00a7 4246 necessarily contemplates the temporary commitment of that person so that the director can conduct the evaluation necessary to make the certification decision.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
