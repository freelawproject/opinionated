(\"CPI\") and Crafty Productions, LLC (\"CPL\") (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") commenced this action against numerous defendants alleging copyright infringement of CPI's original craft designs and products, trade dress infringement, intentional interference with prospective business advantage, unfair competition, breach of contract, and fraud. Many parties were listed as defendants in the first complaint, but various defendants have been dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. (ECF No. 213.) As relevant here, Defendants The Michaels Companies, Inc. and Michaels Stores, Inc. (collectively, \"Michaels\") and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' prior complaint for failure to state a claim. (ECF No. 90.) The Court granted the motion to dismiss and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. (\"Prior Order,\" ECF No. 214.) Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against Michaels; Plaid Enterprises, Inc.; Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.; Party City Holdings, Inc.; and Party City Corporation. (\"SAC,\" Second Amended Complaint, ECF No. 232.) Plaintiffs allege trade dress infringement, intentional interference with prospective business advantage, and unfair competition. Michaels moves to dismiss the second amended complaint. (\"Mot.,\" ECF No. 233.) Defendants Hobby Lobby; Party City Holdings, Inc.; Party City Corporation; and Plaid Enterprises, Inc. join the Motion to Dismiss with respect to paragraphs III(A)(1)-III(A)(4) and III(B) of the Motion. (ECF Nos. 235, 236, 238.) Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Motion,\n   (\"Opp'n,\" ECF No. 239), and Michaels filed a reply in support of the Motion, (\"Reply,\" ECF No. 240).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court finds this Motion suitable for determination on the papers and without oral argument.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff CPI has created various \"original product concepts and designs, including many creative, decorative wood products.\" (SAC \u00b6 11.) Sometime in 1995, CPI hired Michelle Faherty as a sales representative for some of its products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Ms. Faherty asked permission to take samples of certain products so she could obtain a manufacturing cost estimate from a factory she knew in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She did so, and then CPI began using a Chinese manufacturer owned by Kevin Xiao and/or Tony Zhu for cost-saving purposes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2009 or 2010, CPI learned that replicas of its products were being sold in a crafts and toys product catalog from \"Zhejiang Hongye Art &amp; Craft Co., Ltd.\" (hereinafter, \"Hongye\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) CPI had not approved these sales and had never heard of Hongye. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CPI learned that the Hongye factory was shipping CPI's wood products to Michaels and Plaid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Plaid is CPI's competitor and supplies products to retailers, including Hobby Lobby and Michaels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   CPI insisted on visiting China to meet Zhu and see his manufacturing facilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) On this trip, CPI first visited the Hongye factory, where it saw on display many of CPI's \"original designs and products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Faherty allegedly had to lie to the Hongye representative to arrange a tour of the factory for CPI. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"There appeared to be no effort by the manufacturer to disguise the fact that they were producing unauthorized CPI products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) CPI alleges it saw a frame at the factory that was \"substantially similar to one of CPI's designs\" but had the name \"Plaid\" on the back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) CPI then visited Zhu's manufacturing facility, which contained only a few of CPI's products, and CPI was surprised that Hongye appeared to have more of CPI's designs in its factory than were in Zhu's factory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Faherty told CPI that Zhu's factory was only manufacturing CPI's products, not competitors' products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Faherty and Zhu arranged the manufacture of \"knock offs\" of CPI's original designs and products to sell to Plaid and other retailers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Plaintiffs allege the only way the Hongye factory would have access to CPI's products is if a retail buyer or Faherty provided the designs to the factory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Plaintiffs allege Michaels was buying the knock-off products from the Hongye factory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support, Plaintiffs allege Michaels purchased products from CPI for many years, but as of October 2014, \"was buying very little from CPI\" yet still selling products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 232-2, at 14-22 (images of products being sold in Michaels' stores in 2014 and 2015).) Plaintiffs also allege CPI never sold wood alphabets to Michaels, yet Michaels has sold CPI's wood alphabets in its stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, Plaintiffs allege Hobby Lobby purchased knock-offs of CPI's products through Faherty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court then denied Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration on the issue. (ECF No. 231.) At this point, it must be clear to all Parties that the claims have been dismissed and Plaintiffs are unable to cure the issue of prior registration of the copyrights.

Plaintiffs claim their trade dress is their \"original designs and products.\" (SAC \u00b6 61.) As examples of trade dress, Plaintiffs point to \"all of the designs and products depicted\" in Exhibits A through H and U. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The referenced exhibits include hundreds of pictures of Plaintiffs' products. (ECF Nos. 232-2 to 232-9 and 232-22 to 232-23.) Plaintiffs include no further details as to what the general \"design\" of the products entails. Plaintiffs include examples of certain features of various products that they allege to be non-functional, for example \"the shape and look of the hair and ears\" of a vampire-shaped wooden mask. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68; ECF No. 232-2, at 13.) But Plaintiffs are not alleging their protectable design is based on the distinct \"hair and ears\" features. Nor could it, as all products in the referenced exhibits are different and not every product has \"hair and ears.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In viewing the pictures Plaintiffs attach as \"examples\" of their trade dress, it is immediately clear to the Court that the products are all different. The products' only similarity is that they are crafts or decorations. But it is beyond debate that the products are still vastly different in terms of looks and design. Plaintiffs' products include a yoyo with a frog etched on the top; a hanging bird ornament; a wooden paddle with a ball attached to it by a string; a fabric heart necklace-and the list goes on.

As detailed below, it is clear to the Court that Plaintiffs' products, when taken as a whole, present no consistent look. And even without the \"consistent overall look\" test, the Court finds it is insufficient for Plaintiffs to allege trade dress protection over a general \"design,\" with no further detail, that would cover dozens of dissimilar products.

Plaintiffs' broadly claimed trade dress includes \"the design\" of the products. (SAC \u00b6 61.) But as a whole, the products differ vastly-they are made of different materials, are different shapes, serve different purposes, and have different designs. A square wooden puzzle with a Christmas tree stenciled on the top looks different than a wooden vampire mask and different than a felt purse with the word \"Boo!\" colorfully printed on the outside. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 232-2.) And how can the design of a sticker book of owls consist of the same design as a wooden gingerbread house or a wooden cube-shaped photo holder?

Cal. 2011) (finding an unfair competition claim preempted by the Copyright Act where the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had \"improperly and unlawfully taken commercial advantage of [plaintiff's] investment in his copyright works\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A plaintiff properly pleads a claim for unfair competition when the plaintiff alleges facts that show any unlawful, unfair, or fraudulent business act or practice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

A business practice is \"unfair\" where it \"offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    Gemisys Corp. v.

Cal. 1999) (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs' unfair competition allegation stem from Defendants' acts \"constituting intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.\" (SAC \u00b6 109.) It appears the \"unfair\" act is Defendants' alleged interference with Plaintiffs' relationship with Fuqing. Thus, the same findings apply for this cause of action as they did for the intentional interference cause of action. The Court finds Plaintiffs' unfair competition claim to be preempted and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the cause of action. As noted above, the Court grants Plaintiffs leave to amend the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss in its entirety. However, the Court grants Plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. As noted, the copyright claims remain dismissed, and if Plaintiffs choose to leave the claims in the complaint \"for completeness,\" Defendants need not again move to dismiss them. Plaintiffs are granted leave to amend their trade dress claims. Finally, the Court will grant Plaintiffs one final opportunity to amend their intentional interference and unfair competition claims to the extent they can show the claims are not preempted. Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint\n   <em>\n    on or before July 8, 2019.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    A more comprehensive background can be found in the Court's prior order, (ECF No. 214).

They argue the intentional interference claim \"is based not on Defendants' acts of 'manufacturing, distributing and/or selling the alleged copyrighted works,' but instead on the acts of interfering with CPI's exclusive relationship with its manufacturer Fuqing.\" (Opp'n 11.) The Court relies on what Plaintiffs plead in the Complaint, not their explanation in the opposition.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Further, the Court notes there is no support for the allegation that Defendants manufactured the allegedly infringing products, instead, the allegation is that they distributed and/or sold the products.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Michaels also argues Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) for intentional interference because they have not \"specifically allege[d] how Michaels interfered with Plaintiffs' prospective economic advantage.\" (Reply 4.) The Court disagrees; Plaintiffs have alleged all Defendants (who are retailers or distributors of craft goods) knew of Plaintiffs' relationship with Fuqing and intentionally disrupted this relationship by buying the products directly from Fuqing and distributing the products without Plaintiffs' involvement. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 101-104.) If third party retailer-sellers buy products directly from the manufacturer rather than the designer of the products (so that the retailer-sellers can pay less for the products), the business relationship between the designer and the manufacturer is disrupted. Although the claim is preempted, it contains sufficiently plausible allegations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
