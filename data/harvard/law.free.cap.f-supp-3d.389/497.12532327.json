This meant that the Proposed Rule was never open for public comment after the Final Connectivity Report was finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Almost six months after publishing the Final Connectivity Report, the Agencies released the Final Rule on June 29, 2015, which proposed a different definition of the phrase WOTUS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although generally similar to the Proposed Rule in that it defined the phrase WOTUS in jurisdictional groups, the Final Rule departed from the Proposed Rule in at least one key respect. Namely, the Final Rule defined \"adjacent waters\" under the Act using distance-based criteria, rather than the ecologic and hydrologic criteria used in the Proposed Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Specifically, the Final Rule, like the Proposed Rule, defined \"adjacent\" as \"bordering, contiguous or neighboring.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%202%2C100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%202%2C100\">\n    at 37, 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. 156; Dkt. 157. The Court finds that the Final Rule violates the notice-and-comment requirements\n   of the APA and therefore grants summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs on this ground alone. So being, the Court declines to address the substantive challenges to the Final Rule because they are premature at this time. For the following reasons, the Final Rule will be remanded to the appropriate administrative agencies for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Instead of continuing to use ecologic and hydrologic criteria to define \"adjacent waters\" as originally proposed, the summary judgment evidence reflects that the Final Rule abandoned this approach and switched to the use of distance-based criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   79 Fed. Reg. at 22,263 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   80 Fed. Reg. at 37,105. This shift in terminology and approach led to the promulgation of a Final Rule that was different in kind and degree from the concept announced in the Proposed Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, the Proposed Rule defined \"adjacent waters\" based on the presence of a \"hydrologic connection\" with a Categorically Covered Water or a Categorically Covered Water's \"influence [on] the ecological processes and plant and animal community structure\" of a potentially covered water. 79 Fed. Reg. at 22,263. The summary judgment evidence reflects that commentators to the Proposed Rule spent months evaluating the merits of this definition. However, in contrast, the Final Rule defined \"adjacent waters\" by proximity to Categorically Covered Waters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The term\n   <em>\n    adjacent\n   </em>\n   means bordering, contiguous, or neighboring...[and] the term\n   <em>\n    neighboring\n   </em>\n   means...[a]ll waters located within 100 feet [of a Categorically Covered Water]...[a]ll waters located within the 100-year floodplain [of a Categorically Covered Water]...[and a]ll waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of\" some Categorically Covered Waters or \"1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   80 Fed.

Indeed, the summary judgment evidence establishes\n   that if interested parties had been notified of this change, the comments and evidence presented to the agencies would have been significantly and substantively different. Perhaps more importantly, those governed by the rule were deprived of notice of a substantial change to our nation's environmental regulation scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Long Island Care at Home, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573031\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/158/#p174\">\n    551 U.S. at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573031\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/158/#p174\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Defendants' argument that a hydrologic and ecologic based definition for \"adjacent waters\" necessarily implies elements of \"reasonable proximity\" is unpersuasive. Dkt. 169 at 36. So too is the Defendants' argument that generally requesting comments regarding the merits of unspecified geographic limitations in the notice of proposed rulemaking provided adequate notice of the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Neither of these attempts at public notice is sufficiently specific to inform interested parties that the Agencies were considering the use of precise numerical distance-based criteria in the Final Rule to alter its jurisdictional scope. The APA does not envision requiring interested parties to parse through such vague references like tea leaves to discern an agency's regulatory intent regarding such significant changes to a final rule. Accordingly, the Court finds that the Final Rule was not a logical outgrowth of the Proposed Rule and that it was promulgated in violation of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Final Rule also violated the APA by preventing interested parties from commenting on the studies that served as the technical basis for the rule. As the courts have held, \"[a]n agency commits serious procedural error when it fails to reveal portions of the technical basis for a proposed rule in time to allow for meaningful commentary.\"\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator Indep.

Indeed, it is a \"fairly obvious proposition that studies upon which an agency relies in promulgating a rule must be made available during the rulemaking in order to afford interested persons meaningful notice and an opportunity for comment.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Indeed, the summary judgment record establishes that the Final Connectivity Report was the technical basis for the Final Rule and was instrumental in determining what changes were to be made to the definition of the phrase WOTUS:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   As noted earlier, the agencies interpret the scope of 'waters of the United States' protected under [the Act] based on the information and conclusions in [the Final Connectivity Report]....In light of this information, the agencies made scientifically and technically informed judgments about the nexus between the relevant waters and the significance of that nexus and conclude that 'tributaries' and 'adjacent waters,' each as defined by the rule, have a significant nexus such that they are 'waters of the United States' and\n   <em>\n    no additional analysis is required\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   80 Fed.

However, the Agencies' decision not to reopen the Proposed Rule for comment after the publication of the Final Connectivity Report prejudiced the ability of interested parties to (1) provide meaningful comments regarding the Final Rule's continuum-based approach to connectivity and (2) \"mount a credible challenge\" to the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

This prejudice is especially severe given the substantive changes made between the Draft and Final Connectivity Reports. Dkt. 180 at Tab CCC (for the SAB's proposed changes to the Final Connectivity Report); Dkt. 180 at Tab H (for the Final Connectivity Report). Accordingly, depriving Plaintiffs of a meaningful \"opportunity to comment\" and possibly deconstruct the Final Connectivity Report violated the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owner-Operator Indep.

The Court finds that remand, not vacatur of the Final Rule as requested by Plaintiffs, is the appropriate remedy in this case.

Moreover, the Court finds that vacatur \"would be disruptive,\" and there is a \"serious possibility\" that the Agencies will be able to resolve the notice-and-comment defects with the Final Rule if \"given an opportunity to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Cent. &amp; S.
