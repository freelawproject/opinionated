(\"Defendant\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Case or, in the Alternative, to Stay Under Primary Jurisdiction. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant has manufactured, marketed, sold, and distributed several skin care products under its Revitalift line, including (1) Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Treatment; (2) Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face &amp; Neck Moisturizer; (3) Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Day Moisturizer; (4) Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream Moisturizer; (5) Cicacream; (6) Triple Power Intensive Skin Revitalizer Serum + Moisturizer; (7) Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer; (8) Triple Power Deep-Acting Moisturizer; (9) Triple Power Intensive Anti-Aging Overnight Mask; (10) Triple Power Eye Treatment; (11) Triple Power Concentrated Serum Treatment; (12) Triple Power Intensive Anti-Aging Day Cream Moisturizer; (13) Double Lifting Face Treatment; (14) Double Lifting Eye Treatment; (15) Bright Reveal Brightening Peel Pads; (16) Bright Reveal Brightening Day Moisturizer; and (17) Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer (the \"Products\"). Plaintiff alleges that the Products make various representations including (1) that they reduce wrinkles; (2) that they \"lift\" the skin; (3) that they \"firm,\" \"tighten,\" or \"redensify\" the skin; and (4) that they \"strengthen\" and \"repair the skin barrier.\" Plaintiff contends that these representations are unlawful because they are \"skin structural representations,\" qualifying them as \"drugs\" under California's Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law (\"Sherman Law\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20109925\">\n    Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 109925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Moreover, she contends that the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") has declared such representations to be \"drug claims,\" making the Products drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act (\"FDCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that cosmetics cannot be marketed as skin structure altering drugs without pre-approval from the FDA through the New Drug Application (\"NDA\") process unless they conform to a \"monograph\" for a particular drug category. Monographs identify approved ingredients for specified uses generally recognized as safe and effective. Products containing active ingredients that are non-monograph cannot be marketed to the public without an approved NDA, which requires,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Defendant present evidence that the products are\n   safe and effective for their represented uses. Plaintiff alleges that the active ingredients in the Products do not conform to monographs for wrinkle prevention, elimination, and reduction; skin lifting, tightening, and firming; or improving skin elasticity. Defendant did not subject the Products to the NDA process and did not obtain pre-approval from the FDA to sell the Products with the skin structural representations. However, Plaintiff takes no position on whether the skin structural representations are true or false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     JUDICIAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant moves for dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds of implicit preemption and lack of standing. Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \"To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff brought a state law fraud-by-omission claim, asserting that the defendants misled the proposed class \"by failing to disclose that [a medical device laser] was not FDA approved for hyperopic [LASIK] surgeries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1117. The claim was preempted since it existed only because of the FDA approval system: \"Like the fraud-on-the-FDA claims in\n   <em>\n    Buckman\n   </em>\n   , Perez's fraud by omission claim 'exist[s] solely by virtue of the FDCA ....'

For instance, the section of the Sherman Law which limits the sale of new drugs is explicitly based on whether the product has received federal premarket approval: \"No person shall sell, deliver, or give away any new drug ... unless ... (a) It is ... (1) A new drug, and a new drug application has been approved for it and that approval has not been withdrawn, terminated, or suspended under Section 505 of the federal act ( 21 U.S.C.

The fact that Plaintiff's claim is technically brought under the UCL and the Sherman Law does not override the fact that Plaintiff explicitly requests relief which \"lies squarely within the province of the FDA.\"\n   <em>\n    Elkind v.

Even if this Court was bound by\n   <em>\n    Farm Raised Salmon\n   </em>\n   , it is distinguishable from this case. The California Supreme Court found in\n   <em>\n    Farm Raised Salmon\n   </em>\n   that \"plaintiffs' claims in this case do not require referring to, or applying, the FDCA.\"\n   <em>\n    Farm Raised Salmon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20112\">\n    72 Cal.Rptr.3d 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20P.3d%201170\">\n    175 P.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, in contrast, Plaintiff specifically seeks \"injunctive relief preventing the further unlawful sale of illegal and misbranded drugs until Defendant obtains approved NDAs [from the FDA] or removes the unlawful representations.\" Moreover, because the Sherman Law references and incorporates the FDCA, this Court cannot grant any relief to Plaintiff without referring to and applying provisions of the FDCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's UCL claim interferes with the FDA's enforcement and regulatory authority as set out in \u00a7 336 of the FDCA, which provides as follows: \"Nothing\n   in this Act shall be construed as requiring the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] to report for prosecution, or for the institution of libel or injunction proceedings, minor violations of this Act whenever he believes that the public interest will be adequately served by a suitable written notice or warning.\" Plaintiff's claim, like any private cause of action to enforce the FDCA, conflicts with this explicit grant of discretionary authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In sum, Plaintiff's UCL claim is impliedly preempted by federal law because it exists solely by virtue of the FDCA and law which references the FDCA, seeks to enforce provisions of the FDCA, and conflicts with the FDCA discretionary enforcement process. Thus, Plaintiff is suing not only for conduct that violates the FDCA but \"because the conduct violates the FDCA.\" Thus, Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because Plaintiff's claim is preempted by federal law, the Court declines to consider the parties' arguments regarding standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss.
