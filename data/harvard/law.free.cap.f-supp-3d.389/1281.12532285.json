The Court's rulings and conclusions are set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Supplement Center, LLC, Kenneth Affolter, and M&amp;N Distributing LLC filed this action on July 29, 2018, against Defendants Evol Nutrition Associates, Inc. (\"Evol\"), Jeremy Nickels, Annbiz LLC, and Asif Noorani. Am. Compl. [Doc. 3]. Notably, this case arises from the same\n   background of facts as a case previously before the undersigned,\n   <em>\n    Evol Nutrition Associates, Inc. v. Supplement Center, LLC &amp; Kenneth Affolter\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-CV-1572-ELR (N.D. Ga. May 2, 2017) (\"the Original Action\"). In the Original Action, Evol brought suit against Supplement Center and Kenneth Affolter alleging various trademark infringement claims. Original Action [Doc. 1]. Specifically, Evol, who produces dietary supplements sold in stores nationwide, alleged that Supplement Center and Affolter, through their advertisement and sale of a product called \"Walkers,\" were infringing upon Evol's trademark for a dietary supplement called \"Sleep Walkers.\" The Original Action concluded when, on April 24, 2018, at the Parties' request, the Court entered a Consent Judgment and Permanent Injunction Order (\"Consent Judgment\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 42].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to the Consent Judgment, the Court (1) ordered Supplement Center and Affolter to pay a monetary judgment to Evol in the amount of $50,000.00; (2) permanently enjoined Supplement Center and Affolter from producing or selling any dietary supplement products containing both Phenibut and Gamma aminobutyric acid (\"GABA\"); (3) permanently enjoined Supplement Center and Affolter from using the mark \" 'Walkers,' 'Wakers,' or any colorable variation thereof;\" and (4) dismissed Supplement Center and Affolter's counterclaims with prejudice. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Court retained \"personal and subject matter jurisdiction over all parties in [the] matter to address any issues arising out of [the Consent Judgment].\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the entry of the Consent Judgment, the Parties encountered several issues. According to Supplement Center and Affolter, Evol misrepresented the Consent Judgment to Supplement Center's existing business relationships. Am. Compl. \u00b6 21. Additionally, Supplement Center alleges that they have now realized that Evol obtained the Consent Judgment via fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Thus, on July 29, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the present action against Defendants alleging claims for (I) intentional tortious interference with existing economic relationships; (II) trade libel; (III) common law unfair competition; (IV) false advertising pursuant to the Lanham Act; and (V) common law fraud.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In contrast, Defendants contend that shortly after the entry of the Consent Judgment, Plaintiffs willfully violated the Consent Judgment by marketing products under the enjoined trade names of \"Walkers\" and \"Walters;\" marketing and selling the product \"Stride,\" which contains the prohibited combination of Phenibut and GABA; and failing to provide payments in accordance with the agreed-upon payment schedule. Additionally, Defendants allege that Plaintiffs have falsely advertised the product \"Stride.\" Thus, on November 7, 2018, and in response to Plaintiffs' amended complaint, Defendants filed an Answer wherein they asserted counterclaims for (I) breach of consent judgment, (II) tortious interference with business relations, (III) civil conspiracy, and (IV) false advertising pursuant to the Lanham Act. Answer [Doc. 8]. Plaintiffs now move to dismiss Defendants' counterclaims. [Doc. 11]. Also on November 7, 2018, Defendant Evol filed a Motion to Join Additional Party as Counterclaim Defendant. [Doc. 8]. Having been fully briefed, these motions are now ripe for the Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Separately, on December 3, 2018, shortly after filing its Answer and Counterclaims in this case, Evol moved in the Original Action,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to reopen the case and for a finding that Supplement Center and Kenneth Affolter are in civil contempt of Court for violating the Consent Judgment. Original Action [Doc. 44]. Although the resolution of that matter will\n   be handled separately, the Court notes that the motion is also fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Concerns\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to addressing the pending motions, the Court finds it necessary to address the various procedural concerns represented in this case. In short, the Court finds that the Parties failed to follow proper procedure for presenting the Court with their disputes concerning the Consent Judgment. For clarity, the Court will discuss each party's failure in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs' Allegations of Fraud Concerning the Consent Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiffs bring this case against Defendants alleging claims for (I) intentional tortious interference with existing economic relationships; (II) trade libel; (III) common law unfair competition; (IV) false advertising pursuant to the Lanham Act; and (V) common law fraud. Am. Compl. Notably, when the Court examines Count V for common law fraud, it is clear that Plaintiffs are making a direct allegation that Defendants conducted themselves in a fraudulent manner when negotiating and securing the Consent Judgment that concluded the Original Action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48-52. The effect of a ruling in favor of Plaintiffs on this count would result in the Court setting aside the Consent Judgment.\n   <em>\n    Boykin v.

In these claims, Plaintiffs do not seek to enforce the Consent Judgment, nor will their possible success on the claims result in the Court\n   setting aside the Consent Judgment. Instead, these tangentially related actions are properly brought as a separate action.\n   <em>\n    C.f. Woodcock Bros. Transp. Grp. v. Transp.

Ill. Apr. 14, 2003) (noting that even where underlying facts that gave rise to a settlement agreement are related to a new action, new contentions constitute a new claim where the plaintiff does not seek the enforcement of a settlement agreement). In short, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' claim for fraud but permits their other claims to move forward at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants Erroneously Seek Compliance with the Consent Judgment in this Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the present action, and in response to Plaintiffs' amended complaint, Defendants filed an Answer wherein it asserted counterclaims for (I) breach of consent judgment, (II) tortious interference with business relations, (III) civil conspiracy, and (IV) false advertising pursuant to the Lanham Act. Like Plaintiffs' allegation of fraud, Defendants' first three claims go directly to Plaintiffs' alleged violation of the Consent Judgment.

Thus, pursuant to the Court's inherent authority to manage its docket and achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases, the Court dismisses Defendants' counterclaims for breach of consent judgment, tortious interference with business relations, and civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Durr v.

The Court finds that it is an inappropriate and inefficient use of judicial resources to allow the Parties to simultaneously litigate these substantially similar claims in two (2) actions. Thus, pursuant to the Court's inherent authority to manage its docket, the Court dismisses these claims without prejudice to the Parties' rights to litigate these issues in the Original Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Counterclaim \u00b6 74. Second, Defendants allege that while Plaintiffs advertise that \"Stride\" is half the cost of competing products, the difference in cost is not so extreme.

Defendants allege that Plaintiffs' advertisements are literally false concerning the product's ingredients and price. Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are not persuasive and go to the merits of Defendants' claim.

The Court is not convinced. First, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that Defendants have sufficiently pled their false advertising claim.
