The Malpractice Insurance Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant and Cross-Claimant Dickstein Shapiro LLP (\"Dickstein\") was a law firm and maintained malpractice insurance policies. Defendant Underwriters' Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law, Dkt. 118-1 (\"DSUF\"), \u00b6 1. Underwriters issued a Primary Claims Made and Reported Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance policy to Dickstein identified as Policy No. B0621PDIC00212 (the \"Primary Policy\") for the period from December 20, 2012 to December 20, 2013 (the \"Policy Period\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Primary Policy provides coverage to an \"Assured\" for claims first made against the Assured and reported to Underwriters during the Policy Period, for all claims \"arising out of any act, error or omission of the Assured ... in rendering or failing to render professional services for others arising out of the conduct of the Assureds [sic] profession as lawyer, mediator, arbitrator, fiduciary, notary public or lobbyist.\" Dkt. 80-1 at 5. The Primary Policy also states that Underwriters \"shall have the right and duty to defend, subject to the Limits of Liability, any Claim against the Assured seeking Damages which are payable under the terms of this Insurance [policy], even if any of the allegations of the Claim are groundless, false or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Primary Policy defines the term \"Assured\" to include any lawyer who provided legal services as a partner for Dickstein.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Primary Policy carried a policy limit of $15 million, with the various Underwriters insurers agreeing to cover a certain percentage of the policy limit. DSUF \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dickstein also carried excess layers of malpractice insurance. Underwriters issued the First Excess Lawyers Professional Liability Insurance policy identified as Policy No. B0621PDIC00312 (the \"Underwriters First Excess Policy\") for the same Policy Period as the Primary Policy and embodying substantively similar defense and indemnity coverage. DSUF \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80-2. Scottsdale, via its managing agent Huntersure LLC (\"Huntersure\"), also subscribed to a first layer excess policy with identical terms as the Underwriters First Excess Policy through a separate policy issued to Dickstein with the reference number LXS0000261 and identified as Policy No. B0621PDIC00312001 (the \"Scottsdale First Excess Policy\" and, together with the Underwriters First Excess Policy, the \"First Excess Policy\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The First Excess Policy states that \"[l]iability to pay under this Policy shall not attach unless and until the Underwriters of the [Primary Policy] shall have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay, the full amount of their indemnity inclusive of costs and expenses.\" Dkt. 80-2 at 5; Dkt. 80-3 at 8. The First Excess Policy carried a combined policy limit of $15 million above the $15 million limit provided by the Primary Policy. DSUF \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80-2 at 2; Dkt. 80-3 at 5.

The Hettrick Malpractice Action and Underwriters' Denial of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Clyde Hettrick was a partner at Dickstein, falling within the definition of an \"Assured\" under the Primary Policy. Scottsdale Insurance Company's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law, Dkt. 116-1 (\"PSUF\"), \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9. In early 2008, Hettrick represented Manhattan Beachwear, LLC (\"MBW\") regarding insurance-related matters.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. In June 2008, Hettrick left Dickstein to start his own law firm, HettrickLaw P.C. (\"HettrickLaw\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Hettrick continued representing MBW at HettrickLaw, and in January 2009 HettrickLaw filed a lawsuit on behalf of MBW against Lloyd's of London Insurers relating to certain insurance claims submitted by MBW (the \"Lloyd's Litigation\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2011, MBW fired HettrickLaw as counsel for the Lloyd's Litigation and retained Dickstein as replacement counsel for the duration of the Lloyd's Litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In late 2012, the parties settled the Lloyd's Litigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   MBW refused to pay fees to HettrickLaw and Dickstein related to the Lloyd's Litigation, threatening to file a malpractice action against Hettrick if Hettrick attempted to collect fees from MBW.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. MBW entered into a tolling agreement with Hettrick and HettrickLaw on June 13, 2012 regarding HettrickLaw's claim for fees against MBW, with an expiration date for the tolling agreement set as December 15, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 14, 2012, MBW filed a malpractice lawsuit against Hettrick and HettrickLaw in the Superior Court for the State of California, captioned\n   <em>\n    Manhattan Beachwear, LLC v. Hettrick Law, P.C. et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. BC497520 (Cal. Super. Ct.) (the \"Hettrick Malpractice Action\"). PSUF \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-1. MBW alleged damages exceeding $11 million as a result of Hettrick's professional negligence in tendering MBW's insurance claims and in handling the Lloyd's Litigation. PSUF \u00b6 8; Dkt. 93-1 \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. In February 2013, Hettrick's attorney notified Dickstein that Hettrick was sued on a matter that originated while Hettrick was a partner at Dickstein. PSUF \u00b6 10; Dkts. 93-10-11. In an email on March 13, 2013, before Hettrick had been served with the complaint for the Hettrick Malpractice Action, counsel for Hettrick formally requested that\n   Dickstein and Dickstein's insurers participate in defending the Hettrick Malpractice Action. PSUF \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Dkt. 93-12. After not hearing back from Dickstein for two months, on May 8, 2013, counsel for Hettrick repeated the request that Dickstein participate in the defense of the Hettrick Malpractice Action. PSUF \u00b6 13; Dkt. 93-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 14, 2013, Dickstein sent a letter to Underwriters, providing Underwriters with a \"Notice of Circumstance\" regarding the Hettrick Malpractice Action. Dkt. 93-13. The following day, counsel for Underwriters, Furman Kornfeld &amp; Brennan LLP (\"FKB\"), acknowledged receipt of the Notice of Circumstance on behalf of Underwriters, referencing only the identification number for the Primary Policy. Dkt. 116-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In July 2013, FKB prepared a draft report to Underwriters containing a draft of a letter responding to Dickstein's Notice of Circumstance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkts. 116-23-25. The draft letter to Dickstein prepared by FKB suggested that Underwriters should deny defense and indemnity coverage to both Hettrick and Dickstein on account of Hettrick's alleged late notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action per the terms of the Primary Policy. Dkt. 116-24 at 6-7. After receiving the draft letter and report from FKB, Dickstein's broker responded to FKB by expressing concern about the validity of a denial of coverage to Hettrick and Dickstein based on the terms of the Primary Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-3. FKB responded by clarifying that the issue addressed in FKB's report was limited to whether coverage should be afforded to Hettrick individually, since Dickstein was not a named defendant in the Hettrick Malpractice Action, and \"should a direct claim be brought against Dickstein that coverage would be afforded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 1, 2013, FKB sent a letter to Dickstein's broker denying coverage for the Hettrick Malpractice Action under the Primary Policy, stating that Underwriters \"will not defend or indemnify Mr. Hettrick\" in connection with the Hettrick Malpractice Action. Dkt. 93-15 at 7. The letter denying coverage did not mention Scottsdale or the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 15, 2013, Hettrick passed away following a surfing accident. PSUF \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-5. In a letter dated October 22, 2013, FKB recommended to Dickstein's broker that the insurance file for the Hettrick Malpractice Action be closed in light of Hettrick's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Resolution of the Hettrick Malpractice Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 23, 2015, MBW entered into a settlement agreement with Hettrick's estate (the \"Estate\") and HettrickLaw regarding the Hettrick Malpractice Action (the \"Hettrick Settlement\"). PSUF \u00b6 32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-6. The Recitals page of the Hettrick Settlement stated that, following Underwriters' denial of coverage for the Hettrick Malpractice Action under the Primary Policy, the Estate was faced with substantial financial burdens in defending the Hettrick Malpractice Action, even though HettrickLaw was defended by its malpractice insurer, Hanover Insurance Company/Professional Direct Insurance Company (\"Hanover\"), under a reservation of rights. Dkt. 93-6 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the Hettrick Settlement, MBW agreed to dismiss HettrickLaw from the Hettrick Malpractice Action with prejudice and to substitute the Estate and the Estate's personal representative as the defendant in the action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The Estate agreed to allow the Hettrick Malpractice Action to proceed to an \"uncontested prove-up hearing\" on liability and damages, in which the court would consider all necessary and relevant evidence presented\n   by MBW, and the Estate would not contest the nature or amount of claims made by MBW against the Estate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. The court would then enter a final judgment against the Estate in the Hettrick Malpractice Action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. In exchange, MBW agreed to a covenant not to execute the final judgment against the Estate, and the Estate assigned any and all of its potential assignable claims against Underwriters regarding the denial of coverage for the Hettrick Malpractice Action, including breach of contract and insurance bad faith, to MBW or MBW's designated assignee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following the execution of the Hettrick Settlement, the Hettrick Malpractice Action proceeded to an uncontested trial. PSUF \u00b6 34. On August 10, 2015, the court in the Hettrick Malpractice Action entered judgment against the Estate for $63,888,486.49.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-4. At the same time, the court issued a Statement of Decision apportioning the final judgment as follows: (1) $91,764,841.38 due to the failure of MBW's insurer to pay claims submitted in July 2007; (2) $4,919,604.43 attributable to unnecessary attorney's fees and costs; (3) $228,217.57 in corporate travel costs; (4) 19,840.65 in witness travel costs; (5) $93,812.05 in claim preparation costs not reimbursed; and (6) consequential damages in the amount of $48,862,475.60 due to a delay in MBW's acquisition of a company called Apparel Ventures as a result of Hettrick's alleged malpractice regarding MBW's insurance claims. PSUF \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-5 at 6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The SFA Action and Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After the uncontested trial and judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action, FKB reopened the insurance file on behalf of Underwriters for the Hettrick Malpractice Action. PSUF \u00b6 36. On January 1, 2016, MBW assigned the judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action and MBW's rights under the Primary Policy and First Excess Policy to SFA Group, LLC (\"SFA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 78-3 at 28-35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, on December 7, 2016, SFA filed a lawsuit against Underwriters in California state court, captioned\n   <em>\n    SFA Group, LLC v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. BC618980 (Cal. Super. Ct.) (the \"SFA Action\"). PSUF \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the SFA Action, SFA brought claims against Underwriters and Scottsdale\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   under both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy for breach of the insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, due to Underwriters' denial of coverage and refusal to defend or indemnify Hettrick in connection with the Hettrick Malpractice Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-7 \u00b6\u00b6 44-71. SFA sought recovery of the judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action as the consequential damages of Underwriters' failure to defend Hettrick, pursued punitive damages against Underwriters under the insurance\n   bad faith claim, and also requested attorney's fees and costs in the action.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. The complaint in the SFA Action did not specify which claims SFA brought under the Primary Policy-pertaining to Underwriters only-and which claims also sought recovery under the First Excess Policy-pertaining both to Underwriters and Scottsdale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In August 2017, SFA and Underwriters engaged in mediation to resolve the SFA Action. PSUF \u00b6 41. Dickstein was not provided notice of the mediation and did not participate, since Dickstein was not a named defendant in the SFA Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 104 at 8 (Dickstein's brief in opposition to Scottsdale's motion for summary judgment representing as much). At the mediation, Brit negotiated on behalf of the Primary Policy insurers as the lead underwriter for that policy, while Beazley negotiated as lead underwriter on behalf of the First Excess Policy insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Frederick Marsh, Dkt. 118-7 (\"Marsh Decl.\"), \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hill Decl. \u00b6 11. Scottsdale evidently attended the mediation as a passive observer but refused to contribute to any settlement sum reached by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 106-6 at 157:19-160-5 (deposition of Paul Sewell with Huntersure regarding Scottsdale's involvement during the mediation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ultimately, in the mediation SFA and Underwriters reached an agreement in the form of a settlement term sheet signed and dated on August 17, 2017 (the \"Term Sheet\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-14. In the Term Sheet, SFA agreed \"to a complete, full, and final release by SFA of all known and unknown claims related to the denial of insurance to Clyde Hettrick, III for the malpractice claims against him presented by [MBW],\" a release which would cover \"all claims and damages of any kind, character, or descriptions of any kind whatsoever against UNDERWRITERS and to be identified other insurers of Dickstein Shapiro LLP.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Following execution of a binding settlement agreement, the Term Sheet provided that \"[a]ll litigations, arbitrations, and adjudications between SFA or MBW and any released party shall be dismissed with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In exchange for SFA's release of claims, Underwriters agreed in the Term Sheet to pay $17,500,000 to SFA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   SFA was \"entitled to allocate the settlement amount to damages for the delayed acquisition of Apparel Ventures,\" with SFA shouldering all tax issues and responsibilities arising from the allocation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Term Sheet further acknowledged that Underwriters \"may and will seek contribution towards this settlement amount from other parties and/or allocation among UNDERWRITERS,\" necessitating that Underwriters meet to determine how to allocate the settlement amount across each individual insurer within Underwriters and how to allocate the settlement across the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To allow for an allocation meeting, the Term Sheet was kept open until September 18, 2017 without revocability, and if Underwriters did not accept the settlement terms prior to that date, the Term Sheet would become null and void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Scottsdale was not a signatory to the Term Sheet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Allocation Negotiations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On August 18, 2017, the day after signing the Term Sheet, Aidan McCormack, counsel for Underwriters, notified his clients of the Term Sheet and encouraged Underwriters to negotiate an allocation of the $17.5 million settlement amount so that the settlement of the SFA action could be finalized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 118-8. Mr. McCormack informed Underwriters that he and his firm \"cannot be involved in allocation discussions among you,\" leaving the individual Underwriters insurers to negotiate\n   amongst themselves.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, Paul Sewell with Huntersure was included on the email as Scottsdale's representative.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Underwriters then initiated negotiation efforts amongst the insurers to allocate the SFA settlement amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hill Decl. \u00b6 15. The negotiations initially focused on the question of whether, and to what extent, any of the SFA settlement amount should be allocated toward \"extra-contractual obligations\" (also referred to as \"ECO\" exposure) for Underwriters' alleged breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in denying defense coverage to Hettrick in the Hettrick Malpractice Action, which was one of the claims asserted by SFA against Underwriters.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Any amount designated as ECO exposure would be borne solely by the subscribers to the Primary Policy above and beyond each subscriber's respective policy limit under the Primary Policy, on the ground that the Primary Policy insurers were solely responsible for the denial of coverage to Hettrick for the Hettrick Malpractice Action. The portion of the SFA settlement designated as ECO exposure would correlate to a reduction in the amount of the SFA settlement allocated to the insurance policies, consequently reducing the required contribution from the subscribers to the affected level of insurance by the amount of ECO exposure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Brit, the lead underwriter for the Primary Policy, first proposed that all of the SFA settlement amount should be applied toward the Primary Policy and First Excess Policy limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Apportionment across the two policies would be accomplished by (1) accounting for any prior erosion of the Primary Policy, (2) requiring the subscribers of the Primary Policy to pay the remainder of the Primary Policy limit according to each subscriber's respective share to satisfy a portion of the SFA settlement, and (3) allocating the remainder of the SFA settlement to the First Excess Policies per each subscriber's respective share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Under Brit's proposal, none of the settlement amount would be allocated toward ECO exposure to account for Underwriters' alleged bad faith denial of defense coverage to Hettrick.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Beazley, the lead underwriter under the First Excess Policy, countered Brit's proposal by arguing that up to one third of the $17.5 million settlement should be allocated to ECO exposure on the part of the Primary Policy insurers for their bad faith failure to defend, thereby requiring each subscriber to the Primary Policy to pay its respective share of ECO exposure above its Primary Policy limit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 15. Beazley's allocation would have required the subscribers to the Primary Policy to pay all of the $17.5 million settlement amount, without any amount allocated to the First Excess Policy. Marsh Decl. \u00b6 15. Because of the disagreement between Underwriters regarding the allocation across the Primary Policy and First Excess Policy, Mr. McCormack negotiated an extension of the Term Sheet with SFA to allow Underwriters to continue their allocation negotiation efforts.

Freddie Marsh, Beazley's representative acting on behalf of Underwriters in their capacity as First Excess Policy insurers, emailed Mr. Sewell on September 12, 2017, requesting Scottsdale's formal position on whether Scottsdale would agree to an allocation of a portion of the SFA settlement to the First Excess Policy limits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 118-9 at 3. The next day, on September 13, 2017, Mr. Sewell responded to Mr. Marsh, stating that \"Scottsdale will not be making any\n   contribution to the $17.5M settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Scottsdale took the position that the SFA settlement \"was in relation to [SFA's] claim [against Underwriters] for bad faith for the erroneous denial of coverage and the failure to defend the insured Lawyer in an underlying legal malpractice action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Scottsdale argued that had a defense been provided to Hettrick, the Hettrick Malpractice Action \"would not have cost anywhere near the [Primary Policy] limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In light of Scottsdale's representations that it would not contribute to the SFA settlement, Underwriters continued to negotiate amongst themselves and held a market meeting on November 14, 2017. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21. The day before the market meeting, on November 13, 2017, Scottsdale sent a letter to Underwriters reaffirming Scottsdale's refusal to contribute to the SFA settlement, arguing that \"the entirety of the $17.5 million [settlement] was paid because of [Underwriters'] bad faith denial of a defense.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 118-10. Beazley, representing the interests of the Underwriters subscribers to the First Excess Policy, responded to Scottsdale and informed Scottsdale of the market meeting, noting that \"Beazley as the second agreement party on the [Primary Policy] and the lead of the first excess layer, have called into question the allocation strategy of the primary lead.\" Dkt. 118-11 at 2. Mr. Sewell testified at his deposition that, despite having notice of the market meeting from Beazley, Scottsdale was not affirmatively invited to the market meeting, although neither was Scottsdale \"disinvited\" from attending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-19 at 170:3-9, 171:6-12. In response to Scottsdale's letter, Beazley also disagreed with Scottsdale's characterization that all of the SFA settlement should be considered ECO exposure, noting that while there is \"huge debate\" over the proper amount of ECO exposure that should be incorporated in the SFA settlement allocation, \"zero is clearly not reflective of the real extracontractual exposure, nor was it over 50%.\" Dkt. 118-11 at 1. Ultimately, Scottsdale did not attend the market meeting, and neither did Dickstein.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marsh Decl. \u00b6 17; Dkt. 104 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   At the market meeting, Underwriters negotiated the amount of the SFA settlement that should be designated as ECO exposure. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 19. Without Scottsdale's contribution to the SFA settlement, at the market meeting Underwriters also had to resolve the issue of how Underwriters would account for Scottsdale's gap in contribution to the SFA settlement for any amount of the settlement allocated to the First Excess Policy. Hill Decl. \u00b6 19. Ultimately, Underwriters reached a compromise regarding the allocation of the SFA settlement. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 19. Per the compromise, the settlement amount would first be allocated to exhaust the Primary Policy limit, which at that time had been subject to an unconfirmed amount of prior erosion from unrelated claims. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 19. Then, the additional amount of the SFA settlement not allocated to the Primary Policy would be paid by the subscribers to the First Excess Policy, absent Scottsdale's 29.38% share of the First Excess Policy. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 19. Scottsdale's unaccounted share would then be paid pro rata by each remaining subscriber of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the Primary Policy and First Excess Policy-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Underwriters-with any amount paid by the Primary Policy subscribers considered to be ECO exposure as paid above the Primary Policy limits. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In early December 2017, Beazley prepared a spreadsheet to calculate the contributions due from each subscriber to the Primary Policy and First Excess Policy pursuant to the terms of the compromise\n   at the market meeting (the \"Allocation Sheet\"). Marsh Decl. \u00b6 21; Dkt. 118-5 at 66. Underwriters confirmed the amount of prior erosion under the Primary Policy as $3,258,007, leaving the remaining balance of the Primary Policy as $11,741,993. Dkt. 118-5 at 66. Under the Allocation Sheet, the subscribers to the Primary Policy agreed to pay a total of $12,998,546 toward the SFA settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, when subtracting the remaining balance of the Primary Policy from the amount paid by the Primary Policy insurers, the Primary Policy insurers contributed $1,256,553 above the Primary Policy limits, or approximately 7.18% of the value of the SFA settlement, as ECO exposure. Hill Decl. \u00b6 22; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 21. Per the Allocation Sheet, the First Excess Policy insurers-excluding Scottsdale-agreed to pay the remaining $4,501,454 of the SFA settlement as indemnity under the First Excess Policy. Dkt. 118-5 at 66. Scottsdale's attributed share of the First Excess Policy erosion was $1,691,702, an amount which was allocated pro rata both to subscribers to the Primary Policy (as the ECO exposure) and to the other subscribers to the First Excess Policy (for which the Underwriters subscribers to the First Excess Policy seek equitable contribution from Scottsdale in this action). Dkt. 118-5 at 66. Scottsdale disputes the characterization of any excess amounts paid by the Primary Policy insurers per this compromise as allocated toward ECO exposure, arguing that it was a simple \"exercise in math\" to account for the gap in funding created by Scottsdale's refusal to contribute and pointing to the absence of any affirmative representations by Underwriters as to the allocation between \"covered\" claims under the Primary Policy and First Excess Polity and \"non-covered\" claims of bad faith failure to defend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 138 at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-16 (email from Marie Hill explaining that Underwriters \"all agreed to increase our contributions\" to \"address the shortfall\" resulting from Scottsdale's refusal to contribute).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   After agreeing to the Allocation Sheet, Underwriters and SFA entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and General Release, fully executed on December 7, 2017 (the \"SFA Settlement Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 118-4.

SFA also agreed to dismiss all legal proceedings between SFA and Underwriters related to the Hettrick Malpractice Action with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.

Whether the SFA Settlement Agreement Erodes the Primary Policy Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The thrust of Scottsdale's position in this case is that the SFA Action, and the ensuing SFA Settlement Agreement, pertained only to claims against Underwriters for Underwriters' direct liability for bad faith denial of defense coverage to Hettrick for the Hettrick Malpractice Action. Scottsdale argues that, because the almost $64 million uncontested judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action would not have occurred had Underwriters tendered a defense to Hettrick pursuant to the Primary Policy, Underwriters' bad faith denial of coverage to Hettrick was the sole proximate cause of the $64 million judgment. Scottsdale therefore construes the SFA Settlement Agreement as a settlement only of the bad faith insurance claim, which is not a covered \"claim\" under the Primary Policy and does not erode the Primary Policy limits at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The effect of the SFA Settlement Agreement on the policy limits of the Primary Policy is strictly a matter of interpreting the insurance contract at issue. Under California law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a court must give effect to the parties' mutual intentions in forming the contract, which is first determined by referring solely to the written provisions of the contract.\n   <em>\n    Palacin v.

It is undisputed that Hettrick was an \"Assured\" under the Primary Policy, which FKB acknowledges in the letter denying coverage to Hettrick.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-15 at 7 (\"Hettrick is an Assured under the Policy.\"). A \"Claim\" is defined as a \"demand received by any Assured for money or services including the service of suit or institution or [sic] arbitration proceedings against the Assured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Per this language, the Hettrick Malpractice Action constituted a \"Claim\" against Hettrick arising out of Hettrick's failure to render competent professional legal services to MBW. \"Damages\" is defined in the Primary Policy to mean \"a monetary judgment, award or settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unquestionably, the $64 million judgment of the Hettrick Malpractice Action was a legal obligation Hettrick (or the Estate) was liable to pay, meaning that the judgment constituted \"Damages\" under the Primary Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   SFA's claims against Underwriters in the SFA Action included claims for breach of the insurance contract for Underwriters' failure to defend Hettrick in the Hettrick Malpractice Action, which resulted in a judgment against the Estate in the Hettrick Malpractice Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-7 \u00b6\u00b6 44-58 (SFA's claims for breach of contract). The breach of contract claims sought recovery under the terms of the insurance policies at issue, including up to and above the limits of the Primary Policy. SFA's success on those claims would necessarily depend on a finding that the Primary Policy did indeed extend coverage to Hettrick for the Hettrick Malpractice Action, meaning that the uncontested judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action would be a covered \"Claim\" for \"Damages\" for which Underwriters was responsible under the Primary Policy. Had SFA been successful on the breach of contract claims, the judgment would signify that Underwriters is responsible to provide insurance coverage under the Primary Policy to SFA, the assignee of Hettrick's rights as an insured under the Primary Policy, for \"damages\" that Hettrick was legally obligated to pay arising out of Hettrick's malpractice in the rendering of professional legal services. Therefore, the potential damages sought in the SFA Action included indemnity payments under the Primary Policy, and the SFA Action clearly implicates insurance coverage under the unambiguous terms of the Primary Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Underwriters had the right to negotiate a settlement of the claims in the\n   SFA Action covered by the Primary Policy without Scottsdale's consent. Indeed, \"a primary insurer may negotiate a good faith settlement of a claim in an amount which invades excess coverage, and [ ] the primary insurer may enter into such settlement binding upon the excess insurer without the excess insurer's consent, notwithstanding [a] 'no action' clause\" in the excess insurer's policy.\n   <em>\n    Diamond Heights Homeowners Ass'n v.

Underwriters agreed to pay the limits of the Primary Policy for claims that are potentially covered under the Primary Policy, and Scottsdale has not explained how the Court is authorized to reverse Underwriters' decision to make a payment under their own insurance policies. Accordingly, it was appropriate for Underwriters to pay SFA pursuant to the SFA Settlement Agreement under the Primary Policy limits in order to resolve all of the claims in the SFA Action, which included claims falling within the insurance coverage provided by the Primary Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Scottsdale does not argue that any language in the Primary Policy is ambiguous and should be construed differently than above. Instead, Scottsdale disputes the characterization of the SFA Settlement Agreement as a payment of \"indemnity\" under the terms of the Primary Policy. Scottsdale argues that, because the SFA Action also included a claim against Underwriters for bad faith in denying defense coverage to Hettrick, the entirety of the SFA Settlement Agreement must be construed as Underwriters' personal, extra-contractual liability without eroding the policy limits of the Primary Policy whatsoever. But Scottsdale provides no legal support for the proposition that, in an action containing both breach of insurance contract claims and bad faith denial of coverage claims against an insurer, any settlement of such an action must legally be deemed as the insurer's personal liability for bad faith without eroding the limits of the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Scottsdale's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Amato v.

Scottsdale's assertion is true even though Hettrick and the Estate received defense coverage from Hanover, Hettrick's malpractice insurer through HettrickLaw. However, conspicuously absent from the opinion in\n   <em>\n    Amato\n   </em>\n   or any other case cited by Scottsdale is any reference to the effect of extra-contractual consequential damages on the insurer's insurance policy limits. Scottsdale has not identified a case holding that, following an insurer's wrongful refusal to defend an insured,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   consequential damages resulting therefrom are extra-contractual and cannot be applied to erode or exhaust the insurer's policy limits as pertaining to a \"covered\" claim under the insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Even if California precedent did necessitate that all consequential damages from an insurer's bad faith refusal to defend were extra-contractual in nature and would not erode policy limits-which it apparently does not-Scottsdale ignores the fact that, in the SFA Action, SFA brought not only bad faith claims against Underwriters but also claims for breach of the insurance contract. For this reason alone, Scottsdale's belief that \"the entirety of [Underwriters'] payment to SFA was made to resolve a direct claim against the primary carriers\" for bad faith, Dkt. 138 at 23, is incorrect. Per\n   <em>\n    Amato\n   </em>\n   , if Underwriters was not \"unreasonable\" in failing to provide Hettrick with a defense, then Underwriters would not be subjected to additional consequential damages as a \"tort\" remedy, and the only recovery would be contractual in nature. If an insurer had a reasonable basis to conclude that a tendered defense was not covered by the insurance policy, contractual damages for the breach of the duty to defend are usually limited to \"the costs of the defense\" incurred by the insured.\n   <em>\n    Amato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20Cal.%20App.%204th%20825\">\n    53 Cal.

If, in that subsequent action, it is determined that there was no coverage then the measure of damages for a wrongful failure to defend would be limited to the costs and attorney's fees expended by the insured in defending the underlying action.\"). However, authorities interpreting\n   <em>\n    Amato\n   </em>\n   have concluded that consequential damages following the failure to defend should be recoverable even under a breach of contract theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Ins. Litig. (2018) \u00a7 7:692.3. In keeping with this notion, the entirety of the uncontested judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action could be recovered under a breach of contract theory alone, which would similarly apply to exhaust the Primary Policy limits. There is simply no legal basis for Scottdale's conclusion that the entirety of the damages sought in the SFA Action could only be awarded as extra-contractual under a theory of bad faith without affecting insurance policy limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the time Underwriters settled the SFA Action, there had been no binding resolution of the question whether coverage of the Hettrick Malpractice Action was required under the Primary Policy. The SFA Settlement Agreement did not purport to make any legal determinations about whether coverage to Hettrick was required under the Primary Policy, or whether Underwriters acted reasonably in\n   denying a defense to Hettrick. Because the settlement occurred prior to any adjudication of the issues of coverage under the Primary Policy, there had been no legal determinations necessary to conclude whether Underwriters acted in \"bad faith\" in refusing to defend Hettrick or merely made a reasonable mistake making available only contractual damages. Underwriters theoretically may have been successful had they argued in the SFA Action that coverage to Hettrick was rightfully denied under the Primary Policy, even though insurers have a broader duty to defend insureds for any claims potentially covered under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montrose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1995112\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/6/287/#p295\">\n    6 Cal. 4th at 299-300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20467\">\n    24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=861%20P.2d%201153\">\n    861 P.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In light of the uncertainty surrounding the extent and nature of Underwriters' potential liability in the SFA Action, the amount paid by Underwriters to settle the SFA Action reflects Underwriters' assessment of the risk that Underwriters could be liable for bad faith in addition to the normal contractual damages for breach of the insurance contract, potentially subjecting Underwriters to liability for the full $64 million judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action as consequential damages. Putting the prudence of Underwriters' allocation of that settlement amount aside, because the SFA Action included claims potentially covered under the Primary Policy, nothing in the law precluded Underwriters from making a payment under the Primary Policy limits to resolve the SFA Action. In the end, Scottsdale has not articulated why Underwriters was legally unable to attribute any amount of the SFA Settlement Agreement toward the Primary Policy merely in light of\n   <em>\n    Amato\n   </em>\n   's general representations that consequential damages may be available against an insurer that denied defense coverage in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   It is apparent that Scottsdale's intention in bringing this action is to relitigate the bad faith claims brought by SFA against Underwriters in the SFA Action. The bulk of Scottsdale's briefing attempts to characterize Underwriters' denial of coverage to Hettrick for the Hettrick Malpractice Action as patently unreasonable. Yet it is not for this Court to validate Scottsdale's position that Underwriters acted unreasonably in denying coverage to Hettrick, because those claims against Underwriters have been fully released via the SFA Settlement Agreement. Scottsdale may be displeased with Underwriters' decision to allocate the SFA Settlement Agreement to exhaust the Primary Policy limit, but as the excess insurer, Scottsdale has no independent right to veto a reasonable settlement decision made by the primary insurer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2332556\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/227/563/#p580\">\n    227 Cal.

Instead, Scottsdale would only be entitled to pursue relief against the primary insurers through a theory of equitable subrogation, on the ground that the primary insurers breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing owed to the insureds by improperly allocating the SFA settlement amount toward the policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commercial Union Assurance Cos. v.

Without any such language, Scottsdale as an excess insurer has no discernible ability to relitigate SFA's claims of bad faith against Underwriters or to object to Underwriters' decision to pay the policy limits of the Primary Policy to satisfy the settlement of potentially covered claims brought against Underwriters in the SFA Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   To summarize, in order to determine the legal effect of the SFA Settlement Agreement on the policy limits of the Primary Policy, the sole question for the Court to resolve is the interpretation of the unambiguous contractual language in the Primary Policy itself. Because the SFA Action encompassed claims for breach of the insurance contract that potentially constituted \"covered\" claims under the unambiguous terms of the Primary Policy, and because Underwriters paid the policy limit of the Primary Policy to resolve those \"covered\" claims, the Primary Policy limits were exhausted, and Scottsdale has no ability to challenge the primary insurers' settlement decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Whether the SFA Settlement Agreement Erodes the First Excess Policy Limits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Because Underwriters' settlement of the SFA Action exhausted the Primary Policy limits, the next question is whether the SFA Settlement Agreement erodes the policy limits of the First Excess Policy. What constitutes a \"covered\" claim under the First Excess Policy is functionally identical to the coverage provided by the Primary Policy. Thus, for the same reasons as stated above, the Hettrick Malpractice Action, and the breach of insurance contract claims brought in the SFA Action, were potentially \"covered\" claims under the First Excess Policy as well. The only issue to resolve, therefore, is whether the First Excess Policy properly attached to the SFA Settlement Agreement due to the exhaustion of the Primary Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The explicit terms of the First Excess Policy mandate that liability under the First Excess Policy attaches when the subscribers to the Primary Policy \"have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay, the full amount of their indemnity inclusive of costs and expenses.\" Dkt. 80-2 at 5. California courts analyzing similar \"have paid\" language in excess insurance policies-also referred to as \"loss payable\" clauses-have concluded that such language unambiguously makes the excess insurance policy attach when and only when the full amount of the underlying insurance policies has actually been paid by the primary insurers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Qualcomm, Inc. v.

Specifically, the California court of appeal has held that \"the phrase 'have paid ... the full amount of [indemnity],' particularly when read in the context of the entire excess policy and its function as arising upon exhaustion of primary insurance, cannot have any other reasonable meaning than actual payment of no less than the ... underlying [policy] limit.\"\n   <em>\n    Qualcomm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3995163\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/161/184/#p195\">\n    161 Cal.

Nevertheless, following the SFA Settlement Agreement, Underwriters actually \"paid\" the policy limits of the Primary Policy to SFA as part of the settlement amount, internally labeling the payment an \"urgent indemnity payment on behalf of [Underwriters] subscribing to the Primary $15M layer.\" Dkt. 118-12 at 1 (emphasis removed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 118-5 (email from Brit to Underwriters' claims processor requesting payment of the SFA Settlement Agreement pursuant to the Primary Policy and attaching the SFA Settlement Agreement and the Allocation Sheet).

When an excess insurer is presented with a proposed settlement of a potentially covered claim approved by both the primary insurer and the insured party, the excess insurer has three distinct options: \"The excess insurer must (1) approve the proposed settlement, (2) reject it and take over the defense, or (3) reject it, decline to take over the defense, and face a potential lawsuit by the insured seeking contribution toward the settlement.\"\n   <em>\n    Teleflex Med.

Underwriters were not required to provide their consent, but voluntarily chose to do so; in effect, Underwriters' agreement to pay a portion of the SFA Settlement Agreement out of the policy limits for the First Excess Policy amounted to a waiver of any defenses to coverage under the First Excess Policy that Underwriters otherwise could have advanced in the SFA Action. For the same reasons as with the Primary Policy, because the unambiguous terms of the First Excess Policy were satisfied by the SFA Settlement Agreement, there is no basis to hold that the Underwriters subscribers to the First Excess Policy were not permitted to pay a portion of the SFA settlement under the policy limits of the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Accordingly, because Underwriters actually paid a portion of the limits of the First Excess Policy to resolve potentially covered claims via the SFA Settlement Agreement, the First Excess Policy was eroded by $4,501,454, which is the amount of the SFA Settlement Agreement that Underwriters paid out of the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Under California law, equitable contribution in the insurance context is summarized as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [T]he right to contribution arises when several insurers are obligated to indemnify or defend the same loss or claim, and one insurer has paid more than its share of the loss or defended the action without any participation by the others. Where multiple insurance carriers insure the same insured and cover the same risk, each insurer has independent standing to assert a cause of action against its coinsurers for equitable contribution when it has undertaken the defense or indemnification of the common insured. Equitable contribution permits reimbursement to the insurer that paid on the loss for the excess it paid over its proportionate share of the obligation, on the theory that the debt it paid was equally and concurrently owed by the other insurers and should be shared by them pro rata in proportion to their respective coverage of the risk. The purpose of this rule of equity is to accomplish substantial justice by equalizing the common burden shared by coinsurers, and to prevent one insurer from profiting at the expense of others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Ins.

At first glance, the basic elements for equitable contribution appear to be met in this case. The subscribers to the First Excess Policy seek equitable contribution from Scottsdale for the amount of the SFA settlement sum allocated to the First Excess Policy limits. Scottsdale shares the same level of obligation as the Underwriters subscribers to the First Excess Policy, provides coverage for the same defense and indemnity risks as the other subscribers to the First Excess Policy, and insures the same insured parties as the other subscribers to the First Excess Policy. As detailed above in this Order, the settlement of the SFA Action was not only for Underwriters' extra-contractual liability for claims of bad faith in refusing to defend Hettrick, but also released all claims against Underwriters for breach of the insurance contract, which did implicate the insurance policy limits under both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy. Therefore, Scottsdale was an insurer of a portion of the \"risks\" posed by the SFA Action on even keel with the Underwriters subscribing to the First Excess Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, most importantly, equitable contribution applies only where the insurer from which contribution is sought also had a\n   <em>\n    legal obligation\n   </em>\n   to provide coverage for the insured. \"One of the firm principles undergirding the doctrine of equitable contribution is that two or more insurers share an obligation to the common insured ...

In fact, Scottsdale did not have formal notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action at all, because the Notice of Circumstance letter tendered by Hettrick's attorney to FKB did not specify under which policy or policies defense coverage was sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-13. FKB was the agent for notice of claims not only for Underwriters under the Primary Policy but also for both Underwriters and Scottsdale under the First Excess Policy, meaning that Scottsdale conceivably could be attributed with constructive notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action. However, FKB's response to Hettrick's attorney acknowledging the Notice of Circumstance made reference only to the identification number for the Primary Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-2. Without formal notice to Scottsdale of the Hettrick Malpractice Action or the ensuing uncontested judgment of almost $64 million, and without formal acknowledgment of the Notice of Circumstance as a potential claim implicating the First Excess Policy by either Scottsdale or FKB, Scottsdale did not provide its consent to the costs of the Hettrick Malpractice Action prior to the time those costs were incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Even if the Notice of Circumstance to Underwriters and FKB could constitute formal notice to Scottsdale under the First Excess Policy on the ground that Hettrick did not identify under which specific insurance policy he sought coverage, it is dispositive that the letter from FKB denying coverage to Hettrick for the Hettrick Malpractice Action referenced only the identification number of the Primary Policy, referring to the insurers denying coverage as \"Underwriters at Lloyd's, London\" without referencing Scottsdale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-15 at 2. After Underwriters denied coverage under the Primary Policy, Hettrick never requested defense coverage from Scottsdale under the First Excess Policy. And in any event, Scottsdale would not have been legally obligated to provide defense coverage had Hettrick tendered a claim under the First Excess Policy, because liability to provide defense coverage to an insured does not attach under the First Excess Policy states that \"unless and until the Underwriters of the [Primary Policy] shall have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay, the full amount of their indemnity inclusive of costs and expenses.\" Dkt. 80-2 at 5. Therefore, Scottsdale had no duty to defend Hettrick in the Hettrick Malpractice Action under the First Excess Policy following Underwriters' denial of coverage under the Primary Policy, and Scottsdale cannot be held liable for equitable contribution in the absence of a legal obligation to contribute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

Scottsdale maintained strong defenses to coverage of the Hettrick Malpractice Action as identified above, independent of Underwriters' potential defenses to coverage as the Primary Policy insurers. Underwriters, in their capacity as excess insurers, could have advanced the same arguments as Scottsdale in an effort to seek to avoid liability under the First Excess Policy as part of the SFA Action. Underwriters were disincentivized to do so, however, because any dollar not attributed to the First Excess Policy otherwise would be incurred personally by Underwriters as extra-contractual liability. In accord, Underwriters voluntarily agreed to pay a portion of the SFA settlement from the First Excess Policy, and in the process Underwriters effectively waived any defenses to coverage they might otherwise have advanced under the First Excess Policy. Scottsdale's refusal to participate in the settlement of the SFA Action can be recharacterized as Scottsdale's refusal to voluntarily waive its coverage defenses regarding the Hettrick Malpractice Action, which is anything but unreasonable. As\n   <em>\n    American Continental\n   </em>\n   noted, \"if there was no contractual obligation [on the part of the non-settling insurer], then there can be no successful assertion of a claim for equitable contribution by [the settling insurer] merely because it chose, in the pursuit of its own interests and obligations, to settle the [underlying] action by purchasing the peace of its insureds.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. Continental\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1282244\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/86/929/#p937\">\n    86 Cal.

Underwriters subscribed to both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy, while Scottsdale was the lone insurer that subscribed only to the First Excess Policy. Although SFA included Scottsdale as a defendant in the SFA Action, SFA's claims for bad faith were brought primarily against Underwriters in their capacity as the Primary Policy insurers, given that the Primary Policy insurers-not Scottsdale-were responsible for denying defense coverage to Hettrick in the Hettrick Malpractice Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 93-15 at 2 (denial of coverage letter referencing only the Primary Policy). Scottsdale's refusal to consent to any payment to SFA under the First Excess Policy was justified in the sense that Scottsdale believed that the entirety of any settlement amount would be attributed to resolve the bad faith claims, and Underwriters did not reveal any intent to allocate a portion of the SFA settlement to the First Excess Policy limits until after Underwriters' market meeting in November 2017. No such representations were made during the mediation to resolve the SFA Action, at which Scottsdale was present. Had Underwriters indicated during the mediation that the $17.5 million lump sum payment would be allocated in any way toward the First Excess Policy, Scottsdale surely would have objected at that time rather than remaining a passive observer. Scottsdale's silence cannot be held as a waiver of Scottsdale's strong defenses to coverage of the Hettrick Malpractice Action as an excess carrier, particularly in light of these convoluted facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Underwriters' cited cases supporting the argument that equitable contribution should require Scottsdale to pay its share of the First Excess Policy payments under the SFA settlement are unavailing. Although an excess insurer may not challenge a settlement decision by a primary insurer if the excess insurer denies coverage for a third-party claim against an insured, see\n   <em>\n    United Servs. Auto. Ass'n v. Alaska Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"171356\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/94/638/#p644\">\n    94 Cal.

And Underwriters' settlement of the SFA Action was not a settlement of a third-party claim against an insured; the settlement pertained to Underwriters' direct liability, whether contractual or extra-contractual, for failing to defend Hettrick in the underlying action. Scottsdale is not challenging Underwriters' decision to settle a third-party claim on behalf of an insured but instead rebukes the notion that Scottsdale should contribute to the settlement of the SFA Action ultimately reached by Underwriters. Because Scottsdale was never asked to participate in the defense of Hettrick, Scottsdale did not waive its right to object to payment of the SFA settlement sum pursuant to Scottsdale's subscription to the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Fuller-Austin Insulation Co. v.

But here, the analogous settlement negotiations relevant to this case are those in the underlying Hettrick Malpractice Action, not the settlement of the SFA Action. Scottsdale had no formal notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action and was not asked to participate in any of the proceedings in the Hettrick Malpractice Action, including the stipulation to allow for an uncontested judgment against the Estate. Because Scottsdale possessed legitimate defenses to coverage of the Hettrick Malpractice Action under the terms of the First Excess Policy, Scottsdale rightfully refused under the terms of the Scottsdale First Excess Policy to consent to contribute toward any settlement of the SFA Action.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crowley Mar.

There is no indication that the First Excess Policy was triggered by the filing of the Hettrick Malpractice Action, and Underwriters has not articulated a basis for concluding that Scottsdale was legally obligated to drop down to cover Hettrick when the Primary Policy insurers would not.

Cal. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Allocation of the SFA Settlement Agreement in this case presents a unique posture. In a typical case addressing allocation of a settlement amount, the allocation is necessary to resolve a subsequent claim for equitable indemnity by a party to a settlement that seeks to have some or all of the settlement covered by an insurer. Instead, here it is the Underwriters insurers under the First Excess Policy that are seeking to establish an allocation of the settlement amount between their own extra-contractual liability for bad faith denial of defense coverage (in their capacity as Primary Policy insurers) and contractual liability under the insurance policies, so that Underwriters can recoup from Scottsdale a portion of the payments made under the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The uniqueness of the facts of this case reveal the collusive nature of the purported allocation reached by Underwriters. Based on the undisputed facts presented to the Court, in the mediation to resolve the SFA Action, neither SFA nor Underwriters discussed a purported allocation of the settlement amount reached between the claims brought in the SFA Action. Instead, the Term Sheet executed by SFA and Underwriters explicitly contemplated that Underwriters would meet and negotiate internally to determine how to allocate the $17.5 million settlement sum between the Primary Policy, the Excess Policy, and ECO exposure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 116-14 at 1. Brit, the lead underwriter for the Primary Policy, exchanged emails with Beazley, the lead underwriter for the First Excess Policy, in an attempt to decide how to allocate the settlement sum fairly between the Primary\n   Policy and First Excess Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hill Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 18; Marsh Decl. \u00b6 15. When these negotiations were unsuccessful, Underwriters held a market meeting, where Brit advocated on behalf of the interests of the Primary Policy insurers and Beazley advocated on behalf of the Underwriters subscribers to the First Excess Policy. Hill Decl. \u00b6 21. SFA did not participate in the allocation negotiations, because SFA had no pecuniary interest in how to allocate the settlement sum SFA would receive from Underwriters. Nor did Scottsdale participate, even though Scottsdale had advance notice of the market meeting. And Dickstein, the principal insured party under the insurance policies, also was not a party to the allocation negotiations, even though any allocation decision reached by Underwriters would affect the remaining coverage afforded to Dickstein under its malpractice insurance. Therefore, among the parties participating in the settlement of the SFA Action, only Underwriters had an interest in how to allocate the settlement amount across the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Such a one-sided negotiation amongst only Underwriters operated as collusion, allowing Underwriters to settle on a favorable allocation of the settlement proceeds that could erode the limits of Underwriters' insurance policies to the maximum extent possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505106\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/64/264/#p286\">\n    64 Cal.

Indeed, even though Brit and Beazley negotiated from adverse positions by representing the interests of the Primary Policy insurers and First Excess Policy insurers respectively, Brit and Beazley-and the other Underwriters insurers-were subscribers to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   policy layers and therefore had a mutual interest to minimize the amount of ECO exposure above the policy limits that Underwriters had to bear from the settlement. Any extra-contractual payments by Underwriters would not reduce the policy limits for the insurance policies and would instead would be borne as Underwriters' out-of-pocket expenses. Brit and Beazley both subscribed to a 22.58% share of the Primary Policy; it would be a farce to suggest that Brit and Beazley had competing interests in the negotiations, when both would be forced to bear the exact same percentage of extra-contractual liability under the Primary Policy. Even though Beazley subscribed to a greater percentage share of the First Excess Policy, every dollar attributed to the First Excess Policy instead of to extra-contractual liability reduces the remaining policy limit under the First Excess Policy, thereby saving Beazley money to be owed on an ongoing basis under the First Excess Policy. Brit shared these exact same incentives, even as a lesser subscriber to the First Excess Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Moreover, Underwriters as a whole were incentivized to direct as much of the settlement toward the First Excess Policy so that Underwriters could attempt to recover as much of the SFA settlement from Scottsdale, the lone non-participating insurer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505106\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/64/264/#p286\">\n    64 Cal.

Underwriters' position as both primary and excess insurers in this case inherently renders any internal negotiations about how to allocate the SFA settlement sum between the insurance policies and the primary insurers' extra-contractual liability collusive. Therefore, Underwriters is not entitled to a presumption that the Allocation Sheet is a reasonable allocation of the SFA settlement amount\n   between covered and non-covered claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regan Roofing\n   </em>\n   , 21 Cal.

Here too, Underwriters has not provided any evidence of the market meeting negotiations that would allow the Court to conclude that such negotiations were, in fact, adversarial and non-collusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Underwriters also did not provide the Court with any risk-based assessment of the claims asserted in the SFA Action to support the conclusion that allocating only $1,256,553 toward the Primary Policy insurers' extra-contractual liability. In fact, Scottsdale's argument that Underwriters simply engaged in a \"math exercise\" to account for Scottsdale's missing contribution has merit. Underwriters appears to have reached their purported allocation of extra-contractual liability by (1) taking the amount of the settlement that Underwriters did not allocate to Scottsdale ($17.5 million - Scottsdale's allocated share of $1,691,702 = $15,808,298), (2) determining the percentage of Underwriters' allocation that corresponded to payments by the Primary Policy insurers (remaining Primary Policy balance of $11,741,993 / $15,808,298 = approximately 74.28%), and applying that percentage to the share of the First Excess Policy payments allocated to Scottsdale (74.28% * $1,691,702 = approximately $1,256,553). Even if Underwriters settled on the allocation in the Allocation Sheet through a mathematical exercise solely to account for Scottsdale's gap,\n   which is likely because the math checks out, nothing necessarily precluded Underwriters from determining that such an allocation was a reasonable estimate of ECO exposure that should be borne by the Primary Policy insurers. But Underwriters did not present any evidence showing that this number is a reasonable estimate of the Primary Policy insurers' risk of being found liable for bad faith. Without anything more on the record, the Allocation Sheet is merely the product of a \"collusive\" negotiation at the market meeting and is more akin to after-the-fact testimony from Underwriters explaining \"how [they] believe[ ] settlement proceeds would have been allocated had the parties\n   <em>\n    negotiated and resolved\n   </em>\n   the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505106\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/64/264/#p286\">\n    64 Cal.

That is not an issue raised before the Court in this case, so the Court has no reason to make a good faith determination regarding Underwriters' allocation of the SFA settlement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The procedure identified in\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   , where the Court allocates the settlement in a manner most advantageous to the nonsettling party, does not require the Court to identify what would be the hypothetical good-faith allocation that Underwriters could have reached, considering the risks posed by the SFA Action and the likelihood of success on the various claims brought against Underwriters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Instead, for purposes of Underwriters' claim for equitable contribution, the case law cited above seemingly applies to require the Court simply to award Underwriters nothing for their claim. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   noted that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [i]n many situations of this kind where a settling defendant pursues a cross-claim for partial indemnity against a party who is not jointly and severally liable for all claims, allocating settlement proceeds in the way that most benefits the nonsettling defendant would mean that the cross-complainant recovers nothing because the proceeds should first be allocated to those for which the settling defendant is liable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <em>\n    Dillingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505106\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/64/264/#p286\">\n    64 Cal.

The same logic applies to Underwriters' \"cross-claim\" against Scottsdale for equitable contribution; to allocate the SFA settlement most advantageously to Scottsdale, then the entirety of the SFA settlement would be allocated to Underwriters' extra-contractual liability, with the policy limits of both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy remaining intact. The Court does not make such a finding for purposes of the parties' respective claims for declaratory relief, because, as explained above, there is no basis in the law for such a conclusion. But, when isolating Underwriters' equitable claim for contribution from Scottsdale for the amount\n   Underwriters actually paid under the First Excess Policy, in light of the collusive nature of the allocation of the SFA settlement and the absence of any evidence suggesting that such an allocation was a reasonable assessment of the risks posed by the SFA Action, the only fair outcome is that Scottsdale cannot be required to contribute to Underwriters' settlement figure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The balance of equities further supports this result. As explained above, the evidence shows that Scottsdale, the only excess carrier not subscribed to the Primary Policy, was not actively involved in the decision by the Primary Policy insurers not to defend Hettrick. As a result of Scottsdale's unique position as the only pure excess carrier, Scottsdale played a secondary role in the mediation and as a defendant in the SFA Action, because Scottsdale presumably only would be held liable if the subscribers to the First Excess Policy were found\n   <em>\n    contractually\n   </em>\n   liable to cover a portion of the uncontested judgment in the Hettrick Malpractice Action. But the overriding nature of the SFA Action was for the Primary Policy insurers' failure to defend Hettrick, which implicates only Underwriters. The nature of the claims in the SFA Action, coupled with Scottsdale's distinct role as purely an excess carrier compared to Underwriters' subscription to both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy, weigh heavily against requiring Scottsdale to contribute to a settlement effectuated solely by Underwriters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Axis Surplus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250283\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/204/1214/#p1231\">\n    204 Cal.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Scottsdale brings two distinct challenges to the Court's Order on summary judgment, each of which is addressed separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Policy Period\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   First, Scottsdale argues that the Court erred by dismissing Scottsdale's argument that the Hettrick Malpractice Action did not even fall within the policy period under the Primary Policy, because Scottsdale collected evidence that Clyde Hettrick had received notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action in the reporting period for the previous policy year. Scottsdale raised this argument during the briefing on summary judgment, see Dkt. 138 at 24-25, and the Court addressed Scottsdale's argument in the SJ Order by noting that \"Scottsdale's argument that there are disputed facts regarding which policy period is even at issue ... is irrelevant because such a question is immaterial to the specific legal issues to be resolved in this action.\" SJ Order at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Scottsdale's argument about the policy period is simply a rehashing of an argument made and rejected at the summary judgment stage, argument which the Court rejected as immaterial. Indeed, Scottsdale's arguments on the policy period issue were irrelevant to the scope of Scottsdale's claims for declaratory relief set forth in the First Amended Complaint, which were the only claims at issue in the SJ Order after the Court denied Scottsdale's motion for leave to file an amended complaint after briefing on summary judgment had already begun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 155. Thus, Scottsdale impermissibly has used a motion for reconsideration to relitigate an issue previously raised in the litigation, contrary to\n   the purposes of motions for reconsideration filed pursuant to Rule 59(e), Rule 60(b), and Local Rule 7-18. Nothing about Scottsdale's position in the motion for reconsideration provides grounds for the Court to alter its prior ruling under the binding rules governing motions for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Putting aside the procedural bases for denying Scottsdale's motion for reconsideration, the Court finds it prudent to address Scottsdale's substantive argument in greater detail. Specifically, whether the Hettrick Malpractice Action actually constituted a claim made during the policy period of the Primary Policy is ultimately irrelevant to Scottsdale's claims for declaratory relief because the subscribers to the Primary Policy agreed to pay a portion of the SFA Settlement Agreement out of the Primary Policy. As the Court noted in the SJ Order, \"Scottsdale may be displeased with Underwriters' decision to allocate the SFA Settlement Agreement to exhaust the Primary Policy limit, but as the excess insurer, Scottsdale has no independent right to veto a reasonable settlement decision made by the primary insurer.\" SJ Order at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Diamond Heights Homeowners Ass'n v.

None of the evidence cited by Scottsdale affirmatively mandates that the Hettrick Malpractice Action be treated as a claim falling within the policy period for the prior year's insurance policy; Underwriters avoided any legal dispute over that fact by paying the Primary Policy limits, rather than the prior year's policy limits, to satisfy the SFA Settlement Agreement. Thus, regardless of whether Underwriters knew at the time of the SFA Settlement Agreement that Hettrick may have received actual notice of the Hettrick Malpractice Action prior to the inception of the policy period for the Primary Policy, Underwriters' decision to pay the SFA Settlement Agreement out of the Primary Policy was a settlement decision which neither Scottsdale, nor the Court, can upset in this action for declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Analyzing Scottsdale's argument in this light, it is clear that Scottsdale is attempting to litigate around the provision in the First Excess Policy that triggers the First Excess Policy when the Primary Policy insurers \"have paid or have admitted liability or have been held liable to pay, the full amount of their indemnity inclusive of costs and expenses.\" Dkt. 80-2 at 5. As the Court explicitly held in the SJ Order, this clause requires only that Underwriters actually paid the full $15 million policy limit of the Primary Policy for the First Excess Policy to become operable. SJ Order at 23. Because Underwriters paid the limit of the Primary Policy to satisfy a portion of the SFA Settlement Agreement, and because Scottsdale cannot upset a reasonable settlement decision made by Underwriters in their capacity as subscribers to the Primary Policy, nothing more is required for the Court to conclude that the First Excess Policy attaches as the operative insurance policy moving forward. Scottsdale's argument about the policy period does not affect such a ruling whatsoever, because Underwriters still made the decision to pay the limit of the Primary Policy, a decision which Scottsdale cannot challenge in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Allocation of the SFA Settlement Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Second, Scottsdale argues that the Court should reconsider its ruling on the allocation of the SFA Settlement Agreement, in that the Court should have found that none of the money paid by Underwriters pursuant to the SFA Settlement Agreement could be applied to the Primary Policy in light of the collusive nature of Underwriters' internal allocation negotiations. Again, this argument constitutes a rehashing of arguments previously considered and rejected in the SJ Order, and Scottsdale has not identified a legitimate ground for reconsideration of the Court's conclusion about allocation under the applicable rules above. Although Scottsdale argues that the Court \"significantly misunderstood\" what Scottsdale was arguing, Dkt. 206 at 9, that is simply not true; the Court fully understood that Scottsdale sought a ruling that the entire amount of the SFA settlement should be allocated to Underwriters' extra-contractual liability, but the Court found such a holding to be inappropriate given that Scottsdale could not upset the reasonable settlement decision made by the Primary Policy subscribers to exhaust the Primary Policy. Ultimately, Scottsdale simply disagrees with the Court's application of law, and therefore Scottsdale's request for reconsideration of this issue is procedurally improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   To address the substance of Scottsdale's argument, the deficiency in Scottsdale's position is that Scottsdale seeks a holding that the allocation of the SFA Settlement Agreement was collusive across\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the primary and excess layers of insurance coverage. To repeat yet again, Scottsdale has no basis in this action to challenge a reasonable settlement decision by the subscribers to the Primary Policy to allocate a portion of the SFA Settlement Agreement to exhaust the Primary Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJ Order at 21 (\"[A]s the excess insurer, Scottsdale has no independent right to veto a reasonable settlement decision made by the primary insurer.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Diamond Heights\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2332556\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-3d/227/563/#p580\">\n    227 Cal.

But even if Scottsdale had participated in the negotiations, Scottsdale still would have had no power to affect Underwriters' decision to allocate a portion of the SFA Settlement Agreement to the Primary Policy. Thus, the allocation that is \"most advantageous\" to Scottsdale, the non-settling party, could only be one that does not require Scottsdale to make a contribution at its own level of subscription under the First Excess Policy and cannot be one that upsets the reasonable settlement decision of the subscribers under the Primary Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc. v.

The practical purpose of Scottsdale bringing this action was to resolve a coverage dispute in New York, and New York certainly has an interest in protecting the rights of its insureds when hailed into court in a foreign jurisdiction to resolve a New York-based coverage dispute.

California also has an interest in applying its doctrine on attorneys' fees to protect Scottsdale from paying attorneys' fees for ordinary coverage litigation occurring within its borders, which additionally required determinations as to the legal significance of events that occurred in California, in the absence of any bad faith.

Thus, where an insured must defend itself against its own insurer in any litigation pertaining to the insurer's duty to defend under the insurance policy, New York courts treat that defense as inuring to the insurer's duty to defend the same as any other claim covered under a policy, thereby making an award of attorneys' fees to the successful insured an appropriate measure of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   On the other hand, California's rule allows an award of attorneys' fees to a successful insured only if the \"insurer's tortious conduct reasonably compels the insured to retain an attorney to obtain the benefits due under a policy,\" because in that sense the insured's attorneys' fees are considered \"an economic loss - damages - proximately caused by the tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Brandt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949111\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/37/813/#p819\">\n    37 Cal. 3d at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20211\">\n    210 Cal.Rptr. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=693%20P.2d%20796\">\n    693 P.2d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Thus, rather than treating the insured's attorneys' fees incurred in defending a coverage dispute as a theoretical \"defense cost\" properly allocable to the insurer, California instead more broadly upholds the default rule that each party is to bear its own attorneys' fees, unless those fees were the result of the insurer's bad faith conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Both California and New York allow for exceptions to the rule against awarding attorneys in specific situations meant to protect an innocent insured from actions taken by its insurer to refuse coverage. Thus, the purpose and rationale behind both bodies of law suggest that the collective\n   states' interests would be more impaired if Dickstein, the insured, is not permitted to recover attorneys' fees in this action. If California law were to be applied here, a New York insured would not be getting a bargained-for benefit under its insurance contract with its insurer. Thus, applying California law here would more greatly impair New York's interests in protecting its insureds in these scenarios, whereas applying New York law would merely carve out an additional exception to California's rule against attorneys' fees and would not as significantly impair California's interests in generally requiring parties to bear their own fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Furthermore, the relative contacts to California and New York in this action additionally favor a finding that New York's interests would be more significantly impaired by the application of California law compared to the other way around. While much of the specific events Scottsdale challenges in this action occurred in California, as noted above, the practical purpose of Scottsdale's lawsuit was to establish Scottsdale's obligation to represent Dickstein in the Muhs Action pending in New York. Dickstein was not a party to the Hettrick Malpractice Action or the SFA Action, and Dickstein was not a part of the settlement negotiations and allocation which the Court found to be collusive. The only reason Dickstein is a party to this lawsuit is its status as the insured in the Muhs Action, so New York has a greater interest in upholding Dickstein's rights as an insured under New York law than California does. Indeed, California's interests, when applied specifically to Dickstein's motion for attorneys' fees, are minimal compared to California's interests in applying its substantive insurance law to Scottsdale's causes of action for declaratory relief. These conclusions are true regardless of where the insurance policy between Scottsdale and Dickstein \"locates\" the subject matter and/or the insured risk of the contract, since Dickstein maintained offices throughout the United States and was afforded coverage against legal malpractice claims in all jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   In summary, New York's interests would be comparatively more impaired by the application of California law to Dickstein's motion for attorneys' fees than California's interests would be impaired by the application of New York law. Accordingly, per the governmental interest analysis, the Court applies New York law to Dickstein's fee request. And, as noted above, because Dickstein was cast into a defensive posture in Scottsdale's lawsuit for declaratory relief and was deemed the prevailing party, Dickstein is entitled to attorneys' fees under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Underwriters Ins.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456554\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/592/#p597\">\n    3 N.Y.3d at 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456554\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/592/#p597\">\n    789 N.Y.S.2d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"456554\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/3/592/#p597\">\n    822 N.E.2d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"under\n   <em>\n    Mighty Midgets\n   </em>\n   , an insured who prevails in an action brought by an insurance company seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify the insured may recover attorneys' fees regardless of whether the insurer provided a defense to the insured\");\n   <em>\n    Hervochon v.

Therefore, the Court construes Scottsdale's opposition as conceding to the reasonableness of the amount of attorneys' fees and expenses Dickstein seeks to recover. In any event, the Court's review of Dickstein's attached evidentiary support, see Dkts. 187-3-187-6, also does not indicate that any portion of Dickstein's fees is unreasonable.

In the SFA Settlement Agreement, SFA as the assignee of all of Hettrick's claims against Underwriters released all such claims, including the claims for bad faith denial of defense coverage to Hettrick. Thus, Hettrick and Hettrick's assignee no longer maintain any existing, assignable causes of action for insurance bad faith against Underwriters. Scottsdale's only avenue for equitable subrogation would be through Dickstein for Underwriters' bad faith in allocating the SFA Action, but it is unclear whether and to what extent Scottsdale may be able to do so, particularly in light of the fact that Dickstein apparently has not objected to the settlement allocation reached by Underwriters. Dickstein, for its part, has taken the position in this litigation that it reserves all contractual rights under its malpractice insurance policies as to any claim or defense that could be asserted by Dickstein, Dkt. 104 at 11-12, allowing for the possibility that Scottsdale could maintain an equitable subrogation claim via Dickstein against Underwriters in some respect. In any event, Scottsdale admits that it is not attempting in this litigation to assert a claim against Underwriters based on a theory of equitable subrogation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 138 at 17 (Scottsdale stating in opposition to Underwriters' motion for summary judgment that \"[n]or is Scottsdale asserting an equitable subrogation claim\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy state that disputes concerning the interpretation of the policy are governed by the laws of the District of Columbia.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 80-1 at 1; Dkt. 80-2 at 2. However, throughout the briefing in this case, all parties cite to California law in arguing the interpretation of the policy language under the insurance policies and in addressing the legal significance of the SFA Settlement Agreement.

Scottsdale's acknowledgement that it is not seeking to bring a bad faith claim against Underwriters via equitable subrogation means that the question of whether and to what extent Underwriters actually acted in bad faith in denying defense coverage to Hettrick, or whether Underwriters acted in bad faith by allocating the settlement sum of the SFA Action to exhaust Dickstein's coverage under the Primary Policy, is not at issue in this litigation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    Scottsdale's argument that it does not share the same level of obligation as Underwriters misapplies the theory of equitable contribution.

Dickstein's invocation of a choice of law issue is wholly independent from any of the legal issues resolved at summary judgment as part of Scottsdale's claims for declaratory relief and Underwriters' claim against Scottsdale for equitable contribution.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    Courts also apply a third test when a contractual agreement contains a choice of law provision, in which the court applies the parties' chosen law if \"the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction\" or if \"there is any other reasonable basis for the parties' choice of law.\"\n    <em>\n     Nedlloyd Lines B.V. v. Superior Court\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2008201\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/3/459/#p466\">\n     3 Cal. 4th 459\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 466,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20330\">\n     11 Cal.Rptr.2d 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=834%20P.2d%201148\">\n     834 P.2d 1148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1992) (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 187(2) ). As the Court noted in the SJ Order, both the Primary Policy and the First Excess Policy contain a choice-of-law provision applying District of Columbia law to questions of policy interpretation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 80-1 at 1 (\"Any dispute concerning the interpretation of this [Primary] Policy shall be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia.\"); Dkt. 80-2 at 2 (same). Dickstein's fee request does not depend on an interpretation of either insurance policy, and in any event neither Dickstein nor Scottsdale seeks to invoke District of Columbia law as applicable to Dickstein's fee request. Therefore, the Court will not consider whether District of Columbia law should be applied here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
