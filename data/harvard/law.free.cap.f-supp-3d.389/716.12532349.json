BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff brought this action against Defendants on August 16, 2018, seeking judicial review of the final decision by the Medicare Appeals Council (\"MAC\") denying Plaintiff coverage for the drug Serostim. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiff is a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in the Part D prescription drug plan, administered by Envision in 2016 and Blue Shield in 2017. Dkt. No. 19 (\"FAC\") \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11, 23. In early 2016, Plaintiff was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, an auto-immune disease, and wasting syndrome.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. To treat his conditions, his primary care physician prescribed the drug Serostim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Both Envision and Blue Shield denied coverage for Serostim in 2016 and 2017, respectively, because Serostim was not prescribed to Plaintiff for a use approved by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") or supported by a Medicare-approved drug compendium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff appealed both Envision and Blue Shield's denials of coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-21, 25-30. The appeals went through timely reconsideration requests with the Independent Review Entity and hearings in front of Administrative Law Judges (\"ALJs\") Myles and Gulin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both ALJs denied coverage, and Plaintiff appealed those decisions to the MAC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-21, 27-30. The MAC related and consolidated both appeals and issued a final decision on July 12, 2018, denying coverage of Serostim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff now brings this action against his insurers, Blue Shield and Envision, and DHHS, to \"appeal a final decision of the DHHS that denied coverage for Serostim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. In the FAC, Plaintiff alleges the following four claims against Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) \"Defendants' decisions denying Plaintiff's claim for Medicare coverage of Serostim is [sic] not supported by substantial evidence and is [sic] incorrect as a matter of law,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35; (2) Defendants violated Plaintiff's due process rights \"by refusing to provide coverage,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-41; (3) Defendants, \"[b]y providing coverage for Serostim only to individuals who have HIV,\" denied Plaintiff benefits in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-51; and (4) Defendants Envision and Blue Shield, in refusing to provide coverage, discriminated against Plaintiff due to \"his HIV-negative status,\" in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff requests that the Court reverse the decision of the agency and award Plaintiff benefits, along with any out-of-pocket costs and attorneys' fees and expenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Prayer for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTIONS TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants Envision and Blue Shield move to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Dkt. Nos. 36, 40. Specifically, Envision and Blue Shield assert that they are not the proper defendants in this action, and even if they are, Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   DHHS moves to dismiss Plaintiff's second and third causes of action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), and, alternatively, for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).

Nonetheless, Plaintiff, in a statement to the court on February 6, 2019, affirmed that he still sought inclusion of the AHFS-DI compendium for Serostim. Dkt. No. 65. He also alleged that DHHS is compelled to provide two additional documents that were not identified before the Court in Plaintiff's initial motion: (1) the AHFS-DI compendium for \"somatotropin,\" which Plaintiff posits is the generic compound of Serostim, and (2) the introductory portions of the AHFS-DI compendium.

These conclusory pronouncements come nowhere close to showing \"clear evidence\" that any of the documents should be in the AR. The record reflects that the agency considered DRUGDEX, another Medicare-approved compendium, to determine what the non FDA-approved (or \"off-label\") use for Serostim is. AR at 0055, 0726. Plaintiff does not dispute that DRUGDEX is in the administrative record. Dkt. No. 70 at 5 n.3. The ALJs, in their opinions, also stated that the AHFS-DI compendium did not include any additional off-label uses for Serostim. AR at 0055, 0726. The record does not reflect any reference to \"somatotropin,\" and Plaintiff presents no evidence that the agency relied on information about this drug. Plaintiff does not present any evidence, let alone \"clear evidence,\" that the agency considered any of the materials whose inclusion he seeks to compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because Plaintiff fails to rebut with clear evidence the presumption that the administrative record is complete, or present any evidence that the documents fall under one of the exceptions allowing the Court to consider extra-record evidence, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's second motion to supplement the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
