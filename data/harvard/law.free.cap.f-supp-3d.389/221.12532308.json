Nov. 26, 2018). As set forth in that opinion, Lead Plaintiff the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (hereinafter referred to as the \"Plaintiff\") alleges that Defendants committed securities fraud in two distinct forms: by misrepresenting (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) the health of Signet's credit portfolio and (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ii\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) the company's alleged \"pervasive\" culture of sexual harassment. (Fifth Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") \u00b6 300, dated Mar. 22, 2018, Dkt. No. 111.) Defendants' present motion implicates the second category of fraudulent misstatements. Thus, the Court will re-summarize Plaintiff's allegations, but only as to that second category, for purposes of addressing the instant motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Signet's Corporate Culture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 18, 2008, a class of current and former female Signet employees filed a putative class action in this District, alleging that employees of a wholly owned subsidiary of Signet, Sterling Jewelers, Inc. (\"Sterling\"), were subjected to gender discrimination through improper promotion and compensation practices, in violation of Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jock et al. v. Sterling Jewelers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08 Civ. 2875 (S.D.N.Y.) (Rakoff,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ). Pursuant to an arbitration provision in Sterling's employment agreement, the matter was referred to a confidential arbitration (hereinafter referred to as \"\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   \" or the \"\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   Litigation\"). (FAC \u00b6 179.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Signet first disclosed the\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   Litigation in a Form 6-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 20, 2008, stating that the lawsuit \"is based on the allegations of 15 former and current employees working in a few stores.... When these allegations first surfaced, they were investigated. That investigation failed to substantiate the allegations.\" Signet Jewelers Ltd., Special Report of Foreign Issuer (Form 6-K) (Mar. 20, 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the United States Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (\"EEOC\") filed a lawsuit against Sterling on substantially the same basis (FAC \u00b6 180), Signet filed another Form 6-K, supplementing its previous public disclosure to include a statement that, \"The US Equal Opportunities [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Commission has filed a separate lawsuit alleging that US store-level employment practices are discriminatory as to compensation and promotional activities[,]\" Signet Jewelers Ltd., Special Report of Foreign Issuer (Form 6-K), Note 9 (Mar. 25, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After a request from the SEC to supplement its disclosures with a \"brief[ ] descri[ption of] the factual basis alleged to underlie the class action proceedings\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 189), Signet disclosed that\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   was a suit \"by private plaintiffs alleging that US store-level employment practices are discriminatory as to compensation and promotional activities[,]\" Signet Jewelers Ltd., Annual Report (Form 10-K), at 119 (Mar. 30, 2011). This characterization of the\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   Litigation appears in Signet's SEC filings up to the end of the Class Period.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Signet Jewelers Ltd., Annual Report (Form 10-K), at 122 (Mar. 16, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As part of the\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   Litigation, the claimants filed for class certification, in which the briefing on that issue included approximately 250 declarations from nearly 200 employees detailing their experiences at Sterling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 181, 275.) Because the arbitration proceedings were confidential, those declarations were not initially made public; instead, counsel for the plaintiffs in that case posted on its website a version of its class certification brief with Signet-approved redactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182.) The redacted brief contained limited information from the declarations and, according to Plaintiff,\n   \"obscured\" the nature of the allegations contained therein. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 26, 2013, Signet disclosed that, \"In mid-October 2013, Sterling filed its opposition to Claimants' class certification motion, its disclosure of its experts and their reports, as well as three motions to exclude the reports of Claimants' experts and a motion to strike Claimants' declarations and attorney summaries.\" Signet Jewelers Ltd., Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) Item 1, Note 13 (Nov. 26, 2013). It did not elaborate on the content of the allegations of contained in those moving papers - including those that were contained in the declarations from Signet's employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206167889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The declarations were publicly disclosed on February 26, 2017 - albeit still with certain \"company-approved redactions.\" They contain various allegations that sexual harassment, rather than being confined to \"store-level employees,\" was rampant at Signet at all levels, including among senior executives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 204-205.) Among other allegations, the declarations alleged that the ranks of Signet's executives were filled with \"womanizers,\" \"playboy[s],\" and serial sexual harassers who made \"sexual conquests of female associates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 206-216.) Sexual harassment allegedly occurred in the ordinary course of business and at the company's annual \"Managers' Meetings,\" which were described as \"sexcapades\" where male executives \"sexually prey[ed]\" on female subordinates and engaged in \"sexually promiscuous activity\" with \"subordinate female managers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 216, 209-16, 218-31, 233-40, 242-52, 255, 257-68, 279, 287, 291-92.) Declarants also alleged that female employees were propositioned to engage in sexual behavior in exchange for employment advancement opportunities; those who accepted were rewarded by way of promotion, and those who declined or reported the activity to an anonymous hotline were retaliated against. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 242-68, 280-82, 284, 292.) Specific allegations of sexual misconduct were even leveled against Signet's then-CEO, Mark Tight, who is a Defendant in this action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 226-27, 279.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The day after the declarations were made public, the Washington Post wrote an article detailing their contents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Drew Harwell,\n   <em>\n    Hundreds Allege Sexual Harassment, Discrimination at Kay and Jared Jewelry Company\n   </em>\n   , Wash.

(FAC \u00b6 281.) Signet then issued a press release in which it characterized \"media reports\" as presenting a \"distorted and inaccurate picture of our company,\" and amplifying the voices of \"a very small number of individuals in a workforce of more than 84,000.\" Signet Jewelers Ltd.,\n   <em>\n    Sterling Jewelers Statement on Ongoing Arbitration\n   </em>\n   (Feb. 28, 2017), https://www.signetjewelers.com/investors/news-releases/news-release-details/2017/Sterling-Jewelers-Statement-on-Ongoing-Arbitration/default.aspx. By close of business that day, Signet's stock had fallen 13%. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 280-82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 17, 2017, Signet issued a press release announcing that Light was retiring.

Allegations of Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed the FAC, the operative complaint in this action, alleging that Defendants were liable for violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder (Count I), as well as Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act (Count II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Among other things, the FAC alleges that the emergence of the\n   <em>\n    Jock\n   </em>\n   declarations rendered false and misleading Defendants' public statements about Signet's corporate culture and commitment to preventing gender discrimination, because the declarations demonstrate that Signet had a \"pervasive culture of sexual harassment.\" (FAC \u00b6 300.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In support of this allegation, Plaintiff points to statements contained in Signet's Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics (collectively, the \"Code\"), both of which were re-adopted each year by Signet's board of directors, published on Signet's website (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 199), and incorporated by reference into Signet's SEC filings,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Signet Jewelers Ltd., Annual Report (Form 10-K), Item 10 (Mar. 27, 2014); Signet Jewelers Ltd. Annual Report (Form 10-K), Item 10 (Mar. 26, 2015). The Code of Conduct explained that Signet (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     i\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) made employment decisions \"solely\" on the basis of merit (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 330); (\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     ii\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   ) was \"committed to a workplace that is free from sexual, racial, or other unlawful harassment\" and does not tolerate \"[a]busive, harassing, or other offensive conduct ... whether verbal, physical, or visual\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 332); has \"[c]onfidential and anonymous mechanisms for reporting concerns\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 334); disciplines \"[t]hose who violate the standards in this Code\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and requires its senior officials to \"[e]ngage in and promote honest and ethical conduct\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 336).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In its Form 20-F, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2009, Signet represented that adherence to the Codes, including by senior executives, was of \"vital importance:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In adopting both the Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct, the Company has recognized the vital importance to the Company of conducting its business subject to high ethical standards and in full compliance with all applicable laws and, even where not required by law, with integrity and honesty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Signet Jewelers Ltd., Annual Report for Foreign Private Issuer (Form 20-F) Item 16.B (Apr. 1, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Court's Decision Denying Defendants' Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 26, 2018, the Court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the FAC. (Dkt. No. 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As relevant here, the Court rejected Defendants' contention that the representations contained in Signet's Code concerning their policies and procedures against sexual harassment constituted inactionable puffery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.) The Court recited the well-established law governing the materiality/puffery analysis, including the law set forth in the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Tr. of Chicago v. JP Morgan Chase Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717182\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/553/187/#p197\">\n    553 F.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 197, 206 (2d Cir. 2009). (Dkt. No. 120 at 34-35, 22.) Based upon these principles, the Court distinguished immaterial statements from those that could be actionable under the securities laws. Relying upon\n   <em>\n    In re Moody's Corp. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3366808\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/599/493/#p508\">\n    599 F.

Supp. 2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2009), the Court explained, \"While generalized, open-ended or aspirational statements do not give rise\n   to securities fraud (as mere puffery), statements contained in a code of conduct are actionable where they are directly at odds with the conduct alleged in a complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Analogizing the present case to\n   <em>\n    Moody's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3366808\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/599/493/#p508\">\n    599 F. Supp. 2d at 508-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court concluded that Signet's Code statements - in which it touted how the company makes decisions solely based on merit, disciplines misconduct, and provides a safe and anonymous means for employees to report misconduct without a risk of retaliation - \"are directly contravened by allegations in the FAC that the company conditioned employment decisions on whether female employees acceded to sexual demands and retaliated against women who attempted to anonymously report sexual harassment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35 (internal citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court did, however, conclude that certain other alleged misstatements identified by Plaintiff were too generalized and aspirational to be actionable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) Specifically, the Court dismissed Signet's Code statements touting the importance of Signet's relationship with its employees and consumer trust in the Signet brand (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 326, 328), because those were \"the sort of broad, aspirational, and vague puffery statements that no reasonable investor could possibly consider significant in making investment decisions.\" (Dkt.

Of the three groups of statements that were allegedly false and misleading, the plaintiffs asserted that certain representations contained in a company \"pamphlet,\" titled \"Code of Ethics and Principles of Conduct,\" falsely touted the company's commitment to \"compliance and integrity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520446\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/57/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520446\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/918/57/\">\n    at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In so arguing, they claim that any puffery analysis must be limited to looking at the \"nature of the [offending] statements themselves\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1), without considering whether the \"conduct at the company ... contravene[s]\" the company's other public disclosures (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).

Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125360\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/462/#p476\">\n    430 U.S. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 476,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125360\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/462/#p476\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125360\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/462/#p476\">\n    51 L.Ed.2d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Notwithstanding Defendants' suggestion to the contrary (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. at 6), that is not what Plaintiff has done in this case. The crux of Plaintiff's securities fraud claim is as such:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the face of a credible accusation (by way of another lawsuit) that Signet suffered from rampant sexual harassment - including, but not limited to, conditioning subordinate female employees' promotions to their acceding to the sexual demands of their male supervisors (even those who held the highest positions in the company), and retaliating against those who reported this misconduct (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 242-68, 280-82, 284, 292) - Defendants sought to reassure the investing public that Signet did not, in fact, have a toxic workplace (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 177-194). They did so by including representations in their periodic SEC filings that the company expressly \"denies the allegations\" in\n   <em>\n    Jock.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 324, 350, 371, 387, 401.) They did so by pointing to their corporate policies (which were incorporated in Signet's securities filings) affirming the company's commitment to making hiring decisions solely on the basis of merit, disciplining misconduct in its ranks, and providing employees with a means to report sexual harassment without fear of reprisal. And they did so by emphasizing that Signet's senior executives held themselves to the highest standards of all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As alleged, a reasonable investor - who otherwise would be concerned about how grave allegations concerning rampant sexual misconduct might affect her investment in Signet - took Defendants at their word.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As alleged, their word was not truthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Defendants' motion is denied. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close Dkt No. 149.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This constitutes the decision and order of the Court.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
