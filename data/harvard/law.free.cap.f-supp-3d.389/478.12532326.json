Furthermore, while in\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   prior determinations in the same area were relevant to its analysis, the court did not establish a strict rule as Total proposes, and more recent cases have simply looked at prior determinations of nearby blocks.

Apr. 21, 2006) (also applying Alabama law as adjacent state law to MP 261).\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   CEPS itself runs through several areas including the Main Pass, Viosca Knoll, DeSoto Canyon, and Mississippi Canyon. Blocks in the Main Pass and Viosca Knoll areas have been found to be adjacent to Alabama using the \u00a7 1333 analysis. Blocks that are both east and west of CEPS have been determined to be adjacent to Alabama. To find that some blocks east and west of CEPS are adjacent to Alabama, but the blocks in between are adjacent to Louisiana, as Total contends, would make little sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Regarding the blocks Total claims have previously been determined to be adjacent to Louisiana, they are all significantly farther west and south of CEPS than the blocks MOGUS relies on to support the application of Alabama law. For example, Total relies on the following blocks: MC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   243 is 18 blocks west of MC 261, which CEPS traverses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   MC 711 is 33 blocks west and nine blocks south of MC 348. MC 754 is 34 blocks west and ten blocks south of MC 348. MC 755 is 33 blocks west and ten blocks south of MC 348. MC 809 is 23 blocks west and 11 blocks south of MC 348. MC 773 is 15 blocks west and ten blocks south of MC 348.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The blocks MOGUS claims have previously been determined to be adjacent to Alabama are significantly closer to the Assets at issue. For example, MP 261 is the northernmost and westernmost block that the CEPS traverses. VK 956 is one block south and one block west of VK 913, and two blocks west of VK 958, both of which CEPS traverses. VK 823 is one block west of VK 824, which CEPS traverses. VK 915 is one block east of VK 914, which CEPS traverses. VK 786 is five blocks east of VK 781, which CEPS traverses. Because these blocks are all significantly closer to the Assets and some are directly east and west of CEPS, this factor weighs in favor of finding Alabama is the adjacent state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    D.
