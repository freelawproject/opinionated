Guy, appeals the final decree in his divorce from the petitioner, Joni Guy, which a Marital Master <em>{Forrest, </em>M.) recommended and the Superior Court <em>{Groff, </em>J.) approved. The respondent argues that the trial court erred when it granted the petitioner a fault-based divorce. The petitioner filed a cross-appeal, asserting that the trial court erred with respect to the division of a particular marital asset. We reverse in part, vacate in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The record supports the following facts. The parties married in March 1987. The petitioner filed for divorce in March 2006, seeking a divorce on the grounds of conduct endangering her health and reason, adultery, and habitual drunkenness. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7, II, V, VII (2004). Alternatively, she sought a divorce on the ground of irreconciliable differences. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7-a (Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The trial court heard the matter in December 2007. The court dismissed the grounds of habitual drunkenness and adultery, <em>see </em>RSA 458:7, II, VII, but granted the petitioner a divorce on the ground that the respondent had \u201cso treated [her] as seriously to injure [her] health or endanger [her] reason.\u201d RSA 458:7, V. With respect to the parties\u2019 property settlement, the court determined that an equal division of their assets was equitable. The court specifically considered two factors that might favor an unequal division: (1) the respondent\u2019s fault in causing the breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage; and (2) the value of his inheritance. Because these two factors \u201ceffectively cancelled] each other out,\u201d the court concluded that dividing the parties\u2019 assets equally was equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">We first address the respondent\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by granting the petitioner a divorce on the ground of conduct that seriously injured her health or endangered her reason. RSA 458:7 provides, in pertinent part, that the trial court shall grant a divorce \u201cin favor of the innocent party... [w]hen either party has so treated the other as seriously to injure health or endanger reason.\u201d RSA 458:7, V. This provision was first enacted in 1840. <em>See </em>Laws 1840, 573:1; <em>see also Robinson v. Robinson, </em>66 N.H. 600, 609 (1891). \u201cIt was intended to provide for a divorce... where the conduct complained of did not fall within the established definition of extreme cruelty.\u201d <em>Robinson, </em>66 N.H. at 609. Divorce upon the ground of extreme cruelty required proof of actual or threatened direct bodily injury; \u201c[t]he infliction of mere mental pain, however seriously it might injure health or endanger reason, was not legal cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608. The sufferer of such conduct had no remedy at law. <em>Id. </em>at 608-09. While \u201c[c]onstant, innumerable, and nameless indignities of speech and action, each possibly petty in itself, might cause mental anguish less endurable, more hurtful to physical well-being, and more likely to overturn reason, than any degree of pain produced by blows,\u201d and while this conduct \u201cmight make life intolerable and death welcome, ... [it was] not legal cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609. \u201cIn consideration of this state of the law,\u201d in 1840, the legislature enacted the predecessor to RSA 458:7, V. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The language of the current statute is nearly identical to that which was first enacted in 1840. Laws 1840,573:1. In 1867, the language was amended slightly to clarify that the adverb \u201cseriously\u201d was intended to modify both \u201cinjure health\u201d and \u201cendanger reason.\u201d The 1867 version of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>allowed a divorce to be decreed: \u201cV. When either party has so treated the other as seriously to injure health. VI. When either party has so treated the other as seriously to endanger reason.\u201d GS 163:3 (1867). Sections V and VI of the 1867 version of the law were later merged. <em>See </em>PL 287:6 (1926). They have remained so ever since. <em>See </em>RL 339:6 (1942); RSA 458:7 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The gravamen of a cause of action for divorce on this ground \u201cis the injury to health and the danger to reason\u201d suffered by the innocent spouse. <em>Robinson, </em>66 N.H. at 609. \u2018Whether the behavior proved is a sufficient ground of divorce depends on... whether it has seriously injured health or endangered reason. This is the sole test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u201cAny behavior of one party which affects the other physically or mentally is treatment within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It does not matter whether the conduct was directed towards the innocent spouse or whether the guilty spouse engaged in the conduct with malevolent intent. <em>Id. </em>at 609-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">While the statute does not require proof of conduct that would have affected an average or reasonable person, it does require proof that the health or reason of the complaining spouse was <em>actually </em>affected. <em>In the Matter of Gronvaldt &amp; Gronvaldt, </em>150 N.H. 551, 553 (2004). Whether the innocent party has been so treated is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. <em>Id. </em>We will sustain its findings and rulings unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">In its narrative order, the trial court found that the following conduct seriously injured the petitioner\u2019s health or endangered her reason. In December 2005, the petitioner surreptitiously discovered the respondent\u2019s email password and accessed his e-mail account. She discovered that the respondent was exchanging e-mails with other women, including a former girlfriend. In their e-mails the respondent and his former girlfriend professed their love for one another, and, at times, their e-mails were sexually suggestive. When the petitioner discovered the e-mails, she felt \u201cangry, upset, and distraught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">This kind of effect upon the petitioner\u2019s physical and mental health is insufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain a divorce under RSA 458:7, V. In cases involving a divorce granted upon these grounds, the effect upon the \u201cinnocent\u201d spouse has been much more severe than mere anger and upset and the conduct in which the \u201cguilty\u201d spouse engaged was more brutal than merely e-mailing a former girlfriend. <em>See id. </em>at 553-54 (husband drank alcohol on a daily basis, was verbally abusive to wife, threatened to punch wife, exhibited uncontrolled anger and used scare tactics to intimidate wife, causing wife to suffer emotional distress and undergo counseling during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>parties\u2019 marriage); <em>Routhier v. Routhier, </em>128 N.H. 439, 440 (1986) (during marriage, husband admitted to having affairs with other women, drank excessively, and was domineering, argumentative and verbally abusive, which caused wife to seek counseling for two years in the 1960s and again after their separation in 1980); <em>Morgan v. Morgan, </em>101 N.H. 470, 471 (1958) (husband hit wife, threatened to kill her, and used obscene and abusive language towards her, causing wife to become \u201chighly nervous and to lose weight\u201d); <em>Szulc v. Szulc, </em>96 N.H. 190, 191 (1950) (husband drank heavily and used abusive and profane language, causing wife to lose considerable weight and to become \u201ca complete wreck\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We hold that the respondent\u2019s conduct was insufficient, as a matter of law, to constitute treatment that seriously injured the petitioner\u2019s health or endangered her reason. RSA 458:7, V. Feeling \u201cangry, upset and distraught\u201d does not constitute either a serious injury to one\u2019s health or a serious endangerment to one\u2019s reason within the meaning of the statute. The conduct at issue did not do any harm to the petitioner\u2019s physical well-being. Nor did it cause her to suffer the type of \u201cmental anguish\u201d that the statute was intended to encompass. <em>Robinson, </em>66 N.H. at 609. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the petitioner a fault-based divorce under RSA 458:7, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Because the trial court specifically considered the respondent\u2019s fault in causing the breakdown of the parties\u2019 marriage when dividing the parties\u2019 assets, we vacate the court\u2019s property division. In light of this vacatur, we need not address the petitioner\u2019s issue in her cross-appeal. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Reversed in part; vacated in part; remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
