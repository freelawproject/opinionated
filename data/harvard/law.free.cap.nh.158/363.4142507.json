(Hair Excitement), appeals from a judgment entered by the Superior Court <em>{Honran, </em>J.) rejecting its claim that the defendant violated the Consumer Protection Act, RSA chapter 358-A (1995 &amp; Supp. 2008). The defendant, L\u2019Oreal U.S.A., Inc., (L\u2019Oreal) cross-appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">The record supports the following facts. Hair Excitement is a New Hampshire corporation which owns and operates a number of hair salons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts. L\u2019Oreal manufactures and distributes hair care products, including Matrix and Redken brand products.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In 1993, Hair Excitement entered into purchase contracts with a Matrix distributor for the purchase of Matrix products, a line now owned by L\u2019Oreal, for its salons. The contracts provided that Hair Excitement would \u201cnot resell or redistribute Matrix retail products to anyone other than [its] legitimate salon clients for home maintenance use.\u201d Either party could terminate the contracts \u201cimmediately upon notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In 1997, Hair Excitement entered into a Redken Products Chain Account Agreement (chain account agreement) with Redken Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of L\u2019Oreal. Pursuant to this agreement, Hair Excitement was appointed \u201cas an authorized, non-exclusive Redken Chain Account for the Redken products.\u201d The products to be sold under the account were either products that Hair Excitement could only sell to consumers for their own use or products that its professionals applied on clients at its salons. The chain account agreement provided that Hair Excitement would \u201csell the products ... solely from Chain Account\u2019s salons to consumers for their own use, and that it [would] not sell, offer for sale or otherwise transfer such products to anyone other than consumers for their own use.\u201d As for products labeled \u201cFor Professional Use Only,\u201d the agreement provides that Hair Excitement would \u201cuse such products only in [its] salons.\u201d The agreement also provided that \u201c[e]ither party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving sixty (60) days prior written notice of such termination to the other party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">These provisions restricting the sale of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s products are intended to serve as protection against the sale of products outside of salons in the so-called \u201cgray market.\u201d The \u201cgray market\u201d is a market in which legal but perhaps unethical methods are used to avoid a manufacturer\u2019s distribution chain and thereby sell goods at prices lower than those envisioned by the manufacturer. As the trial court\u2019s order explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">The diversion of product, and in particular product designed and marketed for salon-only sales, is a very large problem in the beauty industry. Manufacturers are constantly battling this problem, which harms the business reputations of both the manufacturer and the salon owner, which creates a mistaken impression that the manufacturer permits or endorses the sale of salon-only products outside of a professional salon setting, and which is likely to cause confusion concerning the quality of salon-only products. Among the few tools available to manufacturers to battle diversion are tips from informants, coding of product to track the product\u2019s distribution routes, and buying programs, known at L\u2019Oreal as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u201cloyalty tests.\u201d Buying programs or loyalty tests involve the manufacturer sending in an investigator to pose as someone other than a consumer purchasing for the consumer\u2019s own use, and are generally used by a manufacturer to confirm whether a salon reported to be reselling in violation of contracts is in fact doing so. Both the problem and the tools used by manufacturers to combat it are well known and well understood by those involved in the industry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In December 2001, a distributor in Rhode Island informed Charles Domroe, L\u2019Oreal\u2019s director of corporate security, that it had learned from at least two sources that Hair Excitement was engaged in product diversion. As part of its subsequent investigation, L\u2019Oreal retained Paul Cosentino to pose as a \u201ccollector\u201d in order to conduct a \u201cloyalty test\u201d to determine whether Hair Excitement would make an unauthorized sale of L\u2019Oreal\u2019s products. In early January 2002, Cosentino, posing as Paul Kostanza, telephoned Hair Excitement\u2019s salon in Rochester seeking to purchase Redken and Matrix hair care products for resale. That same day he received a return call from John Langlois, the owner of Hair Excitement, and was directed to contact purchasing manager, Ed Sharon, to discuss the proposed sale. Langlois knew that Cosentino intended to resell the products. The next day Cosentino spoke by telephone with Sharon and confided that he planned to sell the Redken and Matrix products outside of the United States. Sharon agreed to sell the requested products but told Cosentino that he needed to \u201cbe careful because Hair Excitement, Inc. [was] a franchise\u201d and it \u201ccould run into problems with the manufacturer.\u201d The following day, Cosentino arrived at the Rochester salon and purchased 150 bottles of consumer-use only Redken and Matrix products at fifty percent of their retail value. Cosentino was told that Hair Excitement could supply whatever additional products he needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">By letter dated February 8, 2002, L\u2019Oreal informed Hair Excitement that due to its alleged product diversion and based upon other independent investigation, it was terminating the chain account agreement and would no longer sell it any Redken products. L\u2019Oreal also barred its distributors from further sales of any of its product brands, including Matrix products, to Hair Excitement.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Hair Excitement brought suit against L\u2019Oreal alleging that it had violated RSA chapter 358-A. It contended that L\u2019Oreal willfully and knowingly misrepresented the identity of its agent and also misrepresented the agent\u2019s intent with the purpose to deceive and induce it to sell the products to third parties in violation of its purchase contracts and chain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>account agreement, resulting in its termination as an approved franchise. L\u2019Oreal brought a counterclaim alleging that Hair Excitement violated RSA chapter 358-A because its distribution of Redken products outside of the salon-only sales to consumers harmed Redken\u2019s business reputation with both salon owners and consumers, created a mistaken impression that L\u2019Oreal permits or endorses the sale of Redken products outside of a professional salon setting, and was likely to cause confusion concerning the quality of Redken products.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">The parties agreed to bifurcate the trial of liability and damages. Over Hair Excitement\u2019s objection, the case was tried to the court and not to a jury. Following a four-and-a-half-day trial, the trial court found in favor of L\u2019Oreal on Hair Excitement\u2019s claim and in favor of Hair Excitement on L\u2019Oreal\u2019s counterclaim. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Hair Excitement argues that the trial court erred in finding that: (1) it was not entitled to a jury trial; (2) L\u2019Oreal did not engage in unfair and deceptive acts under RSA chapter 358-A; (3) L\u2019Oreal\u2019s anti-diversion policy contained in the distributor contracts is a legitimate business practice; and (4) L\u2019Oreal did not engage in price fixing. L\u2019Oreal\u2019s cross-appeal raises four issues, including whether the trial court erred in ruling that: (1) the choice of law provision in the contract was inapplicable; (2) Hair Excitement\u2019s claims are not barred by the economic loss doctrine; (3) Hair Excitement\u2019s claims may not be limited by the terms of the contract; and (4) the doctrine of unclean hands does not bar Hair Excitement\u2019s claims. L\u2019Oreal does not appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of Hair Excitement on L\u2019Oreal\u2019s RSA chapter 358-A counterclaim. Accordingly, because we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling in favor of L\u2019Oreal on Hair Excitement\u2019s consumer protection claim, we need not address the issues raised by L\u2019Oreal\u2019s cross-appeal. For purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that RSA chapter 358-A applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Prior to trial, L\u2019Oreal moved to strike Hair Excitement\u2019s jury trial demand. The trial court granted the motion on the basis that \u201cthere is neither a constitutional nor statutory right to a jury trial on a claim brought under RSA 358-A:10.\u201d Noting that it \u201chas the discretion to seek the advice of a jury on such a claim,\u201d the court declined to exercise such discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Part I, Article 20 of the New Hampshire Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons except those in which another practice is and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>has been customary and except those in which the value in controversy does not exceed $1,500 and no title to real estate is involved, the parties have a right to a trial by jury. This method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in cases arising on the high seas and in cases relating to mariners\u2019 wages, the legislature shall think it necessary to alter it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The right to a jury trial under the New Hampshire Constitution \u201cis not without limitation; it extends only to those cases for which the jury trial right existed when the constitution was adopted in 1784.\u201d <em>State v. Morrill, </em>123 N.H. 707, 712 (1983); <em>see Hallahan v. Riley, </em>94 N.H. 338, 339 (1947) (constitutional guaranty of trial by jury in civil matters determined generally by historical test of its use at common law). Part I, Article 20 \u201cdid not create or establish a right [to a jury trial] not before existing. It was a recognition of an existing right, guaranteeing it as it then stood and was practiced, guarding it against repeal, infringement, or undue trammel by legislative action, but not extending it so as to include what had not before been within its benefits.\u201d <em>Davis v. Dyer, </em>62 N.H. 231, 235 (1882). \u201cThe right does not extend... to special, statutory or summary proceedings unknown to the common law.\u201d <em>In re Sandra H., </em>150 N.H. 634, 636 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u201cTo resolve whether a party has a right to trial by jury in a particular action, we generally look to both the nature of the case and the relief sought, and ascertain whether the customary practice included a trial by jury before 1784.\u201d <em>Franklin Lodge of Elks v. Marcoux, </em>149 N.H. 581, 591 (2003) (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cWhen a plaintiff seeks relief for breach of codified rights, we further consider the comprehensive nature of the statutory framework to determine whether the jury trial right extends to the action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The legislature enacted RSA chapter 358-A in 1970 to \u201censure an equitable relationship between consumers and persons engaged in business.\u201d <em>Hughes v. DiSalvo, </em>143 N.H. 576, 578 (1999). RSA chapter 358-A is \u201ca comprehensive statute designed to regulate business practices for consumer protection by making it unlawful for persons engaged in trade or commerce to use various methods of unfair competition and deceptive business practices.\u201d <em>Chase v. Dorais, </em>122 N.H. 600, 601 (1982). Thus, RSA chapter 358-A creates new statutory rights which did not exist in New Hampshire common law in 1784 when this state adopted its constitution. Because of this, our constitution does not confer the right to a jury trial for a claim under RSA chapter 358-A. <em>See Morrill, </em>123 N.H. at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Moreover, nothing in the language of RSA chapter 358-A specifically provides for a right to a jury trial. The statute states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">Any person injured by another\u2019s use of any method, act or practice declared unlawful under this chapter may bring an action for damages and for such equitable relief, including an injunction, as <em>the court </em>deems necessary and proper. If <em>the court </em>finds for the plaintiff, recovery shall be in the amount of actual damages or $1,000, whichever is greater. If <em>the court </em>finds that the use of the method of competition or the act or practice was a willful or knowing violation of this chapter, <em>it </em>shall award as much as 3 times, but not less than 2 times, such amount. In addition, a prevailing plaintiff shall be awarded the costs of the suit and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, as determined by <em>the court. . . . </em>Injunctive relief shall be available to private individuals under this chapter without bond, subject to the discretion of <em>the court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">RSA 358-A:10,1 (emphases added). We are the final arbiter of the meaning of a statute as expressed by the words of the statute itself. <em>Green Crow Corp. v. Town of New Ipswich, </em>157 N.H. 344, 346 (2008). We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute and will not examine legislative history unless the statutory language is ambiguous, consider what the legislature might have said, or add words not included in the statute. <em>Id. </em>In its ordinary meaning, the word \u201ccourt\u201d refers to a judge rather than a jury. Had the legislature intended to provide for a jury trial, it could have expressly done so. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 354-A:21-a, I (Supp. 2008) (in action for damages based upon unlawful discrimination \u201ceither party is entitled to a trial by jury on any issue of fact\u201d). Accordingly, under the plain language of the statute, the court is vested with the authority to decide claims brought under RSA chapter 358-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\"> Nonetheless, Hair Excitement argues that its claim is similar to a common law fraud or deceit claim. \u201cIn order to prove deceit, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant intentionally made material false statements to the plaintiff, which the defendant knew to be false or which he had no knowledge or belief were true, for the purpose of causing, and which does cause, the plaintiff reasonably to rely to his detriment.\u201d <em>Caledonia, Inc. v. Trainor, </em>123 N.H. 116, 124 (1983). Fraud must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, to prove a violation of RSA chapter 358-A, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant is a person, that the defendant used an unfair method of competition or a deceptive act or practice, that the act occurred in trade or commerce, and that the defendant\u2019s conduct rose to \u201ca level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>ACAS Acquisitions v. Hobert, </em>155 N.H. 381, 402 (2007); <em>see </em>RSA 358-A-.2. In addition, RSA chapter 358-A provides broader damages than a common law fraud action, allowing treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See </em>RSA 358-A:10, I. Thus, actions brought pursuant to RSA chapter 358-A require proof of significantly different elements and satisfaction of a different standard of proof. Accordingly, we decline to hold that RSA chapter 358-A is analogous to common law fraud or deceit.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that RSA chapter 358-A claims are not entitled to a trial by jury. Although Hair Excitement argues that many RSA chapter 358-A claims have been tried before juries, we note that the issue of whether a right to a jury trial existed was never raised or addressed in those cases. <em>See, e.g., Becksted v. Nadeau, </em>155 N.H. 615 (2007); <em>Transmedia Restaurant Co. v. Devereaux, </em>149 N.H. 454 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Hair Excitement next argues that the trial court erred in finding that L\u2019Oreal did not engage in unfair and deceptive acts under RSA chapter 358-A, asserting that many of its requests for findings of fact granted by the court support such a finding and that some of its requests denied by the court constitute error and are contrary to the evidence. When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision, we will \u201csustain [its] findings and rulings . . . unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Letendre &amp; Letendre, </em>149 N.H. 31, 34 (2002). \u201cAbsent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, we will not overturn its ruling or set aside its factual findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">RSA 358-A:2 states that it \u201cshall be unlawful for any person to use any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice in the conduct of any trade or commerce within this state.\u201d Unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices include \u201c[c]ausing likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding as to affiliation, connection or association with . . . another.\u201d RSA 358-A:2, III. Not all conduct in the course of trade or commerce falls within the scope of the statute. To recover under RSA chapter 358-A, a plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s acts attained \u201ca level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce.\u201d <em>Hobert, </em>155 N.H. at 402. \u201c[S]elfish bargaining and business dealings will not be enough to justify a claim for damages under the Consumer Protection Act.\u201d <em>Barrows v. Boles, </em>141 N.H. 382, 390 (1996) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Although the trial court found that Mr. Cosentino misrepresented both his identification and intent in approaching Hair Excitement, it also found that those misrepresentations did not constitute a violation of RSA chapter 358-A. As the trial court noted, \u201cGiven this state of the beauty supply industry, L\u2019Oreal did what is well understood in the industry and what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>made sense to do in this case: It charged an investigator with approaching Hair Excitement to find out if [it] would sell a quantity of Redken and Matrix product.\u201d The trial court ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">L\u2019Oreal\u2019s conduct was not immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous, did not offend public policy as established by law or by other established concepts of unfairness, was not the type proscribed by the Consumer Protection Act, and did not attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce. L\u2019Oreal was instead, in the context of a rough and tumble business, exercising its rights under the Hair Excitement agreements. Hair Excitement has fallen far short of its burden of proving that L\u2019Oreal engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of the Consumer Protection Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">There is sufficient evidence in the record to support these findings. The anti-diversion provisions in the contracts and chain account agreement entered into by the parties are included by L\u2019Oreal to protect its brand name, trade name, and other intellectual property rights for its salon-only products such as Redken and Matrix. Such contractual terms are common in the industry. Anti-diversion campaigns are prominently advertised in trade shows, training seminars and trade publications. The beauty supply industry enforces its anti-diversion policies by terminating its contractual relationships with distributors, chain accounts, or salons that are caught engaging in diversion. L\u2019Oreal publicizes the fact that it polices salons and distributors, has a zero-tolerance policy for diversion, and cancels contracts with salons and distributors that engage in diversion. Hair Excitement was aware of the practices of diversion, the gray market, and efforts by the industry to police and curtail it. We hold that the trial court\u2019s ruling that L\u2019Oreal did not engage in unfair and deceptive acts under RSA chapter 358-A is not an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The third issue raised by Hair Excitement is whether the trial court erred in finding that L\u2019Oreal\u2019s anti-diversion policy contained in its distributor contracts is a legitimate business practice. Hair Excitement\u2019s position is that the policy violates the \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine under which a trademark owner cannot control distribution of a trademarked item beyond its first sale. Section 106(3) of the Copyright Act of 1976, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 106(3) (2000), gives the owner of a copyright the exclusive right to distribute copies of a copyrighted work. \u201cAfter the first sale of a copyrighted item ..., any subsequent purchaser ... is ... an owner of that item.\u201d <em>Quality King Distributors, Inc. v. L\u2019anza Research Intl, Inc., </em>523 U.S. 135, 145 (1998) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(quotations omitted). Pursuant to federal law, \u201csuch an owner is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell that item.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The \u201cfirst sale\u201d doctrine is a defense to an infringement action under federal copyright law. Hair Excitement\u2019s cause of action was limited to a single theory of recovery: a violation of RSA chapter 358-A. We reject its \u201cfirst sale\u201d argument and hold that the doctrine has no application to this Consumer Protection Act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Finally, Hair Excitement argues that the trial court erred in finding that L\u2019Oreal did not engage in price fixing. Hair Excitement argues that the evidence \u201cin toto\u201d shows that L\u2019Oreal\u2019s conduct surrounding its termination of the chain account agreement supports that L\u2019Oreal engaged in \u201cprice fixing\u201d by preventing Hair Excitement from purchasing L\u2019Oreal\u2019s products and selling them at discount prices. As the trial court found, L\u2019Oreal did not need a pretext to terminate its contracts with Hair Excitement. The chain account agreement permitted unilateral termination without cause with sixty-day notice and the purchase contracts could be terminated by either party without cause or notice. Notwithstanding that the contracts could be terminated without cause, Hair Excitement in fact breached the express prohibitions against reselling Matrix products to anyone \u201cother than [its] legitimate salon clients for home maintenance use\u201d and against reselling Redken products to anyone \u201cother than consumers for their own use,\u201d thereby giving L\u2019Oreal cause to terminate them. We \u2018reasonably into selling affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that the evidence does not ' support\u201d a conclusion that L\u2019Oreal deceived Hair Excitement product with an underlying purpose of illegal price control.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-8\">Dalianis, Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
