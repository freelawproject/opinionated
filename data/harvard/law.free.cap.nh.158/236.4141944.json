Kleeman, M.D., appeals rulings of the Superior Court (Murphy, J.) made during a medical malpractice trial. The plaintiff, Joseph P. Goudreault, Jr., cross-appeals the apportionment of fault to non-litigants and the failure to impose joint and several liability upon Dr. Kleeman. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">The record supports the following. Goudreault developed a back problem in 2001. He consulted Dr. Kleeman, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in spine surgery, who initially recommended conservative therapies. These were unsuccessful and diagnostic testing revealed degeneration in the discs and cartilage of Goudreault\u2019s lower back. Dr. Kleeman recommended a procedure called an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF). The ALIF procedure uses a bone graft to prevent inflammation by immobilizing the affected discs. The procedure is performed laparascopically to minimize its invasiveness, typically by a vascular surgeon teamed with a spine surgeon.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">Goudreault\u2019s ALIF was performed at Catholic Medical Center (CMC) in April 2002 by Dr. Kleeman and vascular surgeons Dmitry Nepomnayshy and Patrick Mahon. The operation began at 7:00 a.m., initially with Drs. Kleeman and Nepomnayshy. Although there were no complications with the spinal fusion part of the surgery, complications arose with respect to accessing Goudreault\u2019s spine. Vascular injuries occurred causing substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tial bleeding and requiring conversion from a laparascopic, minimally invasive approach to a more intrusive open approach. Dr. Kleeman testified that he could not say for sure whether he or Dr. Nepomnayshy caused the vascular injuries. After the vascular injuries arose, Dr. Kleeman left the surgery table and Dr. Mahon assisted Dr. Nepomnayshy. Dr. Kleeman returned to complete the ALIF after the vascular injuries were repaired and the bleeding was controlled. The surgery concluded around 4:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Following the surgery, Goudreault was taken to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) at CMC, where he was monitored and given intravenous fluid. The PACU nurse eventually transferred him to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and contacted Dr. Kleeman and his partner, Dr. Ahn, around 9:00 p.m. due to concern over some of his symptoms. Dr. Kleeman, who was familiar with compartment syndrome, observed Goudreault around 9:30 p.m. and saw no symptoms of the complication.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Dr. Kleeman began to suspect compartment syndrome in Goudreault\u2019s left calf the following morning when he observed him at 6:30 a.m. He testified that he then called Dr. Mahon. The substance and timing of the telephone call to Dr. Mahon were disputed, and the court instructed the jury to consider Dr. Kleeman\u2019s testimony only as evidence that a telephone call was made and not as evidence that Dr. Mahon agreed to take responsibility for treating any potential compartment syndrome. The ICU nurse observing Goudreault testified that she also contacted Dr. Mahon around 6:30 a.m. and updated him on Goudreault\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Around 6:45 a.m., Dr. Kleeman requested a tonometer, which is a device that can detect compartment syndrome by measuring pressure in the leg. The ICU nurse testified that she left and asked the charge nurse for the instrument, returned to tell Dr. Kleeman that there was a tonometer in the emergency room, but found that he had left. Dr. Kleeman testified that he left before the nurse returned because she had informed him that she did not think CMC had a tonometer.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Several hours elapsed before surgery took place to treat Goudreault\u2019s compartment syndrome, during which time Dr. Kleeman performed scheduled elective surgery at another hospital. Dr. Kleeman testified that he placed several telephone calls to Dr. Mahon and the hospital attempting to discover Goudreault\u2019s condition. He returned to observe Goudreault around 11:30 a.m. and made additional notes on his chart. Dr. Mahon did not perform the surgery to relieve the pressure in Goudreault\u2019s leg until around 2:00 p.m., when the compartment syndrome had reached an advanced state. Goudreault suffered a permanent loss of the peroneal nerve, which runs through one of the compartments in the leg. Although he saw improvement in his back pain, Goudreault testified that he now experiences pain, numbness and difficulty walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Goudreault initiated the instant action for professional negligence against CMC and Drs. Nepomnayshy, Mahon and Kleeman. Dr. Kleeman was the sole trial defendant, however, because Goudreault settled with the other defendants. Goudreault introduced evidence of several breaches of Dr. Kleeman\u2019s duty of care, including responsibility for causing at least one of the four vascular injuries and for failing to timely diagnose and treat compartment syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Goudreault maintained that Dr. Kleeman advised him that he would supervise the surgical team performing the ALIF. Dr. Kleeman disputed this, and denied any general responsibility for Goudreault\u2019s condition as the admitting physician. Dr. Kleeman further testified that he was not qualified to treat the compartment syndrome and that vascular issues were the vascular surgeon\u2019s responsibility. He acknowledged that Dr. Mahon did not act quickly upon being informed of the suspected compartment syndrome, but denied any responsibility for the delay. Additionally, because he was not present for Goudreault\u2019s entire surgery, Dr. Kleeman said his \u201cindex of suspicion\u201d regarding compartment syndrome was not high and that he relied upon Drs. Nepomnayshy and Mahon to also monitor Goudreault\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Both sides presented expert testimony. Goudreault called Dr. Michael Golding, a surgeon with vascular training and board-certification in thoracic, cardiovascular and general surgery. Dr. Golding testified that surgical teams commonly have leaders, and that the attending surgeon, in this case Dr. Kleeman, typically heads the team. He further testified that, although injuries to blood vessels sometimes happened during spinal surgery, they are rare. He testified that the quantity and severity of the injuries to Goudreault\u2019s blood vessels fell far below the standard of reasonable surgical care. Although Dr. Golding initially said that it was difficult to tell whether Dr. Nepomnayshy or Dr. Kleeman caused the injuries, he later testified that it was more likely than not that Dr. Kleeman caused at least one of Goudreault\u2019s vascular injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">As for the compartment syndrome, Dr. Golding opined that as Goudreault\u2019s admitting physician, Dr. Kleeman was responsible for post-surgical monitoring. In Dr. Golding\u2019s opinion, the circumstances of Goudreault\u2019s surgery created an environment that predisposed him to compartment syndrome and any surgeon would know that vascular injury was one of its common causes. He also testified that Dr. Kleeman breached the standard of reasonable care by failing to timely confirm or deny the presence of compartment syndrome, notwithstanding the presence of warning signs. He testified that early diagnosis and treatment of compart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ment syndrome usually averts permanent injury and that Dr. Kleeman\u2019s failure to timely diagnose and treat the compartment syndrome caused permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Dr. Kleeman called two expert witnesses: Dr. Bruce Morgan, a board-certified general and vascular surgeon, and Dr. John Regan, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon and internist who had performed over two thousand ALIFs. Both disputed the assertions that Dr. Kleeman breached duties of care and caused Goudreault\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">At the close of evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict. Dr. Kleeman argued that no jury could reasonably find for Goudreault on the count alleging negligent vascular injury because Dr. Golding\u2019s expert opinion on causation was speculative. As to the count alleging negligent postoperative care, Dr. Kleeman argued that Dr. Golding lacked the requisite experience with ALIFs to give expert testimony on the breach of duty. Goudreault moved for a directed verdict prohibiting the apportionment of fault to Drs. Nepomnayshy and Mahon for lack of adequate evidence. The trial court denied each motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">After the jury was instructed and heard closing arguments, the court explained the special verdict form. The first question asked whether the defendant was at fault for the plaintiffs injuries. If so, the jury was instructed to address question two, which asked the jury to determine the total amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Upon learning that the jury was deadlocked, the court gave an additional charge that apprised the jury, for the first time, of its ability to apportion fault to non-litigants. The court cautioned the jury not to \u201creach that issue unless you find D[r.] Kleeman is responsible to any degree.\u201d The court then instructed the jury to deliberate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Thereafter, the jury foreperson submitted a written question to the court asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Does a Decision which Favors The Defendant Preclude other Remedies? ie-isit Necessary-before [pursuing] other People i.e. Is it necessary to prove Dr. K\u2019s negligence in order to seek remedy from other parties? (For example, Dr. Mahon?)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Over Dr. Kleeman\u2019s objection, the court responded in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">[I]n order for any apportionment of fault among parties other than the defendant Dr. Kleeman to occur, Dr. Kleeman would have to be found legally at fault for plaintiffs injuries to some degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The jury then returned an affirmative response to the first question regarding liability but failed to answer the second question concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>damages. The court gave the jury another special verdict form with two additional questions: question three asked whether non-litigants were at fault and, if the answer was \u201cyes,\u201d question four asked the jury to attribute percentages of fault to each. The court instructed the jury to proceed to the remaining questions and apportion fault \u201cto each person who [it] determine[d] contributed to cause [Goudreault\u2019s] injuries.\u201d It reminded the jury that the defendant bore the burden of proving the fault of non-litigants. Each counsel then gave further closing arguments on the issue of apportionment. The jury found total damages of $1,109,000 and attributed 10% of fault to Dr. Kleeman, 20% of fault to Dr. Nepomnayshy and 70% of fault to Dr. Mahon.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On appeal, Dr. Kleeman argues that the trial court committed reversible error by: (1) qualifying Dr. Golding as an expert witness; (2) permitting Dr. Golding to opine that Dr. Kleeman likely caused at least one of Goudreault\u2019s vascular injuries; (3) granting Goudreault\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude impeachment of Dr. Golding by the American College of Surgeons\u2019 (ACS) policy statement; and (4) unfairly prejudicing the jury by submitting a nonresponsive and misleading answer to its question during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Goudreault cross-appeals, arguing that: (1) Dr. Kleeman should be jointly liable with Drs. Nepomnayshy and Mahon under RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) (1997); and (2) Dr. Kleeman failed to adduce adequate evidence to apportion fault to non-litigants pursuant to our holdings in <em>Nilsson v. Bierman, </em>150 N.H. 393 (2003), and <em>DeBenedetto v. CLD Consulting Eng\u2019rs, </em>153 N.H. 793 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We reverse and remand based upon the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question. We address the remaining issues because they \u201care likely to arise on remand.\u201d <em>Figlioli v. R.J. Moreau Cos., </em>151 N.H. 618, 622 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>I. Testimony of Dr. Golding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\n<em>A. Qualification as an Expert Witness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Dr. Kleeman first argues that the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Golding to offer expert testimony. He argues that Dr. Golding was not qualified because he had not operated since 1986 and had relinquished all surgical privileges by 1988. Additionally, Dr. Kleeman points out that Dr. Golding \u201cwas never trained in and had never performed any lapar[a]scopic surgery, observed an ALIF, or cared for a post-operative ALIF patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Goudreault counters that, although Dr. Golding retired from surgery for health reasons, he remained active in medicine. Goudreault points out that his was not strictly a laparascopic procedure because the complications required conversion to an open approach, which was within Dr. Golding\u2019s experience. Goudreault asserts that Dr. Golding was \u201cvery familiar with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the . . . lumbar anatomy\u201d and \u201cwhile [he] had never performed a lapar[a]scopic spinal surgery, he was well familiar with the techniques and [related] equipment.\u201d Goudreault maintains that vascular injuries are not unique to the ALIF procedure and that compartment syndrome can arise from various types of surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Expert witness testimony is required to establish a <em>prima facie </em>medical negligence case. <em>See </em>RSA 507-E:2,1 (1997). A witness is \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 702. \u201cIn deciding whether to qualify a witness as an expert, the trial judge must conduct an adequate investigation of the expert\u2019s qualifications.\u201d <em>Milliken v. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic, </em>154 N.H. 662, 667 (2006) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. </em>RSA 516:29-a, I (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u201cBecause the trial judge has the opportunity to hear and observe the witness, the decision whether a witness qualifies as an expert is within the trial judge\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Milliken, </em>154 N.H. at 667 (quotation omitted). We will not reverse that decision absent a clearly unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Hodgdon v. Frisbie Mem. Hosp., </em>147 N.H. 286, 289 (2001); <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). Our inquiry is \u201cwhether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 296. To prevail on appeal, \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his ease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">After a hearing, the trial court ruled that \u201c[b]ased on his training and experience, ... Dr. Golding is qualified to render his opinions about the surgery performed on the plaintiff and his follow-up care\u201d together with opinions about \u201cthe role and responsibility of Dr. Kleeman as the lead surgeon ... on plaintiffs procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s ruling was an unsustainable exercise of discretion. Dr. Golding had training in vascular surgery and was board-certified in thoracic, cardiovascular and general surgery. Although he no longer operates, he has been licensed to practice medicine since 1959 and is currently licensed to practice in three states. During his career, he taught medicine, performed research and practiced as a cardiac surgeon. He is an attending surgeon and consultant at three different hospitals. In addition to teaching surgeons about compartment syndrome, Dr. Golding authored a chapter about vascular trauma in a medical textbook including a discussion of compartment syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Dr. Golding\u2019s lack of laparascopic ALIF experience and training does not negate his ability to advance the jury\u2019s understanding and determination of facts at issue. \u201cAlthough a medical degree does not automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>qualify a witness to give an opinion on every conceivable medical question,\u201d <em>Mankoski v. Briley, </em>137 N.H. 308, 313 (1993) (quotation omitted), we have held that \u201c[t]he lack of specialization in a particular medical field does not automatically disqualify a doctor from testifying as an expert in that field.\u201d <em>Milliken, </em>154 N.H. at 667 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Mankoski, </em>137 N.H. at 312 (\u201cAn orthopedic surgeon is not <em>per se </em>unqualified to render expert testimony on the psychological health of a patient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Although Dr. Golding had not operated on patients since 1986 and had never personally performed an ALIF, he had performed surgery in the posterior lumbar area hundreds of times and had assisted to resolve major vascular problems that occurred during spinal fusions. Thus, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling qualifying Dr. Golding as an expert. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>B. Causation of Vascular Injuries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Dr. Kleeman next argues that the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Golding to opine that Dr. Kleeman more likely than not caused at least one of Goudreault\u2019s vascular injuries. Dr. Kleeman points out that Dr. Golding also testified that either Dr. Nepomnayshy or Dr. Kleeman could have caused Goudreault\u2019s vascular injuries. He contends that Dr. Golding\u2019s opinion on causation had no foundation under RSA 516:29-a, I, because of insufficient facts or data and a lack of \u201creliable principles reliably applied to the facts of th[is] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Goudreault argues that Dr. Golding\u2019s opinion was admissible because he based it upon the records, depositions and testimony coupled with his experience as a surgeon. Goudreault maintains that any inconsistent testimony given by Dr. Golding should go the weight of his opinion, not its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of medical negligence, a plaintiff must introduce, by expert testimony, \u201cevidence sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror\u2019s conclusion that the causal link between the negligence and the injury probably existed.\u201d <em>Bronson v. The Hitchcock Clinic, </em>140 N.H. 798, 801 (1996); <em>see </em>RSA 507-E:2, 1(c). \u201cThe plaintiff need only show with reasonable probability, not mathematical certainty, that but for the defendant\u2019s negligence, the harm would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Bronson, </em>140 N.H. at 802-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> A medical expert\u2019s competent opinion that the defendant\u2019s negligence \u201cprobably caused\u201d the harm establishes the quantum of expert testimony necessary. <em>See id. </em>at 802; <em>see also </em>N.H. R. Ev. 704; <em>Emerson v. Bentwood, </em>146 N.H. 251, 256 (2001). However, such an opinion is admissible only after it has been shown to the satisfaction of the court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201ctestimony is based upon sufficient facts or data; ... is the product of reliable principles and methods; and ... [that t]he witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d RSA 516:29-a, I; <em>see also </em>N.H. R. Ev. 702. Thus, \u201can expert\u2019s testimony must rise to a threshold level of reliability to be admissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 702.\u201d <em>Emerson, </em>146 N.H. at 254 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">The proper focus for the trial court is the reliability of the expert\u2019s methodology or technique. The trial court functions only as a gatekeeper, ensuring a methodology\u2019s reliability before permitting the fact-finder to determine the weight and credibility to be afforded an expert\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\"><em>Baker Valley Lumber v. Ingersoll-Rand, </em>148 N.H. 609, 616 (2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">N.H. R. Ev. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The trial court permitted Dr. Kleeman to explore the basis for Dr. Golding\u2019s opinion in the jury\u2019s presence before allowing him to render an opinion on causation. Dr. Golding testified that \u201c[t]he basis is when I reviewed the records and some depositions and testimony that I heard here yesterday and forty years of experience in surgery.\u201d Dr. Golding conceded that the records he reviewed did not expressly identify which doctor caused the vascular injuries, but he elaborated that \u201c[i]n reviewing the operative records, there was a progression of major bleeding episodes\u201d coupled with his \u201csense of how dissection in the retro-peroneal space is done, and how vessels get injured in the retro-peroneal space.\u201d He added that the \u201cuse of blunt and sharp dissection . . . requires traction and counter-traction\u201d performed by two sets of hands, which occurred here in an area of blood vessels that \u201ccan easily be damaged by either traction or counter-traction.\u201d Dr. Golding testified that two vascular injuries were \u201c[c]ertainly\u201d caused by traction and a third \u201ccould be from the traction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The trial court recessed to examine the record outside of the jury\u2019s presence in response to Dr. Kleeman\u2019s objection. Dr. Golding was then allowed to give his opinion \u201cthat more likely than not that Doctor Kleeman caused at least one of these vascular injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The trial court did not expressly rule as to the reliability of Dr. Golding\u2019s methodology. He appears to have relied upon something akin to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cdifferential etiology,\u201d <em>Baker Valley Lumber, </em>148 N.H. at 616, \u201ca standard scientific technique of identifying the cause of a medical problem by eliminating the likely causes until the most probable one is isolated.\u201d <em>Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, </em>178 F.3d 257, 262 (4th Cir. 1999). We find no error in admitting this testimony because admissibility of expert opinions turns upon the \u201creliability of the expert\u2019s methodology or technique,\u201d <em>Baker Valley Lumber, </em>148 N.H. at 616, and not upon the expert\u2019s conclusion, <em>see id. </em>at 615; <em>see also Baxter v. Temple, </em>157 N.H. 280, 285 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">To the extent there were gaps in Dr. Golding\u2019s explanations, \u201cthese omissions concern the relative weight and credibility of competing expert testimony rather than the basic reliability of such testimony, and are the province of the fact-finder, not the trial court.\u201d <em>Baker Valley Lumber, </em>148 N.H. at 615. \u201c[Objections to the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion go to the weight to be accorded the opinion evidence, and not to its admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe appropriate method of testing the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion is by cross-examination of the expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615-16 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>C. Use of ACS Policy for Impeachment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Prior to trial, Goudreault sought to exclude any evidence suggesting that, by testifying, Dr. Golding was failing to abide by the ACS policy statement on expert testimony because he lacked sufficient experience to offer opinion testimony on matters related to the ALIF procedure. The Trial Court <em>{McGuire, </em>J.) denied Goudreault\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling that the \u201cstandard is relevant to the competency and credibility of Dr. Golding, particularly where he is a Fellow of the [ACS], and is not unfairly prejudicial.\u201d Goudreault moved for reconsideration clarifying that he objected only to identification of the ACS as the source of statements and not their contents. The Trial Court <em>{Murphy, </em>J.) reconsidered the earlier decision and granted Goudreault\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>ruling \u201cit is appropriate to prevent injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Dr. Kleeman argues that the trial court \u201cerred by granting plaintiffs untimely motion to reconsider.\u201d He urges that the policy statement \u201cexposed a legitimate basis for rejecting Dr. Golding\u2019s testimony\u201d because it \u201cwould have demonstrated [that] the professional organization Dr. Golding relies upon to burnish his reputation had promulgated recommendations that, if... followed, would have precluded him from testifying\u201d due to alack of experience and demonstrated competence in ALIF surgery and post-operative care. Dr. Kleeman cites case law attaching weight to similar policies promulgated by the American Association of Neurosurgeons. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>Austin v. American Ass\u2019n of Neurological Surgeons, </em>253 F.3d 967 (7th Cir. 2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1078 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Goudreault argues that \u201cmedical specialty societies, such as ACS, . . . should not have any role in determining the qualifications of any expert witness in a judicial proceeding.\u201d Rather, he maintains that the trial court made the determination that Dr. Golding was qualified as an expert guided by judicial standards and not those of a private organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We review a trial court\u2019s decisions on the admissibility of evidence under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>Boynton v. Figueroa, </em>154 N.H. 592, 599-600 (2006). We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 600. \u201cTo meet this standard, [Dr. Kleeman] must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s rulings were clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of h[is] case.\u201d <em>Desclos v. S. N.H. Med. Ctr., </em>153 N.H. 607, 610 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s ruling was unreasonable or untenable. \u201c[T]he power to [reconsider an issue once decided] remains in the court until final judgment or decree.\u201d <em>Redlon Co. v. Corporation, </em>91 N.H. 502, 506 (1941) (quotation omitted). \u201cIt is immaterial that different judges act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon clarification of Goudreault\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>Judge Murphy concluded that reconsideration of Judge McGuire\u2019s prior ruling was necessary to prevent injustice. The trial court could have reasoned that its ruling was necessary to avoid juror confusion regarding the threshold determination of expert witness competency. <em>Emery v. Company, </em>89 N.H. 165, 169 (1937) (\u201cThe question whether one possesses the requisite qualifications to testify as an expert is one of fact for the trial court....\u201d). Thus, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s ruling exceeded its \u201cbroad discretion to fix the limits of cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>155 N.H. 246, 253 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>II. The Supplemental Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Dr. Kleeman maintains that the trial court committed reversible error by submitting a nonresponsive answer to a deadlocked jury, resulting in a verdict that was the product of bias and confusion about the law. Noting the jury\u2019s ignorance of the previous settlements reached with Drs. Mahon and Nepomnayshy, he maintains that the correct response to the jury\u2019s question was that Goudreault\u2019s remedies against the other doctors would not be affected by its finding on Dr. Kleeman\u2019s liability. He argues that \u201cthe jury\u2019s verdict was based on the mistaken belief that unless it found [him] liable[,] . . . Goudreault would be left without a remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Goudreault argues that the trial court\u2019s response was a correct statement of the law because \u201c[i]f Dr. Kleeman was not [found to be] legally at fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to any degree, [then he] could not pursue anyone else because he had settled with those parties.\u201d Goudreault also argues that the original jury instructions regarding liability and collateral sources of recovery were sufficient to ensure that the jury understood the requisites for a determination of liability. Finally, Goudreault argues that any perceived prejudice is but \u201cwild speculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u201cThe response to a jury question is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>155 N.H. 212, 214 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201c[W]e review the court\u2019s response under the unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFirst, [the party challenging an instruction] must show that it was a substantial error such that it could have misled the jury regarding the applicable law.\u201d <em>Francoeur v. Piper, </em>146 N.H. 525, 531 (2001). \u201cThe instruction must be judged as a reasonable juror would probably have understood it....\u201d <em>State v. Dingman, </em>144 N.H. 113, 115 (1999). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s answer to a jury inquiry in the context of the court\u2019s entire charge to determine whether the answer accurately conveys the law on the question and whether the charge as a whole fairly covered the issues and law in the case.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>155 N.H. at 214 (quotation omitted). Even if the supplemental instruction is shown to be a substantial error, we will only set aside a jury verdict if the error resulted in mistake or partiality. <em>See Babb v. Clark, </em>150 N.H. 98, 100 (2003) (quotation omitted); <em>Francoeur, </em>146 N.H. at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\n<em>A. The Question and Answer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"> \u201c[T]he general rule is that the trial court has a duty to provide instruction to the jury where it has posed an explicit question or requested clarification on a point of law arising from facts about which there is doubt or confusion.\u201d <em>People v. Childs, </em>636 N.E.2d 534, 539 (Ill. 1994). It should address \u201cthose matters fairly encompassed within the question.\u201d <em>Testa v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 173, 176 (1st Cir. 1998). Here, we conclude that the trial court committed a substantial error in answering the jury\u2019s question. The question posed to the court was reasonably susceptible of competing interpretations. The jury asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">Does a Decision which Favors The Defendant Preclude other Remedies? ic is it Necessary-before [pursuing] other People i.e. Is it necessary to prove Dr. K\u2019s negligence in order to seek remedy from other parties? (For example, Dr. Mahon?)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">One trained in the law might interpret this as an inquiry about the apportionment of fault and whether that issue is germane to the threshold finding of liability However, we believe the better reading of the question, especially in view of the portion that was stricken, is whether returning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>defendant\u2019s verdict on liability would foreclose the plaintiff from pursuing damages against other persons involved in bringing about his alleged harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">The trial court responded to the former interpretation but ignored the latter. At best, its response addressed one possible, though unlikely, interpretation of the jury\u2019s inquiry. At worst, it was entirely nonresponsive. Thus, it likely \u201cwas, in effect, no response at all.\u201d <em>Van Winkle v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas, </em>683 N.E.2d 985, 991 (Ill. App. Ct. 1997); <em>see Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 613-15 (1946) (declining to sustain conviction where question and answer between judge and deliberating jury was subject to multiple interpretations). \u201cThe failure to answer or the giving of a response which provides no answer to the particular question of law posed ... [can result in] prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Van Winkle, </em>683 N.E.2d at 990 (quotation omitted). The trial court should have taken special care to specifically and accurately dispel any confusion about the law. <em>See id.) Bollenbach, </em>326 U.S. at 612-13. Accordingly, we cannot sustain its answer to the deadlocked jury\u2019s question. <em>See Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>B. Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The fact that the trial court substantially erred does not end our inquiry. To warrant reversal, the error must be said to have prejudiced Dr. Kleeman. <em>See Stewart, </em>155 N.H. at 217; <em>Francoeur, </em>146 N.H. at 531. We are persuaded that the trial court\u2019s error likely caused prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\"> We begin by noting that \u201ca jury instruction given after deliberations have begun comes at a particularly delicate juncture and therefore evokes heightened scrutiny.\u201d <em>Testa, </em>144 F.3d at 175. In addition, the jury\u2019s question evinces confusion about the law and its application to a dispositive issue, <em>see Van Winkle, </em>683 N.E.2d at 991; <em>Hassler v. Simon, </em>466 N.W.2d 434, 437 (Minn. Ct. App. 1991), which was heavily disputed at trial, <em>see Stewart, </em>155 N.H. at 217; <em>Francoeur, </em>146 N.H. at 531-32. The court\u2019s nonresponsive answer likely permitted lingering confusion at minimum or even promoted misapprehension about the applicable law by \u201cimpl[ying] that the jury must find [Dr. Kleeman] negligent if [Goudreault] was to recover anything for [his] damages.\u201d <em>Hassler, </em>466 N.W.2d at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">Although we consider the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction in the context of the whole jury charge, <em>see Francoeur, </em>146 N.H. at 531, the prior charge on collateral sources of recovery and the requisites of professional negligence did not cure the prejudice. <em>See id.) Baraniak v. Kurby, </em>862 N.E.2d 1152, 1157 (Ill. App. Ct.) (trial court has duty to resolve jury confusion about law \u201c[even though] the jury was properly instructed\u201d originally), <em>appeal denied, </em>871 N.E.2d 54 (Ill. 2007). \u201cThe influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>jurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him.\u201d <em>Bollenbach, </em>326 U.S. at 612 (quotation and citation omitted). \u201cIf [the court\u2019s answer] is a specific ruling on a vital issue and misleading, the error is not cured by a prior unexceptionable and unilluminating abstract charge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\n<em>III. Joint &amp; Several Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Goudreault argues that Dr. Kleeman should have been jointly and severally liable. \u201cUnder the rule of joint and several liability, a defendant who is only partly responsible for a plaintiffs injuries may be held responsible for the entire amount of recoverable damages.\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 798. \u201cThis allows a plaintiff to sue any one of several tortfeasors and collect the full amount of recoverable damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAs a result, numerous jurisdictions^ including New Hampshire,] have enacted legislation seeking to ameliorate the \u2018inequities\u2019 suffered by low fault, \u2018deep pocket\u2019 defendants . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Under New Hampshire\u2019s statutory scheme, liability is \u201cjoint and several\u201d for each party fifty percent at fault or greater. <em>See </em>RSA 507:7-e, 1(b) (1997). However, where \u201cany party shall be less than 50 percent at fault, then that party\u2019s liability shall be several and not joint and he shall be liable only for the damages attributable to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding RSA 507:7-e, 1(b), RSA 507:7-e, 1(c), restores joint liability by providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">[I]n all cases where parties are found to have knowingly pursued or taken active part in a common plan or design resulting in the harm, [the court shall] grant judgment against all such parties on the basis of the rules of joint and several liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Goudreault asserts that Dr. Kleeman should be jointly liable regardless of his percentage of fault because he \u201ct[ook] active part in a common plan or design,\u201d <em>id., </em>with the other doctors operating upon him where each \u201cw[as] responsible for [his] treatment and caret,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 stood side by side during surgery and assisted one another[,]... wrote notes and observations in the same chart[,] . . . and individually profited [from] the services rendered.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. </em>We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond it for further indication of legislative intent, and we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. If a statute is ambiguous, however, we consider legislative history to aid our analysis. Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><em>Cloutier v. City of Berlin, </em>154 N.H. 13, 17 (2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We begin our analysis by considering RSA 507:7-e, 1(c), in context. RSA chapter 507 is a broad framework governing comparative fault and apportionment of tort liability. <em>See Nilsson, </em>150 N.H. at 395. \u201cThe New Hampshire legislature first enacted a comparative negligence statute in 1969, motivated by a deep conviction that the contributory negligence rule was so basically unfair and illogical that it should have no further place in the State\u2019s law.\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 808 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cHowever, the statute abolished not only contributory negligence, but joint and several liability as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In 1986, the legislature separated the concepts of apportionment and contributory negligence, \u201cenact[ing] section 7-d to address contributory negligence and section 7-e to address apportionment.\u201d <em>Nilsson, </em>150 N.H. at 397. \u201cAs enacted in 1986, section 7-e provided for apportionment of damages in all actions, not only those involving contributorily negligent plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201c[T]he legislature [thereby] established a system for contribution among tortfeasors and reinstituted joint and several liability,\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 808, for \u201c \u2018each party liable,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 798 (quoting Laws 1986, 227:2).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u201cIn 1989, the legislature amended section 7-e, 1(b) to protect minimally liable defendants.\u201d <em>Nilsson, </em>150 N.H. at 399 (quotation omitted). \u201c[R]ecognizing that manufacturers, professionals and public agencies become targets for damage recoveries because of their potential money resources rather than their fault, [it] sought to amend RSA 507:7-e to treat fairly those entities which may be unfairly treated under the rule of joint and several liability.\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 799 (quotations and ellipsis omitted). \u201c[It] rejected [a] pure several liability approach and instead passed a compromise measure adopting several liability only for those parties less than 50 percent at fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe resulting legislation made New Hampshire a hybrid jurisdiction\u201d employing both several and joint liability. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he comprehensive scheme of RSA chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>507 reflects the legislature\u2019s careful balance of the rights of defendants and plaintiffs ... [, and i]t is not our place to upset this balance.\u201d <em>Nilsson, </em>150 N.H. at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The plain language of RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) imposes joint liability where a tortfeasor (1) knowingly (2) pursued or took active part in (3) a common plan or design (4) resulting in harm. <em>See </em>RSA 507:7-e, 1(c). The present dispute centers upon what the legislature meant by \u201ca common plan or design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Goudreault argues that its plain meaning is \u201cconcerted action, taken by each with knowledge of the others\u2019 participation\u201d without proof of civil conspiracy or specific intent. He argues it is enough that the doctors \u201ct[ook] a conscious part in a common plan which results in harm.\u201d On the other hand, Dr. Kleeman argues that Goudreault\u2019s construction \u201cwould have the absurd result of subjecting every doctor involved in a patient\u2019s care to joint and several liability for the full extent of the patient\u2019s [] damages.\u201d He maintains that RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) \u201ccreates a narrow exception to several liability, preserving the common law rule of joint and several liability when there is concerted wrongful activity such as . . . civil conspiracy or when a defendant intentionally aids and abets another\u2019s tortious conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We note that of the several ways one may be subject to joint and several tort liability, RSA 507:7-e, 1(c), most closely resembles the common law imposition of joint and several liability for concerted activity. <em>See </em>2 J.D. Lee &amp; B. A. Lindahl, Modern Tort Law Liability &amp; Litigation \u00a7 19:4, at 19-7 to -8 (2d ed. 2002); RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: Apportionment of Liability \u00a7 15 (2000). Recognizing this, both parties attempt to define what constitutes concerted activity; specifically, whether it contemplates collaboration to achieve a tortious result, or, conversely, if the pursuit of a desirable result gone awry due to negligence is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Goudreault correctly points out that the legislature did not include words such as \u201ccommon plan or design\u201d <em>to commit a tortious act. </em>However, neither did it require a \u201ccommon plan or design\u201d to achieve any other variety of result. The better reading of the statute, considering its object and purpose, takes account of the fact that, to be subject to RSA 507:7-e, 1(c), the conduct must be undertaken \u201cknowingly.\u201d Under the Criminal Code, \u201c[a] person acts knowingly with respect to conduct or to a circumstance ... when he is aware that his conduct <em>is of such nature </em>or <em>that such circumstances exist.\u201d </em>RSA 626:2,11(b) (2007) (emphases added). \u201cIn other words, a defendant acts knowingly when he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause a prohibited result.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>148 N.H. 394, 398 (2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We believe the legislature required the mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d as a limited exception restoring common law joint liability for \u201c[a]ll those who, in pursuit of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt the wrongdoer\u2019s acts done for their benefit.\u201d W. KEETON, PROSSER AND Keeton ON THE LAW OF TORTS \u00a7 46, at 323 (5th ed. 1984) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In this way, the requirements of RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) resemble the concerted activity of civil conspiracy. <em>See Jay Edwards, Inc. v. Baker, </em>130 N.H. 41, 47 (1987) (outlining elements of civil conspiracy). \u201cIt is... essential that each . . . defendant... be proceeding tortiously, which is to say with the intent requisite to committing a tort, or with negligence.\u201d Keeton, <em>supra </em>at 324. However, \u201c[e]xpress agreement is not necessary and all that is required is that there be a tacit understanding, as where two automobile drivers suddenly and without consultation decide to race their cars on the public highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Our construction is guided by the legislative policy behind RSA chapter 507. We have previously observed that RSA 507:7-e, 1(c) imposes joint liability only as an <em>exception </em>to RSA 507:7-e, 1(b). <em>Rodgers v. Colby\u2019s Ol\u2019 Place, </em>148 N.H. 41, 44 (2002). Goudreault\u2019s expansive exception would contravene the legislature\u2019s objective of shielding minimally liable tortfeasors from undue civil liability. Dr. Kleeman correctly points out that \u201c[djoctors, lawyers, dentists, and architects rarely practice their trades in isolation\u201d and that Goudreault\u2019s construction \u201cwould swallow the rule\u201d of several liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Finally, we note that our construction accords with the decisions of other states. <em>See, e.g., GES, Inc. v. Corbitt, </em>21 P.3d 11, 15 (Nev. 2001); <em>Schneider v. Schaaf, </em>603 N.W.2d 869, 876 (N.D. 1999); <em>Kottler v. State, </em>963 P.2d 834, 841 (Wash. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>IV. Apportionment of Fault to Non-litigants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Goudreault argues that Dr. Kleeman failed to adduce \u201cadequate evidence,\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 804, for the jury to apportion fault to Drs. Mahon and Nepomnayshy. In <em>Nilsson, </em>we held \u201cthat for apportionment purposes under [RSA 507:7-e, 1(b)], the word \u2018party\u2019 refers to parties to an action, including settling parties.\u201d <em>Nilsson, </em>150 N.H. at 396 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). In <em>DeBenedetto, </em>we elaborated that \u201cthe word \u2018party\u2019 [embraces] ... all parties contributing to the occurrence giving rise to an action, including those immune from liability or otherwise not before the court.\u201d <em>DeBenedetto, </em>153 N.H. at 804. However, in order to shift fault, we noted that \u201callegations of a non-litigant tortfeasor\u2019s fault must be sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ported by <em>adequate evidence </em>before a jury or court may consider it for fault apportionment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Goudreault\u2019s effort to preclude apportionment of liability to Drs. Mahon and Nepomnayshy derives from RSA chapter 507-E, the statute governing the elements of a medical negligence plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case. He argues that the defendant should carry the same or a similar burden of proof in order to shift fault to non-litigants. He premises this argument on equal protection grounds and fundamental fairness to litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Dr. Kleeman argues that New Hampshire law does not require him to apportion fault by presenting a <em>prima facie </em>case through \u201cunequivocal expert testimony,\u201d testimony from the \u201capportionees,\u201d or evidence from a defense expert. He cites <em>Wilder v. Eberhart, </em>977 F.2d 673 (1st Cir. 1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 930 (1993), arguing that the burden of proof on causation \u201crests and remains with the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">First, we consider whether, as the trial court instructed the jury over his objection, Dr. Kleeman had the burden of proving non-litigant liability. Dr. Kleeman did not appeal this issue, but clarification may assist the litigants upon retrial. Goudreault correctly observes that a civil defendant who seeks to deflect fault by apportionment to non-litigants is raising something in the nature of an <em>affirmative defense. Cf. </em>RSA 507:7-d (1997) (stating, with regard to comparative fault of a party, that \u201c[t]he burden of proof as to the existence of amount of fault attributable to a party shall rest upon the party making such allegation\u201d). Thus, the defendant carries the burdens of production and persuasion. <em>See id.) see also Brann v. Exeter Clinic, </em>127 N.H. 155, 159 (1985); <em>Gust v. Jones, </em>162 F.3d 587, 593 (10th Cir. 1998) (interpreting Kansas law to require defendant asserting non-party doctor\u2019s fault to bear burden of proving such fault); <em>Carroll v. Whitney, </em>29 S.W.3d 14, 21 (Tenn. 2000) (\u201c[T]he nonparty defense is an affirmative defense [and as such], a jury can apportion fault to a nonparty only after it is convinced that the defendant\u2019s burden of establishing that a nonparty caused or contributed to the plaintiffs injury has been met.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We further agree with Goudreault that a defendant who raises a non-litigant apportionment defense essentially \u201cbecomes another plaintiff who must seek to impose liability on a [non-litigant] just as plaintiff seeks to impose it on him.\u201d Where the defendant seeks to reduce or eliminate the plaintiffs recovery by apportioning professional liability, it is only fair that he or she carry the plaintiffs burden of proof outlined in RSA 507-E :2. That statute requires \u201caffirmative evidence which must include expert testimony of a competent witness,\u201d RSA 507-E :2, I, of the standard of reasonable care, breach thereof and proximate causation of damages, <em>see </em>RSA 507-E :2, I(a)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>In <em>Gust, </em>a case we relied upon in <em>DeBenedetto, </em>defendants in a vehicle accident action sought to apportion fault to a nonparty doctor, <em>Gust, </em>162 F.3d at 593, after the plaintiff sought recovery for harm to his femur, foot and ankle, <em>id. </em>at 591. The Tenth Circuit applied Kansas law to require \u201cadequate evidence\u201d in support of \u201callegations that a nonparty\u2019s negligence caused a plaintiff\u2019s harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593. In the context of a medical negligence claim \u201cwhere the lack of reasonable care would [not] be apparent to the average layman,\u201d <em>id., </em>such adequate evidence \u201crequire[d] expert testimony to establish that the [nonparty doctor breached] the accepted standard of medical care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593-94. The lack of such expert testimony with respect to the treatment of the plaintiff\u2019s femur precluded apportionment to the nonparty doctor. <em>Id. </em>at 594. Although some evidence suggested a breach of care regarding treatment of the plaintiffs foot and ankle, those claims were also properly excluded from jury apportionment where the \u201c[defendants produced no expert testimony that [the doctor\u2019s] treatment exacerbated [the plaintiffs] foot and ankle injuries or resulted in any harm to [the plaintiff.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Dr. Kleeman\u2019s reliance upon the First Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Wilder </em>is misplaced. Notably, it preceded our decision in <em>Nilsson </em>by over ten years. Moreover, it is distinguishable from the case before us today. <em>Wilder </em>stands for the proposition that the plaintiff must prove proximate causation of his or her injuries, <em>Wilder, </em>977 F.2d at 676, while \u201cthe defendant need not disprove causation\u201d but only \u201cdiscredit or rebut the plaintiffs evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u201cDefendant need not prove another cause, he only has to convince the trier of fact that the alleged negligence was not the legal cause of the injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike <em>Wilder, </em>the defendant <em>is </em>seeking to prove another cause and, so, must go beyond the mere rebuttal of the plaintiffs expert evidence in <em>Wilder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that there was sufficient expert testimony adduced to support the jury\u2019s apportionment of fault to Drs. Nepomnayshy and Mahon. As for Dr. Nepomnayshy\u2019s fault, Drs. Kleeman and Regan both testified that vascular issues were the vascular surgeon\u2019s responsibility. Dr. Morgan testified that Dr. Nepomnayshy would have been directing Dr. Kleeman in accessing Goudreault\u2019s spine. Dr. Golding opined that vascular injuries in such an approach were rare and that Goudreault\u2019s four injuries were <em>per se </em>breaches of the standard of reasonable care. Even Dr. Morgan conceded that it is unusual to have four vascular injuries during an ALIF. At minimum, the jury could have reasonably found that the vascular injuries caused Goudreault to endure additional surgeries and prolonged hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>As for Dr. Mahon, he was present for the repair of Goudreault\u2019s vascular injuries. Dr. Morgan testified that Goudreault\u2019s compartment syndrome was likely the product of procedures to repair the vascular injuries coupled with the excess of fluid in Goudreault\u2019s system following surgery. Dr. Morgan testified that the vascular surgeons, including Dr. Mahon, were responsible for post-surgical monitoring of vascular issues. Both Dr. Kleeman and the ICU nurse testified to alerting Dr. Mahon of Goudreault\u2019s suspected compartment syndrome. Dr. Kleeman acknowledged that Dr. Mahon did not act quickly and that several hours elapsed before Goudreault\u2019s surgery began. Dr. Golding also testified that any surgeon would know that vascular injury was a common cause of compartment syndrome and that time was of the essence in averting permanent injury. He also testified that the failure to timely diagnose and treat the compartment syndrome caused permanent injuries. We conclude that there was ample evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict as to Dr. Mahon.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan and Galway, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
