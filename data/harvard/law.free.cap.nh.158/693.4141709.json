We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">At issue is the PUC\u2019s interpretation of NHPUC Tariff No. 85, <em>available at http:llwmv.puc.nh.govlRegulatorylTariffslFairPointNo85AccessTariff.pdf. </em>Tariff No. 85 is one of several tariffs that apply to the services that were formerly offered by Verizon and are now offered by FairPoint. For ease of reference, this opinion will refer to Verizon and FairPoint, collectively, as Verizon.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">The dispute in this case is about a charge that Verizon has required petitioner Freedom Ring Communications, LLC d/b/a BayRing Communications (BayRing), intervenor One Communications, and intervenor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>AT&amp;T Corporation (collectively, the petitioners), to pay. The petitioners are competitor telephone companies that use Verizon\u2019s network to provide telephone services in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 2.1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The charge at issue is called the \u201ccarrier common line access charge.\u201d <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 5. In 2006, BayRing petitioned the PUC to investigate Verizon\u2019s imposition of this charge upon certain local or \u201cintrastate\u201d toll calls. Following a hearing, the PUC ruled in the petitioners\u2019 favor, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We first discuss the proper standard of review in this case. A party seeking to set aside an order of the PUC has the burden of demonstrating that the order is contrary to law or, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the order is unjust or unreasonable. RSA 541:13 (2007); <em>see Appeal of Verizon New England, </em>153 N.H. 50, 56 (2005). Findings of fact by the PUC are presumed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. RSA 541:13; <em>see Verizon, </em>153 N.H. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">We review certain PUC orders deferentially. \u2018When... we are reviewing agency orders which seek to balance competing economic interests, or which anticipate such an administrative resolution, our responsibility is not to supplant the [PUC\u2019s] balance of interests with one more nearly to our liking.\u201d <em>Appeal of Conservation Law Foundation, </em>127 N.H. 606, 616 (1986) (quotation, ellipses and brackets omitted). While we give the PUC\u2019s policy choices considerable deference, <em>see Verizon, </em>153 N.H. at 56, we do not defer to its tariff interpretation, despite its obvious expertise in this regard. <em>Cf. Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. 716, 719-20 (1994) (explaining that court no longer defers to statutory interpretation by New Hampshire Public Employee Labor Relations Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">\u201c[T]he vehicles by which utility rates are set, the tariffs or rate schedules required to be filed with the PUC, do not simply define the terms of the contractual relationship between a utility and its customers.\u201d <em>Appeal of Pennichuck Water Works, </em>120 N.H. 562, 566 (1980) (citations omitted). \u201cThey have the force and effect of law and bind both the utility and its customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because a tariff has the same force and effect as a statute, we interpret a tariff in the same manner that we interpret a statute. <em>See Laclede Gas Co. v. Public Service Com\u2019n, </em>156 S.W.3d 513, 521 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005). Therefore, we review the PUC\u2019s tariff interpretation <em>de novo. See Nenni v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Ins. Dep\u2019t, </em>156 N.H. 578, 581 (2007). We begin by examining the language used in the tariff, ascribing the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>See id. </em>Where the tariff\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we will not look beyond it to determine its intent. <em>See id.; Laclede Gas Co., </em>156 S.W.3d at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Before addressing the merits of this appeal, we explain the process by which a telephone call is made. In PUC parlance, the individuals at either end of a telephone conversation are \u201cend users.\u201d <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 1.3.2. When an \u201cend user\u201d makes a telephone call, the call is transmitted to an \u201cend office\u201d over a set of wires or fiber optic lines that is called a \u201ccommon line.\u201d <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 1.3.2. In the calls at issue, neither person on either end of the conversation was a Verizon customer. Thus, because the \u201cend user\u201d making the telephone call was not a Verizon customer, the \u201cend office\u201d to which the call was transmitted, as well as the \u201ccommon line\u201d leading to the \u201cend office,\u201d did not belong to Verizon.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Once a call has been transmitted to the \u201cend office,\u201d the \u201cend office\u201d routes it over another set of wires or fiber optic lines, depending upon whether the call is a local or toll call. In the calls at issue, the \u201cend office\u201d connected the calls to a Verizon \u201caccess tandem.\u201d An \u201caccess tandem\u201d is a type of switch. <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 1.3.2. Switching is another word for connecting a call. <em>See </em>C.H. Kennedy, An Introduction to U.S. Telecommunications Law 2 (2d ed. 2001). In the calls at issue, once a call was transmitted to Verizon\u2019s \u201caccess tandem,\u201d the \u201caccess tandem\u201d then routed it either to another \u201cend office\u201d or to a \u201cwire center,\u201d depending upon whether the call was a wireless call or not. In the calls at issue, the \u201cend office\u201d or \u201cwire center\u201d to which Verizon\u2019s \u201caccess tandem\u201d routed the calls belonged to a non-Verizon telephone company. The \u201cend office\u201d or \u201cwire center\u201d then transmitted the calls to the \u201cend user,\u201d who received the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In the context of this case, \u201clocal switching\u201d refers to the process by which the \u201cend office\u201d routed the calls to Verizon\u2019s \u201caccess tandem,\u201d and \u201clocal transport\u201d refers to the process by which Verizon\u2019s \u201caccess tandem\u201d routed the calls to the non-Verizon telephone company\u2019s \u201cend office\u201d or \u201cwire center.\u201d \u201cLocal switching\u201d and \u201clocal transport\u201d are two of three components of \u201cswitched access service.\u201d The third component is \u201ccommon line access.\u201d <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 6.1.2.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The parties dispute whether Tariff No. 85 allows Verizon to impose a carrier common line access charge for calls that do not traverse Verizon\u2019s common line. The petitioners contend that Verizon may impose the carrier common line access charge only for calls that are transmitted over Verizon\u2019s common line. As the calls at issue were not transmitted over Verizon\u2019s common line, the petitioners assert that it was error for Verizon to impose the carrier common line access charge upon these calls. Verizon counters that it was allowed to impose the carrier common line access charge for calls that did not traverse its common line because, under the tariff, this charge applies to each aspect of \u201cswitched access service\u201d that Verizon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>provided and it is undisputed that Verizon provided \u201clocal switching\u201d and \u201clocal transport,\u201d two of the three aspects of \u201cswitched access service\u201d in connection with the calls at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">To determine whether Verizon may impose the carrier common line access charge for calls that do not actually use Verizon\u2019s common line, we first examine the plain language of Tariff No. 85. Three provisions in section 5 of Tariff No. 85 specifically refer to the carrier common line access charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u2022 Section 5: \u201cCarrier common line access service is billed to <em>each </em>switched access service provided under this tariff in accordance with the regulations set forth herein and in Section 4.1, and at the rates and charges contained in Section 30.5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">\u2022 Section 5.4.1.A: \u201cExcept as set forth herein, <em>all </em>switched access service provided to the customer will be subject to carrier common line access charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u2022 Section 5.4.1.C: \u201cThe switched access service provided by [Verizon] includes the switched access service provided for both interstate and intrastate communications. The carrier common line access rates and charges will be billed to <em>each </em>switched access service provided under this tariff in accordance with Section 4.1 and Section 5.4.2.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>sections 5, 5.4.1.A, 5.4.1.C (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The plain meaning of these three provisions is that the carrier common line access charge applies to <em>each </em>aspect of switched access service that Verizon provides. The plain meaning of the word \u201ceach\u201d is \u201ceach one\u201d or \u201call considered one by one.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 713 (unabridged ed. 2002). Here, it is undisputed that Verizon provided local switching and local transport with respect to the calls at issue, and that local switching and local transport are part of switched access service. Accordingly, under the plain language of Tariff No. 85, it was permissible for Verizon to assess the carrier common line access charge to the local switching and local transport services it provided in connection with the calls at issue. Because we find the tariff\u2019s language to be plain and unambiguous, we will not look beyond it to determine its intent. <em>See Nenni, </em>156 N.H. at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The PUC reached the opposite conclusion in part because it conflated \u201cswitched access service\u201d with \u201ccomplete switched access service.\u201d These terms are not synonymous. Section 6.1.2.B identifies the three rate categories that apply to switched access service as \u201c[l]ocal transport,\u201d \u201c[l]ocal switching,\u201d and \u201c[c]arrier common line.\u201d Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>6.I.2.B. Section 6.1.2.D explains: \u201cLocal transport, local switching and carrier common line <em>when combined... </em>provide a complete switched access service.\u201d Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 6.1.2.D (emphasis added). Thus, it is only when all three aspects of switched access service are provided that Verizon provides \u201ccomplete switched access service.\u201d When only two aspects are provided, the \u201cswitched access service\u201d is not complete, but is still \u201cswitched access service\u201d under the tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Although it is not binding upon us, we observe that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reached a similar conclusion in <em>AT &amp; T Corp. v. Bell Atlantic - Pennsylvania, </em>14 F.C.C.R. 556 (1998). At issue was the complaint by rival telephone companies that the incumbent telephone companies improperly assessed \u201caccess carrier common line (CCL) charges\u201d for portions of interstate calls that did not actually use a common line. <em>AT &amp; T Corp., </em>14 F.C.C.R. at 557, 558. The FCC ruled that imposing a CCL charge for a call that does not physically use a common line violated the FCC\u2019s own rules and prior orders, <em>see id. </em>at 570-75, but did <em>not </em>violate the clear language of the incumbent telephone companies\u2019 tariffs, <em>id. </em>at 592-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The tariffs of the incumbent telephone companies included language that was similar to the language in Tariff No. 85. <em>Id. </em>at 592-93. For instance, the tariff of one company provided: \u201c[EJxeept as otherwise provided, all Switched Access Service provided to the customer will be subject to Carrier Common Line Access Service charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592 (quotation omitted). This language is nearly identical to section 5.4.1. A of Tariff No. 85. <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 5.4.1.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The FCC determined that the tariffs appeared to be inconsistent with its interpretation of its rules and orders because \u201cthey imply that all switched access minutes that are not explicitly excepted from the CCL charge must be subject to that charge notwithstanding the absence of common line use.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Corporation, </em>14 F.C.C.R. at 593. Accordingly, the FCC directed the incumbent telephone companies to modify their tariffs to reflect its finding that to impose a CCL charge upon a call that does not actually use a common line is contrary to its rules and prior orders. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, here, Tariff No. 85 implies that all switched access minutes must be subject to the carrier common line access charge even when Verizon\u2019s common line is not actually used.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">We find guidance as well from the decision of the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) in <em>WilTel Communications, Inc. v. Verizon New York Inc., </em>Case 04-C-1548, 2006 WL 1479507 (N.Y.P.S.C. May 30, 2006). In that proceeding, WilTel Communications, Inc. (WilTel) had complained that Verizon improperly charged the carrier common line access charges for intrastate calls that WilTel originated and that termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>nated at a wireless carrier\u2019s network. WilTel argued, among other things, that Verizon was precluded from demanding compensation for carrier common line access when Verizon did not actually perform this service. The NYPSC ruled that the tariff language was clear and unambiguous and that nothing in that language \u201cassume[d] that Verizon performs all of the stated functions\u201d involved in providing complete switched access service. The Verizon tariff in the NYPSC proceeding stated, in pertinent part, \u201cFor traffic which originates or terminates at [a wireless carrier\u2019s network], Carrier Common Line [Access] Service and Switched Access Service Local Switching rates and charges . . . will apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">While the tariff language at issue in the WilTel proceeding differed significantly from the language of Tariff No. 85, we reach a similar conclusion here. As with the Verizon tariff in the WilTel proceeding, there is nothing in Tariff No. 85 that requires Verizon to provide complete switched access service in order to charge the carrier common line access charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">In arguing for a contrary result, the petitioners rely upon section 5.1.1.A.1, which states: \u201c[Verizon] will provide carrier common line access service to customers in conjunction with switched access service provided in Section 6.\u201d Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 5.1.1 Al. The petitioners contend that, pursuant to this provision, Verizon provides \u201cswitched access service\u201d <em>only </em>when it also provides \u201ccarrier common line access service.\u201d In the calls at issue, because Verizon\u2019s common line was not used, Verizon did not provide \u201ccarrier common line access service,\u201d and, therefore, did not provide \u201cswitched access service.\u201d Accordingly, the petitioners contend, Verizon could not charge the carrier common line access charge for the disputed calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The plain meaning of section 5.1.1.A.1 does not support this interpretation. Read in the context of the entire tariff, section 5.1.1.A.1 merely reiterates that carrier common line access service is one of the types of switched access service that Verizon provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The petitioners also rely upon section 4.1.1.A, which requires Verizon to bill only for services it established, discontinued or provided during a given billing period. <em>See </em>Tariff No. 85, <em>supra </em>section 4.I.I.A. As Verizon provided local transport and local switching services in connection with the calls at issue, and as these two services are part of switched access service and, therefore, subject to the carrier common line access charge, we conclude that Verizon did not violate section 4.1.1.A when it imposed this charge upon the disputed calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Alternatively, the petitioners assert that section 5 of Tariff No. 85 simply does not apply to the disputed calls. The petitioners argue that \u201cwhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>carriers are taking <em>only </em>Local Transport and Local Switching pursuant to Section 6 \u2014 as is the case here \u2014 the rates, terms and conditions of Section 6 apply. The only time the rates, terms and conditions in Section 5 apply is when carriers are taking services from Section 5.\u201d These assertions are contrary, however, to the plain language of section 5, which states that the carrier common line access charge applies to <em>each </em>switched access service provided under the tariff as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The petitioners urge us to uphold the PUC\u2019s interpretation of Tariff No. 85 because, they contend, it is reasonable in light of the evolution of the telephone industry since the tariff was first adopted. Were we to review the PUC\u2019s tariff interpretation deferentially for mere reasonableness or rationality, we might find this argument persuasive. <em>See Bradshaw v. Wilkinson Water Co., </em>94 P.3d 242, 245 (Utah 2004). We review the PUC\u2019s tariff interpretation <em>de novo, </em>however, and although we \u201capproach the task of examining some of the complex scientific issues presented in cases of this sort with some diffidence,\u201d we are obliged to give effect to the plain language used in the tariff. <em>Appeal of Conservation Law Foundation, </em>127 N.H. at 616 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThat is our responsibility no less than it is our obligation to refrain from arrogating to ourselves the role of a public utilities commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the tariff should be amended, it should be amended as a result of regulatory process, and not by a decision of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, therefore, we reverse the PUC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b720-8\">Broderick, C.J., and Duggan and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
