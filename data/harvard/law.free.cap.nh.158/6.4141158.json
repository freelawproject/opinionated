Weiner, appeals an order of the Hampton District Court <em>{Frasier, </em>J.) granting the request by the plaintiff, Rita MacPherson, to extend a final protective order for an additional five years. <em>See </em>RSA 633:3-a, III-c (2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-17\">The record reveals the following. On September 22, 2005, the plaintiff obtained a final protective order against the defendant. On January 3,2006, the plaintiff filed a statement with the police, claiming that the defendant went to her place of employment and also made telephone calls to her parents and to her place of employment. On June 3, 2006, a witness observed the defendant at the plaintiff\u2019s residence. A complaint filed on June 6, 2006, alleged that the defendant drove by the plaintiff\u2019s residence seven times. The defendant was subsequently convicted of violating the protective order. On August 30, 2006, the district court extended the order for one year. There is no evidence that the defendant violated the protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>order during that year. On August 28,2007, the plaintiff requested, and the trial court granted, a five-year extension. The defendant requested a hearing. <em>See </em>RSA 633:3-a, III-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">At the hearing, the defendant represented, and the plaintiff did not dispute, that he had complied with the protective order since June 2006. The plaintiff informed the trial court that she requested an extension because the defendant had violated the prior orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The trial court issued a written order, granting the plaintiff\u2019s request for a five-year extension, stating: \u201cAn important factor in the Court finding plaintiff is entitled to have the order extended is that the defendant did previously on June 5, 2006 violate a previous order then in effect, [defendant's claim he has not contacted plaintiff in over a year is not a reason to deny [p]laintiff\u2019s request or her fear of defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">On appeal, the defendant raises four issues: (1) whether the plaintiff submitted sufficient evidence of \u201cgood cause\u201d to support the extension; (2) whether an incident that occurred fifteen months prior to the plaintiff\u2019s request for extension is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard; (3) whether the district court unsustainably exercised its discretion in granting the extension; and (4) whether RSA 633:3-a, III-c is void for vagueness as it relates to the phrase \u201cgood cause,\u201d and therefore violates the defendant\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The defendant\u2019s arguments as to sufficiency of the evidence are intertwined with questions of statutory interpretation regarding the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard in RSA 633:3-a, III-c. Specifically, the defendant points out that it is undisputed that he has complied with the protective order since June 2006, and argues that violation of a protective order fifteen months prior to a request for an extension is insufficient as a matter of law to meet the standard of \u201cgood cause.\u201d We, therefore, begin our analysis with a discussion of RSA 633:3-a, III-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">RSA 633:3-a, III-c provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">Any order under this section shall be for a fixed period of time not to exceed one year, but may be extended by order of the court upon a motion by the plaintiff, <em>showing good cause, </em>with notice to the defendant, for one year after the expiration of the first order and thereafter each extension may be for up to 5 years, upon the request of the plaintiff and at the discretion of the court. The court shall review the order, and each renewal thereof and shall grant such relief as may be necessary to provide for the safety and well-being of the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Upton v. Town of Hopkinton, </em>157 N.H. 115, 118 (2008). When examining the language of the statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. <em>Fisher v. Minichiello, </em>155 N.H. 188, 191 (2007). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>We interpret a statute to lead to a reasonable result and review a particular provision, not in isolation, but together with all associated sections. <em>Appeal of N.H. Troopers Assoc., </em>145 N.H. 288, 290 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Initially, we discuss the meaning of \u201cgood cause.\u201d RSA 633:3-a, III-c permits the court to extend a final protective order initially for one year. Thereafter \u201ceach extension may be for up to 5 years\u201d upon a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d RSA 633:3-a, III-c. RSA 633:3-a does not define \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>But see In re Alexander Grant &amp; Co., </em>820 F.2d 352, 356 (11th Cir. 1987) (good cause is \u201cdifficult to define in absolute terms, [but] it generally signifies a sound basis or legitimate need to take judicial action\u201d). It is, however, a common legal term. <em>E.g., </em>Fed. R. Civ. R 26(c) (\u201cThe court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.\u201d); RSA 12-E:5, II (2003) (\u2018When a petition for a hearing has been made, and good cause has been shown therefor, the commissioner shall set a time and place for a hearing.\u201d); RSA 29:12,1 (2000) (abatement of interest on taxes where good cause shown); RSA 30-B:21 (2000) (transfer to another department of corrections where good cause shown); <em>Curras v. Unemployment Appeals Com\u2019n, </em>841 So. 2d 673, 674 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2003) (to receive unemployment compensation one must show good cause to quit); <em>7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dar, </em>757 N.E.2d 515, 522 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001) (\u201cTermination of a franchise must be supported by good cause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The defendant points to RSA 633:3-a, Ill-a, which references RSA chapter 173-B, and argues that we should apply the principles articulated in <em>Tosta v. Bullis, </em>156 N.H. 763 (2008), in construing the term \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 633:3-a, Ill-a (remedy for stalking petitions look to domestic violence petition remedy); RSA ch. 173-B (2002 &amp; Supp. 2007) (domestic violence petitions). In <em>Tosta, </em>we reiterated that \u201cwe have required that the threshold misconduct prompting a domestic violence petition be neither \u2018too distant in time\u2019 nor \u2018non-specific.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 767 (quoting <em>Fillmore v. Fillmore, </em>147 N.H. 283, 286 (2001)). Although we agree with the defendant that the trial court should consider these factors, we disagree that they are the only factors that define \u201cgood cause\u201d within RSA 633:3-a, III-c. Furthermore, unlike in <em>Tosta, </em>where the misconduct occurred nine months prior and the plaintiff chose to stay with the defendant following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the misconduct, <em>see Tosta, </em>156 N.H. at 768, the plaintiff here has refrained from intentional contact with the defendant. The link between the abuse and the petition in <em>Tosta </em>was \u201cattenuated at best.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the defendant\u2019s past acts of violating the court order are the reason for the extension. Thus, any analogy to <em>Tosta </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We interpret \u201cgood cause\u201d in context by considering the statute as a whole. RSA 633:3-a, Ill-a provides that \u201c[a] person who has been the victim of stalking as defined in this section may seek relief by filing a civil petition,\u201d and \u201cthe court shall grant such relief as is necessary to bring about a cessation of stalking.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 173-B:5,1(a) (Supp. 2007) (providing procedures for protective orders). The initial objective is to ensure the stalking ends. In addressing any extension, RSA 633:3-a, III-c provides that the court may extend the protective order on a \u201cshowing [of] good cause ... to provide for the safety and well-being of the plaintiff.\u201d Thus, whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists directly relates to the safety and well-being of the plaintiff. For a showing of \u201cgood cause,\u201d the trial court must therefore assess whether the current conditions are such that there is still a concern for the safety and well-being of the plaintiff. To do so, the trial court must review the circumstances of the original stalking and any violation of the order. The trial court should also take into account any present and reasonable fear by the plaintiff. Where the trial court determines that the circumstances are such that, without a protective order, the plaintiff\u2019s safety and well-being would be in jeopardy, \u201cgood cause\u201d warrants an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">We next address whether the trial court\u2019s finding was based upon sufficient evidence. The defendant makes two claims: (1) as a matter of law there was insufficient evidence because he had not violated the protective order during the one-year extension; and (2) on these particular facts, his behavior for the previous fifteen months did not warrant an extension. We reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">On appeal, we review sufficiency of the evidence claims as a matter of law and uphold the findings and rulings of the trial court unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law. <em>Fisher, </em>155 N.H. at 190. We accord considerable weight to the trial court\u2019s judgments on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">As to the defendant\u2019s argument that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law, the defendant\u2019s compliance with the order over the previous fifteen months does not bar an extension. If we adopted the defendant\u2019s interpretation, any acts amounting to stalking, <em>see </em>RSA 633:3-a, II, regardless of how severe, would result in a protective order \u201cnot to exceed one year,\u201d RSA 633:3-a, III-c, provided the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>violate the order. This interpretation is flawed. If the legislature intended to allow for an extension only when there was a violation of the prior order, the legislature would have included that restriction in the statute. <em>See Fisher, </em>155 N.H. at 191. It did not. Thus, the defendant\u2019s compliance with or violation of the protective order is a factor for the trial court to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">As to the trial court\u2019s specific findings in this case, the trial court based its decision to extend the order primarily upon the defendant\u2019s June 5,2006 violation of the previous order. At the hearing, the trial court heard that in June 2006, while the original protective order was in place, the defendant \u201cdrove by [the plaintiffs house] a dozen times.\u201d The defendant \u201csubsequently was arrested and went to jail.\u201d At the hearing, the plaintiff stated, \u201cI do have affidavits from the witnesses in the neighborhood that saw him during that time period in the silver car.\u201d The plaintiff explained to the court, \u201cI am not feeling with Mr. Weiner\u2019s previous history that without the extension I can move forward. I\u2019m asking that I can be made to feel safe and not sorry.\u201d Based upon this evidence, the trial court could have reasonably found good cause to extend the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The trial court is in the best position to view the current circumstances, as well as the defendant\u2019s prior acts, and determine whether an extension is necessary for the safety and well-being of the plaintiff. Thus, the trial court has discretion to extend a protective order. <em>See </em>RSA 633:3-a, III-c. We caution, however, that this discretion is not without limitation. We regard this as a close case. Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that the defendant\u2019s actions in driving by the plaintiffs residence multiple times in violation of the protective order only fifteen months earlier, together with the plaintiffs reasonable fear, constituted good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Finally, we address the defendant\u2019s argument that the term \u201cgood cause\u201d is impermissibly vague and violates his procedural due process rights. The defendant does not specifically invoke a provision of the State Constitution in his brief, and therefore fails to preserve a state constitutional claim. <em>See State v. Hancock, </em>156 N.H. 301, 305 (2007). We therefore limit our analysis to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> \u201cA statute can be impermissibly vague for either of two independent reasons. First, if it fails to provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits. Second, if it authorizes or even encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Hill v. Colorado, </em>530 U.S. 703, 732 (2000). \u201cA party challenging a statute as void for vagueness bears a heavy burden of proof in view of the strong presumption favoring a statute\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d <em>State v. MacElman, </em>154 N.H. 304, 307 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he term \u2018Good Cause\u2019 should give a [defendant some articulable level of conduct which, if refrained from, would result in the ultimate end to the extensions ....\u201d He maintains that \u201cthere have been no incidents between the plaintiff and the defendant for a period of fifteen months, a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would neither believe, nor understand, \u2018Good Cause\u2019 could exist to the extent that an order could be extended for an additional period of five years.\u201d He further argues that it is unclear if the showing of good cause \u201ccan, or should, relate back to the original precipitating event that gave rise to the initial order, or if \u2018Good Cause\u2019 should only relate to events that took place from and after the last extension of the current order.\u201d Although he does not clarify whether his challenges to RSA 633:3-a, III-c are facial or as-applied, we interpret his arguments to be both.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">RSA 633:3-a, III-c sets forth what the trial court must consider in determining if \u201cgood cause\u201d exists. \u201cThe court shall review the order, and each renewal thereof and shall grant such relief as may be necessary to provide for the safety and well-being of the plaintiff.\u201d RSA 633:3-a, III-c. Such relief may include an extension of the order \u201cfor up to 5 years.\u201d RSA 633:3-a, III-c.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> Accordingly, we find that RSA 633:3-a provides notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that, in addressing whether there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for an extension, the court will take into account the original act and any subsequent acts. RSA 633:3-a further provides notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that if the court finds \u201cgood cause\u201d for the extension, the extension may be for five years. The defendant knew or should have known that if he participated in activity that constituted stalking or violated conditions of the original stalking order, the court could issue an extended protective order. As to the defendant\u2019s concern that the statute does not provide guidelines for a defendant to know the actions which will result in a five-year extension, we will not find a statute unconstitutionally vague simply because it does not precisely apprise an individual of the standards by which the decision will be made. <em>See Derry Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. v. Town of Londonderry, </em>121 N.H. 501, 505 (1981). Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s arguments that \u201cgood cause\u201d within RSA 633:3-a, III-c is vague either on its face or as applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Furthermore, we note that \u201c[cjourts have rejected arguments that [\u2018good cause\u2019] renders a statutory provision vague.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>964 So. 2d 911, 921 (La. 2007) (citing <em>Wray v. Folsom, </em>166 F. Supp. 390 (W.D. Ark. 1958)); <em>see Derry Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., </em>121 N.H. at 505 (\u201cThis court has long recognized that [\u2018good cause and sufficient reason\u2019] provide adequate criteria to guide a governmental body... in the exercise of its discretion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we uphold the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis, Galway and Hicks, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
