(SSGC), challenges a ruling of the Trial Court <em>(Conboy, </em>J.) sustaining the assignment of pre-liquidation legal fees to Class V Residual Classification, RSA 402-C:44, V (2006), for priority of payment under the Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act, RSA ch. 402-C (2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. SSGC rendered legal services between October 2002 and January 2003 to The Home Insurance Company (Home) in connection with certain asbestos-related litigation. Home subsequently entered receivership upon becoming insolvent. The superior court ordered Home liquidated in June 2003 and appointed the respondent Commissioner of Insurance as liquidator (liquidator) of its estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">SSGC filed a proof of claim for $74,784.89 for its pre-liquidation legal fees and expenses. The liquidator allowed the claim in full and designated it a Class V residual priority, finding that the \u201cservices provided were reasonable and necessary for the defense of Home in the referenced... litigation.\u201d \u201c[I]t is unlikely that there will be sufficient assets to make distributions to classes beyond Class II.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. 472, 477 (2006). SSGC appealed the Class V declaration, asserting that its claim is properly categorized as Class I Administration Costs, RSA 402-C:44,1. Upon review, the court-appointed referee <em>(Rogers, </em>R.) affirmed. SSGC moved to recommit. The trial court denied this motion and sustained the referee\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">On appeal, the parties dispute whether the pre-liquidation legal services expended in protecting Home\u2019s financial interests constitute costs of \u201cadministration\u201d as that term is used within RSA 402-C :44, I.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. </em>We are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. We first examine the language of the statute, and, where possible, ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. When a statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we need not look <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>beyond it for further indication of legislative intent, and we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><em>In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. at 479 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">RSA 402-C:44 states that \u201c[t]he order of distribution of claims from the [insolvent] insurer\u2019s estate shall be[:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">I. Administration Costs. The costs and expenses of administration, including but not limited to the following: the actual and necessary costs of preserving or recovering the assets of the insurer; compensation for all services rendered in the liquidation; any necessary filing fees; the fees and mileage payable to witnesses; and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">RSA 402-C:44,1.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">SSGC first argues that administration costs include legal services rendered prior to the liquidation because the text of RSA 402-C.-44, I, distinguishes between \u201cservices rendered in the liquidation\u201d and \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Second, it maintains that \u201c[i]f attorney\u2019s fees incurred pre-liquidation were not paid as administration costs, attorneys would have little incentive to do what SSGC did \u2014... to perform an enormous amount of work defending an insurer in a period of financial difficulties with the prospect of a liquidation looming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">We previously approached the issue presented in this appeal by assuming, without deciding, \u201cthat claims and rights to payment that arise pre-liquidation cannot constitute \u2018administration costs\u2019 under RSA 402-C:44,1.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. at 484. Commentators have noted that \u201c[attorneys\u2019 fees are not ordinarily entitled to a preference,\u201d 1 L. R. Russ &amp; T. F. SEGALLA, COUCH ON INSURANCE 3d \u00a7 6:12, at 6-29 (2005), and \u201cexpenses for professional services performed before the liquidation is initiated have no priority,\u201d 26 E. M. HOLMES, Appleman on Insurance 2d \u00a7 165.4, at 118 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">With these principles in mind, we begin our analysis with an abbreviated review of New Hampshire\u2019s statutory liquidation scheme. Once an \u201corder to liquidate,\u201d RSA 402-C:21, I, issues, \u201cthe rights and liabilities of . . . [the insolvent] insurer and ... its creditors, policyholders, shareholders, members and all other persons interested in its estate are fixed as of the date of filing of the petition for liquidation.\u201d RSA 402-C:21, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Once the liquidator is appointed and the liquidation is underway, the liquidator must \u201ctake possession of the assets of the insurer and . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>administer </em>them under the orders of the court.\u201d RSA 402-C:21,1 (emphasis added); <em>cf. </em>RSA 402-C:16, I (charging rehabilitator with same task in a rehabilitation of an insolvent insurer). This entails notifying creditors of the \u201cliquidation order,\u201d RSA 402-C.-26,1(a), and taking various actions such as \u201c[d]efray[ing] all expenses of taking possession of, conserving, conducting, liquidating, disposing of or otherwise dealing with the business and property of the insurer,\u201d RSA 402-C:25, IV (entitled \u201cPowers of Liquidator\u201d). The liquidator is ultimately required to \u201creduce the assets to a degree of liquidity that is consistent with the effective <em>execution </em>of the liquidation,\u201d RSA 402-C:29, II (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"> From these provisions we conclude that SSGC\u2019s pre-liquidation legal services do not fall within the ambit of administration costs, RSA 402-C:44,1. The statutory text draws a clear distinction in time separated by the order to liquidate. RSA 402-C:21, II references an \u201cestate,\u201d <em>cf. </em>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 541 (2004 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2008), the assets and liabilities of which are fixed pending action by the court-appointed liquidator. <em>See </em>RSA 402-C.-21, II; RUSS &amp; SEGALLA, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 6:8, at 6-18 to -19. \u201cAdminister\u201d (and by extension \u201cadministration\u201d) appears within the statutory scheme only in relation to authorized activities undertaken in furtherance of the liquidation. <em>See </em>RSA 402-C:21,1; <em>In the Matter of Liquidation of Home Ins. Co., </em>154 N.H. at 484-85; <em>cf. </em>RSA 402-C:16, I. Accordingly, general litigation services rendered and payable prior to the liquidation do not constitute administration costs. <em>See </em>RSA 402-C:44, I; <em>In re Coronet Ins. Co., </em>698 N.E.2d 598, 603 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998) (stating law firm was a general creditor of insolvent insurance company by virtue of pre-liquidation legal services).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">SSGC does not advance nor do we discern any principled way to distinguish between the fee for SSGC\u2019s pre-liquidation legal representation and the fees of other pre-liquidation professionals falling within the residual classification of RSA 402-C:44, V. <em>See Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, </em>491 U.S. 617, 628 (1989); <em>People ex rel Schacht v. Prestige Cas., </em>678 N.E.2d 785, 788 (Ill. App. Ct.), <em>appeal denied, </em>686 N.E.2d 1172 (Ill. 1997). The argument that \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d are separately listed in Class I loses sight of the fact that such expenses only gain Class I priority when they actually constitute \u201ccosts and expenses of <em>administration,\u201d </em>RSA 402-C:44, I (emphasis added). <em>See Roberts v. General Motors Corp., </em>138 N.H. 532, 538 (1994) (holding that phrase \u201c \u2018including but not limited to\u2019... limits the applicability of [the relevant statute] to those <em>types </em>of acts therein particularized\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Contrary to SSGC\u2019s assertion, our reading of \u201cadministration\u201d does not render \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d mere surplusage. The various types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>administration costs listed within RSA 402-C:44,1, are illustrative, <em>see </em>RSA 402-C:44, I (\u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d). As such, \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d exemplifies its textual predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
