(Lakeside), appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Abramson, </em>J.) affirming a boat use limit on Lakeside\u2019s Lake Sunapee dock, imposed by the Town of New London Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA). We hold that state law and regulations preempt the regulation imposed by the ZBA, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">The record supports the following relevant facts. Lakeside owns property in New London on Lake Sunapee\u2019s waterfront. The property includes a private dock which has been used by Lakeside\u2019s owners since at least the 1980s.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The respondent, Town of New London (Town), enacted a zoning ordinance in 1991 (the 1991 ordinance) designating Lakeside\u2019s lot within a \u201cShore Land Overlay District.\u201d <em>See </em>New London, N.H., Rev. Ordinances art. XVI (amended 2006). The ordinance prohibits the use of waterfront \u201ccommon areas\u201d for lake access except in compliance with its provisions and with planning board approval. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 D(3). A \u201ccommon area\u201d is defined as one \u201cused by a group of [three] or more unrelated persons or by an association, club or organization consisting of [three] or more members.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ordinance also states that \u201c[a]ny use of a common area ... for business or commercial purposes shall be subject to\u201d special exception. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 E(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">After receiving approval from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (DES), Lakeside completed substantial dock repairs in 1995. The Town maintains that Lakeside\u2019s use intensified after these renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>In 2002, the Town asserted that the use of Lakeside\u2019s dock by multiple, unrelated persons violated the 1991 ordinance. Lakeside maintained that such use predated the 1991 ordinance, and applied to the New London Board of Selectmen (Selectmen) for an exemption, asserting that eleven users secured fifteen boats prior to the 1991 ordinance. The Selectmen determined that no preexisting, nonconforming use existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\">Lakeside appealed and the ZBA ultimately reversed, concluding that at least four users predated the enactment of the 1991 ordinance. The Selectmen issued a ruling interpreting the ZBA\u2019s decision to permit three owners and one non-owner to use the dock. The abutters sought to enforce this ruling in 2004 but the Selectmen declined, citing the lack of clarity from the ZBA as to how to proceed. The abutters appealed to the ZBA for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">In 2007, the ZBA ruled that, because use by Lakeside\u2019s three owners predated the 1991 ordinance and because users typically invite guests, \u201cthere may be no more than six (6) users and six (6) boats at the dock at any one time.\u201d The ZBA intimated that renting dock space exceeded the scope of the \u201cpersonal\u201d use asserted by Lakeside\u2019s three owners. The superior court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On appeal, Lakeside raises several arguments, but we need address only the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cOur review of zoning board decisions is limited.\u201d <em>Guy v. Town of Temple, </em>157 N.H. 642, 649 (2008). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision unless the evidence does not support it or it is legally erroneous. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Lakeside argues that the Town\u2019s application of the 1991 ordinance is unlawful because the legislature has preempted local regulation of private dock use for boat storage on Lake Sunapee. Lakeside points to RSA chapter 482-A, which it characterizes as a comprehensive regulatory scheme governing the design and placement of docks over State-owned waters to achieve the State\u2019s goal of uniform regulation. Additionally, it argues that the State\u2019s permission to repair the dock in 1995 conflicts with local regulation restricting use of the renovated dock.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The Town argues that the State regulates only the construction of private docks, leaving to the Town the authority to regulate their use as extensions of the land. It maintains that dock users must cross the shorefront property to access the dock. It asserts its interest in the availability of parking and bathrooms in addition to its authority to promote environmental ends. It cites our holdings permitting municipalities to create more restrictive rules than the State. Finally, it argues that, by defining \u201cwetlands\u201d within RSA 674:55 (2008), the legislature intended to share concurrent regulatory authority over wetlands regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The trial court ruled that the six-user, six-boat restriction was within the ZBA\u2019s authority, citing RSA 47:17, VII (2003) and our decision in <em>Gray v. Seidel, </em>143 N.H. 327 (1999). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">We are the final arbiter of the meaning of a statute as expressed by the words of the statute itself. <em>Weare Land Use Assoc. v. Town of Weare, </em>153 N.H. 510, 511 (2006). \u201cThe state preemption issue is essentially one of statutory interpretation and construction \u2014 whether local authority to regulate under a zoning enabling act is preempted by state law or policy.\u201d <em>N. Country Envtl. Servs. v. Town of Bethlehem, </em>150 N.H. 606, 611 (2004) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cPreemption may be express or implied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cState law preempts local law . . . when there is an actual conflict between State and local regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA conflict exists when a municipal ordinance or regulation permits that which a State statute prohibits or vice versa.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, State law may preempt local regulation if such regulation \u201cfrustrates the statute\u2019s purpose,\u201d or \u201c[t]he very nature of the regulated subject matter . . . demand[s] exclusive state regulation to achieve the uniformity necessary to serve the state\u2019s purpose or interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> The State has delegated to municipalities authority to \u201cregulate and restrict\u201d certain land uses. RSA 674:16 (2008). An overlay district, such as that created by the 1991 ordinance, is one \u201cthat is superimposed over one or more zoning districts .. . and . . . imposes specified requirements ... in addition to those otherwise applicable for the underlying zone.\u201d 10 P. Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls \u00a7 53C.08[2][a], at 53C-444.90 (2008); <em>see, e.g., Brewster v. Town of Amherst, </em>144 N.H. 364, 365 (1999). \u2018Where the state has not preempted the area, a municipality may zone to protect its shorelines____\u201d 2 K. YOUNG, ANDERSON\u2019S AMERICAN Law OF Zoning \u00a7 9:13, at 144 (4th ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The parties and proceedings below assumed that a nonconforming personal use predated the 1991 ordinance. Thus, our inquiry is limited to whether the local attempt to restrict <em>personal </em>use of Lakeside\u2019s dock is permissible. <em>See Cherry v. Town of Hampton Falls, </em>150 N.H. 720, 725 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The use of lakes of ten or more acres, such as Lake Sunapee, is controlled by the State, which holds these \u201cvaluable resources,\u201d RSA 483-B:1, II (2003), in trust for public use. <em>See </em>RSA 271:20, I (1999); RSA 483-B:1, II (The State has the \u201cjurisdiction to control the use of the public waters and the adjacent shoreland for the greatest public benefit.\u201d). The State is the exclusive steward of public trust rights, a bundle of \u201call useful and lawful purposes,\u201d <em>State v. Sunapee Dam Co., </em>70 N.H. 458, 460 (1900), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>such as the common law right to boat recreationally, <em>see Hartford v. Gilmanton, </em>101 N.H. 424, 425-26 (1958). <em>See generally </em>6 WATERS AND WATER Rights 801-12 (Robert E. Beck ed., 1991, 2005 repl. vol.); Annotation, <em>Rights of Fishing, Boating, Bathing, or the Like in Inland Lakes, </em>57 A.L.R.2D 569, 577-78 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Numerous statutes regulate the right to boat. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 233-A (1993 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cAccess to Public Waters\u201d); RSA ch. 270 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cSupervision of Navigation; Registration of Boats and Motors; Common Carriers by Water\u201d); RSA ch. 270-A (1999) (\u201cUse of Houseboats\u201d); RSA ch. 270-B (1999) (\u201cAbandoned Boats\u201d); RSA ch. 270-D (1999 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cBoating and Water Safety on New Hampshire Public Waters\u201d); RSA ch. 485 (2001 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2008) (\u201cNew Hampshire Safe Drinking Water Act\u201d); RSA ch. 485-A (2001 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u2018Water Pollution and Waste Disposal\u201d); RSA ch. 487 (2001 &amp; Supp. 2008) (\u201cControl of Marine Pollution and Aquatic Growth\u201d). This broad statutory framework is intended to safeguard public waters \u201cin light of the fact that competing uses for the enjoyment of these waters, if not regulated for the benefit of all users, may diminish the value to be derived from them.\u201d RSA 270:1, II (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">As the steward of public waters, the State safeguards the right to use and enjoy public waters by avoiding piecemeal on-water regulation. <em>See Opinion of the Attorney General, </em>No. 0-87-067 (August 2, 1989) (public trust doctrine imposes limits upon municipality\u2019s use of public waters); <em>see also </em>RSA 483-B.T, II, IV (2001) (asserting State\u2019s \u201cinterest in protecting [the public waters of New Hampshire]\u201d and seeking to avoid \u201cuncoordinated, unplanned and piecemeal development along the state\u2019s shorelines\u201d); RSA 482-A:14-b, II (2001) (allowing municipality to petition superior court for enforcement as the remedy for violations of RSA chapter 482-A, and requiring notice of such petition to the attorney general and the DES commissioner, \u201cwho may take such steps as they deem necessary to ensure uniform statewide enforcement\u201d). Nowhere is the peremptory judgment of the legislature better expressed than in RSA chapter 483-A, creating the Lakes Management Protection Program (LMPP) and ordering the \u201cdevelop[ment of] detailed guidelines for coordinated lake management and shoreland protection plans together with recommendations for implementation.\u201d RSA 483-A-.7,1 (Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">In addition to enjoying the common law right to boat recreationally in Lake Sunapee, Lakeside appears to own the littoral rights accompanying its waterfront lot. \u201cLittoral rights are incidental property rights associated with ownership of lakeshore property.\u201d <em>Donaghey v. Croteau, </em>119 N.H. 320, 323 (1979). While the State holds title to the bed of the great ponds, <em>State v. Stafford Company, </em>99 N.H. 92, 97 (1954), \u201clittoral owners have rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>which are more extensive than those of the public generally.\u201d <em>Sundell v. Town of New London, </em>119 N.H. 839, 844 (1979) (quotation omitted). \u201cThese .. . include ... the right to use and occupy the waters adjacent to their shore for a variety of recreational purposes....\u201d <em>Id.; see also Stafford Company, </em>99 N.H. at 97. Such littoral rights, however, \u201care always subject to the paramount right of the State to control them reasonably in the interests of navigation, water storage and classification, health and other public purposes.\u201d <em>Stafford Company, </em>99 N.H. at 97; <em>see also </em>RSA 483-A:3 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Against this backdrop we first observe that, by expressly permitting Lakeside to repair its dock in 1995, the State has placed its imprimatur upon the use of Lakeside\u2019s dock for personal boating. Presumably, the Town received notice of its opportunity to participate in this process. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:3, I (Supp. 2008). Construction connotes use. Construction of docks on public waters is prohibited without a DES permit. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:3, 1(a) (Supp. 2008); RSA 483-B:9, 11(c) (Supp. 2008). RSA chapter 482-A prescribes detailed siting and construction requirements. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:3, XIII (2001). The DES administrative rules prescribe additional restrictions. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Env-Wt 402.01 (\u201cConfiguration\u201d), 402.02 (\u201cNavigation Space\u201d), 402.03 (\u201cDimensions\u201d), 402.04 (\u201cSetbacks\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Importantly, the administrative regulations prescribe frontage requirements per \u201cboating slip\u201d for lots with more than seventy-five feet of shoreline frontage in order</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">[t]o lessen congestion, improve public safety and <em>navigation, </em>protect neighboring property values, provide sufficient area for construction of facilities, provide adequate area for <em>boat maneuvering, </em>and protect health, safety and general welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Env-Wt 402.13 (emphases added); <em>cf. </em>N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Env-Wt 402.12 (applicable to lots with less than seventy-five feet of frontage).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">We find implicit within the permission to repair its dock the right to use the entire repaired dock for personal boating and boat docking \u2014 a clear exercise of its common law and littoral rights. <em>Cf. N. Country Envtl. Servs., </em>150 N.H. at 615 (holding that RSA chapter 149-M preempted local regulation because the regulatory regime sought to achieve broad goals, delegated power to DES and prescribed detailed \u201cdesign, construction, operation and closure\u201d standards for facilities); <em>Wasserman v. City of Lebanon, </em>124 N.H. 538, 543 (1984) (ordinance preventing reconstruction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>dam preempted by state law); 6 Rohan, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 36.02[l][b], at 36-27 (\u201cA municipality may not . . . prohibit a use expressly permitted by state statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The statutory scheme regulating the \u201cmooring\u201d of watercraft further reveals the State\u2019s expectation that private dock users will make use of the entire dock for personal boating and docking. <em>See </em>RSA 270:59-:72 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2008). The provisions of RSA chapter 270 are intended to \u201cmaintain[] jurisdiction to control the use of public waters for the greatest public benefit,\u201d RSA 270:60,1(a) (1999), by curtailing the \u201cundue proliferation of moorings,\u201d RSA 270:60, 1(c) (1999). The department of safety is charged -with issuing mooring permits on Lake Sunapee. <em>See </em>RSA 270:61, I (Supp. 2008); <em>see also </em>N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Saf-C 408.04. Individual mooring permit applications require the applicant to list the length and width of existing docking structures together with the number of boating slips and explain why they are insufficient to meet the user\u2019s need. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 408.05(a)(1), 408.06(b)(12)-(13), (15)(d)(1). These provisions impel private dock users to exhaust available watercraft storage before seeking a mooring permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Town argues that RSA 674:21, I(j) (2008) allows additional municipal regulation of Lakeside\u2019s private dock. We disagree. <em>See JTR Colebrook v. Town of Colebrook, </em>149 N.H. 767, 770-72 (2003); 3 A. H. Rathkopf et al., Rathkopf\u2019s The Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a7 48:16, at 48-37 to -38 (2008) (\u201cLocal control and regulation of navigable waters within a state often is preempted by state law.\u201d). <em>But cf. Cherry, </em>150 N.H. at 725 (declining to address validity of ordinance, but stating that DES permit does not prove compliance with ordinance and that \u201cmunicipality is not estopped from creating more restrictive rules for wetlands issues than those required by the Wetlands Board\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>Anderson v. Motorsports Holdings, </em>155 N.H. 491, 501 (2007) (quoting language from <em>Cherry </em>in rejecting due process argument). Although the ZBA has broad authority to act under RSA 674:33 (2008), see <em>Ouellette v. Town of Kingston, </em>157 N.H. 604, 610 (2008), it acted ultra vires by imposing the six-user, six-boat limit upon Lakeside.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Whether the ZBA acted with authority requires examination of whether the conditions on use within the 1991 ordinance apply to personal boating and boat docking. The six-user, six-boat limit was an attempt to define and/or reasonably restrict a grandfathered use \u2014 one asserted only after the Town maintained that Lakeside had violated the provisions of the 1991 ordinance restricting the number of non-related waterfront lot users. Although we have expressly permitted a ZBA to define and constrain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>nonconforming uses, <em>see Peabody v. Town of Windham, </em>142 N.H. 488, 492 (1997); <em>Vlahos Realty Co. v. Little Boar\u2019s Head District, </em>101 N.H. 460, 464 (1958), such authority derives from, and is coextensive with, the authority to enact the underlying ordinance because nonconforming use is the byproduct of regulation. <em>Cf. </em>RSA 674:33, 1(a) (zoning board has power to hear and decide appeals if error alleged \u201cin the enforcement of any zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to RSA 674:16\u201d); <em>Peabody, </em>142 N.H. at 493 (\u201c[T]he ultimate purpose of zoning regulations is to reduce nonconforming uses to conformity as quickly as possible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u201cIt is well established in this State that cities and towns have only those powers which are granted to them by the legislature.\u201d <em>Dugas v. Town of Conway, </em>125 N.H. 175, 181 (1984). The Town lacks specific legislative authority to infringe upon the right to boat. Such authority is necessary to enact on-water regulations within public waters. <em>See Opinion of the Attorney General, supra </em>(specific legislative authorization required if local municipality\u2019s action infringes upon public trust rights in bodies of water); 6 Waters and Water Rights, <em>supra </em>at 807 (legislative grant of authority required if municipality\u2019s action interferes with public trust rights); <em>Erbsland v. Vecchiolla, </em>313 N.Y.S.2d 576, 578 (App. Div.), <em>appeal denied, </em>27 N.Y.2d 485 (1970) (holding that municipality\u2019s zoning power did not extend into navigable waters because they \u201care within the sole jurisdiction and control of the State of New York\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"> The Town enacted the 1991 ordinance by invoking RSA 674:21, I(j), a grant of authority to develop \u201cinnovative land use controls\u201d to accomplish environmental objectives. <em>See </em>15 R LOUGHLIN, New HAMPSHIRE Practice, Land Use Planning and Zoning \u00a7 15.07, at 89-90 (Supp. 2007) (describing inception of innovative land use control legislation). By any measure, the boundaries of the Town\u2019s authority under RSA 674:21, I (2008) are not precisely drawn, <em>see </em>RSA 674:16, II (2008), but to say that the statute confers general authority incidental to shoreland protection to regulate personal boating and boat docking upon State-owned waters stretches its language beyond logic. <em>See Weare Land Use Assoc., </em>153 N.H. at 511 (\u2018We interpret a statute to lead to a reasonable result. ...\u201d); <em>JTR Colebrook, </em>149 N.H. at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Perhaps the clearest statutory grant of retained, local shoreland protection authority is found within the Comprehensive Shoreland Protection Act, RSA chapter 483-B, which sets the minimum standards for shoreland protection, <em>see </em>RSA 483-B :2 (2001), and permits municipalities to \u201cadopt land use control ordinances . . . which are more stringent.\u201d RSA 483-B:8,1 (2001); <em>see also N.H.

RSA chapter 483-B, however, lacks any provisions regulating the use of docks for boating or boat docking as part of shoreland protection. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 483-B (2001 &amp; Supp. 2008). \u201cHad the legislature intended to permit municipalities to enact [such regulations], it could have explicitly done so.\u201d <em>JTR Colebrook, </em>149 N.H. at 771-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The DES guidelines state that \u201conly the federal... and state ... governments] ha[ve] the authority to impose on-lake regulations\u201d upon State-owned public water and that dock and mooring regulations are considered \u201con-lake\u201d management.

Plans 53-54 (DES 2008), <em>available at </em>http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/publications/ wd/doeuments/nhdes-wd-08-8.pdf. Indeed, vesting localities with broad authority to enact piecemeal on-water regulation of recreational boating and boat docking would threaten the State\u2019s need and desire for uniform regulation, which is expressly manifested within the broader statutory scheme governing regulation of public waters. \u201cThe legislature will not be presumed to pass an act... nullifying, to an appreciable extent, the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Weare Land Use Assoc., </em>153 N.H. at 511-12; <em>Erbsland, </em>313 N.Y.S.2d at 578 (allowing municipality to regulate navigable waters owned by the state \u201cwould have the effect of nullifying rights which the State has the authority to grant\u201d); 6 ROHAN, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 36.02[1][a], at 36-25 (\u201c[Municipal zoning ordinances cannot frustrate the purpose or implementation of a general or special law enacted by the state legislature.\u201d); 3 Rathkopf, <em>supra </em>at 48-37 (\u201c[L]ocal regulation of wharves . . . may not be exercised contrary to state statutory provisions or policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">RSA 47:17, VII, relied upon by the trial court in rejecting Lakeside\u2019s preemption argument, grants towns only the authority to regulate <em>public </em>docks. <em>See </em>RSA 47:17, VII; <em>Gray, </em>143 N.H. at 330. Consistent with our well-established rules of statutory interpretation, we do not find within RSA 47:17, VII, implied local authority to regulate the use of private docks for personal boating or boat docking on public waters. <em>St. Joseph Hosp. of Nashua v. Rizzo, </em>141 N.H. 9, 11-12 (1996) (\u201cNormally the expression of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Contrary to the ZBA\u2019s assertion, the statutory definition of \u201cwetlands,\u201d found within the provisions authorizing local land use regulation, does not, by itself, suggest local authority to regulate personal boating and boat docking on waters held in trust for the public. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:2, X (Supp. 2008) (\u201c \u2018Wetlands\u2019 means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>support, and that under normal conditions does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions\u201d). The legislature could have defined \u201cwetlands\u201d either to facilitate wetland setbacks or for local wetland regulation outside the sphere of any exclusive State wetland regulation. <em>See Blagbrough Family Realty Trust v.
