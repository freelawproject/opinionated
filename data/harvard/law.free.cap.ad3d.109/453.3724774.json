CPLR 3216 permits a court to dismiss an action for failure to prosecute only after the court or the defendant has served the plaintiff with a written demand requiring the plaintiff to resume prosecution of the action and to serve and file a note of issue within 90 days after receipt of the demand, and also stating that the failure to comply with the demand will serve as the basis for a motion to dismiss the action. Here, the Supreme Court did not possess the power to dismiss this pre-note of issue action on the ground of a general lack of prosecution since the plaintiff had not received a 90-day demand pursuant to CPLR 3216 (b) requiring the plaintiff to serve and file a note of issue (see <em>Chase v Scavuzzo, </em>87 NY2d 228, 233 [1995]; <em>Airmont Homes v Town of Ramapo, </em>69 NY2d 901, 902 [1987]; <em>Cohn v Borchard Affiliations, </em>25 NY2d 237, 246 [1969]; <em>Arroyo v Board of Educ. of City of N.Y., </em>110 AD3d 17 [2013]; <em>Docteur v Interfaith Med. Ctr., </em>90 AD3d 814, 815 [2011]; <em>Maspeth Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn, v Simon-Erdan, </em>67 AD3d 750, 751 [2009]; <em>Dominique v Flushing Hosp. Med. Ctr., </em>22 AD3d 789 [2005]). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to prosecute should have been denied. Dillon, J.P, Balkin, Chambers and Austin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
