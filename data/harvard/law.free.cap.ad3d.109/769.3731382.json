The petition did not comply with the requirements of CPLR 3014 that pleadings \u201cconsist of plain and concise statements in consecutively numbered paragraphs,\u201d with each paragraph containing, \u201cas far as practicable, a single allegation,\u201d and the appellant could not cure the defective pleading within the time limit for commencing an invalidation proceeding (see Election Law \u00a7 16-102 [2]). Additionally, the appellant lacked standing to challenge the designating petitions with respect to all of the challenged candidates except the two candidates from the same election district in which the appellant was enrolled to vote (see Election Law \u00a7 6-154 [2]; <em>Lucariello v Niebel, </em>72 NY2d 927, 928 [1988]; <em>Matter of Hintz v Board of Elections of City of N.Y., </em>218 AD2d 773, 773 [1995]; <em>Matter of Cantatore v Sunderland, </em>196 AD2d 606, 607 [1993]).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Supreme Court properly granted that branch of the motion of the respondent Nassau County Board of Elections which was, in effect, to dismiss, for failure to state a cause of action, so much of the petition as sought relief pursuant to CPLR article 78, in effect, in the nature of prohibition to prohibit it from taking certain actions, and dismissed that portion of the proceeding <em>(see Matter of Podolsky v Bloomberg, </em>37 AD3d 354 [2007]).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">The appellant\u2019s remaining contentions have been rendered academic in light of our determination.
