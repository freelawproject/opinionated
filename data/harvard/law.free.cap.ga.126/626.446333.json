Before Judge Hodges. City court of Macon. September 18, 1905.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-8\">Carger sued the street-railway company for damages on account of personal injuries alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the motorman of a street-car in' unnecessarily ringing a bell and in not stopping the car, and in thus frightening a pair of mules which the plaintiff was driving. The manner in which the injury occurred, as alleged in the petition and stated in the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, was in brief as follows: The mules were attached to a wagon loaded with wood, and had just turned into the street on which the car was approaching, when the plaintiff saw the car. The situation of the track was such that he could not safely pass the car without crossing the track to the other side of the street, and at the time he saw the ear it was too late to do this. His mules began to show signs of fright, and he stopped them and \u201cwaved the motorman down,\u201d and told him to stop the car, so that the wagon could pass. The motorman observed the fright of the mules, but, instead of stopping the car, he rang his foot-bell, and continued the ringing while he approached, the team. This increased the fright of the animals and caused them to back the wagon into a shallow ditch, on the side of the street, overturning the wagon and the wood on the plaintiff and causing the injuries complained of. One of the mules was blind and \u201cscary,\u201d and had at other times been frightened by street-cars. The backing was begun by the other mul\u00e9.. He started to \u201ccut up,\u201d and that started the blind mule. The plaintiff \u201ccould not coach the mules and keep them from getting scared when the motorman rang the bell.\u201d If the car had stopped when he held up his hand to the motorman, he \u201ccould have coached them on by talking to them.\u201d The car was about twenty-five steps from him when he gave the signal to stop. The motorman then had the car under control, and could have stopped it, but he ran the car about fifty steps past the wagon before stopping. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved that a nonsuit be granted, \u201con the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the plaintiff had shown no cause of action, and on the ground that the only proximate cause of the injury disclosed by the testimony was the vice of the animal.\u201d The motion was granted, and the plaintiff excepted. He died, and Ms administrator was made plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b679-5\"><em>B.

Under those conditions was it not negligence to continue his approach, sounding the gong? These were questions for the jury. See, in this connection, Oates <em>v. </em>Metropolitan Street Railway Company, 168 Mo. 535. The -evidence was not such as would have authorized the co.urt to hold that the vieiousness of the animals was the proximate cause of the injury. That question was .one also for the jury. -It was erroneous to grant a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Ayz\">\n<em>All the Justices concur.</em>\n</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
