(\u201cStoner\u201d), a supplier. Stoner subsequently filed an answer. Appellants, however, moved for default judgment against appellee since no answer or extension of time to answer was filed by appellee within the required time. The trial court granted default judgment on April 19, 1995. In addition to sustaining appellants\u2019 motion for default judgment, the trial court, in its entry, scheduled a hearing for the determination of damages. On August 10, 1995, appellee filed a motion to set aside the default judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). In its judgment entry of January 8, 1996, the trial court set aside the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Although the issue is not raised by the parties, we <em>sua sponte </em>address whether this appeal was taken from a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Pursuant to the holding in <em>Wolford v. Newark City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 218, 596 N.E.2d 1085, we conclude that there was no final, appealable order. In <em>Wolford, </em>appellant obtained a default judgment; however, the trial court \u201ccontinued the matter for a determination of damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 596 N.E.2d at 1085. Appellee then filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). The trial court granted the motion and appellant appealed. The reviewing court concluded that a default judgment which continued the matter to determine damages failed to constitute a final, appealable order. Thus, any judgment vacating that order was also not a final, appealable order. See, also, <em>Pinson v. Triplett </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App.3d 46, 9 OBR 49, 458 N.E.2d 461. Furthermore, although the court noted as persuasive appellant\u2019s argument that because \u201cthe original default judgment was not a final judgment, Civ.R. 60(B) relief was inappropriate,\u201d it dismissed the cause for want of appellate jurisdiction. <em>Wolford v. Newark City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., </em>73 Ohio App.3d at 220, 596 N.E.2d at 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>In the instant case, the court also continued the matter for damages. The default judgment, therefore, fails to constitute a final, appealable order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In turn, the judgment entry vacating the default judgment is not a final, appealable order. Finally, we note, as the court did in <em>Wolford, </em>that Civ.R. 60(B) grants relief \u201cfrom a final judgment.\u201d Absent a final, appealable order, however, this court lacks jurisdiction, and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-6\">Evans and Shaw, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-15\">. Even if the amount of damages were included in this judgment entry, the entry would not be final and appealable unless it met the requirements of Civ.R. 54(B), as there is more than one defendant in the present case. See <em>Shelby Ins. Group v. Gumm </em>(Dec. 27, 1995), Ross App. No. 95CA2102, unreported, 1995 WL 765162 (finding that an entry which granted a default judgment to one of three plaintiffs and failed to include the language \"there is no just reason for delay\u201d pursuant to Civ.R. 54[B] was not a final, appealable order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
