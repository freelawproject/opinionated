During that time, Thomas-Schafer was married to John Thomas, but that marriage ended in divorce in May 1990. Thomas-Schafer claims that after that date she was involved in and committed to a common-law marriage with Schafer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She points out that the two held themselves out to the community as husband and wife, and that when Schafer was incarcerated, she was permitted, as his wife, to visit him at the penitentiary. After hearing the evidence, the referee agreed, stating in his report that there was \u201ca valid and existing marriage in effect at the time [the] Defendants [Schafer and Jennings] [allegedly] married * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">In September 1994 Schafer allegedly married Jennings. Two months later, Thomas-Schafer, claiming that she was still legally married to Schafer, filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>complaint for annulment of Schafer\u2019s marriage to Jennings. After hearing the evidence, the referee recommended that the marriage between Schafer and Jennings be annulled. The trial court, however, in dismissing the complaint, ruled that \u201c[a]s the spouse of defendant, Duane Schafer, plaintiff, Betty J. Thomas-Schafer, was not a party to the alleged marriage.\u201d Schafer-Thomas now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">R.C. 3105.31 set forth the grounds for annulment and provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201cA marriage may be annulled for any of the following causes existing at the time of the marriage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201c(B) That the former husband or wife of either party was living and the marriage with such former husband or wife was then and still is in force[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">R.C. 3105.32(B) specifies the parties who may commence an action for annulment: \u201cFor the cause mentioned in division (B) of section 3105.31 of the Revised Code, by either party during the life of the other or by such former husband or wife[J\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">There can be no doubt that Thomas-Schafer had the requisite standing to bring the annulment action if her alleged marriage to Schafer was valid at the time Schafer entered into a second marriage with Jennings. While the trial court, in its entry, referred to Thomas-Schafer as the \u201cspouse\u201d of Schafer, it did not make an affirmative finding, as did the referee, that the two were parties to a valid and existing marriage at the time Schafer purportedly married Jennings. Instead, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>ruled that Thomas-Schafer, as the \u201cformer\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> spouse did not have standing because she was not a party to the marriage sought to be annulled. This ruling is in direct contravention of the statute, and of common sense. Who might have better standing to object to a spouse\u2019s bigamous marriage than the present spouse?</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions for the trial court to determine whether SchaferThomas and Schafer were legally married at the time Schafer allegedly married Jennings. If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, then SchaferThomas has a right to bring an action under R.C. /3105.32(B) to have the marriage between Schafer and Jennings annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b815-12\">Marianna Brown Bettman, P.J., and Sundermann, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-13\">.
