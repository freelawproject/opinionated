Case No. 14579 is an appeal by Gary Tremaine from an order denying his motion to reduce his spousal support obligation. Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>No. 15589 is an appeal by Gary Tremaine from an order sentencing him to jail for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Gary Tremaine and Elizabeth Tremaine, now Elizabeth Brothers, each sought a decree of divorce. In a judgment filed on September 14, 1992, the trial court granted both petitions. Gary Tremaine was ordered to pay spousal support in a monthly amount for three years. In an amended entry and decision filed December 1, 1992, the court set the support amount at $667 per month, or $8,004 per year stating, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">\u201cThis case is before the court upon defendant\u2019s motion for clarification filed October 30, 1992. Defendant correctly points out that the court\u2019s September 14, 1992 decision overstated defendant\u2019s net disposable income in determining spousal support. The net profit realized by defendant from his business in 1991 was $30,100. In 1990 that figure was $35,300. And in 1989 that figure $18,200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\u201cUsing his most recent figures from 1991, which have a higher degree of relevance because of their recent vintage and the fact that defendant filed a separate return, defendant was liable for about $8,000.00 in federal taxes. He is thus left with about $22,000 in net disposable income from which to cover his stated annual living expenses of $12,000. Plaintiff meanwhile can be expected to earn about $6,000, leaving her $10,000 short of her stated needs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">\u201cThe court notes that plaintiffs living expenses are about one third higher than defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is not the court\u2019s intention to use spousal support in this case to create for plaintiff a higher living standard than that enjoyed by the defendant. Rather, it is the court\u2019s intention to divide between the parties their combined net disposable income, or $28,000. An award of $8,000 annually achieves this goal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Gary Tremaine was also ordered to pay his former wife $400 he owed for unpaid temporary support and $150 per month on an obligation of $4,893 for her interest in the marital residence, which was awarded to him. Gary Tremaine was also ordered to maintain life insurance in the amount of $27,000 to assure payment of these obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">On June 9, 1993, six months after the decree, Gary moved to reduce his monthly spousal support obligation. Three months after that, on October 7, 1993, Elizabeth filed charges in contempt for Gary\u2019s failure to comply with the support and property division orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Both motions were referred to a magistrate for hearing. On February 7, 1994, the trial court provisionally adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that (1) Gary\u2019s motion be overruled, and (2) that Elizabeth\u2019s charges be sustained and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>that Gary be sentenced to serve one hundred twenty days in jail, which he could avoid by complying with the court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Gary filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, which were overruled on April 25, 1994. After a stay of proceedings for more than a year resulting from Gary\u2019s petition in bankruptcy, on November 16, 1995 the court entered a sentence on the contempt it had found. Gary was sentenced to serve sixty days for criminal contempt. He appeals from that order, which was stayed by the trial court pending appeal after seven days had been served.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Gary Tremaine has filed two briefs in these proceedings. The first was filed in case No. 14579 on July 19, 1994. The second was filed in case Nos. 14579 and 15589 on January 22, 1996. The assignments of error set out in them are overlapping and repetitious. For purposes of clarity, they are reformed and restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when it overruled the appellant\u2019s motion to reduce spousal support.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Award of spousal support and modification of award orders are governed by R.C. 3105.18. Subdivision (E) of that section denies the court jurisdiction to modify absent a change of circumstances. Subdivision (F) provides that a change of circumstances includes any increase or decrease in a party\u2019s wages, salary or living expenses. However, the change must be one that is substantial and one not contemplated at the time of the prior order. <em>Leighner v. Leighner </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 214, 515 N.E.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">The burden of showing that modification of spousal support is warranted is on the party who seeks it. <em>Heltzel v. Heltzel </em>(Nov. 9, 1990), Trumbull App. No. 89-T-4279, unreported, 1990 WL 174152. In making its determination the court must consider all the relevant factors in R.C. 3105.18(B), and not consider any one in isolation. <em>Kaechele v. Kaechele </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St.3d 93, 518 N.E.2d 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">The trial courts are granted broad discretion concerning awards of spousal support. Their orders will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. \u201c \u2018The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">In support of his motion to modify Gary showed that Elizabeth\u2019s 1993 annual income was $13,274, substantially more than the $6,000 income she had in the year prior at the time of the decree. That change was substantial enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>warrant modification pursuant to R.C. 3105.18(F). However, whether modification is warranted depends on all the facts and circumstances relevant to the nature and amount of support per R.C. 3105.18(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">There was evidence that Elizabeth\u2019s monthly living expenses had increased by $500 since the decree, which would largely consume the increase in her income. The magistrate did not specifically address that issue in his report and recommendation, however, perhaps because Gary Tremaine relied primarily on a claim that his own income had fallen drastically since the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Gary Tremaine owns and operates an auto repair business. It is undisputed that he suffers from heart problems. Gary testified that his health condition had worsened since the divorce, requiring him to engage a mechanic to perform work he had done in the business. Gary testified that the mechanic was paid $400 per week. That cost, along with an increase in the cost of auto parts, had caused his annual net income to decline to $3,000, according to Gary.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The magistrate rejected Gary Tremaine\u2019s argument, finding that the evidence he offered to support his reduced income claim is \u201csimply not believable.\u201d The magistrate concluded that Gary\u2019s annual income had probably increased from $22,000 to $30,000, but recommended no increase in spousal support because none had been requested. The magistrate recommended that Gary\u2019s motion be denied. The trial court adopted that recommendation, stating: \u201cBluntly put, the court finds no credibility in any of the defendant\u2019s testimony or evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are primarily for the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 79, 24 O.O.3d 150, 434 N.E.2d 1356. In this instance we can find nothing which causes us to disagree with the trial court\u2019s rejection of the credibility of Gary Tremaine and the weight to be accorded the evidence he offered. That evidence was inconclusive and incomplete. Furthermore, the magistrate\u2019s finding that Gary had concealed and diverted income to his son damages his credibility seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Even without a reduction in Gary Tremaine\u2019s income, the increase in Elizabeth\u2019s income could support a reduction in spousal support. The requirement that Gary pay $8,000 to Elizabeth in order to equalize their incomes is questionable. R.C. 3105.18 does not require a spousal support award that provides the parties with an equal standard of living. <em>Kaechele v. Kaechele, supra. </em>There was no objection to the amount of support ordered in relation to that purpose at the time of the decree, however, and none is argued now.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">This court has held that a spousal support award must balance the obligee\u2019s need for support against the obligor\u2019s ability to pay. <em>Fletcher v. Fletcher </em>(June 28, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 14726, unreported, 1995 WL 386818. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>increase of Gary Tremaine\u2019s annual income from $22,000 to $30,000 increased his ability to pay, but the increase in Elizabeth\u2019s annual income from $6,000 to $13,274 reduced her need for support, though it did not fully meet her annual living expenses of $16,000. Nevertheless, some modification of the court\u2019s prior order was warranted on this record, and the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Gary Tremaine\u2019s motion to modify.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">On remand, the trial court may consider whether Elizabeth\u2019s annual living expenses have increased, as she claimed and, if they have, whether the increase is such that support should be continued at or near the amount ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it imposed a sentence of incarceration for the appellant\u2019s failure to comply with its spousal support order when the court found that he was unable to comply with its order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">On February 7, 1994, the trial court provisionally adopted the report and recommendation of the magistrate, which found Gary Tremaine in contempt for failing to make <em>any </em>payments to his former wife in satisfaction of the spousal support and property division provisions of the divorce decree entered in 1992. The February 7, 1994 order sentenced Gary to a total of one hundred twenty days\u2019 incarceration, which was suspended on condition that he pay the arrearages due, open a bank account from which his support payments could be paid, and maintain life insurance for his former wife\u2019s benefit, as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Gary\u2019s objections to the February 7, 1994 provisional order were overruled on April 25, 1994. He subsequently filed his petition for bankruptcy. After those proceedings were concluded the court set a hearing for imposition of sentence. A hearing was ultimately held, after several continuances. At the conclusion of that hearing the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-11\">\u201cI will concede that he\u2019s proved, to my satisfaction, he has not had the ability to pay the full amount of the court\u2019s order as were issued on April 25, 1994. He certainly has not proved that he has had no ability to pay anything whatsoever which is what he has paid since April of 1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-12\">\u201cAnd, you know, he\u2019s also had the opportunity to maneuver his finances so that his children pay his life insurance policy, but he doesn\u2019t follow the Court\u2019s orders in keeping [Elizabeth] as beneficiary. And on top of all that, in top of all the support issues, he\u2019s living in her house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-13\">\u201cShe owns [a] $5,000 interest in that house. She\u2019s paying support to him, at this point in time, by subsidizing his living arrangements by \u2014 by him not paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>her equity in his real estate. He was awarded the real estate based on him paying her her equity, which was $10,000. The only money she\u2019s ever gotten out of this case was what she took at the time of the breakup, about $4,500 bucks, or she\u2019s be that much further along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cMR. ANZMAN: That doesn\u2019t consider the tax lien, part of her tax liens on that house, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: In effect, she\u2019s subsidizing his living expenses, and I just think the whole situation is unjustifiable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u201cIf he came in here having made $10.00 a week payments, I would have some justification of her not sending him to jail. I don\u2019t find that justification. He can\u2019t sit there and do 'absolutely nothing in compliance with the Court\u2019s orders and expect me not to send him to jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The court sentenced Gary to serve a term of one hundred twenty\" days in jail, suspending sixty days if he paid all court costs and fines within ninety days. Gary was taken directly to jail on November 16, 1995. He was released on November 22, 1995, pending appeal, after posting a $25,000 bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The court\u2019s finding that Gary could not pay the full amount ordered does not excuse his failure to pay any part of that amount when, as the court found, he had the resources to do so. His failure to pay any of the monies the court had ordered him to pay almost three years before cannot be justified on this record. Coupled with Gary\u2019s failure to maintain a bank account and life insurance, as ordered, and his efforts to conceal his assets, all to the detriment of his former wife, his acts amount to contempt, which the court was authorized to punish as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">The trial court\u2019s order denying appellant Gary L. Tremaine\u2019s motion to modify spousal support is reversed, and that matter will be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">The trial court\u2019s order sentencing appellant Gary L. Tremaine to a term of incarceration for contempt of the court\u2019s orders will be affirmed. The trial court\u2019s incarceration order filed November 16, 1995 is subject to immediate execution. We note that in this instance the trial court was not authorized to suspend execution of that sentence. Pursuant to R.C. 2705.09, any stay of execution of a sentence imposed in contempt proceedings during the pendency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>an appeal must be ordered by the appellate court. <em>Pugh v.
