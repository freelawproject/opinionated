The trial court based its decision on the grounds of <em>res judicata </em>from the parties\u2019 divorce of the preceding year.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-11\">On June 23, 1995, appellant filed his complaint alleging that appellee, his ex-wife, during a period while the parties were still married, forged his name on his pension checks and wrongly converted the sum of $6,307.89. Prior to his marriage to appellee, appellant was receiving military pension checks from the Air Force. It was alleged that from March 1994 through October 1994, the appellee forged appellant\u2019s name on the pension checks and cashed them for her use.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">Appellee\u2019s complaint for divorce was filed on September 30, 1994. Appellant filed a counterclaim on October 3, 1994. As part of the final judgment of divorce entered on December 12,1994, the trial court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-13\">\u201cFurthermore, defendant shall be entitled to retain as his own his Air Force Retirement Benefits, free and clear of any claim of wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">Appellant\u2019s counterclaim made no issue as to the converted funds and the divorce decree does not address them. From the grant of summary judgment dismissing the complaint in fraud and conversion, appellant brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">The sole assignment of error presented is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>\u201cThe trial court abused its discretion and erred to the prejudice of the appellant when it granted summary judgment to the appellee based on the doctrine of <em>res judicata. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">At issue is whether the claim for fraud and conversion should have been addressed in the domestic relations proceeding. Appellant cites <em>Koepke v. Koepke </em>(1989), 52 Ohio App.3d 47, 556 N.E.2d 1198, for the proposition that the fraud and conversion claims are separate matters from the divorce proceeding. In <em>Koepke, </em>the court held in the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-6\">\u201cIntentional tort claims should be considered independently from divorce claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">\u201cClearly, it is inconsistent to c\u00f3mbine intentional tort claims with divorce actions since a party to a divorce cannot recover damages.\u201d 52 Ohio App.3d at 48, 556 N.E.2d at 1199.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\"><em>Koepke </em>involved the intentional infliction of emotional distress by a wife\u2019s revelation that the parties\u2019 one-year-old child was not issue of their marriage. <em>Koepke </em>is distinguishable both in the nature of the claim and because in the present case appellant filed a counterclaim wherein the conversion issue could have been addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the funds from the wrongly cashed checks were not marital property and thus not subject to the divorce action is misplaced. R.C. 3105.171(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">\u201cIn divorce proceedings, <em>the court shall * </em>* * determine what constitutes marital property and what constitutes separate property.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">The appellant was receiving the monthly benefit while he was married and it was to continue after the marriage ended in divorce. As set out in the agreed judgment entry of divorce, the parties fully settled all issues between them. This settlement included appellant\u2019s military pension that he was to retain as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">R.C. 3105.171(E)(3) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-14\">\u201cIf a spouse has engaged in financial misconduct, including, but not limited to, the dissipation, destruction, concealment, or fraudulent disposition of assets, the court may compensate the offended spouse with a distributive award or with a greater award of marital property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">Appellant chose not to claim that conversion of the pension cheek was \u201cfinancial misconduct\u201d during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>The issue of proceeds from the pension check and the wrongful conversion thereof is clearly a matter which could have and should have been addressed in the divorce proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">\u201cUnder Ohio law, the doctrine of res judicata is that an existing, final judgment or decree, rendered upon the merits and without fraud or collusion, by a court of competent jurisdiction, is conclusive of rights, questions, and facts in issue, as to the parties or their privies, in all other actions in the same or any other judicial tribunal of concurrent, jurisdiction.\u201d 63 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1985) 178-179, Judgments, Section 400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Ohio Supreme Court expressed in <em>Hicks v. DeLa Cruz </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 71, 74, 6 O.O.3d 274, 276, 369 N.E.2d 776, 777-778:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cThe modern view of <em>res judicata </em>embraces the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which basically states that if an issue of fact or law actually is litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, such determination being essential to that judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim. A party precluded under this principle from relitigating an issue with an opposing party likewise is precluded from doing so with another person unless he lacked full and fan-opportunity to litigate that issue in the first action, or unless other circumstances justify according him an opportunity to relitigate that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Under the facts of this case, the property interest of the parties relative to the proceeds of the pension checks could have and should have been resolved in the domestic proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Kerns v. Schmidt </em>(1994), 94 Ohio App.3d 601, 641 N.E.2d 280, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-10\">\u201cAlthough domestic relations court did not resolve issue of former husband\u2019s consent to wife\u2019s artificial insemination, he was collaterally estopped by divorce decree which imposed obligation to support child from relitigating parentage issue in subsequent fraud claim against former wife.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">As in <em>Kerns, </em>appellant is estopped from litigating the property settlement issue because it was a matter that could have been addressed in the counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Under Civ.R. 13(A):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">\u201cA pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-14\">j]&lt; \u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The claims in the present case should have been raised by compulsory counterclaim in the parties\u2019 previous divorce action. Appellant is collaterally estopped from litigating such claims in a separate proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The judgment of the trial court is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b682-7\">O\u2019Neill, P.J., and Cox, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
