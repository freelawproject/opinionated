These claims generally relate to alleged incidents at Whirlpool involving coworkers and Rowlinson and Mouser, supervisors of appellant, which occurred over an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">On June 8, 1994, appellees filed an answer and affirmative defenses. Thereafter, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on August 31, 1995. In support of the motion, appellees included answers to appellees\u2019 first set of interrogatories and various excerpts of appellant\u2019s deposition. Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition, including his own affidavit, to the summary judgment motion on October 4, 1995. Subsequently, appellees filed a reply memorandum. In its judgment entry of November 7, 1995, the trial court granted appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion. In doing so, the trial court found that no weight should be given to the contradictory statements in appellant\u2019s affidavit (as compared to his earlier deposition testimony). It is from this judgment entry that appellant raises two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Assignment of Error No. 1</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred by finding no genuine issues as to any material fact remaining to be litigated, in that it failed and refused to consider the affidavit of appellant in determining the motion for summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Appellant maintains that his affidavit is admissible. While appellant acknowledges in his brief that the facts in his affidavit \u201cwere in some cases different from those stated in his deposition testimony,\u201d he also asserts that there is no indication of bad faith or sham. Furthermore, appellant contends that his affidavit supplemented the deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\"> In <em>Turner v. Turner </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 337, 341-342, 617 N.E.2d 1123, 1127, the Ohio Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-10\">\u201c[W]hen a litigant\u2019s affidavit in support of his or her motion for summary judgment is inconsistent with his or her earlier deposition testimony, summary judgment in that party\u2019s favor is improper because there exists a question of credibility which can be resolved only by the trier of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>This court has also found error where a trial court gave no consideration to a party\u2019s affidavit filed with her memorandum opposing summary judgment even though the affidavit and an earlier deposition were contradictory. <em>Grant v. Marion </em>(Dec. 28, 1995), Marion App. No. 9-95-37, unreported, 1995 WL 771385. In particular, we found that such conflicting statements \u201cgo to the credibility of the witness, and not the admissibility of such documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, absent a trial court\u2019s determination of bad faith concerning an affidavit, the affidavit must be construed as truthful. <em>Aglinsky v. Cleveland Builders Supply Co. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 810, 816, 589 N.E.2d 1365, 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Upon our review, we initially note that the trial court made no specific finding of bad faith regarding the submission of the affidavit. Moreover, even if conflicts exist between the two documents, based upon our decision in <em>Grant, </em>the trial court erred in failing to consider appellant\u2019s affidavit in its determination of the summary judgment motion. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, therefore, is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Assignment of Error No. 2</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in determining that summary judgment should be afforded as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">Within this assignment of error, appellant asserts that there are genuine issues of'material fact regarding the causes of action raised in the complaint and, in turn, contends that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. We will analyze each claim accordingly. First, however, we set forth the standard for granting a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Civ.R. 56(C) provides that a motion for summary judgment is appropriate when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-10\">\u201c(1) [n]o genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Although the initial burden rests on the moving party, the nonmoving party \u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but * * * must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Civ.R. 56(E). However, since a summary judgment is a shortcut resulting in termination of litigation, it must be granted carefully and all reservations must be resolved against the moving party. <em>Davis v. Loopco Industries, Inc. </em>(1993), 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Ohio St.3d 64, 66, 609 N.E.2d 144, 145. Thus, \u201c[e]ven the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in the affidavits and depositions must be construed in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 341, 617 N.E.2d at 1127.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">A. Assault and Battery</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The record shows that appellant played jokes on coworkers, including Rowlinson and Mouser, such as putting red tags on their backs and telling workers they could go home early. In contrast, appellant\u2019s affidavit states that he did not engage in jokes with supervisors. On several occasions in the late 1980s, apparently as a result of these jokes, Rowlinson and/or Mouser called appellant into a line office. In his affidavit, appellant stated, \u201cI understood that I had to go into the office on those occasions, under the threat of termination.\u201d He further indicated that once in the office, the two supervisors poked and tickled him so that he would \u201cjump\u201d and \u201cflop.\u201d Appellant claimed that these actions continued despite his protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In a 1993 incident in a line office, appellant alleges that the supervisors locked the door to the office, restrained him by holding his wrists, and proceeded to tickle and poke him in the stomach and chest areas. In his deposition, appellant stated that there was a \u201cgood possibility\u201d that he was again called into the office for playing a joke. On this occasion, appellant maintained in his affidavit, \u201cAt the time they initially restrained me, I said, \u2018no, no, don\u2019t do this,\u2019 but they persisted, poking me so that I would jump and \u2018flop.\u2019 I continued to protest.\u201d Again, appellant averred that he went into the office due to the fear of facing discipline and/or termination. On the other hand, appellant acknowledged that his supervisors told him more than one time that he was a good employee and that he enhanced the morale of the work force.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">An assault in tort is \u201cthe willful threat or attempt to harm or touch another offensively, which threat or attempt reasonably places the other in fear of such contact.\u201d <em>Smith v. John Deere Co. </em>(1993), 83 Ohio App.3d 398, 406, 614 N.E.2d 1148, 1154. A key element of assault is that the alleged tortfeasor \u201cknew with substantial certainty that his or her act would bring about harmful or offensive contact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Battery results when an individual \u201cacts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact, and when a harmful contact results.\u201d <em>Love v. Port Clinton </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 98, 99, 524 N.E.2d 166, 167. To constitute offensive contact, the contact must be \u201coffensive to a reasonable sense of personal dignity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is a one-year statute of limitations for assault and battery claims. R.C. 2305.111.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Initially, we find that appellant\u2019s claims for assault and battery, relating to the incidents in the 1980s, are barred by the one-year statute of limitations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Appellant, however, has set forth facts showing that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the 1993 incident. He described, in both his affidavit and deposition, the alleged offensive contact which took place despite his protests. Therefore, construing the evidence most favorably for appellant, we cannot conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding these causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">B. False Imprisonment</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">As with his assault and battery claims, appellant\u2019s assertion of false imprisonment centers around the incidents in the line offices. Appellant contends that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding his consent of going to and staying in the line office.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The tort of false imprisonment results when an individual intentionally confines another in a restricted area for any appreciable length of time absent lawful justification and without that individual\u2019s consent. <em>Bennett v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 107, 109, 573 N.E.2d 633, 636. Due to the \u201ccontinuing nature\u201d of false imprisonment, liability may be imposed even if there was an initial privilege to confine the individual. <em>Id. </em>Finally, we note that the statute of limitations for false imprisonment is also one year. R.C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Again, we first find that several of the incidents occurred in the late 1980s. Thus, any claims of false imprisonment regarding those incidents are barred by the statute of limitations. With regard to the 1993 incident, appellant again asserted that he went to the office only because he feared discipline or termination. Appellant further declared, in both his affidavit and deposition testimony, that he was physically restrained in the line office. Thus, even if the initial confinement in the line office was justified, for example, as disciplinary action for disrupting the work environment, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the subsequent restraint of appellant. Appellant\u2019s assertions, therefore, concerning his claim of false imprisonment are well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The following elements must be established in order to recover in an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-11\">\u201c1) that the actor either intended to cause emotional distress or knew or should have known that actions taken would result in serious emotional distress to the plaintiff; 2) that the actor\u2019s conduct was so extreme and outrageous as to go \u2018beyond all possible bounds of decency\u2019 and was such that it can be considered as \u2018utterly intolerable in a civilized community,\u2019 * * *; 3) that the actor\u2019s actions were the proximate cause of plaintiffs psychic injury; and 4) that the mental anguish suffered by plaintiff is serious and of a nature that \u2018no reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>[person] could be expected to endure it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pyle v. Pyle </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 31, 34, 11 OBR 63, 66, 463 N.E.2d 98, 103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20 </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 369, 374-375, 6 OBR 421, 425-427, 453 N.E.2d 666, 671, citing Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1965) 73, Section 46, Comment <em>d, </em>described what constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-6\">\u201c \u2018 * * * It has not been enough that the defendant has acted with an intent which is tortious or even criminal, or that he has intended to inflict emotional distress, or even that his conduct has been characterized by \u201cmalice,\u201d or a degree of aggravation which would entitle the plaintiff to punitive damages for another tort. * * * Generally, the case is one in which the recitation of the facts to an average member of the community would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to exclaim, \u201cOutrageous!\u201d * * * The liability clearly does not extend to mere insults, indignities, threats, annoyances, petty oppressions, or other trivialities.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Additionally, the statute of limitations for intentional infliction of emotional distress is four years. R.C. 2305.09(D). See <em>Yeager v. Local Union 20, </em>6 Ohio St.3d at 375, 6 OBR at 426-427, 453 N.E.2d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">In support of his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, appellant submits that his affidavit should be considered \u201cas a whole\u201d to show that \u201cthe actions of Appellees and Whirlpool employees constitute extreme and outrageous conduct.\u201d Appellant cites various incidents, including receipt of blowup dolls, cartoons, and an item labeled a \u201cpenis warmer.\u201d He also refers to the above-mentioned line office incidents concerning Rowlinson and Mouser.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Initially, we find that any alleged actions that occurred more than four years before the complaint was filed are barred by the statute of limitations. As to the remaining incidents, appellant has failed to set forth evidence that such actions are so outrageous and extreme to meet the requirements as set forth in <em>Yeager. </em>The trial court, therefore, properly granted appellees\u2019 summary judgment motion regarding this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">D. Defamation</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">In his affidavit, appellant cited to three alleged incidents in support of his claim of defamation. First, appellant asserts that on several occasions, a coworker yelled, \u201c[H]ey, Retterer, how\u2019s your AIDS?\u201d Next, appellant stated that a coworker, in the presence of another party, told him \u201cto get away from [me], because I [Retterer] had AIDS.\u201d Finally, appellant maintains that a \u201ccaution\u201d tape, hung across a bathroom door, referred to him having AIDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>Slander refers to spoken defamatory words, while libel is generally defined as written or printed defamatory words. 35 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d (1982), Defamation and Privacy, Sections 1 and 2. More specifically, slander <em>per se </em>results from \u201cthe very words spoken\u201d and damages are presumed. <em>King v. Bogner </em>(1993), 88 Ohio App.3d 564, 567, 624 N.E.2d 364, 366. In contrast, libel is generally defined, in part, as \u201ca false written publication, made with some degree of fault, reflecting injuriously on a person\u2019s reputation, or exposing a person to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame or disgrace * * <em>A &amp; B-Abell Elevator Co. v. Columbus/Cent. Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 1, 7, 651 N.E.2d 1283, 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">To maintain an action for defamation at common law, including libel and slander, a plaintiff must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">\u201c \u2018(a) a false and defamatory statement concerning another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201c \u2018(b) an unprivileged publication to a third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">\u201c \u2018(c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">\u201c \u2018(d) either actionability of the statement irrespective of special harm or the existence of special harm caused by the publication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akron-Canton Waste Oil, Inc. v. Safety-Kleen Oil Serv., Inc. </em>(1992), 81 Ohio App.3d 591, 601, 611 N.E.2d 955, 962, quoting 3 Restatement of the Law 2d, Torts (1977) 155, Section 558.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">Furthermore, there is a one-year statute of limitations for defamation actions. R.C. 2305.11(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">The trial court found that some of the incidents with regard to the coworker yelling that appellant had AIDS occurred during the 1980s. Appellant\u2019s deposition supports this conclusion. There is no reference to a contrary date. Consequently, these allegations are barred by R.C. 2305.11(A). Furthermore, appellant has failed to set forth evidence establishing genuine issues of material facts regarding these incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">The second claim is cited as occurring in 1993. Appellant testified that he does not have AIDS. He further indicated in his deposition testimony and his affidavit that a supervisor was present when the coworker, on the assembly line, told him to get away because he had AIDS. He testified that the supervisor \u201cturned his head the other way\u201d and \u201c[tjotally ignored it.\u201d In his affidavit, appellant stated that the supervisor was present when the coworker made the remark. The trial court concluded that there was no evidence of publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">As stated above, appellant must present evidence of publication to a third person in order for a claim of defamation to be actionable. In <em>Wyrick v. Westover Retirement Community </em>(Mar. 13, 1989), Butler App. No. CA88-06-086, unreported, 1989 WL 21229, the appellate court found no evidence of publication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>to withstand a summary judgment motion. In <em>Wyrick, </em>a statement was made to appellant in a dining hall. Appellant argued that since others were present, \u201cthe court is to assume that the people in the dining hall heard the comment simply by virtue of having ears.\u201d Rejecting appellant\u2019s argument, the court concluded that appellant had no knowledge of who was present in the dining hall at the time the statement was made or whether if anyone heard the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In the instant case, appellant has identified the individual present at the time of the alleged statement and has indicated, albeit through nonverbal actions, that the individual heard the statement. Since we must construe the evidence presented and inferences from that evidence in favor of the nonmoving party, we find that appellant has met the threshold necessary to defeat summary judgment on this particular claim of defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Regarding the third incident, appellant stated that when he left the bathroom at work, he found a banner draped across the doorway with the word \u201ccaution\u201d written on it. He asserts, in his affidavit, that another coworker told him that \u201cit was a reference to AIDS \u2014 that others should stay away from me, because I had AIDS.\u201d The trial court found that since the banner contained no defamatory words and the only evidence regarding its meaning was a coworker\u2019s hearsay statement, appellant\u2019s libel claim failed. We concur with the trial court\u2019s conclusion and find that appellant has failed to set forth evidence to establish genuine issues of material fact regarding this particular claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">E. Sexual Harassment</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Appellant contends that his claims for sexual harassment are viable under R.C. 4112.02 and common law. In particular, appellant maintains that he was harassed \u201con account of his gender\u201d and further that he was subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">Initially, we note that in analyzing statutory sexual harassment claims, Ohio courts have generally looked to the statute itself, R.C. 4112.02(A), the administrative equivalent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and to federal case law construing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 2000e <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S. Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Delaney v. Skyline Lodge, Inc. </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 264, 270, 642 N.E.2d 395, 399. Thus, we examine these areas as well as Ohio case law to analyze appellant\u2019s claim of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">R.C. 4112.02(A) provides that it is unlawful for any employer to discriminate on the basis of \u201crace, * * * sex, national origin, handicap, age, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, * * * or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Under the statute, two of the requisite elements for a sexual harassment claim based on a hostile work environment are that an \u201cemployee was a member of the protected class\u201d and \u201cthe harassment complained of was based upon sex.\u201d <em>Delaney v. Skyline Lodge, Inc., </em>95 Ohio App.3d at 270, 642 N.E.2d at 399-400. Furthermore, we note that the statute fails to include a category of sexual orientation and, in fact, pursuant to the definition of handicap and physical or mental impairment, specifically excludes homosexuality. R.C. 4112.01 (A)(13) and (A)(16)(b)(i). See <em>Greenwood v. Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 295, 298-299, 663 N.E.2d 1030, 1032 (stating that \u201cthe Ohio civil rights statutes, R.C. Chapter 4112, do not include sexual orientation among their protections\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We next examine federal case law to determine whether hostile work environment arising from sexual harassment involving two males or concerning an individual\u2019s sexual preference is actionable under Title VII. In <em>Dillon v. Frank </em>(C.A.6, 1992), 952 F.2d 403, unpublished,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the claim of sexual harassment was based on a hostile work environment. In particular, the plaintiff alleged that other employees taunted and threatened him because they thought he was homosexual. The court concluded that there was no cause of action for discrimination on the basis of sexual preference under Title VII. In addition, the court noted that the plaintiff attempted to avoid that conclusion by asserting that he was discriminated against because he was male. Rejecting this argument, the court found that the plaintiff failed to show that \u201chis co-workers would have treated a similarly situated woman any differently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Likewise, plaintiffs\u2019 claim of a hostile work environment because of homosexual writings, drawings, and discussions initiated by coworkers and supervisors was rejected by the court in <em>Fox v. Sierra Dev. Co. </em>(D.Nev.1995), 876 F.Supp. 1169. The court reasoned that \u201c[plaintiffs do not perceive the work environment to be hostile to them because they are men. * * * This is a form of hostility or abuse which is not discriminatory on the basis of sex or gender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Additionally, in <em>Carreno v. Local Union No. 226, Internatl. Bhd. of Elec. Workers </em>(Sept. 27, 1990), D.Kan. No. 89-4083-S, unreported, 1990 WL 159199, a hostile work environment was claimed because of verbal and physical harassment by other employees concerning homosexuality. The court found that \u201c[w]hile the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>plaintiff has expressly stated that he is not asserting discrimination based on sexual preference, the undisputed facts indicate that the plaintiff was not harassed because he is a male, but rather because he is a homosexual male. Every derogatory comment made to the plaintiff related to his homosexuality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Thus, the court, finding no cause of action under Title VII for discrimination based on sexual preference, granted summary judgment against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Finally, the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Kerans v. Porter Paint Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 486, 575 N.E.2d 428, found that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act failed to provide the only remedy for sexual harassment claims and, thus, recognized a common-law action for sexual harassment. In particular, the court found that if evidence in the record implies that an employee had a previous history of sexual harassment behavior of \u201cwhich the employer knew or should have known\u201d summary judgment should not be granted. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 575 N.E.2d at 433. More important, however, the facts of the case clearly relate to sexual harassment based upon appellant\u2019s sex. <em>Id. </em>at 493, 575 N.E.2d at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">In support of his position, appellant points to the following statement in his affidavit, \u201cI do not know of any women who received the same types and level of harassment which I received.\u201d Appellant, however, cites numerous physical objects and verbal comments relating to sexual preference. In his deposition, appellant also described a harassment incident which happened to a woman who appellant indicated was a lesbian. Finally, appellant\u2019s brief cites no incidents of any other males being harassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Based on this, as well as the rest of the record, we find that appellant has failed to set forth evidence to withstand summary judgment regarding harassment because of his sex. Instead, appellant has set forth evidence relating to his sexual orientation. In view of the above analysis, such harassment is not actionable in the instant case and summary judgment was appropriately granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">F. Disability Discrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Appellant maintains that he was subjected to discrimination because of a perception that he had AIDS. He refers to the same comments alleged in his defamation claim as well as the displaying of a poster concerning AIDS as support for his assertion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Again, R.C. 4112.02(A) prohibits any unlawful discriminatory practices on the basis of handicap which includes any discrimination with regard to conditions of employment or any other matter related to employment. The definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>handicap includes a physical or mental impairment or \u201cbeing regarded as having a physical or mental impairment.\u201d R.C. 4112.01(A)(13). Physical or mental impairment, in turn, includes human immunodeficiency virus infection. R.C. 4112.01(A)(16)(a)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s mere reference to a few comments regarding AIDS and a poster fail to present any genuine issues of material fact regarding discriminatory practices due to the perception that appellant has AIDS. Thus, the trial court appropriately granted summary judgment regarding appellant\u2019s disability claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">G. Negligent Supervision</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In count eight of his complaint, appellant argues that Whirlpool \u201cknew or should have known of the foregoing unlawful and/or tortious actions of its employees.\u201d On the other hand, appellees assert that since appellant attributes his injury to the negligence of Whirlpool, it falls within the confines of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Both parties also cite the <em>Blankenship </em>intentional tort exception to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in support of their positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">We first reject appellees\u2019 claim that the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act conclusively bars appellant\u2019s negligent supervision claim. R.C. 4123.74 provides that employers have no liability \u201cto respond in damages at common law or by statute for any injury, * * * or bodily condition, received or contracted by any employee in the course of or arising out of his employment.\u201d The definition of injury excludes any \u201c[pjsychiatric conditions except where the conditions have arisen from an injury or occupational disease.\u201d R.C. 4123.01(C)(1). Thus, the Ohio Supreme Court stated it was unable to conclude that emotional disturbances \u201carising solely from emotional stress in the workplace fit within the definition of \u2018injury\u2019 in R.C. 4123.01.\u201d <em>Kerans v. Porter Paint Co., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 489, 575 N.E.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Next, we discuss the intentional tort exception. In <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, the Ohio Supreme Court held that R.C. 4123.74 and 4123.741 do not preclude an employee from bringing an action for an intentional tort against his employer. See R.C. 2745.01. We agree; however, appellant is claiming that Whirlpool was negligent; therefore, we analyze this claim solely on appellant\u2019s claim of negligent supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">As a preliminary matter, we note that \u201can underlying requirement in actions for negligent supervision * * * is that the employee is individually liable for a tort or guilty of a claimed wrong against a third person, who then seeks recovery against the employer.\u201d <em>Strock v. Pressnell </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 207, 217, 527 N.E.2d 1235, 1244. Consequently, the previous claims which failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>withstand summary judgment would, in turn, support no cause of action under a negligent supervision theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">As to appellant\u2019s viable claims, however, appellant must show that Whirlpool breached its duty to act \u201creasonably and prudently\u201d in supervising its employees. See <em>Morgan v. Fisher Foods, Inc. </em>(Dec. 5, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 59488, unreported, 1991 WL 261324.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Appellant asserted that a human resources staff person was present \u201con at least one of the occasions\u201d in the line office, but presents no evidence that Whirlpool failed to act reasonably and prudently. Moreover, appellant apparently made no report to Whirlpool of the various incidents prior to May 1993, even though he encouraged others to utilize the complaint procedures. In May 1993, appellant\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to Whirlpool complaining of the alleged conduct. As a result, Whirlpool conducted an investigation and took action. Thus, summary judgment was appropriately granted in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">In conclusion, the second assignment of error is overruled with respect to appellant\u2019s claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, disability discrimination, sexual harassment, and negligent supervision and sustained in part as discussed herein regarding the claims of assault and battery, false imprisonment, and defamation. The judgment of the Marion County Court of Common Pleas is, therefore, affirmed in part and reversed, and the cause is remanded in part in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b896-9\">Thomas F. Bryant and Evans, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-11\">. Appellant has been on medical leave since May 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b892-11\">.
