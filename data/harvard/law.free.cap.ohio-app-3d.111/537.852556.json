We affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">On June 21, 1992, Ted Martinez attended a party given by his friend Gary Smith. Martinez brought a .32 caliber derringer to the party, which he loaded before entering the house. Martinez arrived at approximately 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., and estimates that between that time and midnight he consumed enough beer to be \u201cfeeling good,\u201d but not so much that he was \u201cable to get a good buzz.\u201d Sometime after midnight the party ended when police, called to Smith\u2019s house for the second time that evening, told guests to leave. Martinez stayed to help Smith clean.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Martinez and Smith\u2019s brother Todd began picking up cans on the back patio. Martinez claims that he removed the derringer from his pocket and placed it on a nearby table. He further claims that Todd began \u201cmessing with it while I was picking cans up.\u201d According to Martinez, after Todd set the gun down Martinez picked it up, pointed it at Todd and pulled the trigger in a play-like manner. Martinez was approximately two feet from Todd when he shot him in the head. Todd Smith died a few days later as a result of the gunshot wound to his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Martinez pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter with a gun specification, using a weapon while intoxicated, and carrying a concealed weapon. Beverly Campbell, individually and as the administrator of Todd Smith\u2019s estate, Greg Smith and Michelle DiLuciano filed a wrongful death action against Martinez. That lawsuit was submitted to the Western Reserve Mutual Insurance Company, the homeowner\u2019s insurer for Dolores Martinez, Martinez\u2019s grandmother. Western Reserve then filed the present declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties under the insurance policy issued to Dolores Martinez.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The trial court granted Western Reserve\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that although Martinez was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s household and therefore covered by her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy, the intentional-act exclusion of Delores Martinez\u2019s policy applied to Todd Smith\u2019s death as a matter of law. Thus, the trial court determined that Western Reserve had no duty to defend or indemnify Ted or Dolores Martinez with respect to the wrongful death lawsuit. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Smith, DiLuciano and Campbell (collectively, \u201cSmith\u201d) present one assignment of error: The trial court erred in granting Western Reserve\u2019s motion for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist. Western Reserve cross-assigns that the trial court erred in finding Martinez was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Western Reserve homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to Dolores Martinez contains the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cCoverage E \u2014 Personal Liability and Coverage F \u2014 Medical Payments to Others do not apply to bodily injury or property damage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201ca. which is expected or intended by the insured[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Essentially, Smith argues that because Martinez claims that he believed the safety was on when he pointed the gun at Todd and pulled the trigger, Todd\u2019s injury and death were unexpected and unintended and therefore the, above exclusion does not apply. This logic is simply implausible. Martinez admitted the following during deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201cA. Yeah, but the thing about a derringer, the hammer will move. You know, if you got the safe on a regular gun, the hammer\u2019s not gonna move, but this hammer moved. Now, only way you know the safety was on, you know, just stop that far from the trigger off, so the gun was really, you know, messed up. But when I pointed it at him, the gun went off and stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201cA. Very unsafe gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\"><em>\u201c </em>* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201cQ. It is true though, isn\u2019t it, that you knew that with a loaded gun that if it\u2019s pointed at someone and it discharged that that person \u2014 strike that. You know that if a gun discharged and it was aimed at someone point blank it could hurt them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201cQ. You knew that if a gun was pointed at someone\u2019s forehead and it discharged it could kill that person conceivably, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201cA. Any gun could, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-17\">\u201cQ. Is it fair to say that you knew as just a matter of common sense that guns are dangerous and capable of causing serious harm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-18\">\u201cA. Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-19\">The trial court found that there were no disputed material facts and that \u201c[wjhen Martinez raised a loaded, operable gun and pointed it in Smith\u2019s direction and then pulled the trigger, there is no other conclusion but that the injury was expected. As coverage under the policy is excluded for injuries that are expected or intended, there is no insurance coverage under the Western Reserve policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>#WHT-520151 for the damages resulting from the shooting of Todd Smith.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Parenti v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 826, 829, 586 N.E.2d 1121, 1122-1123. Summary judgment is proper if (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to that party. <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274; Civ.R. 56(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In order to avoid coverage on the basis of an intentional-act exclusion, the insurer must demonstrate that the injury itself was intentional or expected. <em>Physicians Ins. Co. v. Swanson </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 189, 193, 569 N.E.2d 906, 910-911. Smith argues that because Martinez <em>claims </em>that he did not expect or intend the injury, and because <em>Swanson </em>specifically holds that an intentional act resulting in an unintended or unexpected injury is insufficient to avoid insurance coverage, Todd\u2019s injury was therefore unintentional and coverage should be provided. Because it is always in the insured\u2019s interest to establish coverage and avoid policy exclusions, Martinez\u2019s self-serving statements are of negligible value in demonstrating intent or expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">This court has previously decided the issue presently before us. See <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Carreras </em>(Nov. 15, 1995), Lorain App. No. 95CA006031, unreported, 1995 WL 678556. In <em>Carreras, </em>Mois\u00e9s Carreras, a juvenile, shot and killed Joseph McKern during an altercation. Carreras admitted the crime of involuntary manslaughter and was adjudicated delinquent. The offense underlying the involuntary manslaughter charge was felonious assault, a crime requiring a \u201cknowing\u201d state of culpability. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">McKern\u2019s mother brought a wrongful death claim against Carreras and his parents. The Carrerases were insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Nationwide, which contained an intentional- or expected-acts exclusion similar to the policy exclusion in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Nationwide filed a declaratory judgment action, arguing that it had no duty to defend or indemnify the Carrerases. Carreras argued that he did not intend to shoot or kill McKern, but that the gun accidentally discharged. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Nationwide\u2019s favor, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cAppellant seems to be suggesting that Mois\u00e9s [Carreras], although he concededly was aware that his conduct would probably cause injury, did not intend to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>kill Joseph [McKern], and for that reason should be insured. The fact that Mois\u00e9s did or did not specifically intend to kill Joseph does not contradict his admitted knowledge that his actions were likely to result in physical harm to Joseph. Mois\u00e9s does not contest that he intentionally pointed the rifle at Joseph. * * * According to the statutory definition of \u2018knowingly,\u2019 <em>supra, </em>Moises\u2019s specific purpose was irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201cThis court recently considered a similar crime, aggravated assault, and determined that one who knowingly commits such a crime necessarily does so with the expectation that harm will result * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Martinez, like Carreras, pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, for which the culpable mental state is that of the underlying offense. <em>Stanley v. Turner </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 6 F.3d 399, 402. The culpable mental state for carrying a concealed weapon is \u201cknowingly.\u201d R.C. 2923.12(A). A person acts \u201cknowingly,\u201d \u201cregardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u201d R.C. 2901.22(B). Although the underlying offenses in the present case and <em>Camras </em>are different, both require a \u201cknowing\u201d state of culpability. Thus, the holding in <em>Carreras </em>is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Martinez \u201cneed not have intended to kill; he need only to have acted knowing (or expecting) that his act would probably cause serious physical harm.\u201d <em>Carreras, supra. </em>In addition to admitting that he knew the safety on his gun did not work properly, Martinez admitted in his deposition that, as a matter of common sense, aiming a loaded gun at someone could probably cause serious injury or death. We agree with the Tenth District that \u201c[t]he insurer does not need to prove the crime of murder in order for the intentional acts exclusion to apply.\u201d <em>Horvath v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1996), 108 Ohio App.3d 732, 671 N.E.2d 638. What the insurer does need to prove is that the injury was intended or <em>substantially certain to occur. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Ignoring Martinez\u2019s criminal conviction, expectation or intent may be inferred in the'case at bar. Martinez knew as a matter of common sense that guns are dangerous, and he knew that his gun was loaded and \u201cunsafe\u201d due to the \u201cmessed up\u201d safety. Nevertheless, he pointed it at Todd\u2019s head and pulled the trigger within point-blank range. This unquestionably reckless conduct warrants exclusion from policy coverage. See <em>W. Res. Mut. Cas. Co. v. Macaluso </em>(1993), 91 Ohio App.3d 93, 631 N.E.2d 1079; <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hevitan </em>(Jan. 24, 1996), Medina App. No. 2443-M, unreported, 1996 WL 27927. Construing the evidence in Martinez\u2019s favor, reasonable minds could only conclude that Martinez, at the very least, acted with heedless indifference to the consequences of his actions and disregarded the known risk posed by a loaded gun. Todd\u2019s injury and death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>could reasonably be expected to result from such reckless actions. <em>Hevitan, supra, </em>citing <em>Steinke v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 798, 621 N.E.2d 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The trial court, viewing the undisputed evidence in a light most favorable to Martinez, correctly decided that reasonable minds could only conclude that Todd\u2019s injury was substantially certain to occur and the intentional-acts policy exclusion applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Smith\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">In its cross-assignment of error, Western Reserve contends that the trial court erred in determining that Martinez was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s household. Even if Todd\u2019s death were found to be an unintentional injury to which the policy exclusion did not apply, Western Reserve argues that Martinez would not be covered by his grandmother\u2019s insurance policy because he was not a resident of her household. We agree. Although it appears unnecessary for us to reach this issue based upon our above discussion, we do so, reversing the trial court\u2019s finding that Martinez was a resident of his grandmother\u2019s household.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">\u201cAn appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court where some competent and credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings.\u201d <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 355, 617 N.E.2d 1136, 1138. However, in the present case Martinez\u2019s own deposition testimony directly contradicts the trial court\u2019s finding. Martinez testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201cQ. Is it fair to say that you primarily just went to your grandmother\u2019s house to change clothes basically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">\u201cA. Yeah. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">\u201cQ. Did you usually eat dinner at your grandmother\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">\u201cA. No. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">\u00ab \u2021 $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-15\">\u201cQ. Is it fair to say \u2014 strike that. In the months in the \u2014 strike that. In the month or two before the accident, is it fair to say you spent more days and nights away from your grandmother\u2019s house then <em>[sic] </em>you did in it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-16\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-17\">\u201cQ. Is it also fair to say the only reason you would put your address on your employment application or driver\u2019s license or things of that sort at your grand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>mother\u2019s house was because you knew that you could always get your mail there, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">\u201cA. Basically. Because, you know, my father he lived in Texas, and you know, that was his only home, he would know where I am at as long as I gave that address, get in touch with my family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cQ. Did you pay your grandmother any rent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Although Martinez listed his grandmother\u2019s address on job applications, his driver\u2019s license and tax returns, and used his grandmother\u2019s address as his mailing address, his testimony indicates that he was not a resident of her household. Martinez admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201cQ. Okay. In the six months of 1992 that preceded this accident, about how many days a week do you think you lived with your grandmother on average?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cA. I am telling you honestly, I was staying with this girl Crystal, I had another girl that I was staying with. You know, I \u2014 I\u2019m a young dude like a bachelor type. If I want to spend over \u2014 a night over a girl\u2019s house, that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. So I would stay over here, I\u2019d stay over here, I\u2019d go to grandma\u2019s house and change clothes. I didn\u2019t even really stay there. She, hardly even saw me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Maintenance of a mailing address is, in itself, insufficient to establish residency. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Davidson </em>(1993), 87 Ohio App.3d 101, 107, 621 N.E.2d 887, 891-892. Viewing the totality of Martinez\u2019s testimony in light of his admission that he rarely stayed at his grandmother\u2019s, there was no competent and credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of residency. By his own admission, Martinez was not a resident of his grandmother\u2019s house, and therefore he was not covered under her homeowner\u2019s insurance policy. We reverse the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Western Reserve\u2019s cross-assignment of error is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Smith\u2019s assignment of error is overruled and the order of the trial court granting summary judgment in Western Reserve\u2019s favor is affirmed. Pursuant to App.R. 12(B), we reverse the trial court\u2019s finding as to Martinez\u2019s residency and find, as a matter of law, that Martinez was not covered by his grandmother\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy as a resident of her household.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Quillin, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b579-5\">Baird, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b579-6\">Quillin, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AaE\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">By pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter, Martinez admitted that he knowingly killed Todd Smith.

Thus, summary judgment on that issue is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">I concur in the balance of the majority opinion, including the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
