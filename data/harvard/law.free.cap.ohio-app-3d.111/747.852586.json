DeLeon (\u201cDeLeon\u201d), and appellant, DeLeon Heating <em>&amp; </em>Cooling, Inc. (\u201cDeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling\u201d), appeal from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas finding DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>On May 5, 1992, plaintiff-appellee, William F. Cherry, filed a complaint against DeLeon and Jose M. DeLeon, d.b.a. JMD Thermotics (\u201cJMD Thermotics\u201d), alleging default on an investment agreement. After the court entered summary judgment against DeLeon and JMD Thermotics, plaintiff filed an affidavit to commence R.C. 2716.11 garnishment proceedings. As part of the garnishment proceedings, plaintiff named DeLeon Plumbing, Inc. and DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling (\u201cthe corporations\u201d) as garnishees, and DeLeon and JMD Thermotics as judgment debtors. On February 11,1993, the clerk of court served the notices of garnishment on the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">On March 19, 1993, plaintiff filed a motion to show cause because Michael Freeze, vice president of both corporations, failed to appear at a March 18, 1993 garnishment hearing. On May 25, 1993, the referee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> issued a report and entry, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">\u201cBy agreement of the parties the corporations, DeLeon Plumbing, Inc., and/or DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling, Inc., both being responsible for this Order, but a single amount to be paid into the Clerk of Courts as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u201cIt is ORDERED that said corporations pay to * * * the Clerk of Court, on or before the 10th day of the month the sum of Four Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($400.00) each and every month until the claim of the creditor, William F. Cherry, is paid. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">According to the entry, at the time the garnishment notice was served, the corporations owed DeLeon more than the amount of plaintiffs judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">For the next twelve months, the corporations paid the clerk of court each month. After the corporations ceased making payments, plaintiff on March 1, 1995, filed a contempt motion against DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling, alleging contempt of the May 25, 1993 order. In the meantime, on August 31, 1994, DeLeon had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. On March 21, 1995, DeLeon gave notice of his bankruptcy filing to the common pleas court and moved to stay all common pleas court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">On April 7, 1995, the referee heard evidence concerning plaintiffs March 1, 1995 contempt motion and determined that DeLeon Heating <em>&amp; </em>Cooling<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was in contempt of the May 25, 1993 order. Further, the referee determined DeLeon\u2019s personal bankruptcy filing did not stay proceedings between plaintiff and garnishee DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>On August 9, 1995, the trial court adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision, found DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling in contempt of the May 25, 1993 order, and ordered DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling to make not only delinquent payments totaling $5,600, but also future payments of $400 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">On August 31, 1995, defendants appealed to this court, assigning the following errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201cI. The referee and the trial court erred in considering the merits of appellees\u2019 contempt motion after the trial court was notified of the bankruptcy filing of appellant Jose DeLeon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cII. The trial court erred in adopting a document captioned \u2018magistrate\u2019s decision,\u2019 which contained errors of law and other defects in the face of the decision. The trial court should have concluded that the bankruptcy of appellant Jose DeLeon was a bar against proceedings to collect the judgment of appellee William' F. Cherry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">\u201cIII. The trial court erred in adopting a document captioned \u2018magistrate\u2019s decision,\u2019 which contained errors of law and other defects in the face of the decision. The trial court should have concluded that appellant DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling, Inc. did not become the guarantor of the debt to appellee William Cherry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201cIV. The trial court erred in adopting the magistrate\u2019s decision of a motion which was originally heard and considered pursuant to an order of reference to the referee, not the magistrate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Initially, even though plaintiff contends the May 25, 1993 order was a judgment entry reflecting an agreement between plaintiff and the corporations, nothing within that order or the record indicates judgment against the corporations. Accordingly, we analyze the order as one finding DeLeon Heating &amp; Cooling in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">More particularly, throughout these garnishment proceedings, the corporations as garnishees were not named as parties to the suit. See <em>Januzzi v. Hickman </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 40, 42, 572 N.E.2d 642, 644, citing <em>Secor v. Witter </em>(1883), 39 Ohio St. 218. Nevertheless, upon the garnishees\u2019 answering the notice of garnishment and the court\u2019s discovering the corporations possessed \u201cany money, property, or credits of the judgment debtor or [were] indebted to the judgment debtor,\u201d the court may order that the garnishees make payments to the court. R.C. 2716.21(B); R.C. 2716.21(D) (\u201cA garnishee shall pay the * * * money or value of the property * * * other than personal earnings, of the judgment debtor in his possession or under his control, or so much thereof as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>court orders, into court.\u201d); see <em>Emerald City Jewelers, Inc. v. Jones </em>(Apr. 30, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 62635, unreported, 1992 WL 90746.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">If the garnishee fails to comply with a proper court order to make payments, the court may proceed against the garnishee in contempt, R.C. 2716.21(E), or the judgment creditor may initiate a separate civil action. R.C. 2716.21(F); <em>Januzzi, supra; RLM Industries, Inc. v. Indep. Holding Co. </em>(1992), 83 Ohio App.3d 373, 376, 614 N.E.2d 1133, 1135; <em>Goralsky v. Taylor </em>(Mar. 22, 1990), Cuyahoga App. No. 56534, unreported, 1990 WL 32615 (trial court given discretion to determine if garnishee is in contempt under R.C. 2716.21). When the court proceeds against a garnishee for contempt, that garnishee becomes party to the suit only for contempt purposes. <em>Januzzi, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 45, 572 N.E.2d at 646; <em>Emerald City, supra. </em>If the court finds the garnishee violated a valid court order of which it had knowledge, the court properly may hold that garnishee in contempt. See <em>Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. Kelly </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 287, 295, 588 N.E.2d 233, 239. Here, the court proceeded against the garnishees in contempt. Throughout these proceedings, plaintiff never initiated a separate R.C. 2716.21(F) civil action and never received an enforceable judgment against the corporations. See <em>Emerald City, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">With that basis, we address jointly defendants\u2019 first and second assignments of error, as they both concern the effect of DeLeon\u2019s bankruptcy on the proceedings in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">At the time DeLeon filed for bankruptcy, plaintiff had a lien on, but no \u201ctitle\u201d to, the garnished funds. <em>State ex rel. Auto Loan Co. v. Jennings </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 152, 156-157, 43 O.O.2d 250, 252-253, 237 N.E.2d 305, 309-310; <em>In re Sininger </em>(Bankr.Ct.Ohio 1988), 84 B.R. 115; <em>In re Corbin </em>(C.A.6, 1965), 350 F.2d 514, 517. Similarly, as debtor, DeLeon had an equitable claim to those garnished funds. See <em>In re Dodds </em>(Bankr.Ct.Ohio 1992), 147 B.R. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Once DeLeon filed for bankruptcy, his bankruptcy estate included most of his legal and equitable property interests<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> existing at the time of filing. Section 541(a)(1), Title 11, U.S.Code. By virtue of his equitable claims to garnished funds held by the corporations and by the court, the funds remained within his estate. See <em>Auto Loan, supra, </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus (garnished funds held by court part of bankrupt\u2019s estate when debtor insolvent at time garnishment ordered); <em>Sininger, supra; In re Evans </em>(Bankr.Ct.Ohio 1987), 78 B.R. 145, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">According to the automatic stay provisions of Sections 362(a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5), Title 11, U.S.Code, commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding stays <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>attempts to collect or enforce liens against estate property or to obtain possession of such property. Without a separate enforceable judgment recasting the corporations\u2019 payments as corporate debt, plaintiff has no \u201ctitle\u201d to the funds, and the corporations have no independent liability to plaintiff. See <em>Am. Gen. Fin. Co. v. United Ready Mix, Inc. </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 195, 196, 590 N.E.2d 867. Because the contempt order may enforce plaintiffs lien on the garnished funds or may give plaintiff possession of those funds, the bankruptcy stay applies. <em>Corbin, </em>350 F.2d at 517 (creditor receiving garnished funds on day of bankruptcy filing had lien only on funds, and lien was extinguished by Section 107[a], Title 11, U.S.Code); cf. <em>Am. Gen. Fin., </em>70 Ohio App.3d at 196, 590 N.E.2d at 867 (garnishee had previously incurred separate obligation to creditor based upon creditor\u2019s judgment against garnishee); <em>In re Waltjen </em>(Bankr.Ct.Ill.1993), 150 B.R. 419 (action against employer for failure to garnish wages and solely against employer\u2019s assets does not trigger stay, but action to terminate debtor\u2019s rights in wages violates stay); <em>In re Gray </em>(Bankr.Ct.Ill.1989), 97 B.R. 930, 935 (personal liability of garnishee as new and independent cause of action, not as an order to turn over debtor\u2019s assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Because the court\u2019s contempt order affects the corporations\u2019 obligation to pay garnished funds that are included in DeLeon\u2019s bankruptcy estate, the trial court violated DeLeon\u2019s automatic bankruptcy stay. <em>McCarthy v. Pacific Loan, Inc. </em>(D.Hawaii 1986), 61 B.R. 288, 290 (debt not garnishee\u2019s own because state statute does not allow automatic entry of judgment against garnishee for failing to obey court process); see, also, <em>Donovan v. Sunmark Industries, Inc. </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 219, 221, 10 OBR 294, 295-297, 461 N.E.2d 321, 323-324 (stay prohibits attempts to reach assets of debtor); see, also, <em>Waltjen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Accordingly, defendants\u2019 first and second assignments of error are sustained, rendering the third and fourth assignments of error moot. App.R. 12(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Having sustained defendants\u2019 first and second assignments of error, rendering the third and fourth assignments of error moot, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-9\">Petree, P.J., and Bowman, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-11\">.
