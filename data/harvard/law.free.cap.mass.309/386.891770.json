After a verdict for the plaintiff, the judge, upon leave reserved, entered a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">From the plaintiff\u2019s testimony the jury could find that she \"skidded\u201d on some \"dark brown\u201d candy, with \"a lot of white filling or something,\u201d that \"had been flattened right out.\u201d This candy was \"about twice as big as . . . [the plaintiff\u2019s] hand and about four or five inches wide.\u201d After the accident the plaintiff observed \"a shoe mark,\u201d \"a kind of skid mark,\u201d in the candy where she could see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the floor underneath, and that it was clean and \u201clooked like marble, kind of a creamy color.\u201d She found \u201csome of that white stuff\u201d on her right foot. The candy was dirty, and the floor of the platform was dirty all around the candy. It was a wet day, and the plaintiff wore rubbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The plaintiff contends that her testimony brings this case within-' the authority of cases like <em>Anjou </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>208 Mass. 273, and, more particularly, <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>275 Mass. 469, where significance was attached to evidence that the floor was clean under the offending substance but dirty around it as aiding in the drawing of an inference that the substance had been upon the floor a sufficient length of time to enable the defendant in the exercise of due care to discover and remove it. See also <em>Manell </em>v. <em>Checker Taxi Co. </em>284 Mass. 151; <em>Foley </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>293 Mass. 232; <em>Connair </em>v. <em>J. H. Beattie Co. </em>298 Mass. 550; <em>Zanes </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co. </em>298 Mass. 569, and <em>Bavosi </em>v. <em>Interstate Theatres Corp. </em>307 Mass. 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The difficulty with this contention is that upon cross-examination of the plaintiff it appeared that her observation of the floor under the candy was limited to the place where the \u201cskid mark\u201d was. Her testimony, taken as a whole, cannot fairly be interpreted as extending beyond this. There was no evidence that the candy was removed at any other point so that the condition of the floor under it could be examined and compared with the remainder of the floor. The fact that the floor looked clean at the precise point where some one\u2019s foot had \u201cskidded\u201d through a soft substance affords in itself no solid ground for an inference as to the condition of the floor under the substance at points where it had not been wiped or scraped by skidding. Nor does the mere fact that the candy on a floor where many people would naturally pass was \u201cdirty,\u201d especially after some one, very likely the plaintiff herself, had \u201cskidded\u201d through it, indicate in any substantial manner how long it had been allowed to remain there. This case must be distinguished from the cases upon which the plaintiff relies and must be classed with such cases as <em>O'Neill </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Boston Elevated, Railway, </em>248 Mass. 362, <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>Smith, 255 </em>Mass. 121, <em>Mascary </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>258 Mass. 524, <em>Cartoof </em>v. <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. </em>262 Mass. 367, <em>Sisson </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>277 Mass. 431, <em>McBreen </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>284 Mass. 253, <em>Renzi </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>293 Mass. 228, <em>Newell </em>v. <em>Wm. Filene\u2019s Sons Co. </em>296 Mass. 489, and <em>Beach </em>v. <em>S. S. Kresge Co. </em>302 Mass. 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
