T. Hughes, (H. L. Barrett </em>with him,) for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b267-4\"><em>L. D. Yont, (P. H.

There was no error in refusing such direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s case goes beyond the mere pushing and \u25a0crowding which is a common incident of travel by public carrier and for which the carrier is not responsible under such decisions as <em>MacGilvray </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>229 Mass. 65; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>244 Mass. 451; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>262 Mass. 542, and <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>264 Mass. 364. If the jury believed the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, they could find that the defendant\u2019s operator allowed his car to come to a stop and then started it again in the midst of a surging crowd when he could have seen the plaintiff\u2019s unfortunate position in front of the car, or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>least when he ought to have realized that someone might be endangered as she was. This remains true even if the stop was for a very brief period. One witness testified, it was \u201cabout a couple of seconds.\u201d Although the defendant cannot be held liable on this evidence for the mere presence and conduct of the crowd, the jury could find that it negligently handled the car in the face of the observable conditions. The case is to be distinguished from <em>Savickas </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>239 Mass. 226, <em>Alward </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>250 Mass. 244, <em>Sack </em>v. <em>Director General of Railroads, </em>245 Mass. 114, and <em>Notaro </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>273 Mass. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">A ruling that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
