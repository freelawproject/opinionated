The plaintiff brings this action to recover for resultant damage to her automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The case was tried in the Superior Court and a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. It is now agreed that a finding was warranted that the defendant operated his automobile, in a negligent manner, and that a finding that he was grossly negligent was not warranted. It is not now contended that the plaintiff\u2019s son was negligent in the manner in which he operated the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was not at the time of the collision legally registered and that she therefore is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">1. There was in evidence at the trial an auditor\u2019s report, whose findings were not made final by the rule appointing him. He found the following facts with respect to the registration of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The plaintiff supplied the money for the purchase of the automobile in June, 1935, and it was then registered in her name. \u201cHer address given in the application was \u2018Union Street, Holliston, Mass.\u2019 which was the address of her son.\u201d In 1936 the car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>registered \u201cin the plaintiff\u2019s name\u201d giving the same address, \u201cUnion Street, Holliston.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The plaintiff formerly lived in Holliston and ran a boarding house, but seventeen or more years prior to the accident she married her present husband and shortly after moved elsewhere in Massachusetts. For ten or more years prior to the accident she lived with her husband in New Hampshire and kept boarders in her home. Three or four years before the. accident the foreclosure of a mortgage on her son\u2019s house was threatened. The plaintiff took title to the house and, after paying the arrears on the mortgage, deeded it back to him. The plaintiff \u201chad a room\u201d in her son\u2019s house, furnished with her furniture, which she occupied when she visited her son. During the two years preceding the accident she visited him in Holliston three or four times each year. The length of such visits varied from one week to four weeks. She came to Holliston in the latter part of February, 1936, to make application for the registration of her automobile and between that time and July 10 came to Holliston three or four times.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The automobile was kept in Holliston. The plaintiff could not operate an automobile and when she wanted to leave New Hampshire for Holliston she would send word to her son and he would drive the automobile to New Hampshire and bring her to Holliston.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The auditor made the general findings that the plaintiff \u201chad her residence\u201d in New Hampshire \u201cand did not have a residence in Holliston, Mass.,\u201d and that \u201cthe car was not properly registered in her name with the mail address given on the application as Union Street, Holliston, Mass.\u201d He found for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The bill of exceptions states that the only other evidence at the trial before the jury pertinent to the questions raised by the bill of exceptions was certain testimony, given by the defendant on cross-examination, to the effect that after the collision he \u201cfound\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s son at the son\u2019s home on \u201cUnion Street in Holliston\u201d and thought that this was the address given to him by the son on the morning of the accident and the \u201caddress that was on the registration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>2. An auditor\u2019s findings of fact are <em>prima facie </em>evidence. Here no evidence contradicting the auditor\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact was introduced. The jury therefore was required to accept as true those subsidiary findings. The jury was, however, not obliged to accept the auditor\u2019s general findings that the plaintiff \u201cdid not have a residence in Hollis-ton\u201d and that the automobile \u201cwas not properly registered in her name with the mail address given on the application as Union Street, Holliston, Mass.\u201d The subsidiary findings of the auditor warranted the drawing of contrary inferences as to these matters. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Farm Service Stores, Inc. </em>301 Mass. 564, 567, 568. <em>Lakeville </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>307 Mass. 433, 436-437.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">3. The statute required that the plaintiff\u2019s application for registration and her certificate of registration should' contain her \u201cname, place of residence and address.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 2. The burden of proving that these requirements of the statute were not fulfilled was on the defendant. <em>Brodmerkle </em>v. <em>Gorolsky, </em>293 Mass. 517, 518. It is not here contended that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cname\u201d was not properly stated in the application and in the certificate. A \u201cmistake\u201d in the statement in an application or in a certificate as to the \u201cplace of residence\u201d or the \u201caddress\u201d of the owner of a motor vehicle does not invalidate its registration. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 9, as amended by St. 1934, c. 361. <em>Emeneau </em>v. <em>Hillery, </em>282 Mass. 280, 284. The record in this case, however, shows that the contention made by the plaintiff at the trial was not that there was \u201cmistake\u201d in the statement of her \u201cplace of residence\u201d or her \u201caddress,\u201d but that she, in fact, had the \u201cplace of residence\u201d and the \u201caddress\u201d set out in the application and in the certificate, within the meaning to be given to the quoted words of the statute. This was the main issue tried before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">4. The word \u201cresidence,\u201d which often appears in statutes, is a word of variant meaning. The meaning to be given to it depends on the context in which it appears, and it must be construed in the light of the purpose of the statute in which it appears and \u201cthe result designed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>accomplished by its use.\u201d <em>Marlborough </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>275 Mass. 394, 396-397. <em>Cambridge </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>303 Mass. 63, 67. It has been said that generally in statutes relating to taxation, voting and settlement the word \"residence\u201d means the same as domicil. <em>Stoughton </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>165 Mass. 251, 252-253. But, \u201cCases arise in which there is a distinction between domicil and residence. A person may have a residence in one place for various reasons comparatively temporary in nature such as performing the duties of an office, transacting a business, seeking improvement in health, pursuing pleasure or visiting relatives, and yet have his permanent home or domicil in a different place.\u201d <em>Tuells </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>283 Mass. 106, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Among such cases are those which involve statutes, relating to an owner\u2019s registration of his motor vehicle, where the word \"residence\u201d appears. An owner of an automobile \u201cmay have a domicil in one place and a residence in another place at the same time.\u201d <em>Caverno </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>294 Mass. 110, 113. He may \"have two places of residence within the Commonwealth,\u201d <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>294 Mass. 105, 108, or a place of residence within, and a place of residence without the Commonwealth. See <em>Avila </em>v. <em>DuPont, </em>278 Mass. 83, 87. The determination of the place of residence of a person is commonly a question of fact. <em>Hamden </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>305 Mass. 485, 487. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>294 Mass. 105, 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The plaintiff was not merely a casual visitor at the home of her son in Holliston. Since the time when she had averted a foreclosure of a mortgage on her son\u2019s home, there was a room in his house fitted up for her occupancy with furniture which she owned. She occupied this room when in Holliston. Her visits were not short or merely occasional. She regularly visited at his home for substantial periods of time. She was there when she purchased the automobile and when it was registered in her name in 1935 and in 1936. She could not operate an automobile and it was obviously contemplated that her automobile would be kept in Holliston, would be operated by her son and mostly within this Commonwealth. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>she came to Holliston to occupy her room in her son\u2019s house she travelled in her automobile. Subsidiary findings of the auditor warranted a finding that \u201cUnion Street, Holliston, Mass.\u201d was in fact a \u201cplace of residence\u201d of the plaintiff within the meaning of that phrase of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The terms of the plaintiff\u2019s application or of her certificate are not set out in full in the auditor\u2019s report. The statute provides that her \u201caddress\u201d should be given, and the auditor apparently found that a statement of her \u201cmail address\u201d was required in the application and in the certificate. In either case it cannot be said that, as matter of law, the defendant sustained the burden of proving that the address given was improper. The purpose of the statute requiring a statement of \u201cplace of residence\u201d and \u201caddress\u201d in an application and certificate has often been said to be that a person interested in ascertaining the identity of a motor vehicle or of its owner, may readily do so. <em>Di Cecca </em>v. <em>Bucci, </em>278 Mass. 15, 16. <em>Topf </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>288 Mass. 552, 554. <em>Sanjean </em>v. <em>Hyman, </em>302 Mass. 224, 226, and cases cited. On facts found by the auditor, a conclusion was warranted that the purpose of the statute was met by the statement in the application and in the certificate, that \u201cUnion Street, Holliston, Mass.\u201d was a \u201cplace of residence\u201d and the \u201caddress\u201d of the plaintiff, within the meaning of those words of the statute. It could be found that there she had a \u201cplace of residence.\u201d There lived her son who regularly operated the automobile and there the automobile was kept. A finding was warranted that the identity of the automobile and its owner could be determined more readily from the address given in the application and in the certificate by persons likely to be interested than if she had given the only other \u201caddress\u201d which she could have given, that is, the address of her place of domicil in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The present case is distinguishable in its facts from cases where the application or certificate fails to show the place of residence or the address of the registrant <em>(Crean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>292 Mass. 226); and from cases where the application or certificate fails to state <em>(LeBlanc </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Cutler Co. </em>305 Mass. 283) or misstates <em>(Cray </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>299 Mass. 105) the municipality where the registrant lives; and from a case where, though the name of the street where the registrant lives is correctly stated in the application and certificate, a wrong street number is given and inquiry at that number would not disclose where the registrant could be found. <em>Lappanasse </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>297 Mass. 290. In the present case the application and the certificate stated the residence and the address of the plaintiff to be \u201cUnion Street, Holliston, Mass.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate the length of the street, or how many houses were on it, or that the house of the plaintiff\u2019s son or other houses thereon, if any there were, bore numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">5. There was no error in the refusal of the judge to give five rulings requested by the defendant. It was not necessary, as requests numbered 2 and 5 assume, that the plaintiff should have either a \u201cpermanent residence\u201d or a \u201cdomicil\u201d in Holliston in order to have a legal registration of her automobile in Massachusetts. The seventh ruling requested by the defendant was in effect that the plaintiff was a \u201cnon-resident\u201d of this Commonwealth when her automobile was registered in 1936. The word \u201cnonresident\u201d where it appears in our automobile statutes means: \u201cany person whose legal residence is not within the commonwealth.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 1. The propriety of the plaintiff\u2019s registration of her automobile in Massachusetts did not depend on the place of her legal residence. The defendant\u2019s requests numbered 10 and 11 were, in substance, that if the plaintiff in her application for registration stated a residence which was \u201ctemporary,\u201d or, if Holliston was a \u201ctemporary\u201d residence of the plaintiff when her automobile was registered, it was not legally registered. Without a definition of the meaning of the vague word \u201ctemporary,\u201d these requests were rightly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The defendant took a general exception to the \u201centire section of the judge\u2019s charge having to do with domicil, residence and occupancy.\u201d The section of the charge referred to covers several pages in the printed record. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>defendant did not specify any particular portions of the charge which he deemed objectionable. Such an exception should not be sustained. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Lynn Fire &amp; Police Notification Co. Inc. </em>292 Mass. 165, and cases cited. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Benson Coal Co. </em>301 Mass. 145, 150, 151. <em>Kingsbury </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>300 Mass. 516, 518-519.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
