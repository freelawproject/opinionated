Rather, a firefighter may only bring a CPLR article 78 proceeding. This Court\u2019s 1999 unanimous decision in <em>Matter of Montella v Bratton </em>(93 NY2d 424 [1999]), which pertained to the identical issue as here but with respect to police officer disciplinary determinations, is dispositive. <em>(Matter of Finegan v Cohen, </em>275 NY 432; <em>Burke v Kern, </em>287 NY 203; <em>Matter of City of New York v MacDonald, </em>201 AD2d 258, 83 NY2d 759; <em>Ferrin v New York State Dept. of Correctional Servs., </em>71 NY2d 42; <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. of City of N.Y. v City of New York, </em>41 NY2d 205; <em>Rangolan v County of Nassau, </em>96 NY2d 42; <em>Riley v County of Broome, </em>95 NY2d 455; <em>People v Brancoccio, </em>83 NY2d 638; <em>Matter of Tucker v Board of Educ., </em>82 NY2d 274; <em>Doctors Council v New York City Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>71 NY2d 669.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b286-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b286-5\">R.S. Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">In <em>Matter of Montella v Bratton </em>(93 NY2d 424 [1999]) we held that uniformed police officers disciplined pursuant to section 14-115 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York could not appeal their discipline to the New York City Civil Service Commission. We hold today that the same rule applies to firefighters disciplined pursuant to section 15-113 of the Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">Firefighter Robert Joel was charged with violating Fire Department regulations by calling in two false alarms. At a hearing before an administrative law judge, Joel admitted his guilt and the judge recommended that he be terminated from his position with the department. The Fire Commissioner adopted the recommendation, and ordered termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Joel sought to appeal this ruling to the New York City Civil Service Commission. The Civil Service Commission ordered the parties to brief the question of whether it had jurisdiction over the appeal, and after receiving the briefs determined that it did. The Fire Commissioner then filed the present CPLR article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the Civil Service Commission\u2019s determination. Supreme Court upheld the Civil Service Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sion\u2019s jurisdiction, and dismissed the article 78 proceeding. The Appellate Division reversed, holding in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion that <em>Montella </em>was controlling. We agree with the Appellate Division and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Civil Service Commission claims jurisdiction here pursuant to Civil Service Law \u00a7 76 (1), which permits an appeal to that Commission from punishment \u201cimposed pursuant to the provisions of section seventy-five of this chapter.\u201d Thus the dis-positive issue is whether Joel was disciplined pursuant to Civil Service Law \u00a7 75, which prescribes certain procedures for the removal or penalizing of civil servants charged with \u201cincompetency or misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We held in <em>Montella </em>that Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 76 did not apply to Police Department discipline because we found in provisions of the New York City Charter and Administrative Code a legislative direction that such discipline be left to the discretion of the Police Commissioner, subject only to review by the courts under article 78. Specifically, we relied on NY City Charter \u00a7 434 (a), which provides that the Police Commissioner \u201cshall have cognizance and control of the government, administration, disposition and discipline of the department, and of the police force of the department\u201d; and on Administrative Code \u00a7 14-115 (a), providing that the Police Commissioner \u201cshall have power, in his or her discretion ... to punish the offending party\u201d in specified ways. Since these provisions were in existence before Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 76 were enacted, and since Civil Service Law \u00a7 76 (4) provides that \u201c[n]othing contained in section seventy-five or seventy-six of this chapter shall be construed to repeal or modify any general, special or local law or charter provision relating to the removal or suspension of officers or employees . . . ,\u201d we concluded that the Civil Service Law sections did not affect the Police Commissioner\u2019s power to discipline police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">The Charter and Administrative Code provisions applicable to Fire Department discipline closely parallel those on which we relied in <em>Montella. </em>The relevant Charter provision, section 487 (a), is even more strongly worded than NY City Charter \u00a7 434 (a). While the latter provision, governing Police Department discipline, refers to \u201ccognizance and control,\u201d section 487 (a) provides that the Fire Commissioner \u201cshall have sole and exclusive power and perform all duties for the government, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>cipline, management, maintenance and direction of the fire department.\u201d The Administrative Code section governing Fire Department discipline is section 15-113, which uses the same words quoted above from Administrative Code \u00a7 14-115. Section 15-113, like its counterpart applicable to the police, says that the Commissioner \u201cshall have power, in his or her discretion ... to punish the offending party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Since the Charter and Code provisions governing Fire Department discipline, like those governing Police Department discipline, were in existence before Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a775 and 76 were enacted, the saving clause of Civil Service Law \u00a7 76 (4), providing that neither section 75 nor section 76 \u201cshall be construed to repeal or modify\u201d other laws, is applicable here as it was in <em>Montella. </em>Fire Department discipline, like Police Department discipline, is outside the scope of Civil Service Law \u00a7\u00a7 75 and 76 and thus not subject to the jurisdiction of the Civil Service Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The Civil Service Commission and Supreme Court found <em>Montella </em>to be distinguishable because in <em>Montella </em>we relied on two provisions of law that have no counterpart here: Civil Service Law \u00a7 75 (3-a), which specifically provides that the Police Commissioner \u201cmay punish [a] police officer pursuant to the provisions of sections 14-115 and 14-123 of the administrative code of the city of New York,\u201d and Administrative Code \u00a7 14-116, which authorizes the bringing of an article 78 proceeding within four months to review discipline imposed by the Police Commissioner. But while section 75 (3-a) and section 14-116 supported our holding in <em>Montella, </em>they were not indispensable to it, for the reasons explained by the Appellate Division opinion in the present case. In <em>Montella, </em>sections 75 (3-a) and 14-116 provided confirmation of what other legislative provisions also made clear: that Police Department discipline was not subject to Civil Service Commission review. Even without corresponding confirmatory evidence, we reach the same conclusion with respect to the Fire Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and Read concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
