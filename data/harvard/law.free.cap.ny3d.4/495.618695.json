Consequently, the Appellate Division erred in dismissing the People\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order. <em>(People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d 8; <em>People v Laing, </em>79 NY2d 166; <em>People v McDonald, </em>68 NY2d 1; <em>People v Carthrens, </em>171 AD2d 387; <em>People v Carter, </em>63 NY2d 530; <em>People v Fai Cheung, </em>247 AD2d 405; <em>Matter of Theroux v Reilly, </em>1 NY3d 232; <em>Matter of Jose R., </em>83 NY2d 388; <em>People v Sanchez, </em>276 AD2d 723; <em>People v Rice, </em>199 AD2d 1054.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-9\"><em>Feldman and Feldman, </em>Uniondale <em>(Steven A.

We conclude that such an appeal is not authorized by the Criminal Procedure Law and must instead be challenged in a CPLR article 78 proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-13\">Defendant was charged with murder and related offenses stemming from her alleged participation in a shooting outside a Brooklyn nightclub. She was convicted of murder in the second degree and moved to set aside the verdict under CPL 330.30. Supreme Court denied the motion but nevertheless overturned the verdict sua sponte. Relying on Judiciary Law \u00a7 2-b (3) in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>procedure that the trial judge recognized to be \u201chighly unusual,\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the court vacated defendant\u2019s conviction on the ground that defense counsel had failed to meaningfully represent defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The People\u2019s appeal from the order was dismissed by the Appellate Division. The Court concluded that the Criminal Procedure Law does not authorize an appeal by the People from an order setting aside a verdict made on a trial court\u2019s own motion. The Appellate Division adhered to its determination on reargument. A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">It is well settled that \u201c[n]o appeal lies from a determination made in a criminal proceeding unless specifically provided for by statute\u201d <em>(People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d 8, 10 [2002]). CPL 450.20 delineates the orders that may be appealed by the People to an intermediate appellate court. As relevant to this case, subdivision (3) of the statute authorizes a People\u2019s appeal from \u201c[a]n order setting aside a verdict, entered pursuant to section 330.30 or 370.10\u201d of the Criminal Procedure Law. The trial court\u2019s order in this case, however, was premised on Judiciary Law \u00a7 2-b (3), which is not one of the enumerated statutory predicates for an appeal by the People. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s order was facially nonappealable under CPL 450.20 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The People, recognizing that the trial court relied upon Judiciary Law \u00a7 2-b (3) to set aside the verdict, contend that the court\u2019s order should be deemed to have been made pursuant to CPL 330.30 because it was based on the ineffective assistance of counsel, a claim that could have been reviewed on direct appeal. In light of the unequivocal declaration by the trial court that it was not relying on CPL 330.30, we will \u201c \u2018not resort to interpretative contrivances to broaden the scope and application\u2019 \u201d of CPL 450.20 <em>(People v Hernandez, </em>98 NY2d at 10, quoting <em>People v Laing, </em>79 NY2d 166, 170-171 [1992]), especially when an adequate legal remedy aside from a direct appeal was available to the People. As we explained in <em>Matter of Pirro v Angiolillo </em>(89 NY2d 351 [1996]), the People may seek a writ of prohibition in a CPLR article 78 proceeding when a trial court clearly acts in excess of its authorized powers and there is \u201cno adequate remedy at law\u201d to address the People\u2019s grievance <em>(id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>at 359). Here, as in <em>Pirro, </em>the proper vehicle for the People to challenge Supreme Court\u2019s order was an article 78 proceeding, not a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\"> Judiciary Law \u00a7 2-b (3) provides that a court may \u201cdevise and make new process and forms of proceedings, necessary to carry into effect the powers and jurisdiction possessed by it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
