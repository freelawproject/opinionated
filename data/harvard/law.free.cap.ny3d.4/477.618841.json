As the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division correctly held, the Fire Department can properly redact the callers\u2019 words from the records of the 911 telephone calls before disclosing those records.

II. As the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division correctly held, the Fire Department can properly redact intra-agency materials from the records of the dispatch calls and of the oral histories before disclosing those records. The Fire Department did show that the intra-agency materials exemption under the Freedom of Information Law authorizes such redaction. <em>(Matter of Gould v New York City Police Dept, </em>89 NY2d 267; <em>Matter of Russo v Nassau County Community Coll., </em>81 NY2d 690; <em>Matter of Morgan v New York State Dept, of Envtl.

III. The Appellate Division erred as a matter of law in holding that the Fire Department could not, prior to disclosure, redact from the records of the oral histories passages recounting moments of high emotion and revealing personal details. Such material comes within the exemption for personal privacy. <em>(Matter of Encore Coll. Bookstores v Auxiliary Serv. Corp. of State Univ. of N.Y. at Farmingdale, </em>87 NY2d 410.) IV Contrary to the holdings of the Supreme Court and the Appellate Division, the Fire Department did show that the law enforcement exemption under the Freedom of Information Law applied to the records at issue. The Fire Department compiled these records for law enforcement purposes, namely, at the request of the prosecution in the Zacar\u00edas Moussaoui criminal case. Disclosure of the records that may be offered into evidence at trial would interfere with the Moussaoui trial and endanger Moussaoui\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>(John Doe Agency v John Doe Corp., </em>493 US 146.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-5\"><em>Norman Siegel, </em>New York City, and <em>Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel LLP (Thomas H.

Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The issue here is whether the New York City Fire Department is required by the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) to disclose tapes and transcripts of certain conversations that occurred on and shortly after September 11, 2001. Supreme Court and the Appellate Division held that FOIL requires disclosure of some, but not all, of the materials in dispute. We affirm most of the rulings below, but we modify the Appellate Division\u2019s order in two respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Some four months after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Jim Dwyer, a New York Times reporter, requested \u201cvarious records\u201d from the Fire Department. In the two requests that are still disputed, he asked for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u201cAll transcripts of interviews conducted by the department with members of the FDNY concerning the events of Sept. 11, 2001. (These might be called \u2018oral histories.\u2019) . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-9\">\u201cAny and all tapes and transcripts of any and all radio communications involving any FDNY personnel on Sept. 11, starting from 8:46 AM.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">The Fire Department denied the first of the above requests, and also denied the second in large part. As a result, three categories of tapes and transcripts are now at issue. They contain: (1) calls made on September 11 to the Department\u2019s 911 emergency service; (2) calls made on the same day on the Fire Department\u2019s internal communications system, involving Department dispatchers and other employees, which are referred to as \u201cdispatch calls\u201d; and (3) \u201coral histories,\u201d consisting of interviews with firefighters in the days following September 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">The New York Times and Dwyer brought this CPLR article 78 proceeding to compel disclosure. Later, family members of eight men who died at the World Trade Center were permitted to intervene in support of the Times\u2019s and Dwyer\u2019s position. No family member of anyone else killed in the September 11 attacks has appeared on either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Supreme Court ordered disclosure of tapes and transcripts containing: (1) the 911 calls, to the extent that the words recorded are those of public employees and of the eight men whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>survivors sought disclosure, but redacted to delete the words of other people who called 911; (2) the dispatch calls, redacted to delete the opinions and recommendations of Fire Department employees; and (3) the oral histories, redacted to delete opinions and recommendations and the \u201cpersonal expressions of feelings\u201d of the interviewees. The Appellate Division affirmed these rulings, except that it ordered the \u201cpersonal expressions of feelings\u201d in the oral histories disclosed. We granted both sides\u2019 motions for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In this Court, the Times, Dwyer and the interveners seek disclosure of all materials in all three categories. The Fire Department asks us to affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order with two exceptions: It asks us to \u201creinstate\u201d Supreme Court\u2019s ruling by authorizing the redaction from the oral histories of \u201cpassages recounting moments of high emotion and revealing personal details,\u201d and it asks that disclosure be denied as to six records said by the United States Department of Justice to be possible exhibits in the impending federal criminal trial of Zacar\u00edas Moussaoui, who is alleged to have had a role in the September 11 attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">We now affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s order with two modifications: (1) we direct that the entire oral histories be disclosed, except for specifically-identified portions that can be shown likely to cause serious pain or embarrassment to an interviewee; and (2) we direct that the Department of Justice be given a chance to demonstrate that disclosure of the six potential exhibits would interfere with the Moussaoui case, or would deprive either the United States Government or Moussaoui of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">FOIL requires state and municipal agencies to \u201cmake available for public inspection and copying all records,\u201d subject to 10 exceptions (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2]). Here, the Fire Department relies on three of those exceptions\u2014the \u201cprivacy,\u201d \u201claw enforcement\u201d and \u201cintra-agency\u201d exceptions. To the extent they are relevant here, these exceptions permit agencies to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\u201cdeny access to records or portions thereof that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u201c(b) if disclosed would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>subdivision two of section eighty-nine of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">\u201c(e) are compiled for law enforcement purposes and which, if disclosed, would:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">\u201ci. interfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cii. deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication; . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201c(g) are inter-agency or intra-agency materials which are not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">\u201ci. statistical or factual tabulations or data; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cii. instructions to staff that affect the public.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">The Fire Department contends that the privacy exception applies to the portions of the 911 calls that are in dispute; that the intra-agency exception applies to the disputed portions of the dispatch calls; and that both these exceptions apply to portions of the oral histories. The Department also contends that the law enforcement exception applies to the six potential exhibits at the Moussaoui trial, but it does not identify those six exhibits or say which categories they belong to. Thus, we first consider the application of the privacy and intra-agency exceptions to each category of materials, and then discuss the law enforcement exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">A. The 911 Calls</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">The Fire Department does not now oppose disclosure of the words spoken in the 911 calls by 911 operators, or by the eight men whose families are seeking disclosure. Thus, the only issue before us is whether the disclosure of words spoken by other callers would constitute an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Supreme Court and the Appellate Division both held that it would, and, in view of the extraordinary facts in this case, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">We first reject the argument, advanced by the parties seeking disclosure here, that no privacy interest exists in the feelings and experiences of people no longer living. The privacy exception, it is argued, does not protect the dead, and their survivors cannot claim \u201cprivacy\u201d for experiences and feelings that are not their own. We think this argument contradicts the common understanding of the word \u201cprivacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Almost everyone, surely, wants to keep from public view some aspects not only of his or her own life, but of the lives of loved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ones who have died. It is normal to be appalled if intimate moments in the life of one\u2019s deceased child, wife, husband or other close relative become publicly known, and an object of idle curiosity or a source of titillation. The desire to preserve the dignity of human existence even when life has passed is the sort of interest to which legal protection is given under the name of privacy. We thus hold that surviving relatives have an interest protected by FOIL in keeping private the affairs of the dead <em>(cf. National Archives and Records Admin, v Favish, </em>541 US 157 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The recognition that surviving relatives have a legally protected privacy interest, however, is only the beginning of the inquiry. We must decide whether disclosure of the tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls would injure that interest, or the comparable interest of people who called 911 and survived, and whether the injury to privacy would be \u201cunwarranted\u201d within the meaning of FOIL\u2019S privacy exception. Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (b), which creates the privacy exception, refers to section 89 (2), which contains a partial definition of \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u201d but section 89 (2) (b) is of little help here; it says only that \u201c[a]n unwarranted invasion of personal privacy includes, but shall not be limited to\u201d six specific kinds of disclosure. None of the six is relevant to this case, and so we must decide whether any invasion of privacy here is \u201cunwarranted\u201d by balancing the privacy interests at stake against the public interest in disclosure of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The privacy interests in this case are compelling. The 911 calls at issue undoubtedly contain, in many cases, the words of people confronted, without warning, with the prospect of imminent death. Those words are likely to include expressions of the terror and agony the callers felt and of their deepest feelings about what their lives and their families meant to them. The grieving family of such a caller\u2014or the caller, if he or she survived\u2014might reasonably be deeply offended at the idea that these words could be heard on television or read in the New York Times.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We do not imply that there is a privacy interest of comparable strength in all tapes and transcripts of calls made to 911. Two factors make the September 11 911 calls different. First, while some other 911 callers may be in as desperate straits as those who called on September 11, many are not. Secondly, the September 11 callers were part of an event that has received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>and will continue to receive enormous\u2014perhaps literally unequalled\u2014public attention. Many millions of people have reacted, and will react, to the callers\u2019 fate with horrified fascination. Thus it is highly likely in this case\u2014more than in almost any other imaginable\u2014that, if the tapes and transcripts are made public, they will be replayed and republished endlessly, and .that in some cases they will be exploited by media seeking to deliver sensational fare to their audience. This is the sort of invasion that the privacy exception exists to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We acknowledge that not everyone will have the same reaction to disclosure of the 911 tapes. The intervenors in this case, whose husbands and sons died at the World Trade Center, favor disclosure. They may feel, as other survivors may also, that to make their loved ones\u2019 last words public is a fitting way to allow the world to share the callers\u2019 sufferings, to admire their courage, and to be justly enraged by the crime that killed them. This normal human emotion is no less entitled to respect than a desire for privacy. Recognizing this, the Fire Department does not challenge the lower courts\u2019 rulings that the words of the eight relatives of the intervenors be disclosed, and has assured us that it will honor similar requests made in the future by the families of other September 11 callers. That commitment must be kept. Surviving callers who want disclosure are also entitled to it (Public Officers Law \u00a7 89 [2] [c] [ii]). But the privacy interests of those family members and surviving callers who do not want disclosure nevertheless remain powerful.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On the other hand, there is a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of these 911 calls. In general, it is desirable that the public know as much as possible about the terrible events of September 11. And more specifically, as the Times and Dwyer point out, the public has a legitimate interest in knowing how well or poorly the 911 system performed on that day. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, which had access to the tapes and transcripts at issue here, identified significant flaws in the system\u2019s performance (9/11 Commission Report, at 286-287, 295, 304, 318, available on the Internet at &lt;http://www.9-llcommission.gov&gt;, cached at &lt;http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/webdocs/fullreport.pdf&gt;), and more public scrutiny might make these problems better understood. But the parties seeking disclosure here do not request only particular calls that may be relevant to this subject; they seek complete disclosure of all the 911 calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">We are not persuaded that such disclosure is required by the public interest. Those requesting it have not shown that the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>formation that will be disclosed under our ruling\u2014including the words of the 911 operators, and of callers whose survivors seek, or who themselves seek, disclosure\u2014will be insufficient to meet the public\u2019s need to be informed. We conclude that the public interest in the words of the 911 callers is outweighed by the interest in privacy of those family members and callers who prefer that those words remain private.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">B. The Dispatch Calls</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The dispatch calls are communications within the Fire Department; the only participants in the calls were Department dispatchers and other Department employees. The tapes and transcripts of these calls are therefore \u201cintra-agency materials,\u201d and are protected from disclosure by Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 (2) (g) unless they fit within one of two exclusions from the intra-agency exception: the exclusions for \u201cstatistical or factual tabulations or data\u201d (\u00a7 87 [2] [g] [i]) and for \u201cinstructions to staff that affect the public\u201d (\u00a7 87 [2] [g] [ii]). We interpreted the first of these exclusions in <em>Matter of Gould v New York City Police Dept. </em>(89 NY2d 267, 277 [1996]), where we said that \u201c[f]actual data . . . simply means objective information, in contrast to opinions, ideas, or advice exchanged as part of the consultative or deliberative process of government decision making\u201d (citations omitted). Here, Supreme Court and the Appellate Division ordered that the dispatch calls be disclosed to the extent they consist of factual statements or instructions affecting the public, but that they be redacted to eliminate nonfactual material\u2014i.e., opinions and recommendations. This is, in our view, a straightforward and correct application of the statute as we interpreted it in <em>Gould.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The parties seeking disclosure argue otherwise, relying on cases in which we have characterized the intra-agency exception as being applicable to \u201c \u2018deliberative material,\u2019 i.e., communications exchanged for discussion purposes not constituting final policy decisions\u201d <em>(Matter of Russo v Nassau County Community Coll., </em>81 NY2d 690, 699 [1993], citing <em>Matter of Xerox Corp. v Town of Webster, </em>65 NY2d 131 [1985]). In <em>Russo </em>and <em>Xerox, </em>however, we were concerned with materials that were arguably not \u201cintra-agency\u201d at all\u2014in <em>Russo, </em>films shown by a public college to its students, and in <em>Xerox, </em>a report prepared for a public agency by an outside consultant. In deciding that the films were not intra-agency materials, and that the report was, we relied on the facts that the films were not used by the college as part of an internal decision-making process, while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>report was used for just that purpose. Neither case implies that materials that fit squarely within the plain meaning of \u201cintraagency\u201d\u2014in this case, tapes and transcripts of internal conversations about the agency\u2019s work\u2014are not within the scope of the intra-agency exception to FOIL.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The parties seeking disclosure also rely on our reference in <em>Gould </em>to \u201cthe consultative or deliberative process of government decision making\u201d (81 NY2d at 277). But we used those words in <em>Gould </em>simply to define the scope of the \u201cfactual data\u201d exclusion from the intra-agency exception; we spoke of \u201cobjective information, in contrast to\u201d exchanges that were part of \u201cthe consultative or deliberative process.\u201d <em>(Id.) Gould </em>does not hold, as the parties seeking disclosure seem to suggest, that the intra-agency exception shields from disclosure only formal, lengthy or profound policy discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The point of the intra-agency exception is to permit people within an agency to exchange opinions, advice and criticism freely and frankly, without the chilling prospect of public disclosure <em>(see Xerox, </em>65 NY2d at 132, citing <em>Matter of Sea Crest Constr. Corp. v Stubing, </em>82 AD2d 546, 549 [2d Dept 1981]). This purpose applies not only to comments made in official policy meetings and well-considered memorandums, but also to suggestions and criticisms offered with little chance for reflection in moments of crisis. A Fire Department dispatcher who believes that a rescue operation is being badly handled should feel free to say so without the concern that a tape of his or her remarks will be made public.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">C. The Oral Histories</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The record here leads us to conclude, subject to the qualification discussed below, that the oral histories are not protected from disclosure by either the privacy or the intra-agency exception. We infer from the record that the oral histories were exactly what their name implies\u2014spoken words recorded for the benefit of posterity\u2014and that the Department intended, and the people , interviewed for these histories understood or reasonably should have understood, that the words spoken were destined for public disclosure. If this inference is correct, the privacy exception obviously has no application here. Nor does the intra-agency exception apply where, though agency employees are speaking to each other, the agency and the employees understand and intend that a tape of the conversation will be made public. The point of the intra-agency exception, as we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>explained above, is to permit the internal exchange of candid advice and opinions between agency employees. The exception is not applicable to words that are intended to be passed on verbatim to the world at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The record evidence about the purpose and origin of the oral histories comes largely from an affidavit submitted by a representative of the Fire Department. The affidavit adopts the title \u201coral histories,\u201d previously used in Dwyer\u2019s request, to identify these materials, and says that after September 11 the Fire Department decided \u201cto promptly record the recollections of Fire Department personnel who were present at the World Trade Center site on that day.\u201d These recollections, the affidavit says, were collected for two purposes: \u201cto be an invaluable historical record, in addition to assisting in any investigations or assessments of the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Fire Department\u2019s affidavit also says that all interviewees \u201cwere assured that the interviews would be held in complete confidence.\u201d This statement, if true, would be highly relevant to this case\u2014but it was later acknowledged to be in error. The parties stipulated that the Fire Department \u201chas withdrawn its claim that each of these interviews (\u2018oral histories\u2019) with Fire Dept, personnel was recorded with a promise of confidentiality to the interviewee, since it has come to the [Department\u2019s] attention that only some interviews included such a promise.\u201d After the stipulation, the Fire Department made no attempt to substantiate even the claim that \u201csome\u201d interviewees were promised confidentiality. The Department does not now rely on the existence of any such promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">While the record is less clear than it might be, it establishes that the interviews were intended as an \u201chistorical record\u201d\u2014 which implies that the interviews would be disclosed to the public. If that is the case, they should not be protected from disclosure merely because they also were, as the Fire Department says, intended to be used in \u201cinvestigations or assessments.\u201d The record does not show that any interviewee was given a promise of confidentiality or led to believe that his or her words would be kept secret. Thus, the best inference is that the Department intended, and the interviewees knew or should have known, that the words spoken in the interviews would become a public record. If this is not true the burden was on the Department\u2014which is in possession of the relevant facts\u2014to prove otherwise <em>(see Matter of Newsday, Inc. v Empire State Dev. Corp., </em>98 NY2d 359, 362 [2002]; <em>Matter of Mantica v New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>York State Dept, of Health, </em>94 NY2d 58, 61 [1999]). The Department has not met that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">This logic leads to the conclusion that all of the oral histories are discloseable under FOIL. We add one qualification, however, because we are given pause by the Fire Department\u2019s insistence that \u201cthe oral histories contain numerous statements which are exceedingly personal in nature, describing the interviewees\u2019 intimate emotions such as fears, concern for themselves and loved ones, and horror at what they saw and heard.\u201d If indeed some firefighters made such statements in what they were led to believe was a private setting, it may be unfair to invade their privacy based solely on the inadequacy of the evidence the Department has submitted. We therefore direct that the Department be given an opportunity, on remand, to call to Supreme Court\u2019s attention specific portions of the oral histories which, in the Fire Department\u2019s view, would cause serious pain or embarrassment to interviewees if they were disclosed. Supreme Court should then consider, following an in camera inspection if necessary, whether those portions of the oral histories are subject to the privacy exception, taking into account any further evidence that may be submitted on the question of whether the interviewees thought the interviews were private.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">D. The Law Enforcement Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">As to the six unidentified tapes and/or transcripts which the United States Department of Justice has said it intends to use in evidence at the trial of Zacar\u00edas Moussaoui, the issue is whether they were \u201ccompiled for law enforcement purposes\u201d and whether their disclosure would either \u201cinterfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial proceedings\u201d or would \u201cdeprive a person of a right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication.\u201d We agree with the courts below that, on this record, there is no showing that disclosure would interfere with the Moussaoui trial or cause any unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The materials in issue are already in the Justice Department\u2019s possession, and have been made available to Moussaoui; thus their public disclosure would not give the equivalent of discovery to either side in the criminal case. Theoretically, their disclosure before Moussaoui\u2019s jury is selected might create some prejudice among potential jurors. But the items cannot, by their nature, contain anything specifically relating to Moussaoui; they relate to the September 11 events generally. Potential jurors are already exposed to an enormous mass of publicly available infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>mation about the events of September 11\u2014most of which obviously will not be offered in evidence at the Moussaoui trial. In this context, it is hard to see how the public disclosure of six items that the jury will see at trial anyway could have any significant effect on the federal court\u2019s ability to impanel an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In short, the record would justify affirming the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling that the law enforcement exception does not apply to the records in issue. Once again, however, we qualify our conclusion, because we are mindful of the enormous importance to the public interest of an orderly and fair trial for Moussaoui. The federal court has shown some concern about pretrial publicity; it has entered an order, binding on the parties to the Moussaoui case\u2014though not, of course, on the Fire Department or the Times\u2014prohibiting disclosure of \u201cdiscovery materials\u201d produced by the prosecutors to Moussaoui and his counsel. It may be that there is some good reason, not apparent from the record before us, why the disclosure of the six potential exhibits at issue here would create problems in the criminal case, and it can do no harm for the Department of Justice to have an opportunity to point out such a good reason to Supreme Court. If such a submission is made, Supreme Court should decide, in light of the additional information submitted and following an in camera inspection if necessary, whether the potential exhibits are subject to the law enforcement exception to FOIL.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should, be modified to the extent described in this opinion, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b555-8\">Rosenblatt, J. (dissenting in part).</author>\n<p id=\"AXS\">I disagree with the majority only with respect to the 911 calls. The Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requires more disclosure. The public is well aware of the function of the 911 system and the sort of information it is designed to relay. Ordinarily, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in a call to 911, and the full contents are generally subject to disclosure under FOIL.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Here, because of the unique nature of the attack, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>has ordered disclosure of words spoken by the operators, while deleting the words of the callers. There is, of course, a need to balance the competing public and private interests. On the side of full disclosure lies the public\u2019s interest in a complete and coherent account of what happened on September 11, 2001. FOIL\u2019S goal of making information public is inhibited when only half the conversation is divulged. The value of a response is compromised when the words that prompt the response are deleted. In some instances, the thrust of an incomplete communication can be inferred or constructed; in others it will be incoherent or even misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The public interest supports disclosure broader than the Court has allowed. September 11th is a date burned in the minds of Americans, an event in which our security was profoundly violated. Precisely because of the importance of the September 11th attacks, Americans deserve to have as full an account of that event as can be responsibly furnished. Indisputably, the 911 tapes would shed light on the effectiveness of the City\u2019s disaster response. In turn, the City (and other municipalities) may adopt response plans that take into account the lessons of September 11th. This will surely save lives in the event of future disasters or emergencies. Indeed, the public report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States found various inadequacies in the City\u2019s 911 system and clearly found value in reviewing the 911 tapes (see 9/11 Commission Report, at 286-296, available on the Internet at chttp:// www.9-llcommission.gov&gt;, cached at chttp://www.courts. state.ny.us/reporter/webdocs/fullreport.pdf&gt;).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Balanced against disclosure is FOIL\u2019S narrow exception for an \u201cunwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u201d (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87 [2] [b]; \u00a7 89 [2] [b]). I agree with the Court that those who suffered the loss of loved ones could be traumatized by the disclosure of tapes that identify victims and contain dramatic, highly personal utterances different from ordinary 911 calls. Not every call, however, falls into that category. But for their connection with September 11th, many of the calls in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>are ordinary 911 calls: people reporting factual information and seeking help.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notably, the City has not provided any affidavits from survivors or victims\u2019 family members suggesting that disclosure of 911 tapes, or any other material sought, would violate their privacy. The record contains only the opposite: affidavits from nine intervenors, family members who want full disclosure. Nevertheless, I do not challenge the majority\u2019s assumption that full disclosure would cause considerable anguish to many victims\u2019 families.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Even so, the goals of privacy and openness can both be met by additional, limited disclosure. I would expand the majority\u2019s ruling and release a written transcript of the callers\u2019 side of the 911 conversations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The City could redact everything that would identify nonofficial callers in calls that have some unusually personal component, such as an expression of dying wishes to be relayed to family members, as opposed to the ordinary reporting of crime scene facts. With such calls, the City should, however, be allowed to withhold any utterance that would by name or other means identify the caller. The public interest would be served by meaningful disclosure, while the grieving families and friends of the callers would be spared the agony of having their personal lives and emotions thrust into the public realm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">My final thought relates to the performance of the firefighters, police officers and others who spearheaded the rescue efforts. It may well be that the 911 transcripts reveal imperfections or mistakes amid the chaos. This, however, is no reason to withhold the transcripts. On the contrary, they will give the public the clearest picture of how the first responders reacted, and that picture should be as comprehensive as possible. The revelation of any deficiencies on the part of the departments or their personnel is essential to improving and enhancing lifesaving procedures. Of course, no one can rightly expect perfection and exquisite orderliness in the face of an attack as horrific as this one. Exposing mistakes may prove discomforting, but this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>will pale in the face of the unforgettable heroics that we will always associate with September 11th. For every person critical of an error or omission, ten thousand voices will rise up in praise of the firefighters, police officers and others who risked life and limb in the line of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Judges G.B.

Other courts considering the availability of 911 calls under FOIL have uniformly required their disclosure, and the majority appears to be in agreement in the ordinary case <em>(see </em>majority op at 484). In <em>State ex rel. Cincin</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>nati Enquirer v Hamilton County </em>(75 Ohio St 3d 374, 377-378, 662 NE2d 334, 337 [1996]), the Ohio Supreme Court held that there was no expectation of privacy in a 911 call and, accordingly, ordered the release of 911 tapes under that state\u2019s version of FOIL. It further held that the tapes became public records at the moment they were made and that their content was irrelevant <em>(see </em>75 Ohio St 3d at 378, 662 NE2d at 337). In accord are <em>Meredith Corp. v City of Flint </em>(256 Mich App 703, 708-709, 671 NW2d 101, 104-105 [2003]), <em>Asbury Park Press v Lakewood Twp.
