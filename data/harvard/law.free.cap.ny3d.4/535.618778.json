III. A peace officer who takes advantage of his apparent authority to effect an unauthorized arrest and investigation of a citizen by utilizing a patrol vehicle with activated emergency lights, by interrogating and removing the person from his vehicle and searching the person may not have the seized evidence admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>as the product of a hypothetical \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d <em>(People v Stith, </em>69 NY2d 313; <em>People v Adams, </em>53 NY2d 241; <em>People v Mendez, </em>28 NY2d 94; <em>People v Di Stefano, </em>38 NY2d 640; <em>People v Roth, </em>66 NY2d 688; <em>People v Knapp, </em>52 NY2d 689; <em>People v Payton, </em>45 NY2d 300; <em>People v Fitzpatrick, </em>32 NY2d 499; <em>People v Harris, </em>77 NY2d 434, 495 US 14; <em>People v Ingle, </em>36 NY2d 413.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b601-6\">Graffeo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">While patrolling a housing project, two peace officers employed by the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority observed defendant driving an automobile on a public street adjacent to the project. The officers stopped defendant because he allegedly was not wearing a seat belt. After defendant informed the officers that he did not have a valid driver\u2019s license, the officers ordered him to step out of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In response to questioning by an officer, defendant replied in a manner that led the officer to suspect that defendant had an object in his mouth. Defendant opened his mouth, revealing what appeared to be a plastic bag protruding from underneath his tongue. When asked to lift his tongue, defendant shoved the officer and fled. Upon being apprehended after a brief chase, defendant spit the bag onto the ground. The bag, which was recovered by the officers, appeared to contain crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">As a result of this incident, defendant was indicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree and several violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Before trial, defendant moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the initial seizure for a traffic infraction was unlawful because the Housing Authority peace officers lacked jurisdiction outside the boundaries of the housing project and the officers were not acting pursuant to their special duties as Housing Authority peace officers when they stopped him for a seat belt violation. The People countered that the seizure was lawful because the peace officers were within their geographical jurisdiction and, even if they were not, the stop was justified as a \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Supreme Court agreed with defendant and dismissed the charges. The court concluded that there was no statutory authority for the peace officers to apprehend defendant for an offense committed outside their geographic area of employment and the People had failed to demonstrate that the officers were acting pursuant to their special duties when they stopped defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>dant for a seat belt violation. The court further rejected the People\u2019s contention that the traffic stop was a valid citizen\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">On the People\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed for the reasons stated by Supreme Court. A Judge of this Court granted leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Before this Court, the People concede that the alleged traffic infractions and the seizure of defendant occurred outside the geographical jurisdiction of the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority peace officers. Instead, the People rely on their assertion that the apprehension of defendant was the equivalent of a citizen\u2019s arrest. We are unpersuaded and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The Criminal Procedure Law differentiates between the respective powers of arrest possessed by peace officers and private citizens <em>(compare </em>CPL 140.25 and 140.27, <em>with </em>CPL 140.30, 140.35 and 140.40). In fact, the Legislature has specified that the authority to make a citizen\u2019s arrest extends only to a \u201cperson acting <em>other than as a police officer or a peace </em>officer\u201d (CPL 140.35, 140.40 [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Aside from this statutory distinction, there also are functional differences between the powers of peace officers and private citizens. A peace officer may arrest upon reasonable cause to believe an offense has occurred <em>(see </em>CPL 140.25 [1]), whereas a citizen\u2019s arrest is justifiable only if the arrestee \u201chas in fact committed\u201d an offense (CPL 140.30 [1]). Additionally, peace officers generally are authorized to apprehend an individual for criminal activity only when the offense is committed within the officer\u2019s \u201cgeographical area of . . . employment\u201d (CPL 140.25 [3] ) or when the officer acts \u201cpursuant to his special duties\u201d (CPL 140.25 [1]), unless the arrest is for a felony (CPL 140.25 [4] ). Similar limitations are not placed on the ability of a private citizen to make an arrest; the only limitation is that an arrest for a nonfelony offense occurring in the citizen\u2019s presence must be made \u201cin the county in which such offense was committed\u201d (CPL 140.30 [2]). To accept the People\u2019s argument and treat a peace officer as an ordinary citizen would render these purposefully drawn differences\u2014and the plain language chosen by the Legislature\u2014meaningless. This we decline to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">We therefore conclude that the traffic stop in this case cannot be validated using the citizen\u2019s arrest provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law because the Housing Authority peace officers were not \u201cacting other than as a police officer or a peace offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>cer\u201d (CPL 140.35, 140.40; <em>cf. McKinley v Commonwealth, </em>564 Pa 565, 583 n 18, 769 A2d 1153, 1164 n 18 [2001]; <em>People v Lahr, </em>147 Ill 2d 379, 383, 589 NE2d 539, 540-541 [1992]). This, of course, is not to say that an individual employed as a peace officer may never under any circumstances effect a citizen\u2019s arrest. We hold only that a peace officer who acts under color of law and with all the accouterments of official authority cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The People\u2019s remaining argument\u2014that despite the violation of CPL 140.25, suppression of evidence and dismissal of the charges is unnecessary under <em>People v Patterson </em>(78 NY2d 711 [1991])\u2014is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
