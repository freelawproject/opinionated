Specifically, we address whether \u201cpremises\u201d includes the land upon which the buildings are situated or only the buildings\u2019 interior space. We conclude that \u201cpremises\u201d as defined in the lease includes only the interior portions of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Pursuant to a 1981 agreement between the parties, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) leased certain space from South Road Associates (SRA) known as Buildings 952 and 982 located at 622 South Road in Poughkeepsie.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> IBM had occupied the same space since the 1950s under previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ownership and under earlier leases and had used the site for its commercial and manufacturing operations. During its occupancy of the site, IBM installed an underground storage tank to hold chemical waste. Through its own investigation, IBM discovered that the site\u2019s groundwater and soil had become contaminated by hazardous chemicals resulting from a leak in the storage tank. IBM then undertook an independent effort to clean up the site that included removal of the underground storage tank and contaminated soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In 1984, the parties entered into an agreement wherein IBM accepted responsibility for the pollution, agreed to hold SRA harmless for any resulting claims and agreed to \u201cabate\u201d the pollution \u201cto the satisfaction of all requisite governmental agencies\u201d and restore the land to its previous condition. After continuing remedial efforts, IBM petitioned the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) requesting that the site be reclassified from a class 2 (\u201cSignificant threat to the public health or environment\u2014action required\u201d) to a class 4 environmental hazard (\u201cSite properly closed\u2014requires continued management\u201d) (ECL 27-1305 [2] [b] [2], [4]). DEC approved the reclassification. The parties entered into a subsequent agreement in February 1994, at the termination of the lease, giving IBM a right of access to the site in order \u201cto maintain and operate\u201d its \u201cmonitoring wells and a groundwater \u2018Pump and Treat System.\u2019 \u201d SRA does not claim a breach of these two agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">SRA commenced this action against IBM in January 2000, alleging several causes of action including a claim for breach of contract.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, SRA claims a breach of article 7 of the lease which requires that the \u201cpremises\u201d be returned in \u201cgood order and condition.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> SRA claims that by contaminating some of the property\u2019s soil, bedrock and groundwater, IBM violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>its agreement to return the premises in \u201cgood order and condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">IBM moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint and SRA cross-moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability for breach of the lease provision. Supreme Court denied IBM\u2019s motion and granted SRA\u2019s cross motion. The court, allowing extrinsic evidence, found in SRA\u2019s favor, stating that the lease, read as a whole, \u201cconveys to IBM rights, obligations, use and occupancy of a leasehold that extends beyond space referenced in the document\u2019s single precatory paragraph.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">A majority of the Appellate Division reversed, determining that the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language of the lease demonstrated that the \u201cpremises\u201d consisted of the buildings\u2019 interior space (2 AD3d 829, 831 [2003]). One Justice dissented and voted to affirm, finding that IBM had occupied the entire property and was required pursuant to article 7 of the lease to return the entire property, rather than just the interior space, in good order and condition (2 AD3d at 833). We granted leave to appeal and now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In cases of contract interpretation, it is well settled that \u201c \u2018when parties set down their agreement in a clear, complete document, their writing should ... be enforced according to its terms\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v 538 Madison Realty Co., </em>1 NY3d 470, 475 [2004], quoting W.W.W. <em>Assoc, v Giancontieri, </em>77 NY2d 157, 162 [1990]). This principle is particularly important \u201c \u2018in the context of real property transactions, where commercial certainty is a paramount concern, and where . . . the instrument was negotiated between sophisticated, counseled business people negotiating at arm\u2019s length\u2019 \u201d <em>(Vermont Teddy Bear, </em>1 NY3d at 475, quoting <em>Matter of Wallace v 600 Partners Co., </em>86 NY2d 543, 548 [1995]). It is also important to read the document as a whole to ensure that excessive emphasis is not placed upon particular words or phrases <em>(see Matter of Westmoreland Coal Co. v Entech, Inc., </em>100 NY2d 352, 358 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The language of the lease makes clear that the term \u201cpremises\u201d was intended to include only the interior portions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>buildings. The lease states that the \u201cpremises\u201d is the space shown on the \u201cfloor plan\u201d consisting of a certain number of square feet \u201cin two buildings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Reading the lease as a whole also supports the interpretation that the term \u201cpremises\u201d refers only to the interior space. The lease repeatedly mentions the \u201cpremises\u201d separately from the water tower, appurtenances, land, parking lot and building. If \u201cpremises\u201d was intended to include not only the interior space but also the buildings and the land surrounding the buildings, the language in these provisions would be superfluous. For example, one provision states that signs cannot be placed on the land or the outside of the building, but can be placed on the entrance doors to the premises. This provision clearly distinguishes the \u201cpremises\u201d\u2014as interior space\u2014from the land and exterior portions of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law and extrinsic evidence may not be considered unless the document itself is ambiguous (see <em>Greenfield v Philles Records, </em>98 NY2d 562, 569 [2002]). Further, \u201cextrinsic and parol evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity in a written agreement which is complete and clear and unambiguous upon its face\u201d <em>(W.W.W. Assoc., </em>77 NY2d at 163 [internal quotation marks omitted]). Since the meaning of \u201cpremises\u201d is clear and unambiguous in the lease, extrinsic evidence such as the conduct of the parties may not be considered. IBM\u2019s conduct\u2014placing underground storage tanks in the surrounding land and cleaning the resulting pollution\u2014is not sufficient to create an ambiguity in the lease where the language is clear. Neither may the conduct of IBM in paying all real estate taxes pursuant to a lease provision create an ambiguity. The contract, read as a whole, clearly and consistently uses the term \u201cpremises\u201d to refer only to interior space and we cannot rely on extrinsic evidence to find otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Since there is no allegation that IBM did not return the interior space \u201cin good order and condition,\u201d article 7 of the lease was not breached and summary judgment dismissing the complaint was properly granted to IBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur; Judge Rosenblatt taking no part. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">.
