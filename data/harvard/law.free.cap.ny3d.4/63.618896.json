The courts below correctly held that appellant\u2019s failure to exhaust her Public Health Law remedies deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s claims. <em>(Gelbard v Genesee Hosp., </em>87 NY2d 691; <em>Matter of Cohoes Mem.

Ctr. v Sabiston, </em>136 AD2d 238.) II. Because New York common law requires courts in this context to defer, the trial court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s claims for this reason as well. <em>(Moallem v Jamaica Hosp., </em>264 AD2d 621; <em>Harris v Eisenberg, </em>199 AD2d 305; <em>Matter of Olsson v Board of Higher Educ., </em>49 NY2d 408; <em>Matter of Susan M. v New York Law School, </em>76 NY2d 241; <em>Matter of Patti Ann H. v New York Med.

Because the indisputable record of the review proceedings shows that appellant received a procedurally fair hearing and that there was some reasonable basis for the hospital\u2019s decision, the federal Health Care Quality Improvement Act also bars appellant\u2019s claims. <em>(Bryan v James E.

Prior to seeking judicial review for the termination of hospital privileges, a physician participating in a residency program must first seek review by the Public Health Council. <em>(Guibor v Manhattan Eye, Ear &amp; Throat Hosp., </em>46 NY2d 736; <em>Gelbard v Genesee Hosp., </em>211 AD2d 159, 87 NY2d 691; <em>Antonoff v Maimonides Med.

The Department took this action \u201c[b]ased on [plaintiffs] disciplinary history, and on [an] incident of inappropriate and disruptive conduct, insubordination, poor judgement and poor performance while on probation.\u201d Plaintiff grieved the Department\u2019s decision to the Medical Center\u2019s House Staff Grievance Committee, which determined on May 19, 2000, that \u201cthe evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>dence produced by the Department fully justifie[d]\u201d the termination, and that there was \u201cno evidence to support the conclusion that the reasons given by the Department for its actions were pretextual,\u201d as plaintiff had argued. On July 5, 2000, the Medical Center\u2019s Review Committee recommended that the Medical Center\u2019s Board of Trustees uphold plaintiffs termination; on July 26, 2000, the Board voted unanimously to accept the Review Committee\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On April 20, 2001, plaintiff commenced this breach of contract action, alleging that the Medical Center had wrongfully terminated her residency because of her advocacy for the rights of staff members and her union organizing activities. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief; reinstatement and/or future damages; compensatory damages; and expurgation of the Medical Center\u2019s records to delete any references to personnel actions taken against her. Upon the Medical Center\u2019s motion, Supreme Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff had not exhausted her administrative remedies under article 28 of the Public Health Law. The Appellate Division affirmed (309 AD2d 651 [1st Dept 2003]), as do. we.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Section 2801-b (1) of the Public Health Law provides in relevant part that</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">\u201c[i]t shall be an improper practice for the governing body of a hospital to refuse to act upon an application for staff membership or professional privileges or to deny or withhold from a physician . . . staff membership or professional privileges in a hospital, or to exclude or expel a physician . . . from staff membership in a hospital or curtail, terminate or diminish in any way a physician\u2019s . . . professional privileges in a hospital, without stating the reasons therefor, or if the reasons stated are unrelated to standards of patient care, patient welfare, the objectives of the institution or the character or competency of the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">A party aggrieved by an improper practice may file a complaint with the Public Health Council (PHC) (Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b [2]), which must promptly conduct a confidential investigation (Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b [3]). The PHC is composed of the Commissioner of Health and 14 members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate (Public Health Law \u00a7 220). If the PHC determines that cause exists to credit the complaint\u2019s allegations, it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>promptly so advise the governing body of the hospital against which the complaint was lodged, and direct the hospital to review its actions (Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b [3]). The provisions of section 2801-b do not \u201cimpair or affect any other right or remedy\u201d that a physician may have (Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b [4]). Supreme Court may enjoin violations or threatened violations of article 28, and any finding made by the PHC or the Commissioner or a hearing officer \u201cshall be prima facie evidence of the fact or facts found therein\u201d (Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-c).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">By its terms, section 2801-b applies to plaintiff because she is a \u201cphysician\u201d who has been denied \u201cprofessional privileges\u201d by the Medical Center. A medical resident is undoubtedly a physician (see Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 996 [10th ed 1998] [defining \u201cresident\u201d as, among other things, \u201ca physician serving a residency\u201d]). Further, the Medical Center\u2019s adverse decision regarding plaintiffs fitness to continue in its residency program \u201ccurtail[s], terminate[s] or diminish[es]\u201d the \u201cprofessional privileges\u201d extended to her by virtue of the Medical Center\u2019s postgraduate medical education program in emergency medicine and/or the Resident Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b was originally enacted to create an avenue of redress for physicians whom hospitals discriminated against or unjustly denied staff membership or professional privileges; however, as Supreme Court below observed, \u201cthe statute gives no indication that the Legislature intended Residents, who perform medical duties under the direction of licensed physicians, to have greater access to the courts than physicians.\u201d Thus, reading section 2801-b to exclude from its reach those physicians who are residents is unsupported by the statute\u2019s language and disserves the \u201cdual purpose\u201d of threshold PHC review\u2014to \u201callow[ ] an expert body to initially review the physician\u2019s complaint and [ ] promot[e] prelitigation resolution\u201d <em>(Gelbard v Genesee Hosp., </em>87 NY2d 691, 696 [1996]; <em>see also Mason v Central Suffolk Hosp., </em>3 NY3d 343 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Plaintiff argues that PHC review would be redundant in her case because she has already exhausted the internal grievance procedure that the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education mandates teaching hospitals to follow. The medical staff privileges of the plaintiff physician in <em>Gelbard, </em>however, also were terminated only after he had exhausted the defendant hospital\u2019s internal hearing and review procedure. Article 28 provides for review by a government panel of medical profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>sionals having no connection whatsoever to the hospital whose actions are being questioned. The availability of this impartial forum \u201cwith vast experience and unparalleled expertise in these cases\u201d (Gelbard, 87 NY2d at 697) not only affords a terminated physician an additional level of professional scrutiny, but also serves to protect the hospital by eliminating any hint of institutional bias. As we observed in <em>Matter of Cohoes Mem. Hosp. v Department of Health of State of N.Y. </em>(48 NY2d 583, 589 [1979]):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c[T]he legislature, by enacting section 2801-b of the Public Health Law, intended to provide the physician and the hospital with a professionally competent forum in which to resolve their disputes in an effort to avoid litigation, if possible. . . . [The PHC] us[es] its professional expertise to identify and discourage groundless claims, to mediate and to conciliate disputes between health-care professionals, and to offer the court some aid in resolving such disputes, should the parties fail to come to an agreement on their own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Plaintiff also protests that the Appellate Divisions are split over whether an aggrieved resident must exhaust administrative remedies under section 2801-b, pointing to the Second Department\u2019s decision in <em>Antonoff v Maimonides Med. Ctr. </em>(251 AD2d 522 [1998] [plaintiff resident who claimed that he was coerced into resigning after being accused of sexually harassing a patient alleged breach of contract sufficiently to withstand motion to dismiss]), and the Third Department\u2019s decision in <em>Jabbour v Albany Med. Ctr. </em>(237 AD2d 787 [1997] [male plaintiff resident terminated for allegedly conducting an inappropriate medical examination of a female patient raised a material issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment on his cause of action for breach of contract]).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Both of these cases, however, involved a resident\u2019s termination based solely on allegations of sexual misconduct; neither the Second nor the Third Department considered, much less decided, whether section 2801-b applies in this context because the issue was not raised. They certainly did not decide that section 2801-b is inapplicable to those physicians who are residents. In our view, a medical resident\u2019s \u201cproper recourse for challenging [ ] termination from [a hospital] residency program is the grievance process set out in Public Health Law \u00a7 2801-b, which cannot be avoided \u2018simply by asserting a breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>claim\u2019 \u201d <em>(see Solomon v Beth Israel Med. Ctr., </em>248 AD2d 118 [1st Dept 1998], <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 874 [1998], quoting <em>Gelbard </em>at 697). Whether there is an exemption from PHC review when a physician\u2019s staff membership or professional privileges are denied, curtailed or terminated solely because of alleged sexual harassment or misconduct directed at a patient is another question for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt and Graffeo concur; Judge R.S. Smith taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
