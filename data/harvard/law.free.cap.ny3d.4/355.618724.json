Appellant was denied his due process right to a fair hearing, the effective assistance of counsel, and his right to be present, where counsel advised the hearing court (and factfinder), before appellant testified and in his absence, that appellant might commit perjury at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing. <em>(People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d 437; <em>Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US 157; <em>People v Salquerro, </em>107 Misc 2d 155, 92 AD2d 1091; <em>Lowery v Cardwell, </em>575 F2d 727; <em>People v Moreno, </em>70 NY2d 403; <em>People v Arthur, </em>22 NY2d 325; <em>People v Williams, </em>85 NY2d 945; <em>People v Roman, </em>88 NY2d 18; <em>People v Spotford, </em>85 NY2d 593; <em>Snyder v Massachusetts, </em>291 US 97.) II. Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was invalid where the court failed to conduct an additional inquiry after it learned that appellant\u2019s desire to proceed pro se was influenced by his mistaken belief that he would be permitted to try the case in a manner that counsel could not. <em>(Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806; <em>People v Arroyo, </em>98 NY2d 101; <em>People v Rosen, </em>81 NY2d 237; <em>People v Reason, </em>37 NY2d 351; <em>Adams v United States ex rel.

Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In <em>People v DePallo </em>(96 NY2d 437 [2001]), we held that defense counsel properly balanced the duties he owed to his client and the duties he owed to the court and to the criminal justice system when, during a jury trial, counsel notified the court that his client had offered perjured testimony and refused to use that testimony in his closing argument to the jury. We left open the question of the propriety of a similar disclosure under circumstances where the court sits as the factfinder. We address that issue in the case now before us and hold that counsel\u2019s disclosure to the court, which was open to the inference that his client intended to perjure himself upon taking the stand, did not deprive defendant of a fair hearing or of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Defendant became enraged when he heard rumors that Magalie Nieves, a woman with whom he had had a sexual relationship, was infected with the HIV virus. Defendant, with the aid of 14-year-old Ericka Cruz, confronted Nieves and a fight ensued. Subsequently, defendant and Cruz lured Nieves to an isolated area where defendant choked her with a bandana, and he and Cruz stabbed her in the ear and in the breast, killing her. Days later, the police arrested Cruz, who offered a confession of the killing. The next day, defendant was arrested and charged, inter alia, with second degree murder and first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>manslaughter. Upon his arrest, defendant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave both written and videotaped statements in which he admitted to acting in concert with Cruz in killing Nieves.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Defendant moved to suppress his confessions, and the trial court ordered a <em>Huntley </em>hearing. Prior to the hearing, defendant\u2019s attorney asked to be relieved as counsel stating, \u201cThere is an ethical conflict with my continuing to represent [defendant] and I can\u2019t go any further than that.\u201d The prosecutor opposed the application, citing the age of the case. The court asked defense counsel to state the nature of the ethical dilemma without disclosing privileged information so that the court could make an effective ruling. Counsel stated, however, that he could not elaborate. The court then presumed that counsel\u2019s ethical dilemma concerned defendant\u2019s right to testify. The court denied counsel\u2019s application and told him that if the problem arose, he would have to offer more specific information to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">After the People presented their case at the <em>Huntley </em>hearing, defense counsel informed the court that defendant intended to testify. Outside defendant\u2019s presence, counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">\u201cAs part and parcel of my request to be relieved in this matter, I think I should tell the Court and place on the record that I did tell [defendant] and advise [defendant] that he should not testify at the hearing and as a result of the problem that I\u2019m having, the ethical problem I\u2019m having. What I\u2019m going to do is just basically direct his attention to date, time and location of the statement and let him run with the ball.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The court, recognizing that defense counsel was not permitted to divulge privileged matters to the court, concluded that counsel\u2019s conduct complied with his ethical obligations under the disciplinary rules given his anticipation that defendant \u201ccould possibly, could commit perjury on the witness stand.\u201d The court further concluded that counsel could still afford defendant the effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Defendant thereafter testified on his own behalf, largely in narrative form, with the court and counsel asking clarifying questions. Defendant testified that at the time he provided his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>statements to the police, he did not remember the events leading to Nieves\u2019s death and specifically did not recall stabbing her. He stated that during his interrogation, the police informed him of Cruz\u2019s version of the events, and he believed what she said because he did not think that Cruz would lie about him. Defendant stated that he initially refused to sign the written confession drafted by the police officers because its contents were not true, but that later he signed it only after one of the officers took him into a private room. Defendant further testified that when he gave his videotaped statement, he simply restated Cruz\u2019s rendition of the killing as described to him by the officers. Thus, he claimed that this confession was not a recounting of events from his own memory. Finally, defendant stated that by the time he had provided the videotaped confession at approximately 10:00 p.m., he was hungry because he had not eaten all day, and was not permitted food until after he had given that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Defense counsel offered no closing argument, choosing instead to rest on the record and the papers submitted. Following the People\u2019s closing statement, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confessions. In a subsequent written decision, the court noted that it \u201cdid not find the defendant\u2019s testimony credible or worthy of belief.\u201d The court held that defendant made his written and videotaped statements after voluntarily waiving his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Upon a jury trial, at which defendant largely defended himself, defendant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction, holding that counsel\u2019s disclosure of an ethical dilemma and his decision to submit defendant\u2019s testimony in narrative form did not deprive defendant of his right to a fair hearing or to the effective assistance of counsel. The Court further held that defendant was not denied his constitutional right to be present at the material stages of his trial insofar as his presence was not required at the colloquy between the court and the attorneys concerning defense counsel\u2019s ethical dilemma regarding defendant\u2019s testimony. A Judge of this Court granted defendant leave to appeal and we now affirm the conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In <em>DePallo, </em>we recognized that a defense attorney\u2019s duty to zealously represent a client must be circumscribed by his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>duty as an officer of the court to serve the truth-seeking function of the justice system (96 NY2d at 441). Moreover, as peijury is a criminal offense, defense counsel has a duty to refrain from participating in the client\u2019s commission of it. Thus, we stated that while counsel must pursue all reasonable means to reach the objectives of the client, counsel must not in any way assist a client in presenting false evidence to the court <em>(id.; Nix v White-side, </em>475 US 157, 166 [1986]).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Indeed, New York\u2019s Code of Professional Responsibility specifically addresses an attorney\u2019s ethical obligations in providing lawful representation. DR 7-102 (codified at 22 NYCRR 1200.33) expressly states that an attorney may not \u201cKnowingly use perjured testimony or false evidence\u201d (DR 7-102 [a] [4]); \u201cKnowingly make a false statement of law or fact\u201d (DR 7-102 [a] [5]); \u201cParticipate in the creation or preservation of evidence when the lawyer knows or it is obvious that the evidence is false\u201d (DR 7-102 [a] [6]); \u201c[c]ounsel or assist the client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or fraudulent\u201d (DR 7-102 [a] [7]); or \u201cKnowingly engage in other illegal conduct\u201d (DR 7-102 [a] [8]).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In light of the ethical obligations of an attorney in this state, and in accordance with United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, an attorney faced with a client who intends to commit perjury has the initial responsibility to attempt to dissuade the client from pursuing the unlawful course of action <em>(see Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US at 169-170; <em>People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d at 441). Should the client insist on peijuring himself, counsel may seek to withdraw from the case. If counsel\u2019s request is denied, defense counsel, bound to honor defendant\u2019s right to testify on his own behalf, should refrain from eliciting the testimony in traditional question-and-answer form and permit defendant to present his testimony in narrative form. However, in accordance with DR 7-102 (a) (4), counsel may not use the perjured testimony in making argument to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Here, defense counsel properly discharged his ethical obligations under the circumstances presented. Counsel clearly advised defendant against lying on the witness stand; indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>counsel encouraged defendant not to take the stand at all. Yet defendant insisted on testifying at the hearing, and his attorney believed that the evidence he intended to present was false. Thus, it was entirely proper for counsel to seek to withdraw as defendant\u2019s attorney prior to the hearing based on his perceived ethical dilemma.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">While defendant does not argue the propriety of his attorney\u2019s actions up to that point, he does take issue with his attorney\u2019s telling the court that the ethical dilemma he faced concerned defendant\u2019s right to testify at the hearing. Defendant argues that such a disclosure signifies defendant\u2019s intention to commit perjury to the court which sits as the factfinder for the hearing. He contends that such a disclosure inevitably affected the court\u2019s ability to assess his credibility in determining the outcome of the hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that same vein, defendant argues that his attorney should not have told the court of his intent to question defendant in the narrative before having done so. Defendant asserts that his attorney should have said nothing, proceeded to question defendant in the narrative and if counsel\u2019s suspicions about defendant\u2019s testimony ripened into a reality, counsel could simply refrain from using the perjured testimony in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We disagree. As an initial matter, we note that at no time did counsel ever disclose to the court that defendant intended to commit peijury or otherwise disclose any client secrets. Rather the court inferred defendant\u2019s perjurious intent based upon the nature of counsel\u2019s application. However, counsel could have properly made such a disclosure since a client\u2019s intent to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>mit a crime is not a protected confidence or secret <em>(see Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US at 174; <em>People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d at 442; Code of Professional Responsibility DR 4-101 [c] [3] [22 NYCRR 1200.19 (c) (3)]). Moreover, counsel\u2019s ethical obligations do not change simply because a judge rather than a jury is sitting as the factfinder. Moreover, as a practical matter, defendant\u2019s suggestion would solve nothing because counsel would likely find it difficult to allow defendant' to testify in the narrative without prior explanation. Like the direct examination of any witness, defendant\u2019s examination must be guided by proper questioning. Had counsel attempted to offer defendant\u2019s testimony in the narrative, it would have been subject to objection either by the prosecutor or the court. Even if counsel were permitted to present defendant\u2019s testimony in narrative form without objection, the very fact of defendant testifying in such a manner would signify to the court that counsel believes that his client is perjuring himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We therefore conclude that defense counsel properly balanced his duties to his client with his duties to the court and the criminal justice system and that in doing so, defendant was not denied his right to a fair hearing. Furthermore, absent a breach of any recognized professional duty, defendant\u2019s claim that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel must also fail <em>(see People v DePallo, </em>96 NY2d at 442-443, citing <em>Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US at 175; <em>People v Baldi, </em>54 NY2d 137, 151-152 [1981]).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied his right to be present during a material stage of the trial because he was absent during the colloquy between the court and the attorneys regarding defense counsel\u2019s intent to present defendant\u2019s testimony in the narrative. As we stated in <em>DePallo </em>(96 NY2d at 443) and in <em>People v Keen </em>(94 NY2d 533, 539 [2000]), a colloquy of this nature involves procedural matters at which a defendant can offer no meaningful input. Therefore, defendant had no right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. The court also concluded that it was not necessary for defendant to be present during the conference because it did not constitute a critical stage of his trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\">.  We expressly reject defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court failed to conduct a sufficient inquiry into defendant\u2019s understanding of the perils of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>self-representation. The record makes plain that the court engaged defendant in a two-hour colloquy and warned him against proceeding pro se. And given the court\u2019s repeated warnings that defendant would be held to the same rules of evidence as would his attorney, no further explanation was needed to address counsel\u2019s statement to the court that defendant believed that he could take certain actions that his attorney could not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b425-6\">. In support of his position, defendant relies on <em>Lowery v Cardwell </em>(575 F2d 727 [9th Cir 1978]). In that case, defendant testified at her bench trial and perjured herself, to the surprise of her attorney. Counsel requested a recess, at which time, he unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw from the case. Counsel then ended the defendant\u2019s testimony and made no reference to the defendant\u2019s perjured testimony during his closing arguments. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that counsel\u2019s actions denied the defendant a fair trial because counsel\u2019s actions gave the judge the impression that counsel believed that the defendant had testified falsely. The court stated that by his actions, counsel placed himself in opposition to his chent\u2019s interests <em>(see id. </em>at 730). The court suggested that it would have been the better practice for the attorney to have made a record for his own protection in the event that he was ever questioned about his professional conduct <em>(see id. </em>at 731 n 5). We expressly reject this approach because it requires an attorney to remain silent while the client commits perjury, which is wholly incompatible with counsel\u2019s role as an officer of the court and, more specifically, counsel\u2019s obligation to reveal fraud perpetrated by a client upon the court (see DR 7-102 [b] [1]; <em>see also Nix v Whiteside, </em>475 US at 174).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
