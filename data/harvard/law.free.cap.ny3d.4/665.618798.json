Because of the commands of article 190 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this Court should not determine the scope of appellants\u2019 Fifth Amendment privilege prior to the production of the subpoenaed evidence. <em>(Matter of Rush v Mordue, </em>68 NY2d 348; <em>Kastigar v United States, </em>406 US 441; <em>People v Slavin, </em>1 NY3d 392; <em>United States v Fox, </em>721 F2d 32; <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, </em>1 F3d 87; <em>Prudential Sec. v Brigianos, </em>233 AD2d 18; <em>Matter of Momah v Rogers, </em>93 NY2d 864; <em>People v Avant, </em>33 NY2d 265; <em>Matter of Lee v County Ct. of Erie County, </em>27 NY2d 432, 404 US 823; <em>Matter of Altman v Bradley, 184 </em>AD2d 131.) II. If this Court reaches the issue of appellants\u2019 rights against self-incrimination under the New York State Constitution, it should not craft a rule that allows appellants to veto the giving of grand jury evidence against them by their employees. <em>(Matter of Vanderbilt </em>[Rosner\u2014 <em>Hickey], </em>57 NY2d 66; <em>Big Apple Concrete Corp. v Abrams, </em>103 AD2d 609; <em>Bellis v United States, </em>417 US 85; <em>People v P.J.

III. The documents called for in the subpoena <em>are </em>records of an enterprise, not personal records, and compelling their production does not implicate the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. <em>(People v Hager, </em>69 NY2d 141; <em>United States v Doe, </em>465 US 605; <em>Fisher v United States, </em>425 US 391; <em>Henry v Lewis, </em>102 AD2d 430; <em>Wilson v United States, </em>221 US 361; <em>Matter of Sigety v Hynes, </em>38 NY2d 260; <em>Shapiro v United States, </em>335 US 1; <em>United States v Hubbell, </em>530 US 27; <em>Matter of Subpoena Duces Tecum to Doe [Park Assoc.\u2014New York State Attorney Gen., Medicaid Fraud Control Unit], </em>99 NY2d 434.) IV The documents called for do not implicate the attorney-client privilege and appellants have failed in their burden of proving that they do. <em>(Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena [Bekins Record Stor.

The County Court properly determined that the subpoena does not violate appellants\u2019 Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. <em>(United States v Dionisio, </em>410 US 1; <em>Hale v Henkel, </em>201 US 43; <em>Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas for Locals 17, 135, 257 &amp; 608 of United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., AFL-CIO [People], </em>72 NY2d 307; <em>Matter of Hynes v Moskowitz, </em>44 NY2d 383; <em>In re Nwamu, </em>421 F Supp 1361; <em>Virag v Hynes, </em>54 NY2d 437; <em>Blair v United States, </em>250 US 273.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b733-4\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b733-5\">G.B. Smith, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The issue here is whether individual partners of a small law firm may invoke the privilege against compelled self-incrimination in response to a grand jury subpoena duces tecum, served upon the custodian of records of their firm, seeking production of firm financial and payment records, copies of retainer and closing statements, and various other records.

Appellants argued that the subpoena violated: the individual partners\u2019 state and federal rights against compelled self-incrimination; the law firm\u2019s and individual partners\u2019 rights against unreasonable searches and seizures; and the attorney-client privilege. Appellants also argued that the subpoena was unduly burdensome and overbroad, and that the statements filed with the Office of Court Administration were confidential pursuant to 22 NYCRR 691.20 (c), and thus not subject to disclosure. Finally, in a supporting affirmation they stated that \u201c[i]f required by this Court, and if given an opportunity to compile a privilege log, Applicants will submit a privilege log, or if compelled, a privilege log along with the compiled documents, for an in camera inspection by the Court only for the purpose of determining the availability of the claimed privileges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">By order dated September 22, 2003, Nassau County Court denied appellants\u2019 application in its entirety. By order dated May 24, 2004, the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed. Appellants appeal as of right pursuant to CPLR 5601 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination is a personal one\u2014\u201cit cannot be utilized by or on behalf of any organization, such as a corporation\u201d <em>(United States v White, </em>322 US 694, 699 [1944]). This privilege \u201cprotects the individual from any disclosure, in the form of oral testimony, documents or chattels, sought by legal process against him as a witness\u201d <em>(id.; see </em>US Const Amend V; NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6). Further, \u201cthe papers and effects which the privilege protects must be the private property of the person claiming the privilege, or at least in his possession in a purely personal capacity\u201d <em>(Bellis v United States, </em>417 US 85, 90 [1974], quoting <em>White, 322 </em>US at 699).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">Under federal law, it is well settled that a partner in a law firm, even a small law firm, cannot rely on the federal Fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination \u201cto avoid producing the records of a collective entity which are in his possession in a representative capacity, even if these records might incriminate him personally\u201d <em>(Bellis v United States, </em>417 US 85, 88 [1974]).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Bellis </em>court\u2014which also had before it a three-partner law firm\u2014set forth two rationales for its holding. First, since the privilege against compelled self-incrimination applies only to natural individuals, neither an artificial organization nor individuals acting as representatives of that organization can invoke the privilege. In support of this rationale, the <em>Bellis </em>court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">\u201cIn view of the inescapable fact that an artificial entity can only act to produce its records through its individual officers or agents, recognition of the individual\u2019s claim of privilege with respect to the financial records of the organization would substantially undermine the unchallenged rule that the organization itself is not entitled to claim any Fifth Amendment privilege, and largely frustrate legitimate governmental regulation of such organizations\u201d (417 US at 90) .<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Second, the <em>Beilis </em>court noted the lack of privacy interest a representative of an organization has in organization records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>(see id. </em>at 91-92).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, with regard to partnerships, the <em>Beilis </em>court noted that \u201cpartnerships may and frequently do represent organized institutional activity so as to preclude any claim of Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to the partnership\u2019s financial records\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 93) .<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">As this Court has never expressly determined whether the New York privilege against compelled self-incrimination (NY Const, art I, \u00a7 6) applies to a partnership, and as this Court has, on occasion, afforded greater protection regarding fundamental rights than the Federal Constitution and the United States Supreme Court, we now consider whether <em>Beilis </em>should be adopted in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">This Court has adopted a two-pronged \u201cinterpretive\u201d and \u201cnoninterpretive\u201d analysis of various factors to determine if a provision of our State Constitution should be construed more broadly than its federal analog <em>(see People v P.J. Video, </em>68 NY2d 296 [1986]). We first review the text of the state and federal constitutional provisions. \u201cIf the language of the State Constitution differs from that of its Federal counterpart, then the court may conclude that there is a basis for a different interpretation of it\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 302 [citations omitted]). Here, there is no material textual difference between the relevant constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>provisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As such, this Court need only conduct a \u201cnoninterpretive\u201d review of the constitutional provisions. A noninterpretive review \u201cproceeds from a judicial perception of sound policy, justice and fundamental fairness\u201d and seeks to discover, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-4\">\u201cany preexisting State statutory or common law defining the scope of the individual right in question; the history and traditions of the State in its protection of that individual right; any identification of the right in the State Constitution as being one of peculiar State or local concern; and any distinctive attitudes of the State citizenry toward the definition, scope or protection of the individual right\u201d (68 NY2d at 303).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">A finding of these factors suggests that a broader reading of the state constitutional provision could be appropriate. Under our \u201cnoninterpretive\u201d analysis of the state and federal constitutional provisions, we conclude that none of the factors that would suggest a broader reading of article I, \u00a7 6 are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Appellants contend that a partnership has a right against self-incrimination based on its unique status, in that a partnership is not a legal entity separate from its member partners. Appellants cite <em>Williams v Hartshorn </em>(296 NY 49, 51 [1946]) in which we stated that \u201ca partnership is not to be regarded as a separate entity distinct from the persons who compose it\u201d (see <em>also People v Zinke, </em>76 NY2d 8 [1990]; <em>Caplan v Caplan, </em>268 NY 445 [1935]). For many purposes, it is certainly true that a partnership is not a legally separate entity from its member partners. In the circumstances presented here, our prior cases guide us toward a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">For example, in <em>Matter of Friedman v Hi-Li Manor Home for Adults </em>(42 NY2d 408, 416 [1977]), we observed that the right against self-incrimination reflects a policy of protecting an individual\u2019s \u201cright to a \u2018private enclave\u2019 \u201d in which he or she may lead a private life, but the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination is concerned mostly with protecting individual civil liberties, and should not be interpreted to \u201cinsulate economic or other interests of organizations, incorpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>rated and unincorporated, when to do so would be to frustrate appropriate governmental regulation.\u201d Citing <em>Beilis </em>approvingly, we have also stated that \u201c[i]t is settled that a corporation has no Fifth Amendment privilege and that a custodian of corporate records may not refuse to produce them even though they may incriminate him personally\u201d <em>(Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Dec. 14, 1984, </em>69 NY2d 232, 242 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Appellants also rely on <em>Matter of Sigety v Hynes </em>(38 NY2d 260, 268 [1975]) for the proposition that in that case, we were not content with relying on the <em>Beilis </em>majority\u2019s definition of a \u201cseparate entity\u201d but instead applied the Supreme Court\u2019s prior precedent of <em>United States v White </em>(322 US 694, 701 [1944]), which the <em>Beilis </em>majority \u201cbacked away from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In <em>Sigety, </em>we stated the <em>White </em>test as whether under all the circumstances, it could be fairly said that a particular type of organization is so impersonal in the scope of membership and activities that it does not represent the purely private interests of its members. We nevertheless applied <em>Beilis </em>while noting the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that in <em>Beilis </em>itself, the result might have been different had it involved a small family partnership. Here, of course, the makeup of the law firm is identical to that in <em>Beilis. </em>Further, the \u201cidentity of language [of these provisions] supports a policy of uniformity between State and Federal Courts\u201d (68 NY2d at 304). Accordingly, we hold that article I, \u00a7 6 affords a partnership no greater right against self-incrimination than the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Based on the foregoing, we hereby adopt <em>Beilis </em>and hold that an individual partner of a law firm, whose firm was served with a subpoena duces tecum seeking the production of firm records, cannot rely on the constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination \u201cto avoid producing the records of a collective entity which are in his possession in a representative capacity, even if these records might incriminate him personally\u201d <em>(Beilis, </em>417 US at 88). Applying this rule to the present case, appellant law firm is a collective entity under <em>Beilis. </em>It is not a family partnership or association; exists as an independent entity apart from its individual members;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is a well structured, not informal, organization set up for conducting an ongoing legal practice; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and maintains a distinct set of organizational records. Additionally, the records subpoenaed were organization records held in a representative capacity rather than records of an individual held in a personal capacity\u2014i.e., the subpoena was directed to appellant law firm\u2019s custodian of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">In further support of our view that appellant law firm is a collective entity, we note that the term \u201cpartnership\u201d is defined as \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit\u201d (Partnership Law \u00a7 10 [1]). Given this definition and the fact that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination is personal (i.e., the privilege protects papers that are a person\u2019s private property or that are in a person\u2019s possession in a purely personal capacity), a partnership and its individual partners, with respect to the papers, effects and records generated in the course of conducting partnership business, should not be afforded the protections provided under the privilege. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the individual partners of appellant law firm cannot invoke the privilege against compelled self-incrimination in order to avoid producing the documents sought by the instant subpoena. We further conclude that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination may not be invoked by an individual partner subpoenaed to produce records required to be kept by law <em>(see Matter of Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Dec. 14, 1984, </em>69 NY2d 232 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Moreover, we agree with the lower court rulings rejecting appellants\u2019 claim that the instant subpoena violates appellants\u2019 right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. It is well established that \u201ca subpoena duces tecum, unlike a search warrant, does not have to be supported by probable cause\u201d <em>(Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas for Locals 17, 135, 257 &amp; 608 of United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., AFL-CIO [People], </em>72 NY2d 307, 315 [1988]).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, under both the State and Federal Constitutions, a subpoena does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>violate an individual\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures when the materials sought are relevant to the investigation being conducted and the subpoena is not over-broad or unduly burdensome <em>(id. </em>at 315-316). Moreover, this Court has stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><em>\u201ca </em>Grand Jury subpoena duces tecum, unlike an office subpoena, enjoys a presumption of validity that requires the party challenging the subpoena to demonstrate, by concrete evidence, that the materials sought have no relation to the matter under investigation. Bare assertions of the lack of relevancy will not suffice. Rather, given the ranging, exploratory nature and operation of a Grand Jury, the witness served with a subpoena must show that \u2018the documents are so unrelated to the subject of inquiry as to make it obvious that their production would be futile as an aid to the\u2019 Grand Jury\u2019s investigation\u201d <em>(Virag v Hynes, </em>54 NY2d 437, 444 [1981] [citation omitted]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Appellants did not make a sufficient showing to rebut the presumption of validity afforded the instant subpoena. Appellants did not produce evidence that the subpoena was overbroad or that subpoenaed documents were irrelevant to the grand jury investigation. For example, the subpoena sought documents generated over a <em>2</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>k </em>year period, documents that were generally partnership financial records and records required to be kept by law. Nor could appellants show that compliance with the subpoena would have been unduly burdensome.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Next, we consider the lower court rulings that the documents sought in the subpoena are not protected under the attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a lawyer and client relating to legal advice sought by the client <em>(see Matter of Priest v Hennessy, </em>51 NY2d 62 [1980]; <em>see also </em>CPLR 4503). The person who asserts the privilege has the burden of proving the above ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ments. Communications regarding \u201cthe identity of a client and information about fees paid by the client\u201d are not generally protected under the privilege, nor are communications regarding the payment of legal fees by a third person (51 NY2d at 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">Here, the lower courts found that the documents sought in the subpoena were not protected by the attorney-client privilege. The courts below considered the subpoena on its face and noted that appellants failed to meet their burden in estabhshing that the records sought were protected under the privilege. However, as the Attorney General conceded at oral argument, nothing prevents appellants from compiling a privilege log and asserting the privilege as to particular documents in the grand jury proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo, Read and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-9\">.

Respondent, however, provided some general information about what the matter concerned in its brief.

In Beilis, a former partner of a dissolved three-partner law firm was served with a subpoena directing him to appear before a federal grand jury and to bring all records in his possession pertaining to the dissolved partnership for the years 1968 and 1969. In response to the subpoena, the former partner asserted the federal Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">. Quoting <em>United States v </em>White, 322 US 694, 700 (1944), the <em>Bellis </em>court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">\u201cThe scope and nature of the economic activities of incorporated and unincorporated organizations and their representatives demand that the constitutional power of the federal and state governments to regulate those activities be correspondingly effective. The greater portion of evidence of wrongdoing by an organization or its representatives is usually to be found in the official records and documents of that organization. Were the cloak of the privilege to be thrown around these impersonal records and documents, effective enforcement of many federal and state laws would be impossible. The framers of the constitutional guarantee against compulsory self-disclosure, who were interested primarily in protecting individual civil liberties, cannot be said to have intended the privilege to be available to protect economic or other interests of such organizations so as to nullify appropriate governmental regulations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 90-91 [citations omitted]).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-6\">. Regarding the difficulty of maintaining a claim of privacy or confidentiality with respect to the financial records of an organized collective entity, the <em>Beilis </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201cControl of such records is generally strictly regulated by statute or by the rules and regulations of the organization, and access to the records is generally guaranteed to others in the organization. In such circumstances, the custodian of the organization\u2019s records lacks the control over their content and location and the right to keep them from the view of others which would be characteristic of a claim of privacy and confidentiality\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 92).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. In determining that the <em>Beilis </em>law. firm engaged in \u201corganized institutional activity\u201d so as to preclude a Fifth Amendment claim, the <em>Beilis </em>court considered whether the organization: (1) existed \u201cas an independent entity apart from its individual members\u201d; (2) was well structured \u201cand not merely a loose, informal association of individuals\u201d; and (3) maintained \u201ca distinct set of organizational records, and recognize[d] rights in its members of control and access to them\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 92, 93). Additionally, the records subpoenaed must actually be organization records held in a representative capacity rather than records of an individual held in a personal capacity <em>(id. </em>at 93).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. Article I, \u00a7 6 of the New York State Constitution provides, in relevant part that \u201c[n]o person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself or herself.\u201d The Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution states, in pertinent part, that \u201c[n]o person shall be . . . compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. This conclusion is based on the two rationales stated by the <em>Beilis </em>court and specifically on the following language: since \u201can artificial entity can only act to produce its records through its individual officers or agents, recognition of the individual\u2019s claim of privilege with respect to the [organization\u2019s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>financial records would substantially undermine the . . . rule that the organization itself is not entitled to claim any Fifth Amendment privilege, and largely frustrate legitimate governmental regulation of such organizations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 90).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\">. \u201cThe standard of reasonableness rather than probable cause is appropriate because of the substantial differences between a search warrant and a subpoena duces tecum. A search and seizure is conducted abruptly, without advance notice, often with force or the threat of force. A subpoena, in contrast, remains at all times under the control and supervision of a judicial officer and may he challenged before compliance through a motion to quash. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>the unannounced search and seizure of documents often results in serious social stigma. A subpoena is served in the same manner as any summons or other legal process and typically no stigma whatsoever attaches if it is enforced\u201d <em>(Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas for Locals 17, 135, 257 &amp; 608 of United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., AFL-CIO [People], </em>72 NY2d at 315 [citations omitted]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">.
