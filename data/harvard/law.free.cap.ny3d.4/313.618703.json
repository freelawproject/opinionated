III. The interpretation of licensing laws both generally and within the context of the No-Fault Law is a special skill delegated to the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York by the Legislature and accordingly the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York\u2019s interpretation is not to be accorded deference in the resolution of the certified question. <em>(Kurcsics v Merchants Mut.

We conclude that they may.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Patients covered by no-fault insurance often assign their claims to their health care providers rather than seek reimbursement from insurance carriers directly <em>(see </em>11 NYCRR 65-3.11). Regulations require the carriers to make prompt decisions on claims once the provider has furnished adequate factual support <em>(see </em>11 NYCRR 65.15).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">This case began when State Farm filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking a judgment declaring that it need not reimburse defendants\u2014fraudulently incorporated medical corporations\u2014 for assigned claims submitted under no-fault. The complaint also sought equitable relief and damages against defendant companies and individuals for unjust enrichment and fraud. State Farm alleged, in essence, that to obtain payments from the carriers under the requirements of no-fault insurance, defendants willfully evaded New York law prohibiting nonphysicians from sharing ownership in medical service corporations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">According to the complaint, the unlicensed defendants paid physicians to use their names on paperwork filed with the State to establish medical service corporations. Once the medical service corporations were established under the facially valid cover of the nominal physician-owners, the nonphysicians actually operated the companies. To maintain the appearance that the physicians owned the entities, the nonphysicians caused the corporations to hire management companies (owned by the non-physicians), which billed the medical corporations inflated rates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>for routine services. In this manner, the actual profits did not go to the nominal owners but were channeled to the nonphysicians who owned the management companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Notably, State Farm never alleged that the actual care received by patients was unnecessary or improper. The patients insured by State Farm presumably received appropriate care from a health professional qualified to give that care. State Farm\u2019s complaint centers on fraud in the corporate form rather than on the quality of care provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The Federal District Court dismissed State Farm\u2019s complaint, holding that defendants\u2019 noncompliance with the licensing and incorporation statutes did not extinguish State Farm\u2019s duty to pay, so long as the actual providers acted within the scope of their licenses in rendering care. The Second Circuit then certified to this Court the question whether</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201ca medical corporation that was fraudulently incorporated under N.Y. Business Corporation Law \u00a7\u00a7 1507, 1508, and N.Y. Education Law \u00a7 6507(4)(c) [is] entitled to be reimbursed by insurers, under New York Insurance Law \u00a7\u00a7 5101 <em>et seq., </em>and its implementing regulations, for medical services rendered by licensed medical practitioners\u201d (372 F3d 500, 510 [2004]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">We accepted the certification and now answer that such corporations are not entitled to reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Insurance Law \u00a7 5102 <em>et seq. </em>requires no-fault carriers to reimburse patients (or, as in this case, their medical provider assignees) for \u201cbasic economic loss.\u201d Interpreting the statute, the Superintendent of Insurance promulgated 11 NYCRR 65-3.16 (a) (12) (effective April 4, 2002) and excluded from the meaning of \u201cbasic economic loss\u201d payments made to unlicensed or fraudulently licensed providers, thus rendering them ineligible for reimbursement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">If State Farm\u2019s allegations are true, as we must construe them to be at this stage, the defendant companies undisputedly fail to meet the applicable state licensing requirements, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>prohibit nonphysicians from owning or controlling medical service corporations. Furthermore, a fraudulently incorporated medical company is \u201c[a] provider of health care services\u201d within the meaning of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Defendants contend they are entitled to reimbursement even if fraudulently licensed. They first argue that the actual care that patients received was within the scope of the licenses of those who treated the patients. Defendants posit that this licensing compliance brings them within the regulatory framework for reimbursement. We disagree. The fact remains that the reimbursement goes to the medical service corporation that exists to receive payment only because of its willfully and materially false filings with state regulators.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Defendants also argue that the quoted regulation conflicts with the prompt payment goals of the no-fault statutes. The Second Circuit treated this issue as a difficult policy balance: on the one hand, there is our State\u2019s prohibition against lay ownership of shares in medical corporations (and the accompanying potential for fraud), and on the other, our encouragement of prompt payment of insurance claims, as reflected in the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The regulation is valid. We are guided by the well-established principle of administrative law that the Superintendent\u2019s \u201cinterpretation, if not irrational or unreasonable, will be upheld in deference to his special competence and expertise with respect to the insurance industry, unless it runs counter to the clear wording of a statutory provision\u201d <em>(Matter of New York Pub. Interest Research Group v New York State Dept, of Ins., </em>66 NY2d 444, 448 [1985]). Where, as here, the Superintendent has properly crafted a rule within the scope of his authority, that rule has the force of law and represents the policy choice of this State.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The Superintendent\u2019s regulation allowing carriers to withhold reimbursement from fraudulently licensed medical corporations governs this case. We hold that on the strength of this regulation, carriers may look beyond the face of licensing documents to identify willful and material failure to abide by state and local law. Defendants argue that the carriers will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>turn this investigatory privilege into a vehicle for delay and recalcitrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The regulatory scheme, however, does not permit abuse of the truth-seeking opportunity that 11 NYCRR 65-3.16 (a) (12) authorizes. Indeed, the Superintendent\u2019s regulations themselves provide for agency oversight of carriers, and demand that carriers delay the payment of claims to pursue investigations solely for good cause (see 11 NYCRR 65-3.2 [c]). In the licensing context, carriers will be unable to show \u201cgood cause\u201d unless they can demonstrate behavior tantamount to fraud. Technical violations will not do. For example, a failure to hold an annual meeting, pay corporate filing fees or submit otherwise acceptable paperwork on time will not rise to the level of fraud. We expect, and the Legislature surely intended, vigorous enforcement action by the Superintendent against any carrier that uses the licensing-requirement regulation to withhold or obstruct reimbursements to nonfraudulent health care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">The Second Circuit questioned whether, if the fraudulent corporations were not entitled to reimbursement, State Farm could recover <em>money </em>already paid out under theories of fraud or unjust enrichment. Because we rest our holding on the Superintendent\u2019s amended regulation declaring fraudulently licensed corporations ineligible for reimbursement, no cause of action for fraud or unjust enrichment would lie for any payments made by the carriers before that regulation\u2019s effective date of April 4, 2002. State Farm\u2019s complaint does not clearly indicate, one way or the other, whether it has paid money to defendants after the amended regulation took effect. We therefore answer only the certified question and decline to consider whether State Farm has alleged sufficient facts to support causes of action for fraud or unjust enrichment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Based on the foregoing, the certified question should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B.
