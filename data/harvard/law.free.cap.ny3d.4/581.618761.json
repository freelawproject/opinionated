The New York State Department of Health (DOH) did not announce its intention to commence audits of Blossom\u2019s PRIs for any of these years until August 2002, and the parties dispute whether DOH may ever audit PRIs more than six years after they are filed. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that DOH is not required by its regulations to notice or commence an audit of PRIs within six years of filing; however, in light, of the facts of this case, DOH may not audit Blossom\u2019s PRIs for 1995 and 1996, or use its audit of Blossom\u2019s 1994 PRIs to determine Medicaid reimbursement rates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">The Commissioner administers the State\u2019s Medical Assistance Plan (Medicaid) and sets Medicaid reimbursement rates for nursing homes, more formally called \u201cresidential health care facilities,\u201d for medical services provided to the indigent (Public Health Law \u00a7 2807 [3]; \u00a7 2808 [3]). Prior to 1986, the State\u2019s Medicaid per diem reimbursement rate\u2014the daily rate at which a facility can bill Medicaid for every Medicaid-eligible resident\u2014 was not in any way tied to the level of care required. As a result, nursing homes were thought to be discouraged from admitting individuals requiring more intensive care, who were as a consequence shunted into costly hospital beds. To reduce any rate-induced disincentive for nursing homes to provide services for individuals requiring institutional but not hospital care, DOH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>developed and implemented the Resource Utilization Group-II (RUG-II) case mix reimbursement methodology, effective January 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">RUG-II is a prospective system that establishes reimbursement rates by using a nursing home\u2019s allowable costs in a base year or period,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> adjusted for regional wage differentials, inflation and changes in the level of care required by its residents. RUG-II provides for reimbursement of capital and operating costs, the latter of which is composed of direct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> indirect<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and noncomparable<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> components (10 NYCRR 86-2.10 [a] [7]; [b] [1] [ii]; [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The direct component of operating costs is based upon a patient classification system that establishes 16 RUG-II categories grouped into five \u201chierarchies,\u201d each of which is characterized by specifically diagnosed physical or mental conditions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The five hierarchies are further divided to create the 16 RUG-II categories based on the resident\u2019s functional ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), measured by the resident\u2019s score on an ADL index designed to reflect the need for supervision or assistance in eating, toileting and transferring <em>(see </em>10 NYCRR Appendix 13-A).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Each of the RUG-II categories represents a different combination of the two components\u2014condition (the hierarchy) and functional ability (the ADL)\u2014and reflects the costs associated with caring for nursing home residents classified within the particular category, expressed as a numeric value or case mix index (CMI). Generally, the higher the CMI, the more intensive and costly the care required.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>The number of a nursing home\u2019s residents classified in the various RUG-II categories determines the facility\u2019s overall CMI and thus significantly influences its per diem Medicaid reimbursement rate. Consequently, it is essential for each resident\u2019s condition and functional ability to be assessed accurately. This is accomplished by means of the PRI.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">A qualified registered nurse completes the PRI, which summarizes the resident\u2019s condition, including medical diagnosis and treatments, ADLs, behavior and specialized services required during the four weeks prior to the PRI\u2019s completion. Each resident is assigned to one of the 16 RUG-II categories based on the information in the completed PRI, for which DOH has provided detailed instructions and clarification documents specifying certain \u201cqualifiers\u201d or criteria that must be met before any PRI question may be answered \u201cYes.\u201d These qualifiers take the form of time period (the four weeks before the PRI\u2019s completion), frequency (how often something needs to occur to meet the qualifier), the specific medical record documentation called for and exclusions (types of behavior or care to be disregarded when answering the question).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Nursing homes submit new PRIs electronically for all the residents in their care every six months, in accordance with a schedule set by DOH. Twice a year, at the halfway point between these \u201cfull-house\u201d PRI filings, a nursing home must update its submission to DOH to account for new admissions and discharges (10 NYCRR 86-2.11 [b]). To insure the accuracy of a nursing home\u2019s PRIs and thus the integrity of its reimbursement rates, DOH has developed a three-stage audit process. DOH has represented in this litigation that \u201cPRI audits are performed at each facility [in the state] approximately every 18 months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">DOH sends a list of nursing homes to be audited to an independent organization with which it has contracted to accomplish this work. For Stage I audits, DOH typically provides audit forms for 40 of a nursing home\u2019s residents during the audit period, which the auditor completes independently to validate the ADL level assigned by the nursing home. The auditor usually completes a hierarchy verification sheet, or checklist, for 16 of the 40 residents, which addresses the qualifiers relevant to the resident\u2019s specific classification. Auditors principally examine a resident\u2019s medical records to complete the audit form, although they may also observe the residents whose PRIs are being audited or discuss the residents\u2019 care with nursing home staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The Stage I auditor returns the completed Stage I audit forms to DOH with an explanation for any differences between PRIs after auditing and as originally submitted. DOH substitutes Stage I audited PRIs for those filed by the nursing home, and also determines whether there is a statistically significant variance (a change in RUG-II category for more than 25% of residents whose PRIs are audited or a change in CMI for the audited residents of .05 or greater), warranting Stage II review of an additional 80 residents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">A different auditor conducts the Stage II audit, which follows the same general format as the Stage I audit. The nursing home may dispute Stage I audit results with the Stage II auditor, who examines any documentation presented and either agrees with or overturns the Stage I auditor\u2019s adverse findings, referred to as \u201ccontroverted items.\u201d The Stage II auditor may also seek to resolve any discrepancies between the audit findings and the nursing home\u2019s PRIs through discussion with staff or observations of residents. The Stage II auditor returns the completed Stage II audit forms to DOH, which substitutes Stage II audited PRIs for those originally filed by the nursing home, and again determines whether there is a statistically significant variance, warranting a Stage III review of all remaining residents (except those in the lowest-rung RUG-II category).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Yet a third auditor conducts the Stage III audit, which follows the same general format as the Stage I and Stage II audits. The nursing home may seek to persuade the Stage III auditor to overturn controverted items from the Stage II audit. If after completion of the Stage III audit the nursing home is again found to have completed PRIs inaccurately to a statistically significant degree, DOH directs the nursing home to have its PRIs completed by an outside assessor at its own expense for at least one year (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [f] [1] [ii]; [2]).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Finally, DOH\u2019s procedures call for kicking off each stage of the audit with an entrance conference at which the auditor outlines the review\u2019s purpose, scope and timetable. During the entrance conference, the auditor must secure the nursing home\u2019s written determination as to whether an exit conference is requested. Nursing homes are entitled to an exit conference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>at the conclusion of each stage of the audit so long as requested at the entrance conference. At the exit conference, the auditor conveys the provisional results of the review just conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On August 11, 1993, DOH\u2019s contract auditor conducted a Stage I audit of Blossom\u2019s July 1993 PRIs, and so examined records to determine the ADL levels of 40 residents and completed hierarchy checklists for 16 of them. The auditor placed 8 of these 40 residents in a different RUG-II classification, yielding a statistically significant decrease in the CMI for these 40 residents. Accordingly, a Stage II audit was scheduled for December 6, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Stage II auditor examined the records pertaining to the remaining residents living at Blossom in July 1993 and, at Blossom\u2019s request, reassessed the Stage I auditor\u2019s findings. The Stage II auditor overturned three of the items controverted by Blossom in the Stage I audit, but agreed with the Stage I auditor as to the others. Further, the Stage II auditor concluded that PRIs for 32 additional residents were unsupported by documentation. There was an exit conference at which the auditor informed Blossom\u2019s personnel of these provisional results.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Blossom\u2019s administrator wrote a health care fiscal analyst at DOH on December 17, 1993 to complain about how the contract auditors had carried out the Stage I and II audits, and to dispute their findings. Although Blossom\u2019s resident population was too small to qualify for a Stage III audit, DOH\u2019s health care fiscal analyst nonetheless offered Blossom an additional review and thus another chance to contest Stage II audit results.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Two new outside auditors undertook this third review on March 14, 1994. The auditors examined the records of 24 patients involving 27 controverted items from the Stage II audit and agreed with the Stage II auditor on all of them, although Blossom did not know this at the time. More significantly, the auditors prepared a report \u201cdetailing] what occurred\u201d during their review. This report conveys the auditors\u2019 distinct impression that Blossom\u2019s staff was at least uncooperative if not downright intimidating and hostile. Upon completing their work, the auditors told Blossom\u2019s administrator that they were finished, but needed time to compile their findings for the exit conference. When the administrator objected that the auditors \u201cwere not to leave the building until an exit interview was granted,\u201d the auditors \u201cexplained again that [they] were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>prepared to do this yet and [Blossom] would hear from the [auditors\u2019 home] office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">On March 30, 1994, Blossom\u2019s attorney wrote to the health care fiscal analyst at DOH to request the exit conference. His version of the \u201cconfusion as to what exactly happened on March 14,\u201d demonstrates yet again the wisdom of <em>Rashomon: </em>perspective distorts reality and makes the absolute truth unknowable. According to the attorney, during the morning session of the review there was \u201c[a] great deal of constructive dialogue\u201d between the auditors and Blossom\u2019s staff. In the afternoon, however, the auditors\u2019 attitude changed and they \u201cbecame difficult to work with.\u201d This turn of events \u201cdismayed\u201d Blossom\u2019s staff \u201csince the review, until that point, had proceeded with the smooth exchange of assistance and information.\u201d Worse yet, \u201cthe auditors left . . . without giving the nursing home staff any chance to discuss the patient records with the auditors or to see the results of the audit itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Blossom\u2019s attorney stated that he had since learned secondhand from DOH that the auditors \u201chad no intention of ever returning\u201d to conduct an exit conference, and that DOH was preparing Blossom\u2019s CMI based on the March 14, 1994 review. He protested that \u201cwithout question\u201d Blossom was \u201cnot afforded its right\u201d to an exit conference; he requested the exit conference in advance of DOH\u2019s making any final decision regarding Blossom\u2019s CMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">No one from DOH ever replied to Blossom\u2019s attorney\u2019s letter. Indeed, Blossom did not hear from anyone at DOH on the subject of the Stage II audit until March 28, 2001\u2014almost exactly seven years later\u2014when the same health care fiscal analyst responsible for affording Blossom the March 14, 1994 review wrote to offer yet another reexamination. DOH offers no explanation for this seven-year gap other than \u201cadministrative oversight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On April 30, 2001, Blossom\u2019s attorney (not the same one who had written to DOH before), accepted the offer of another review of the July 1993 PRIs and chided DOH for not promptly providing Blossom with the exit conference requested seven years earlier. Further, he disputed DOH\u2019s right to use the audited PRIs to calculate the facility\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rate retroactively for periods from July 1993 forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">On July 2, 2001, the Director of DOH\u2019s Bureau of Financial Management and Information Support responded to Blossom\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>attorney by denying his \u201crequest\u201d for DOH to accept Blossom\u2019s PRIs without auditing their accuracy. Noting that although DOH \u201csincerely regret[s] that the final adjudication of the July[ ] 1993 PRI review has yet to occur, we cannot agree to disregard audit findings and circumvent longstanding protocols for determining when reviews are necessary.\u201d He reiterated DOH\u2019s offer to afford Blossom a \u201cre-review\u201d of the 27 controverted items from the Stage II audit, and pledged to \u201ctake all steps practical to move the audit process along as expeditiously as possible for subsequent periods\u201d so as \u201cto make the facility current at the earliest possible date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">This second bonus review took place another eight months later, on February 22, 2002. Blossom did not question about half of the controverted items, apparently because supporting documentation for the July 1993 PRIs was in some cases no longer available. Of the remaining disputed findings, the auditors agreed with their predecessors on most, and with Blossom on only a few. As a result, the level of discrepancy between the July 1993 PRIs as submitted by Blossom and after audit was still statistically significant. Consequently, on March 28, 2002, DOH\u2019s health care fiscal analyst directed Blossom to enter into a contract with an outside assessor approved by DOH to perform its next four rounds of PRIs (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [f] [1] [ii]; [2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On May 3, 2002, Blossom\u2019s administrator requested a \u201cwaiver for Part 86-2.30,\u201d essentially citing DOH\u2019s tardiness in completing the audit of the July 1993 PRIs. On June 12, 2002, the Director responded, stating that it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether Blossom was requesting that DOH \u201cforego processing of the audit results in total\u201d or \u201crescind its instruction that the facility utilize an independent assessor for PRI submissions between July 2002 and April 2003.\u201d In either event, he denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">In August 2002, DOH notified Blossom of its intention to audit Blossom\u2019s January 1994 PRIs in November 2002. Blossom\u2019s attorney wrote the Director and the fiscal health care analyst to object that DOH could \u201cno longer conduct a timely, lawful audit of the 1994 rate period,\u201d asked DOH to withdraw its audit request and threatened a lawsuit if it did not. On October 17, 2002, the Director denied the request and stated that the audit would take place on November 18, 2002. Further, he warned, \u201cIf medical records are not made available to the auditor, we cannot presume the facility\u2019s PRIs are correct. Consequently, all issues relating to hierarchies would need to be denied and all issues relating to [ADLs] would need to be reduced to their lowest level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>When further efforts to persuade DOH to withdraw or postpone the impending audit proved futile, Blossom commenced this proceeding in Supreme Court on November 15, 2002. Blossom sought judgment declaring respondents\u2019 \u201cannounced intention\u201d to audit 1994 PRIs to be arbitrary, capricious, irrational and contrary to state and federal law because \u201cuntimely as a matter of law\u201d; declaring any \u201cattempt\u201d by respondents to audit PRIs for 1995 and 1996 to be arbitrary, capricious, irrational and contrary to state and federal law; ordering respondents to recalculate its Medicaid reimbursement rates for 1994, 1995 and 1996 using the CMI derived from the PRIs originally filed for these years; and enjoining respondents from auditing Blossom for \u201call periods\u201d in 1994, 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">By order to show cause dated November 18, 2002, Supreme Court granted Blossom a temporary restraining order barring respondents from auditing PRIs filed for the time period from January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996. On January 3, 2003, Supreme Court issued a decision in Blossom\u2019s favor; on February 4, 2003, Supreme Court entered an order barring respondents from auditing Blossom\u2019s PRIs for 1994 through 1996 and directing them to recalculate Blossom\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates for those years in accordance with the PRIs as originally filed. The Appellate Division reversed on the law and dismissed the petition. We subsequently granted Blossom leave to appeal, and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Prior to April 1, 1983, Medicaid audit responsibilities were \u201cinefficiently distributed among various State agencies including the Departments of Social Services and Health and the Offices of Mental Hygiene and Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities\u201d (Mem of State Exec Dept, reprinted in McKinney\u2019s 1983 Session Laws, at 2415, 2417). Accordingly, as of April 1, 1983 all Medicaid-related audit activities were vested in the Department of Social Services (DSS), including auditing the fiscal and statistical records and reports filed by nursing homes to support their Medicaid reimbursement rates <em>(see </em>L 1983, ch 83, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 9; Social Services Law \u00a7\u00a7 364, 368-c; 18 NYCRR 517.3 [a] [1]). DOH continued to set and adjust Medicaid rates <em>(see </em>Public Health Law \u00a7 2803 [2]; \u00a7 2807 [3]; \u00a7 2808) and so also, after the advent of RUG-II, undertook to review PRIs (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [e] [3], [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">As of October 1, 1996, responsibility for administering the Medicaid program was shifted from DSS to DOH <em>(see </em>L 1996, ch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>474, \u00a7\u00a7 233-248; Social Services Law \u00a7 363-a [1]; Public Health Law \u00a7 201 [1] [v]). DSS\u2019s rules and regulations pertaining to transferred Medicaid functions continued in full force and effect as rules and regulations of DOH (see L 1996, ch 474, \u00a7 242). DSS retained the Medicaid audit function until April 1, 1997, when it was renamed the Department of Family Assistance, and the \u201cmedicaid audit function pursuant to sections 364 and 368-c of the social services law\u201d was placed with DOH (see L 1997, ch 436, part B, \u00a7 122 [a], [e]).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The specific DOH and DSS regulations cited by the parties as relevant to this appeal are 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 (relating to audits of fiscal and statistical records and reports), promulgated by DOH in 1976; 18 NYCRR 517.3 (relating to audits of fiscal and statistical records and reports), promulgated by DSS in 1985; 10 NYCRR 86-2.30 (relating to PRIs), promulgated by DOH in 1985; and 10 NYCRR 415.22 (relating to patients\u2019 clinical records), promulgated by DOH in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">There is considerable overlap between 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 and 18 NYCRR 517.3. This is not surprising since these provisions both address auditing fiscal and statistical records and reports, the task transferred from DOH to DSS in 1983, and then returned from DSS to DOH in 1997. Thus, 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\u201c[a] 11 fiscal and statistical records and reports shall be subject to audit. All underlying books, records and documentation which formed the basis for the fiscal and statistical reports, filed by [the nursing home] with the [State], <em>shall be kept and maintained by the facility for a period of time not less than six years from the date of filing, or the date upon which the fiscal and statistical records were to be filed, whichever is the later date. </em>In this respect, any rate of payment . . . will be construed to represent a provisional rate until such audit is performed and completed, at which time such rate or adjusted rate will be construed to represent the audited rate\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Similarly, 18 NYCRR 517.3 (a) (1) specifies that for cost-based providers such as Blossom</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u00a3\u00a3[a]ll fiscal and statistical records and reports . . . used for the purpose of establishing rates . . . and all underlying books, records, documentation and reports which formed the basis for such fiscal and statistical records and reports are subject to audit. All underlying books, records and documentation which formed the basis for the fiscal and statistical reports filed by a provider with any State agency responsible for the establishment of rates of payment or fees <em>must be kept and maintained by the provider for a period of not less than six years from the date of filing of such reports, or the date upon which the fiscal and statistical records were required to be filed, or two years from the end of the last calendar year during any part of which a provider\u2019s rate or fee was based on the fiscal and statistical reports, whichever is later. . . . </em>[A]ny rate of payment certified or established . . . will be construed to represent a provisional rate until an audit is performed and completed, or the period within which to conduct an audit has expired without such audit having been begun or notice of such having been issued, at which time such rate or adjusted rate will be construed to represent the final rate as to those items audited\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">18 NYCRR 517.3 (a) (2) concomitantly specifies that \u00a3\u00a3[a]ll required fiscal and statistical reports are subject to audit <em>for a period of six years from the date of their filing or from the date when such reports were required to be filed, whichever is later\u201d </em>(emphasis added); and 18 NYCRR 517.3 (c) directs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u00a3\u00a3[n]otification by the department to the provider of the department\u2019s intent to audit shall toll <em>the six-year period for record retention and audit. </em>The department shall not notify a provider of its intent to audit more than six years from the date of filing of the fiscal and statistical reports to be audited\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>With respect to PRIs, 10 NYCRR 86-2.30 (e) (3) states that \u201c[t]he patient review form (PRI) and any underlying books, records, and/or documentation which formed the basis for the completion of such form shall be subject to review by [DOH].\u201d Further, \u201c[DOH], in order to ensure accuracy of the [PRI], may also <em>conduct timely on-site observations and/or interviews of patients \u00a1residents and review of their medical </em>records\u201d (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [e] [5] [emphasis added]). Finally, 10 NYCRR 415.22 (b) requires a nursing home resident\u2019s \u201c[c]linieal records\u201d to \u201cbe retained <em>for six years from the date of discharge or </em>death\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">As Blossom points out, PRIs and \u201cany underlying books, records, and/or documentation which form[ ] the basis for [their] completion\u201d (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [e] [3]) in common with \u201cfiscal and statistical records and reports\u201d and \u201c[a]ll underlying books, records and documentation which form[ ] the basis for . . . fiscal and statistical reports\u201d (10 NYCRR 86-2.7; 18 NYCRR 517.3 [a] [1]), significantly influence a facility\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rate; and six years is indisputably the period for record retention and audit of fiscal and statistical reports and their supporting documentation as well as for the retention of a resident\u2019s clinical records after discharge or death. It does not follow, however, that DOH must audit PRIs within six years of filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">As an initial matter, PRIs are not \u201cfiscal and statistical records and reports.\u201d The latter are the \u201ccost reports\u201d that nursing homes must file annually with DOH pursuant to 10 NYCRR 86-2.2. Nor are PRIs the \u201cunderlying books, records and documentation which form[ ] the basis for . . . fiscal and statistical reports,\u201d which include such things as employee payroll records, mortgage and loan documents, and purchase records. For one thing, fiscal and statistical reports must be completed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and certified by an accountant (10 NYCRR 86-2.4, 86-2.5). These requirements make no sense with respect to PRIs, which are instead subject to a three-stage audit process (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [e], [f], [g]) and certification by \u201cthe [facility] operator and the nurse assessor responsible for [PRI] completion\u201d (10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [c] [3]). Further, DOH promulgated 10 NYCRR 86-2.30 in 1985, a time when DSS\u2014not DOH\u2014was responsible for auditing a nursing home\u2019s fiscal and statistical reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Courts normally \u201cdefer to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations if not irrational\u201d <em>(Matter of Sylcox </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Nursing Home &amp; Health Related Facility v Axelrod, </em>184 AD2d 986, 988 [1992], <em>Iv denied </em>80 NY2d 761 [1992]). Deference is especially fitting here where DOH has promulgated a separate regulation governing PRIs, which does not impose any specific deadline for PRI audits and instead simply instructs that they must be timely conducted <em>(see </em>10 NYCRR 86-2.30 [e] [5]).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Nonetheless, Blossom protests that the \u201conly rational interpretation that can be gleaned\u201d from the relevant regulations is that 10 NYCRR 86-2.30 (e) (5) incorporates the six-year limitations period specified in 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 and 18 NYCRR 517.3 (a) and (c). Otherwise, nursing homes would be subject to financial uncertainty and would have to cope with PRI audits many years after residents had died or been discharged (which usually occurs within 2.5 years of arrival), staff had left and the rules for completing or auditing PRIs might have changed. Consequently, Blossom argues, any audit of PRIs conducted more than six years after filing places the nursing home in an untenable position. The auditor must review residents\u2019 clinical records to validate PRIs, but the nursing home may have lawfully destroyed these records for at least some of the residents in the audit population.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">These are valid points. It is also true that significantly delayed or protracted PRI audits harm the public fisc by thwarting prompt recoupment of any Medicaid overpayments. As we pointed out in <em>Matter of Elcor Health Servs. v Novello </em>(100 NY2d 273, 280 [2003]), however, \u201c[t]hat [DOH\u2019s] interpretation might not be the most natural reading of the regulation, or that the regulation could be interpreted in another way, does not make the interpretation irrational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Although PRI audits are not subject to the six-year limitations period specified in 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 and 18 NYCRR 517.3 (a) and (c), \u201ctimely\u201d is not synonymous with \u201ctimeless.\u201d In this case, DOH sought to audit Blossom\u2019s January 1994 PRIs more than six years after they were filed solely because DOH neglected to wrap up its Stage II audit of Blossom\u2019s July 1993 PRIs until 2002, and PRI audits take place sequentially. Because DOH offers no better explanation than \u201cadministrative oversight\u201d (meaning inadvertence, not supervision) for the seven-year hiatus in its nearly nine-year long audit of Blossom\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>July 1993 PRIs, we hold that any audit of Blossom\u2019s PRIs filed in 1995 and 1996 is untimely as a matter of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, the proceeding converted to a declaratory judgment action and judgment granted declaring that respondents may not audit or adjust Blossom\u2019s CMI for the period January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, and that Blossom\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates for the period from January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1996 be determined by implementing the CMI as calculated using the PRIs originally filed by Blossom for 1994, 1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Chief Judge Kaye and Judges G.B. Smith, Ciparick, Rosenblatt, Graffeo and R.S. Smith concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-9\">. Blossom\u2019s request for injunctive and declaratory relief with respect to the audit of its 1994 PRIs is moot because DOH has already commenced and completed this audit; however, the question of this audit\u2019s use remains open for our consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. For most nursing homes, 1983 is the base year. Because of a major construction and expansion project, Blossom\u2019s costs are based on the six-month period from May 1, 1991 through October 31, 1991 (10 NYCRR 86-2.2 [e]; 86-2.15). A base year is used in a prospective system to control for cost growth in excess of inflation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">. Direct costs encompass the hands-on care provided to patients, such as nursing, social services, occupational therapy and physical therapy services (10 NYCRR 86-2.10 [c] [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-9\">. Indirect costs include administrative services, grounds, housekeeping, food and laundry services (10 NYCRR 86-2.10 [d] [1]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b649-10\">. Noncomparable costs are those specific to a particular facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\">. In descending order of resource utilization, these five hierarchies are heavy rehabilitation, special care, clinically complex, severe behavioral and reduced physical functioning. A nursing home resident who does not have a condition qualifying for one of the four higher hierarchies is automatically placed in the fifth, reduced physical functioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. For a nursing home with a population under 120, Stage II review encompasses all remaining residents except those in the lowest-rung RUG-II category, and is the last stage in the audit process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">. For a nursing home with a population under 120, DOH would take this step after an unsatisfactory Stage II audit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b656-8\">. As originally promulgated in 1976, what is now 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 was subdivision (a) of a provision composed of subdivisions (a) through (h). On September 25, 1996, DOH proposed to amend section 86-2.7 by deleting subdivisions (b) through (h) \u201cto eliminate obsolete language in order to recognize the transfer to [DSS in 1983] of the authority/responsibility for [nursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>home] Medicaid rate audits\u201d and to recognize that \u201c[t]he responsibility for the Medicaid rate audit function was previously transferred to [DSS] and is authorized by DSS regulation [i.e., 18 NYCRR part 517]\u201d (XVIII NY Reg, Issue 39, Sept. 25, 1996, at 14). Accordingly, subdivisions (b) through (h) of 10 NYCRR 86-2.7 were repealed, effective January 14, 1997 (XIX NY Reg, Issue 4, Jan. 29, 1997, at 10), shortly before the Legislature shifted the Medicaid audit function again, this time away from DSS to DOH (see L 1997, ch 436, part B, \u00a7 122 [a], [e]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\">. We also note that a nursing home\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates are provisional until the cost reports upon which the rates are based have been audited, or the period within which to conduct an audit has expired without either an audit having begun or a notice of audit having been issued (10 NYCRR 86-1.8, 86-2.7; 18 NYCRR 517.3 [a] [1]). Further, notice of intent to audit must be given within six years from the date the cost reports are filed (18 NYCRR 517.3 [c]). A nursing home has no entitlement to Medicaid payments until these audits of cost reports have been completed, or the time for conducting them has expired without an audit having been begun or noticed <em>('Matter of Cortlandt Nursing Home v Axelrod, </em>66 NY2d 169, 178-179 [1985]). From the record in this case, it is impossible to tell whether Blossom\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates for the years 1994 through 1996 were still provisional or instead were final when DOH sought to audit the January 1994 PRIs. Accordingly, we have no occasion to address in this appeal whether an audit of PRIs for time periods for which there are audited or final rates may ever be \u201ctimely\u201d within the meaning of 10 NYCRR 86-2.30 (e) (5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
