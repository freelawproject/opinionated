But some one must be made a defendant who can answer under oath. A corporation answers under its corporate seal, and if it is the sole defendant to a bill for discovery only, the bill will be dismissed.

Whether appellant had ever delivered to appellee or his trustee the <em>\u201c </em>$40,000 worth\u201d of bonds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">(2.) How much of the $500,000 of bonds provided for in the mortgage of 1892 have been issued, how many are in the hands of the Fidelity Company, and how many of those issued does appellant still retain an interest in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">(3.) Whether or not any of the bonds had been delivered to stockholders or other persons as collateral security for moneys advanced appellant, how much money had been realized by appellant on said bonds, and in whose hands and to whom were said bonds delivered,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The prayer of the bill is that the appellant Railway Company and the Fidelity Company, trustee, be required to issue and deliver <em>\u201c </em>$40,000 worth \u201d of the bonds of 1892 with interest coupons attached thereto, and that appellant be required to pay the interest, at the rate of <em>six per cent., </em>that has accrued since the date of the sale of the land to appellant; and that all necessary steps be taken to give appellee complete relief according to the statement of his case in the bill, and such general relief as he might be entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Three grounds are urged in support of the equity of this bill which will be considered in the following order.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">First, that it is a bill for discovery, and that when a court of equity takes possession of the suit upon this rightful ground of jurisdiction, it will proceed to dispose of the case on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">It is true that if a party is properly in equity for a discovery, the court, having possession of the subject, will proceed to decide the case without turning the party round to a court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>law, unless indeed the discovery was sought and obtained in order to be used in a pending common law action. <em>Lyons </em>v. Miller, 6 Gratt. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Without discussing other imperfections in this, as a bill for discovery, it is sufficient to say that it cannot be maintained as such, for the reason that no one is made a party defendant who-can answer under oath. ' There are but two parties defendant, and each is a corporation. The object of a bill of discovery in equity is to enable one party to search the conscience of his antagonist, and to compel him to make disclosures upon oath of facts necessary to the preservation of the rights of the former, which he otherwise might not be able to prove. Corporations cannot answer under oath, but only under their common seal, and for this reason, in order to prevent a failure of justice, it has long been the settled law in this country and in England, when a discovery is desired, to make such of the officers or individual corporators as are supposed to be personally cognizant of the facts wanted, parties defendant along with the company itself. The convenience of this practice has made its adoption a necessity notwithstanding the general rule in equity, that a mere witness shall not be made defendant to a bill. 1 Minor\u2019s Inst., pp. 642-3; Thompson on Corp., sec. 7409, &amp;c., and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The second ground urged in support of the equity of the bill is that it seeks to enforce the specific performance of the contract of appellant to deliver to appellee \u201c $40,000 worth \u201d of its first mortgage bonds. This contention is wholly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The bill on its face declares that the contract to deliver the bonds was dated in 1889, and that the bonds to be delivered were at that time secured on the property o\u00ed appellant by mortgage deed. If the right to specific performance exists, it is the right to demand the bonds secured by the' mortgage of 1889, and yet the bill and exhibits filed therewith show that this mortgage' and the bonds secured thereby have been can-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>celled and destroyed, thus making it impossible to specifically execute the alleged contract.</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">The third ground urged in support of the jurisdiction of the court is that the bill sets out facts which show that there is? or at least should be, in the hands of appellant, a trust fund in which appellee is entitled to participate, and that equity will take jurisdiction to ascertain what that fund is, where it is, and to have it administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The mortage of 1892 which the bill undertakes to interpret as creating a trust fund, for the benefit of appellee, is filed with the bill and made a part thereof. It begins by reciting the right of appellant, under its charter, to borrow money for the use of the corporation, aud to secure such loans on its property. It recites the fact that appellant had acquired all of the bonds secured under the mortgage of 1889, and had cancelled the same, and secured from the trustee named in that mortgage a release of the same of record. It recites that the stockholders had unanimously resolved that the appellant company should issue $500,000 of new bonds, and secure the same by mortgage or deed of trust upon its property. It then proceeds to convey all of appellant\u2019s property to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust, and Safe Deposit Company, in trust for the equal <em>fro rata </em>benefit and security of the several persons or corporations who may be, or shall become holders of any of the bonds issued thereunder. The language in the mortgage relied on in part as creating the bonds a trust fund, is found in the resolution of the stockholders authorizing the mortgage, and is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u201c Whereas, it is further deemed expedient and for the best interest of this company that another mortgage or deed of trust should be executed, and new bonds issued for the sum of $500,000, the money derived from the sale of said bonds to be used for the payment of the. outstanding indebtedness of the company, and for betterments and improvements, for the further extension and improvement of its railroad system, the introduction of electricity as a motive power,, and for the more efficient operation of the same.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>This language sets forth the necessity for creating the mortgage, and explains the purpose of issuing the bonds, but it creates no trust to deliver any of these bonds to any creditor of appellant, or to sell the bonds and pay the proceeds to any creditor. A debtor may borrow money upon his property for the purpose of paying his general debts, but he does not thereby create a trust fund and constitute himself a trustee who can be impleaded by such creditors in a court of equity and made to account to them for the money so borrowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Language further relied on as creating a trust fund is the provision in a subsequent portion of the mortgage that the trustee named in the deed shall certify and deliver $200,000 of the bonds to appellant, \u201c to be applied to the payment of the present outstanding indebtedness, and to such other uses as the Board of Directors shall determine.\u201d What has been said in respect to the resolution of the stockholders is equally applicable to the language here relied on. The trustee is thereby charged with the duty of certifying and delivering to the debtor $200,000 of the bonds, but appellant took the same subject to no trust that it can be called upon to administer in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">This deed of trust or mortgage is in the usual form for such purposes. The only trust created or intended to be created thereby is carefully defined. The property is conveyed to the trustee named to be held by him in trust and confidence for the equal <em>pro rata </em>benefit and security of the several persons and corporations then holding, or who may become holders of any of the $500,000 of bonds issued thereunder. The deed does not secure, and was not intended to secure or create a trust fund for the benefit of the creditors of appellant. Its indebtedness, together with .the necessity for improving and enlarging its business, is only referred to as a reason for creating the mortgage and issuing the $500,000 bonds thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The appellee conveye'd the land in question to appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>without reserving any lien to secure the consideration therefor, and if he has any valid claim against appellant, as to which no opinion is expressed, his remedy is a plain and adequate one at law for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Ror these reasons, the decree complained of must be reversed, the demurrer sustained, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
