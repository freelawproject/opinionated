It is manifest that the object of the statute was <em>twofold; </em>first, to induce those interested to reclaim the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>by promptly paying the delinquent taxes ; and second, to encourage others to come forward and buy the property from the State for the taxes due thereon. After the application has been filed, another opportunity is given those interested to reclaim the land, upon condition, however, that the costs incident to filing the application and a penalty of $5.00 to the applicant is paid. The penalty of $5.00 was doubtless intended; to reimburse the applicant for his trouble in offering, at the invitation of the State, to become the purchaser. This final application to redeem is at any time within four months from the date of the service of the copies of the application, or the completion of the order of publication, if there be one, and the language of the statute, \u201c <em>if no person who has a right to redeem, at the time of the service of the </em>copies, <em>or the completion of the order of publication as aforesaid, appear within four months after such copies have been served, fc.f </em>was intended to fix the date of the service of the copies, &amp;c., as the time from which the redemption period of four months should begin to run, and had no reference to the conditions imposed upon the privilege of redeeming. Those penalties attached as soon as the application to purchase was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The construction contended for by petitioners would defeat the object of the.law, and make it worthless, for no one would take the trouble to prepare his application and pay officers\u2019 fees if the delinquent tax-payer could come forward and reclaim the land by paying to the clerk the tax and interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">For these reasons the writ prayed for must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>Mandamus refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
