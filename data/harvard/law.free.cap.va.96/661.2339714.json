The Pailroad Company appeared, and, upon its motion, the notice was quashed. Thereupon the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company applied for a writ of error to the judge of the Circuit Court, who refused it, and the case is now before us upon a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The judgment complained of is in accordance with the decision of this court in the case of <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Company </em>v. <em>N. &amp; W. Rwy. Co. </em>reported in 88 Va. at page 920. Plaintiff in error urges us to enquire into the correctness of that decision; while, upon the part of the defendant, it is earnestly contended that the reported case was correctly decided, and, if it were not, we are bound to adhere to and respect\u2018it as an authority binding upon us. We recognize the value of the principle invoked. The rule of <em>stare decisis </em>is entitled to the greatest respect, and under our system of jurisprudence is an essential feature of the administration of justice. Where a decision, and especially a line of decisions, has been acquiesced in, where it has been followed in other cases and has become a rule of property, and men have, in the conduct of affairs, learned to respect and conform to it, it becomes of especial, and indeed of binding, force, and should not be disturbed, except by the interposition of legislative power. But we do not consider that the circumstances adverted to as lending force to a judicial interpretation of a statute, and which may be of so strenuous a nature as to preclude further euquiry into the correctness of the adjudication, apply to the case before us. We have here a single judgment followed in no other case, rendered by a bare majority of the court\u2014two of the judges dissenting\u2014and placing a construction upon the statute law involved in it, which, we think, palpably erroneous and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>trary to public policy, as tending to foster and promote a monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The sections of the Code to be considered are 1287, 1288, and 1289. These sections are taken from the act of Assembly found in Acts of 1879-80 at p. 53, and cover substantially the same ground. The revisors, for the sake of perspicuity and convenience, divided the subject treated of in that statute, and it now appears in the Code in the three sections referred to. These sections are <em>in pari materia, </em>and each and all can and should be looked to in order to reach the right interpretation of them. They are as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">Sec. 1287. \u201cEvery telegraph and every telephone company incorporated by this or any other State, or by the United States, may construct, maintain, and operate its line along any of the State or county roads, or works, and over the waters of the State, and along and parallel to any of the railroads of the State, provided the ordinary use of such roads, works, railroads, and waters be not thereby obstructed; and along or over the streets of any city, or town, with the consent of the council thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">Sec. 1288. \u201c Such company may contract with any person or corporation, the owner of lands, or of any interest, franchise, privilege, or easement therein or in respect thereto, over which such line is proposed to be constructed, for the right of way for erecting, repairing, and preserving its poles and other structures necessary for operating its line, and the right of way for the erection and occupation of offices at suitable distances along its line for the public accommodation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">Sec. 1289. \u201cIf the company and such owner cannot agree on the terms of such contract, the company shall be entitled to such right of way upon making just compensation therefor to such owner. Such compensation shall be ascertained and made, as provided in chapter forty-six, for the acquisition of lands by a company incorporated for a work of internal improvement, when such internal improvement company cannot agree on the terms of the purchase with those entitled to the lands wanted for the purpose of the company. The title which may be acquired by a telegraph or telephone company under 'this section shall be only to a right of way for the purposes stated in the preceding section; and no right of way acquired by any such company under this or the preceding section shall be to the exclusion of other like companies from having or acquiring a like right of way over the same lands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">. The rul\u00e9s of interpretation which have been established for the guidance of courts in the construction of statutes are cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>rectly stated in <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. </em>v. <em>N. &amp; W. Rwy. Co., supra. </em>It will be observed that a telegraph company is authorized by the first section quoted to construct its line along any of the State or county roads, and the case just cited concedes that \u201calong,\u201d in that connection, is equivalent to \u201c along and upon \u201d or \u201c on it.\u201d In the last clause of this section they are given the right to go along or over streets of any city or town, with the consent of the council thereof. Here, too, \u201c along \u201d has the signification just given it of \u201c along and upon.\u201d Of this, there can be no doubt. Here, then, we have in this section the word \u201c along \u201d appearing three times; and the sense in which it is used in the first and third instance is clear and unquestioned. The same meaning, therefore, will be attributed to it elsewhere unless there be something in the context which clearly indicates that the Legislature intended some other and different meauing to attach to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">It is claimed that this intention is to be found in the phrase \u201c along and parallel to,\u201d and that by the use of the words \u201c parallel to,\u201d the Legislature intended to restrict the meaning theretofore and thereafter given to the word \u201c along,\u201d and to confine the telegraph company to aline following the length of the railway\u2019s right of way, but never encroaching upon it. Or, in the language of the court in <em>Postal Telegraph-Cable Company </em>v. <em>N. &amp; W. Rwy Co., 88 </em>Va. 920, 927, it is to run in the direction of the railroad line,, \u201c alongside of and equidistant from it throughout all its parts, so that neither shall meet or touch; not in nor upon the railroad strip.\u201d <em>We </em>are wholly unable to perceive, if this be the true construction, why the Legislature found it necessary to say anything about the railroad. The right which a telegraph company is authorized to acquire would be a matter of indifference to railroad companies if the construction heretofore given by this court were correct, and the mention of them in the statute would be utterly irrelevant; but railroads are mentioned in the statute, and it is to be presumed for a necessary purpose, and we must find and give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>effect to the legislative intent by considering, not a part, but all ofthe language used, and are justified in rejecting any part of the statute as unnecessary and irrelevant only in the last resort when it has been found impossible to give effect to all the language used, and reach a rational conclusion. It is impossible to read the three sections under consideration without at once concluding that the regulation of the rights of telegraph companies in their relation to railroad companies in the matter of the construction, maintenance, and operation of their lines was one of the essential objects of the original statute, and the sections into which it has been divided as they now appear in the Code. \u201c Parallel,\u201d as used in \u2022sec. 1287, does not have its primary and scientific meaning as lines extended in the same direction and in' all parts \u2022equally distant.\u201d That definition can in no case be applied to a line of railway, for no railway line is, we believe, mathematically straight. The Legislature merely intended to say that the telegraph line should be \u201c along and parallel to,\u201d in the sense of \u201cconforming to,\u201d'\u201chaving the same direction of, \u2022tendency with\u201d the railroad, in order to guard against any undue interference with or hinderance of the railroad company in the enjoyment of its property. If there were any doubt left as to the proper construction of sec. 1287, the two succeeding sections should remove it. Sec. 1288 provides that a telegraph company \u201c may contract with any person or corporation, the owner of lands, or of any interest, franchise, or easement therein or in respect thereto, over which such line is proposed to be constructed, for the right of way of erecting * * * its line; and sec. 1289 provides that if a telegraph company and \u201c such owner \u201d cannot agree, the company shall be entitled to such right of way upon making just compensation therefor to \u201c such owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Referring to sec. 1288, we find that the \u201cowner\u201d referred to is \u201c any person or corporation,\u201d and the right of way referred to is one to be constructed \u201c over \u201d their lands. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>seems to be hardly room to doubt that these two sections, one of which provides for the acquisition of the right conferred by sec. 1287 by contract, and the other by condemnation, contemplate that the right is to be \u201c over \u201d the property of the \u201c land owner,\u201d whether he be a person or corporation, provided only, in the case of county roads, public works and waters of the State, and of railroads, that their ordinary use shall not be thereby obstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">As bearing upon the proposition that the three sections discussed are to be considered and construed together, we refer, in addition to the considerations already mentioned, to sec. 1290, which expressly groups the three sections together, and provides that they \u201c shall be subject to repeal, alteration, or modification, and the rights and privileges acquired thereunder shall be subject to revocation or modification by the General Assembly at its pleasure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The plaintiff in error urges upon us the propriety of considering the measure of damages. It would be premature to do so at the present time. <em>We </em>shall content ourselves, therefore, with reversing the judgment of the County Court, and direct it to enter judgment in conformity with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
