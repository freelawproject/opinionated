Walker, however, represents that on the 22d day of November, 1898, he applied to the respondent, James A. Stone, registrar of Bristol precinct and also clerk of the Corporation Court of the city of Bristol, and as such by law the custodian of the poll books of said precinct at the election of members of Congress from Virginia held on the 8th day of November, 1898, to permit petitioner to examine said poll books, but was told by respondent that the books were sealed up, and could not'be inspected by him; that petitioner stated to respondent that his \u00a1object in examining the poll books was to get information necessary to petitioner in preparing his notice of contest for a seat in the Fifty-sixth Congress of the United States from the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia, composed in part of the city of Bristol, hut that the respondent flatly refused petitioner permission to see the poll books in his custody, saying that they were sealed up, and petitioner would not be allowed to see the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>outside of them, &amp;c. These allegations are only denied by respondent in a general way, and the proof is that petitioner was denied the privilege of inspecting the poll books of Bristol precinct used at the election held on November 8, 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Sec. 132 of the Code of Virginia provides, among other things, that the poll books, after being lodged with the clerk, shall remain \u201cfor the use of persons who may choose to inspect them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Sec. 3086 of the Code confers upon this court jurisdiction to issue'writs of <em>mandamus </em>in all cases \u201cin which it may be necessary to prevent a failure of justice in which a <em>mandamus </em>may issue according to the principles of the common law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">At common law, the writ of <em>mandamus </em>will be issued directed to any person or corporation, or inferior court, \u201c requiring them to do some particular thing, therein specified, which appertains to their office or duty.\u201d 3 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Under the provision of sec. 132 of the Code, it was clearly the right of the petitioner on the 22d of November, 1898, when he applied to the respondent for the poll books of Bristol precinct, to be permitted to inspect them, and, this right having been denied by the respondent, a <em>mandamus </em>must issue requiring him to permit petitioner, James A \"Walker, to inspect these poll books, and to take therefrom, at and within a reasonable time, in the presence of the respondent, memoranda or notes, such as are proper to be made according to the views expressed by this court in the case of <em>Gleaves </em>v. <em>Terry, supra, </em>with respect to the record of the proceedings of the electoral board of the several counties, &amp;c., as to which secrecy is not enjoined by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\"><em>Mandamus refused in one case, and granted in the </em>other.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
