For the reasons set forth herein, Defendant's conviction is affirmed, the sentence is vacated, and the case remanded for resentencing with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION OF THE RECORD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 21, 2018, the State filed a bill of information charging Defendant with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, in violation of La.R.S. 14:68.4. On July 5, 2018, Defendant pled not guilty and waived his right to a trial by jury. The district court heard evidence and argument on August 9 and took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence adduced at trial revealed that, in September of 2017, Carol Spotsville, a relative of Defendant, made a verbal agreement with him to repair a dented area on her 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe. She agreed to have Defendant do the repair work chiefly because he was charging her a low price. Also, he told her he would have the job done by noon the next day. Defendant drove the victim's car from her house to the area he was using as a body shop. The next day, he called to tell her he could not have the car ready by noon, but that it would be ready by 3:00 p.m. She testified that she repeatedly called him after the car was not returned after 3:00 but got no answer. She did not hear from him until approximately 8:30 p.m., when she called, and he answered only to tell her he had driven the car into Alexandria and collided with another vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The victim testified that Defendant was not authorized to drive the vehicle; she thought his girlfriend (his wife by the time of the trial) was going to drive it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 16, 2018, the court found Defendant guilty as charged. On September 13, the court sentenced Defendant to two years at hard labor, to run consecutively to any other term. Also, he was ordered to pay a fine of seven hundred and fifty dollars and restitution to the victim. The trial court recommended work release, if available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant now seeks review by this court and assigns as a single error that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, Defendant argues the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Specifically, he argues the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his use of the victim's vehicle was unauthorized. The general analysis for insufficiency claims is well-established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is raised on appeal, the critical inquiry of the reviewing court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

The victim testified that he was not authorized to drive the vehicle at any time; she expected his girlfriend, Doris Loyd, to drive if there was any need. Doris and Defendant both testified that he was authorized to drive the Hyundai. Defendant testified that the victim's husband saw him drive the Hyundai when Defendant picked it up at the victim's residence. Thus, resolution of the issue, and ultimately the verdict, hinged upon a credibility determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court explained its ruling at some length:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   BY THE COURT: You can have a seat over there. Counsel, last week we had a bench trial on a charge of Unauthorized Use of a Movable, um, after the conclusion of the trial, the Court um, recessed the trial to allow me to research the jurisprudential handling of consent, which I think was the primary - - one of the primary issues in the case, was whether um, or not [Defendant], had the consent of Ms. Spotsville to use her vehicle - - her SUV uh, on the - - at the time in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   And um, the Court uh, did - - the Court has researched the jurisprudence involving the Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle, the Court has - - also received a case that was submitted by Mr. Wilson for the Court's consideration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And the - - the jurisprudence um, the jurisprudence seems to focus on - - due to the fact that it is a crime that re - - requires intent, uh, the jurisprudence seems to focus on the Defendant's intent in connection with the consent. Um, and from a civil standpoint, I think for both parties to have an agreement, they both have to have an understanding of what is happening, they have uh, - - to form\n   the consent, both have to have a similar understanding, and I'm not saying that doesn't exist in a criminal standpoint, but, in the context of these cases, the cases - - the court seem to have focused on what was the Defendant's intent or understanding of his use of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   And um, I think there were - - there had been similar cases in the past, uh, one, would be\n   <em>\n    State vs. Varnado\n   </em>\n   , [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=01-367%20%28La.App.%205%20Cir.%209/13/01%29\">\n    01-367 (La.App. 5 Cir. 9/13/01)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473122\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/798/191/\">\n    798 So.2d 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], in that particular case a uh, an employee had use of a transport van to haul employees from one location to another, and he was supposed to be back on Friday evening after transporting people to the work - - work site, and uh, he didn't make it back until Sunday evening. And uh, apparently the employer got uptight about Mr. Varnado using the van for the weekend, and uh, the Court - - the Court found there was sufficient proof of intent in that case due to the fact that the Defendant refused or failed to communicate with his employer's repeated requests or repeated attempts to contact him over that weekend period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Uh, another case was\n   <em>\n    State vs Spencer\n   </em>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97-811%20%28La.App.%205%20Cir.%201/27/98%29\">\n    97-811 (La.App. 5 Cir. 1/27/98)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11852377\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/707/119/\">\n    707 So.2d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Uh, in Spencer um, apparently it was a uh, test drive situation where the Defendant went to a mo - - and automobile location, and took the car for a test drive, and apparently the salesman, and the car lot didn't feel like a 24 hour test drive was reasonable under the circumstances, and um, the - - the Court seem to agree that they thought that 24 hours was kind of a long test drive for - - for their vehicle, and they - - they upheld the conviction for Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Um, just for purposes of findings in this case, um, the Court believes that Ms. Spotsville hired [Defendant] to perform um, repair work to her automobile. And uh, the parties had agreed that he was going to pick that vehicle up from - - from her house, and take it to his repair shop. And uh, that - - that seem[s] to be a consistent belief from all the witnesses. Uh, Ms. Spotsville testified, [Defendant] testified, and his wife testified, they were all present at the location in the parking lot where this initial discussion took place where [Defendant] was going to come pick up the vehicle. There was a further discussion at Ms. Spotsville's home where, again, it was discussed that uh, we have other engagements we're going to right now, and I'm going to come back later, and take your car to my shop, and so, I think it's clear that [Defendant] had initial um, authorization to drive Ms. Spotsville's car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Um, the witnesses are also very consistent that these repairs were going to be completed by noon the next day. And [Defendant] has explained that he wasn't able to meet that deadline and he decided to extend how long he was going to work on the car until 3:00 PM. He did not meet that deadline, and everyone is consistent as to, that did not occur. And [Defendant] unilaterally decided to extend the deadline, and to drive her car around in Alexandria until he wrecked it around 6:30 or 7 that evening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   It is also significant that there was contact between [Defendant] and Ms. Spotsville prior to noon and prior to 3:00 PM, but, no communication from 3:00 PM until - - at some point after the wreck. Ms. Spotsville testified that she was uh, concerned about her car and repeatedly tried to contact [Defendant] from 3:00 PM until he - - she finally got a call.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   I think that that is significant. I think it is significant that there was no communication by [Defendant] from 3:00\n   PM until after the wreck. And the reason it's significant is because I think [Defendant] knew he had exceeded his authority or had exceeded his use of her vehicle. Um, whether the reason he took the car was in the scope of his repair, I don't think it matters. He had clearly exceeded the time that everyone had agreed to, everyone had agreed to noon, I don't think Ms. Spotsville agreed to 3:00 but she didn't have much choice. She never agreed 'till[sic] 6:30 or 7:00 that PM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   COURT'S RULING\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   And I think it is - - whether it's 24 hours, such as in the\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   case, or whether it's two (2) days in the\n   <em>\n    Varnado\n   </em>\n   case, when a defendant exceeds his permitted use of the vehicle, that is an unauthorized use of that motor vehicle, and I believe the State has met it's burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that [Defendant] committed an Unauthorized Use of Ms. Spotsville's vehicle on the day in question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This court, in considering the proof necessary for a conviction for the offense of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The Defendant was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, which is \"the intentional taking or use of a motor vehicle which belongs to another, either without the other's consent, or by means of fraudulent conduct, practices, or representations, but without any intention to deprive the other of the motor vehicle permanently.\" La.R.S. 14:68.4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Defendant asserts that Drewitt conveniently omitted the terms of the loan of his truck and never testified that it was for a specified time or when he expected it to be returned. The Defendant points out that Drewitt never testified that the truck was kept longer than the agreed upon time and, when Drewitt initially talked to police, the Defendant did not have Drewitt's truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The Defendant further points out that Drewitt testified that a neighbor \"supposedly\" chased him with a gun. The Defendant asserts that it would seem Drewitt would be able to say whether someone chased him with a gun, and if he had been chased with a gun, he would have reported it to police. The Defendant asserts that he did not initially take the truck, so the question then becomes, was there an agreement as to when it was to be returned and, if so, what was the agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The Defendant then asserts that if Drewitt did not testify to or perhaps recall the agreement, the State did not meet its burden of proof. The Defendant further argues that his request for money in exchange for the return of the truck did not indicate a taking. The Defendant asserts that in light of the events surrounding the loan of the truck, the request for money is far more indicative of the use of the truck as collateral so that Drewitt would be fronted drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   We find that the Defendant had Drewitt's permission to use the truck while Drewitt was at the Defendant's residence; however, Drewitt testified that when he was forced to leave the Defendant's residence, he made it clear that he wanted his truck back and the Defendant was no longer permitted to use it. Charles returned the truck to the Defendant and later saw the Defendant drive the truck. The Defendant then called Drewitt on November 19, 2005 and stated he would return the truck if Drewitt paid him two hundred dollars. Additionally, Drewitt was driving the truck when he encountered the police and fled the scene upon exiting the vehicle. We find that flight by the Defendant was indicative of his guilty knowledge that he was not authorized to use the truck.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

As noted earlier, this case hinged upon credibility, and a determination regarding credibility is within the province of the factfinder. In this case, the trial court heard the testimony and chose to believe Ms. Spotsville and not Defendant or his witness, wife Doris Loyd. In addition, similar to the\n   defendant's flight in\n   <em>\n    Baylor\n   </em>\n   , Defendant here fled the scene of the accident in Alexandria, which can be construed as evidence of guilty knowledge on his part. As further noted by the trial court, Defendant's failure to contact Ms. Spotsville after 3 p.m., or answer her calls until their contact by phone hours later after he totaled her vehicle, can also be construed as guilty knowledge on his part. It is also clear under our law that the testimony of one witness, the victim in this case, if believed, and absent internal contradictions or irreconcilable conflicts with physical evidence, is sufficient to support a conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The current version of La.Code Crim.P. art. 780 providing for a written waiver of the right became effective on July 17, 2013.

Immediately thereafter, Defendant's counsel requested a judge trial, in Defendant's presence. While there is no record of the trial court having advised Defendant at arraignment of his right to jury trial, Defendant was represented by counsel and voiced no opposition to the request for a bench trial. Further, at the actual trial, Defendant acknowledged before the trial judge in open court that he and counsel discussed, prior to the arraignment, his right to jury trial and the reasons for the decision to waive that right. We additionally note that Defendant was not inexperienced in the criminal process; the record reflecting an extensive arrest history and a previous conviction for felony theft of a motor vehicle, the offense for which he was on probation at the time of this trial. Thus, like the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Pierre\n   </em>\n   , Defendant's acknowledgement of the right to a jury trial and his reasons for choosing to waive such, albeit during trial, is sufficient to show a knowing and intelligent waiver. Further, Defendant requested the waiver of his right to jury trial, did not object to the granting of the waiver, and did not assign as error or argue the jury waiver issue on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v.
