I write separately to note my view that this brutal armed robbery offense, which included as victims two adults and a three-year-old child, warrants a significant hard labor sentence. However, I agree with the court of appeal's remand for resentencing, though for a different reason than the court of appeal. Here, in my view,\n   the trial judge did not comply with La. C.Cr.P. 894.1. Specifically, he failed correctly to assess applicable mitigating factors,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   defendant's youth (20 years old) and status as a first-time offender. In fact, contrary to clearly established jurisprudence, the trial judge deemed his youth an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     aggravating\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   factor, rather than\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     mitigating\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   factor, emphasizing that defendant would likely commit additional crimes.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Knox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9536478\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/425/707/#p708\">\n    425 So.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 708 (La. 1982) (recognizing \"youth and first offender status\" as common mitigating circumstances);\n   <em>\n    State v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9597073\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/414/1245/\">\n    414 So.2d 1245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1982) (same). Accordingly, I agree with the court of appeal that the case must be remanded for resentencing and proper assessment of all applicable 894.1 factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State v. Ladd\n   </em>\n   , 14-1611 (La. 3/27/15,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869205\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/184/\">\n    164 So.3d 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (remanding case for resentencing for trial court's failure to comply with application of 894.1 factors).\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
