By written motion filed on January 11, 2018, Defendant waived his right to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 19, 2018, Defendant was tried by bench trial on both the present charge, second degree battery, and a charge filed in a separate docket number, cruelty to persons with infirmities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court found Defendant guilty of both charges. The trial court ordered a Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI) report and set sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 17, 2018, the trial court sentenced Defendant on the second degree battery conviction to eight years in the Department of Corrections, to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for cruelty to persons with infirmities. On the cruelty\n   to persons with infirmities conviction, the trial court imposed a sentence of ten years in the Department of Corrections, with all ten years to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Defense counsel asserted an objection and subsequently filed a written Motion for Reconsideration, alleging the sentences imposed were excessive. The trial court set the Motion for Reconsideration for hearing on October 16, 2018. After hearing argument, the trial court denied the Motion for Reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's Motion and Order for Appeal was granted on September 24, 2018. For the following reasons that will be discussed, we affirm with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 1, 2017, Defendant, a forty-three-year-old inmate, was working at the Bunkie Senior Center as part of a work release program. The victim, Ruddio Rico, age sixty-eight at the time of the incident, worked with his wife as a volunteer at the center. At trial, the victim explained that earlier that day his wife told him Defendant \"cussed\" at her and threatened her when she told him not to pressure wash near the cracks of the windows. According to the manager of the Bunkie Senior Center, she saw the victim walk up to Defendant and tell Defendant to never call his wife names again. The victim testified that he also told Defendant that if he ever had a conflict with his wife again, he would send Defendant back to jail. When the victim turned around and walked back to his truck, Defendant followed and asked what the victim was going to do about it. The victim turned around to face Defendant, and Defendant hit the victim in the face. The victim fell backward, and Defendant began \"stumping\" the victim's hands and kicking the victim in the back. Defendant stopped beating the victim when the manager yelled at Defendant to go inside. The manager estimated the attack lasted about five minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the manager, the victim was bleeding from his face, nose, eyes, and hand, leaving a pool of blood where he lay. The manager did not see any weapons on the victim and did not hear the victim make any threats to Defendant. When asked if the victim yelled during the attack, the manager replied, \"No, I mean it just happened so fast, he just turned around and Gerrell hit him with his fist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victim described the beating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A. He hit me right here in the eye.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q. And you've indicated just for the record, your right eye?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. Right eye, it's a prosthetic eye right now. And then hit me on the nose and then I have a cut on here right here. And then I fell to the ground unconscious he put his hand ... or his foot over my left hand .... And he was smashing down on my hand with foot [sic] and he was kicking me in the back several times and he kicked me in the head several times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The victim also testified that he was 99% unconscious after he was hit. The victim described the pain he felt as being worse than his wound in Vietnam. The victim was transported by ambulance to Bunkie General Hospital, where he was then transported by helicopter to Shreveport. When asked to describe the victim when she saw him at the hospital, the victim's wife stated, \"He was real bad off, he was bleeding from the eye and his hand and then he was ... his eye was all bruised and it was horrible.\" The victim stayed at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport for about seven days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As a result of Defendant's attack, the victim lost his right eye and some teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The victim continues to suffer from blurred vision in his left eye, memory loss, and headaches. As a result of injuries to his left hand, the victim underwent two surgeries and still suffers from pain in his hand. The doctor in Shreveport initially tried to save the victim's right eye but a few days later decided it was best to remove it. The victim did not have facial reconstruction surgery since it would have interfered with other problems. After counsel noted the victim was currently walking with a cane, counsel asked if the victim walked with a cane on the day of the incident. The victim responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q. Is your reason for walking with a cane a direct result of the beating?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A. No [sic] a direct result with the beating because I had tremendous back surgery which you cannot return for sure sure [sic] if that indicated some of the cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In his defense, Defendant presented the testimony of one officer regarding a voluntary statement he received from an eye-witness. The witness stated that he saw \"a white male elderly man push Gerrell, Gerrell then punched him in the face, the police were then called.\" Additionally, the victim's wife testified that when she told her husband (the victim) about her run-in with Defendant, her husband said that it did not sound like Defendant. Defendant testified that on the day in question, he was having an issue with the victim's wife trying to supervise him. When Defendant discussed the issue with his real supervisor, the victim's wife got upset and left. Shortly thereafter, Defendant testified, the victim drove up, slammed his car door, walked up to Defendant, and pushed Defendant in the chest. The victim threatened to \"plant\" Defendant \"in the ground\" if he ever called his wife a \"b-i-t-c-h\" again. Defendant testified that the victim followed him and tried to grab his shirt. Defendant further testified that he automatically \"went on defense\" and hit the victim. Defendant denied jumping or \"stumping\" the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant testified that he was approved for the work release program because of his \"outstanding disciplinary jacket.\" According to Defendant, he had \"no violence in [his] jacket\" in almost twenty years of incarceration. On cross-examination, Defendant testified that he participated in the sport of boxing while in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After hearing the evidence presented, the trial court found Defendant guilty of both offenses, ruling as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   BY THE COURT:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I thank you for your presentations of evidence here today. And really in two separate charges and I will address them separately.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Second Degree Battery is defined by Louisiana Revised Statute 14:34.1, second degree battery is a battery when the offender intentionally inflicts serious bodily injury. The evidence presented here today it is abundantly clear that the State met it's [sic] burden of proof the defendant is guilty as charged of second degree battery. The victim Mr. Ruddi Rico sustained very severe injuries to his left eye and lost the left eye, has a prosthetic eye today, severe damage to his right vision. He has damage to his face, damage to his nose and lots of bleeding, lots of pain, loss of teeth and has memory problems all as a result of the and as a consequence of the beating that was inflicted upon him by Gerrell Washington on May 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   This court has not considered if a defense to the charge that anybody exercised any authority over anybody, the series of events are most regrettable that occurred that day. Regrettable as\n   they may be the consequence and the results that occurred are clear violations of the criminal statute for which there has been no defense shown in this courtroom here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Accordingly I find the defendant guilty as charged of Second Degree Battery based upon the events and testimony of the victim, Ms. Sherry Guillory and Officer Lee who all testified about the events that occurred that day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   As far as the next charge Cruelty to Persons with Infirmities, that statute and I'm just going to read the words that apply to today's case and it says '[c]ruelty to persons with infirmities under 93.3 of the criminal code is the intentional mistreatment by any person whereby unjustifiable pain is caused to a person who is aged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Aged is defined in Section C as a person or individual 60 years of age or older. It is without doubt that the victim of this crime was 68 years old on May 1\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   , 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The State has proven each and every element of this offense beyond a reasonable doubt as to each element charged in this crime, in both crimes, accordingly I find the defendant guilty as charged to both crimes by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, there is one error patent involving the sentence imposed and one error patent as to the minutes of sentencing. The error patent involving the minutes of sentencing is assigned as error and will be addressed in Assignment of Error Number Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At sentencing, the trial court stated the following regarding diminution of sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The sentences imposed herein are not enhanced sentences as defined in our law. As required by Article 890.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, I hereby inform you that the crime of second degree battery to which you have been convicted is a crime of violence as defined by our law and the sentence is not subject to diminution for good behavior. Additionally, the crime of cruelty to persons with infirmities is not listed as a crime of violence in our law and the sentence on this charge is subject to diminution for good behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court's statement appears to be a denial of diminution of sentence for the conviction of second degree battery. \"[A] trial court lacks the authority to grant or deny good time. Except where otherwise provided by law, the provisions of LSA-R.S. 15:571.3(C) are directed to the Department of Corrections exclusively, and 'the sentencing judge has no ... role in the matter of good time credit.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The penalty provision for second degree battery provides, in pertinent part: \"Whoever commits the crime of second degree battery shall be fined not more than two thousand dollars or imprisoned, with or without hard labor, for not more than eight years, or both.\" La.R.S. 14:34.1(C). Although the trial court did not impose a fine, it imposed the maximum term of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the same sentencing proceeding, the trial court sentenced Defendant for cruelty to persons with infirmities to ten years in the Department of Corrections, with all ten years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. As with the second degree battery sentence, the trial court did not impose a fine. However, the trial court imposed the maximum term of imprisonment for cruelty to a person with an infirmity, as well as the maximum amount of time to be served without benefits. As previously stated, the trial court ordered the sentences to run concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The analysis for an excessive-sentence claim is well-settled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Sentences within the statutory sentencing range can be reviewed for constitutional excessiveness.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court recognizes that under the factual situation presented at bar that the defendant may have felt personal anger from the circumstances arising in his work release environment. However, those personal feelings do not justify by any means whatsoever the cruel and severe beating inflicted upon the physical-ill [sic], sixty-eight-year-old victim. As required by the cruelty to the infirmed statute ( La.R.S. 14:93.3 ), the evidence presented at trial supports a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the victim, Ruddie Rico, was a person with infirmities and of advanced age, who was subject [sic] to intentional mistreatment by Gerrell Washington that resulted in unjustifiable pain and suffering to Mr. Rico.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   ... Without any question and beyond any reasonable doubt, the trial evidence supports a finding that the acts of cruelty inflicted upon the victim, Ruddie Rico, were both intentionally and maliciously committed by Gerrell Washington. Accordingly, the defendant is ordered to serve ten (10) years in the custody of the Department of Corrections with the State of Louisiana with all ten (10) years of the sentence imposed being without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence; the defendant is further awarded credit for time served since arrest for this offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Second degree battery is defined as follows, to-wit:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \" La.R.S. 14:34.1 : Second degree battery\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A.

The evidence presented at trial supports a verdict of guilty to the charge of second degree battery as the battery committed by the defendant, Gerrell Washington, upon the victim was intentional and the victim suffered serious bodily injury.

Additionally, Defendant claims he had a non-violent prison record for almost twenty years prior to the offense at issue.

As discussed below, the imposition of consecutive sentences was within the trial court's discretion in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   As stated by the trial court, the offense committed in the present case involved significant, permanent injuries to the victim. While Defendant argues that he hit the victim only once, the police investigation shows that the victim suffered a violent and sustained beating. The exhibits introduced at trial, including original photos of the injuries sustained by the victim, are not part of the appeal record. However, copies of those photos are attached to the probable cause affidavit. The photos show significant injuries sustained by the victim to his eye and hand. The record of the 911 emergency call from the incident, referencing injuries to the victim's eye and finger, is also attached to the probable cause affidavit. In the PSI, the victim stated Defendant caused him to lose his eye and caused his hand to be paralyzed. The victim also stated that his hand is wired together, he has had back surgery, he has had memory and hearing loss, and he is responsible for reimbursing Medicare for his medical bills, which are estimated to be around two million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Additionally, according to the PSI, Defendant is classified as a fourth-felony offender, with a lengthy criminal history:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \u2022 4/19/1993 - Pled guilty to damage to property over $ 500.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \u2022 7/14/1994 - Pled guilty to shoplifting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \u2022 1/27/1994 - Arrested and later pled guilty to possession of stolen property over $ 1000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   \u2022 1/27/1994 - Arrested and later pled guilty to reckless operation of a vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \u2022 2/3/1994 - Arrested and later pled guilty to simple criminal damage to property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \u2022 5/1/1995 - Pled guilty to aggravated battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \u2022 5/1/1995 - Pled guilty to possession with the intent to distribute cocaine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 9/26/1995 - Arrested and later pled guilty to simple criminal damage to property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   \u2022 6/12/1997 - Arrested and later pled guilty to enter/remain in places/on land after being forbidden.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   \u2022 6/15/1997 - Arrested and later pled guilty to misrepresentation during booking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   \u2022 4/1/1999 - Pled guilty to armed robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \u2022 4/1/1999 - Pled guilty to manufacture/distribution of CDS II\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   \u2022 7/19/2018 - Convicted of second degree battery (instant offense).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \u2022 7/19/2018 - Convicted of cruelty to persons with infirmities (instant offense).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \u2022 3/7/2018 - Pled guilty to public intimidation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \u2022 6/6/2018 - Arrested for battery of a correctional facility employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Of particular note is Defendant's history of violent offenses, including a previous conviction for aggravated battery in 1995 and a conviction for armed robbery in 1999. In June 2018, Defendant committed a battery on a correctional facility employee, which was still pending at the time of sentencing. Thus, Defendant's propensity for violence continued even after the current offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   When the offense at issue occurred, Defendant was on a work release program, a time during which he should have been on his best behavior. Even considering Defendant's claim that he was provoked and in fear of a sixty-eight-year-old man, the extreme beating that Defendant inflicted upon the victim while on a work release assignment shows Defendant is a danger to society. Considering this fact along with Defendant's past criminal history, the trial court could have ordered the second degree battery sentence to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for cruelty to a person with an infirmity. Nonetheless, the trial court ordered Defendant's sentence for second degree battery to run concurrently with the sentence for cruelty to a person with an infirmity. Consequently, even though Defendant's sentences are the maximum for each crime, Defendant will actually be serving only one maximum sentence when he could be serving two. Additionally, the trial court did not impose any fine even though it was permitted to do so by the penalty provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.R.S. 14:34.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Considering the extreme injuries suffered by the victim in the present case, Defendant's criminal history, Defendant's continued propensity for violence, and the trial court's order that the present sentence be served concurrently with the offense of cruelty to a person with an infirmity, we find that the sentence imposed for second degree battery is not excessive. Additionally, the supreme court has repeatedly stated \"that sentence review under the Louisiana constitution does not provide an appellate court with a vehicle for substituting its judgment for that of a trial judge as to what punishment is more appropriate in a given case.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
