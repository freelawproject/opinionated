Ellender, appeals his conviction by a six-person jury for his fifth offense of driving while intoxicated. He was sentenced to fifty years at hard labor under the habitual offender statute. His appeal focuses on insufficiency of the evidence, excessive sentence, and an improper jury composition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We affirm his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We must decide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) whether there was sufficient evidence to convict Defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) whether the trial court deprived Defendant of a twelve-person jury and unconstitutionally convicted him by a six-person jury; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3) whether Defendant's sentence is unconstitutionally excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant, Ramon L. Ellender, was charged by Bill of Information with \"Driving While Intoxicated, Fifth Offense,\" in violation of La.R.S. 14:98 and 14:98.4. A six-person jury unanimously found Defendant guilty as charged. The State filed a bill charging Defendant as a habitual offender under La.R.S. 15:529.1. Prior to jury selection, the State and Defendant stipulated to Defendant's four prior DWI convictions, which were not subject to the ten-year cleansing period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant filed a \"Motion for Arrest of Judgment,\" alleging that his conviction should be reversed and that he should receive a new, twelve-person jury trial because La.R.S. 14:98.4(C) requires individuals who receive probation, parole, or suspension of sentence on a prior DWI, fourth offense, to serve a hard labor sentence of not less than ten nor more than thirty years. The trial court found that Defendant was properly tried by a six-person jury. In its written reasons, the trial court\n   noted that the State and defense counsel had discussed the makeup of the jury prior to selection, that La.R.S. 14:98.4(C) was never discussed, and that everyone agreed that the proper jury size was a six-person jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , 11-1044 (La. 3/13/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7008489\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/85/52/\">\n    85 So.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ruled that Defendant had not waived his right to object to an improper jury composition because La.Code Crim.P. art. 859 lists errors in jury composition as a ground for arrest of judgment, an exception to the contemporaneous objection rule. The trial court further cited the supreme court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    State v. Dahlem\n   </em>\n   , 14-1555 (La. 3/15/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785790\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/676/\">\n    197 So.3d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that a similarly-situated defendant was not entitled to a twelve-person jury because the bill of information did not specifically charge him with the sentencing provision that required a hard labor sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant then filed a \"Motion for New Trial,\" as did his defense counsel. Following a hearing, the trial court denied both of the motions. After a hearing and multiple memoranda submitted by defense counsel and the State, the trial court issued a written ruling and adjudicated Defendant \"a fifth felony offender subject to sentencing under La.R.S. 15:529.1.\" Subsequently, Defendant was sentenced to fifty years at hard labor, the first two years to be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence; the remainder to be served without probation or suspension of sentence; and the sentence to run consecutively with any other sentence that Defendant may have. Defendant was also fined $ 5,000 as required by La.R.S. 14:98.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Sentence,\" alleging that his sentence was \"excessive and based, at least partially, on evidence[ ] in dispute.\" The trial court denied the motion. The State also filed a \"Motion to Reconsider Sentence,\" arguing that Defendant should have been sentenced under the habitual offender law as it stood when the offense was committed in 2015, not under the 2017 amendments to the law. Following a hearing, the trial court noted that Defendant's sentence, which remained unchanged, was imposed in accordance with the language of La.R.S. 15:529.1 as it stood at the time of the offense. The trial court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   So what that does for Mr. Ellender's case is it changes the sentencing range in his case from 20 to 60 years under the habitual offender law that took effect by the 2017 amendments to go back to the law in effect as of October of 2015, which makes the habitual offender sentencing range 20 to life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The other thing it does, as long as the bill of information was filed prior to November 1, 2017, is it changes the cleansing period back to the ten-year prior cleansing period as opposed to the five-year cleansing period which took effect as of the 2017 amendment. And in this case the habitual offender bill of information was filed prior to that date; and, therefore, the ten-year cleansing period applies to Mr. Ellender's case. And most, if not all, of the legal arguments raised by the defense as to some of the prior convictions being within ten years but not within five years of one another is now a moot issue in the Court's opinion legally; because the cleansing period is back to one of ten years as it applies to Mr. Ellender's case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evidence and Testimony\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State's first witness was Ms. Mary Benson. Ms. Benson testified that on October\n   9, 2015, she was standing on the sidewalk on West North Street, when she saw a red truck speed past her followed by a \"little grey car.\" She said she believed the grey car rear-ended the red truck before the car turned around and sped past her going in the opposite direction. She said she saw the grey car hit multiple signs near or on the road both times it passed, noting parts of the car came off when the vehicle hit the signs. Ms. Benson testified that there were signs on both sides of the street, noting \"[w]hen he went up the street he knocked that sign down; and when he c[a]me back down the other side, on [the] other side where the school bus c[a]me down, the school bus sign, they tore that sign down; and that church sign, they tore it down.\" Ms. Benson clarified that \"the car did all the damage.\" She identified Defendant as the person driving the grey BMW shortly after the incident, and she identified him in open court as the driver of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mary Benson's 911 Call\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ms. Benson called 911 at 6:40 p.m. and told the operator that a white guy was driving a little BMW going around one hundred miles per hour. She stated that the BMW hit the back of a red Ford truck, turned around at the bank, then came back and almost tore up a woman's car. She stated that the bottom of the car should be torn up, and there was debris all over the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Benson testified that she was about twenty to twenty-five feet away from the vehicle at the time of the incident, and she had no doubt that the Defendant was driving the BMW, \"[f]ast, flying like a bat out of hell.\" Ms. Benson also identified Defendant in a six-man photo lineup roughly a year after the incident. On cross-examination, Ms. Benson testified that she knew \"exactly what both [drivers] look[ed] like.\" Defense counsel then introduced video from Corporal Edward Kuzmik's body camera when the officer first spoke with Ms. Benson following her 911 call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Body Camera Footage of Corporal Kuzmik\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After discussing the sequence of events with Ms. Benson and the silver car parts stuck in the broken sign, Corporal Kuzmik entered his vehicle and proceeded to Defendant's residence where he was met by Sergeant Davidson, who told him they were taking Defendant to Ms. Benson for a possible identification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Sergeant John Davidson, a patrol shift supervisor for the DeRidder Police Department with twelve years of law enforcement experience, testified that he was dispatched to West North Street for a hit-and-run involving a silver BMW. He stated that he subsequently remembered a silver BMW parked on John Henry Jones Street, about two blocks from the scene of the incident. He testified that he and two other officers, Corporals David Stanard and Gene Clark, proceeded to where he knew the silver BMW was parked, which was Defendant's home. Reserve Officer Mike Perkins also responded to Defendant's residence shortly thereafter. They arrived at Defendant's residence on John Henry Jones Street less than fifteen minutes after responding to the location of the incident on West North Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Upon arriving at Defendant's residence, they found a silver BMW with damage matching the description of the hit-and-run. Sergeant Davidson took photographs of the damage to the car which were later introduced into evidence. Sergeant Davidson testified that Defendant was the only person to make himself known at the residence on John Henry Jones. He noted that the engine of the BMW was still giving off heat while he was taking photos of it, indicating that it had been recently driven. Sergeant Davidson noted that the car had\n   damage to the trim and front fender as well as a flat tire. He also noted that the car was still in drive, the windows were down, and the key was still in the ignition in the \"on\" position, indicating someone had turned it off just enough to kill the engine without totally disengaging. This was corroborated by Corporal Clark. Sergeant Davidson testified he left to assist another officer on a separate call but subsequently observed part of Corporal Kuzmik's interview with Defendant. He also stated that he was familiar with Defendant from having worked a prior call involving him, and that Defendant had previously worked around the police department as a trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sergeant Davidson further testified that he believed Defendant was intoxicated, because he knew what Defendant was like when he was sober, and he was not acting sober. He testified that Defendant had an unsteady gait and that his speech appeared \"a little off\" during his interview. Corporal Clark testified that Defendant was unsteady on his feet and \"had bloodshot, watery eyes ... slurred speech and a strong odor of alcoholic beverages.\" Officer Perkins testified that Defendant seemed off-balanced, had slurred speech, and smelled of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Upon arrival at Defendant's residence, Corporal Stanard approached the trailer home and noted that the front door was wide open and that Defendant \"was completely naked, laying face-down on a couch in the living room with his clothes to his feet.\" Corporal Stanard stated that Defendant was detained, handcuffed, and read his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights at that point. Corporal Stanard testified that Defendant's walk was unsteady and they were holding him up to keep him from falling and injuring himself. He also noted that he could smell alcohol coming from Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Reserve Officer Michael Perkins responded to the location of the incident and then proceeded to John Henry Jones Street to back up Corporals Stanard and Clark while Corporal Kuzmik spoke to the witness at the scene. Officer Perkins testified that he placed Defendant in the back of his police unit and escorted him to 208 West North Street, where Ms. Benson identified him as the driver of the grey BMW that she saw hit the sign. At that time, Corporal Kuzmik informed Defendant of his charges, and Officer Perkins transported him back to the police department. After transporting Defendant to the police department, Officer Perkins sat in on Corporal Kuzmik's interview with him. Officer Perkins noted that the interview was recorded by Corporal Kuzmik's body camera. He testified that Defendant never asked for an attorney or attempted to stop the interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Corporal Edward Kuzmik of the DeRidder Police Department's detective division testified that he was dispatched to the scene at 6:49 p.m., in response to a hit-and-run and reckless-driver call. Upon his arrival, he removed car parts and debris from the road near the intersection of Carlisle Street and North Street. He said the sign at the intersection was completely knocked down, and a sign for the Sweet Home Baptist Church, approximately five feet from the stop sign, was destroyed. After speaking to Ms. Benson, Corporal Kuzmik proceeded to Defendant's residence. Once there, he was directed by Sergeant Davidson to return to North Street to see if Ms. Benson identified Defendant as the driver of the BMW she witnessed hit the signs. After Ms. Benson identified Defendant as the driver of the BMW, Corporal Kuzmik took photos of the damage and debris on North Street before heading to the police department to interview Defendant. Noting that the camera normally used to video interviews was\n   not working, Corporal Kuzmik testified that he recorded Defendant's interview with his body camera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant's Statement to Corporal Kuzmik\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant's statement, recorded on Corporal Kuzmik's body camera, was played for the jury and lasted roughly twelve minutes. Defendant initially told Corporal Kuzmik he was thirty-six years old and that his date of birth was September 19, 1949. When asked if he meant 1979, Defendant agreed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant put his head down while Corporal Kuzmik read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and appeared to be asleep until Corporal Kuzmik touched his shoulder. Corporal Kuzmik asked Defendant about a scratch on his chin, which Defendant stated was from a razor. He claimed to have shaved around two or three in the afternoon. When asked how much he had had to drink, Defendant stated he had two bottles of whiskey. He told Corporal Kuzmik he started drinking around 3:00 p.m. and finished around 3:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant stated he owned a truck and not a car multiple times while Corporal Kuzmik tried to ask if he was driving the grey BMW, then stated, \"God Damn, I'm asking you a question. I have a truck.\" He then stated the BMW was his wife's car and that she was driving it. Defendant was then unable to tell Corporal Kuzmik where his wife was or why a witness identified him as driving the BMW. He stated, \"The fair answer is: I was in bed sleeping.\" He then stated that he went to bed at 8:30, seemingly confused by the officers asking him if he went to sleep at 8:30 a.m. or p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   When Corporal Kuzmik asked if Defendant was driving the grey BMW that was sitting in his driveway, Defendant appeared unable to comprehend or answer the question. Defendant acknowledged he was pretty intoxicated. Defendant then stated he was already on parole for a fourth offense DWI and should not be drinking. He then reiterated that he was at home sleeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Corporal Kuzmik identified a trio of forms used to substantiate Ms. Benson's subsequent identification of Defendant from a six-person photographic lineup on December 1, 2016. Following Defendant's statement, Corporal Kuzmik arrested him for reckless operation, hit and run, and driving under suspension and had him booked into the parish jail. Corporal Kuzmik testified the failure to initially charge Defendant with a DWI was an oversight on his part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Corporal Kuzmik noted that Defendant had a flushed face, glassy eyes, and a \"moderately strong odor of alcohol\" when he first encountered him. He also noted that during the interview, he had to wake Defendant up; that Defendant's speech was slurred and that both his nose and ears were flushed. Corporal Kuzmik acknowledged telling Defendant he \"was drunker than Cooter Brown.\" He also noted that Defendant believed he had gone to sleep at 8:30 p.m. awoke at 11:45 p.m.; however, the interview was taking place at 7:25 p.m. As with all of the other officers, Corporal Kuzmik confirmed that at no point did Defendant ever mention any physical injuries, medical issues, or other ailments which may have affected his speech, coordination, or ability to function. At that point, the State rested its case and defense counsel chose not to present a case in chief. The jury subsequently returned a unanimous verdict of guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Insufficiency of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to prove his identity as\n   the driver of the vehicle involved in the hit and run. Furthermore, he contends this is a circumstantial evidence case in which the State failed \"to disprove the reasonable hypothesis that the [D]efendant got intoxicated at his house, where the police found him.\" Defendant's characterization of his case as a purely circumstantial evidence case is incorrect and Defendant himself told law enforcement that he drank two bottles of whiskey between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m., three hours before the hit and run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The analysis for a sufficiency claim is well settled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is raised on appeal, the critical inquiry of the reviewing court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

As this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Iles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7419780\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/684/38/#p42\">\n    684 So.2d at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the observations of an arresting officer may be sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt. Intoxication is an observable condition about which a witness may testify.\" Every law enforcement officer who came into contact with Defendant on October 9, 2015, testified that he exhibited characteristics of being intoxicated when they came into contact with him around 7:00 p.m. He was described as having slurred speech and difficulty walking, and smelling of alcohol. Furthermore, Corporal Kuzmik noted that Defendant had glassy eyes and that both his nose and his ears were flushed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In his statement, which was played for the jury's benefit, Defendant acknowledged that he was intoxicated and stated that he drank two bottles of whiskey about three hours before he went to sleep. Furthermore, Defendant could not accurately state his own age or date of birth and appeared to have trouble forming coherent statements. Observations of the law enforcement officers and the jury's own observations of Defendant's intoxication were more than sufficient to find that he was intoxicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Defendant contends that the State failed to disprove the hypothesis that Defendant got intoxicated at his home between the time of the hit and run and the time that law enforcement found him asleep, naked, on his couch less than thirty minutes later. This hypothesis was presented to the jury at trial and rejected. Furthermore, Defendant's own statement to police indicated that he became intoxicated hours before the accident. Defendant's timeline is questionable, given his claim during the interview at 7:25 p.m. that he had gone to sleep at 8:30 p.m., an impossibility since that time had not yet occurred; but significantly, it evidences a state of confusion consistent with intoxication. Thus, in \"viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

We disagree. The Bill of Information in this case, states that Ramon L. Ellender, on or about October 9, 2015: \"Did willfully and unlawfully violate R.S. 14:98 and R.S. 14:98.4, Driving While Intoxicated, Fifth Offense, by the intentional operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic[ ] beverage[ ] (a felony).\" The Bill of Information then outlines four other DWI convictions: 1992 in Sulphur, 1996 in Lake Charles, 2002 in DeRidder, and 2012 in DeRidder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the time of Defendant's 2015 offense, La.R.S. 14:98 provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   A.

Two years of the sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.

Defendant contends, however, that because he was on parole for a prior DWI fourth offense when he was arrested for his current conviction, La.R.S. 14:98.4(C) requires him to serve his time at hard labor, which requires a twelve-person jury. Pursuant to La.R.S. 14:98.4(C) (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   If the offender has previously received the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on a conviction of a fourth or subsequent offense violation of R.S. 14:98, then on a subsequent conviction of a fourth or subsequent offense, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and regardless of whether the offense occurred before or after an earlier conviction, the offender shall be fined five thousand dollars and imprisoned\n   <em>\n    at hard labor\n   </em>\n   for not less than ten nor more than thirty years. No part of the sentence shall be imposed with benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and no portion of the sentence shall be imposed concurrently with the remaining balance of any sentence to be served for a prior conviction for any offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Neither the Bill of Information nor any discussion by the parties or the trial court suggested the invocation of La.R.S. 14:98.4(C). In fact, all agreed and worked together to select the six-person jury required under the indicting language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Notwithstanding, Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

A panel of this court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Because Defendant, charged with fourth offense DWI, was previously required to participate in substance abuse treatment and was placed on home incarceration the law mandates he be tried before a jury of twelve persons.

However, the supreme court has since created an exception to the rule that this court applied in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ; namely, where as here, a defendant is ultimately sentenced as a habitual offender, the empaneling of a six-person jury\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   trial does not lead to a reversal if the Bill of Information on its face indicates only a relative felony.

Based solely upon the information on the face of the bill of information, the defendant in this case was properly tried before a six person jury, as the sentencing range for a fourth offense DWI, as listed in this particular bill of information, is not mandatory hard labor. Specifically, La. R.S. 14:98(E)(1)(a), in effect at the time of defendant's offense, provided that operating a vehicle while intoxicated, fourth offense, carried the following penalty range\n   <strong>\n    with or without\n   </strong>\n   hard labor:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   ... on a conviction of a fourth or subsequent offense, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and regardless of whether the fourth offense occurred before or after an earlier conviction, the offender\n   <strong>\n    shall be imprisoned with or without hard labor\n   </strong>\n   for not less than ten years nor more than thirty years and shall be fined five thousand dollars. Two years of the sentence of imprisonment shall be imposed without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Given that the enhanced sentence to which the evidence made defendant subject was not apparent on the face of the bill of information, we specifically decline to create a duty requiring a trial judge to look beyond the face of the bill of information or the indictment, and the Title 14 penalty range. Nor is it the responsibility of a trial judge to interrogate the district attorney or independently investigate as to what evidence might be introduced that would require a different jury composition at the outset of a case. Doing so would be inappropriate and contrary to the efficient administration of criminal justice, and effectively result in bad policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785790\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/676/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785790\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/676/\">\n    at 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Dahlem\n   </em>\n   , the supreme court stated in a footnote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   We agree with Judge Kuhn's concurrence in the court of appeal's opinion, which states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   ....[T]rial of the defendant by a six-person jury was dictated by law in this case. The district attorney, in the exercise of his discretion, elected to charge the defendant pursuant to\n   La. R.S. 14:98 with a fourth-offense DWI. Under La. R.S. 14:98(E)(1)(a), the punishment for fourth-offense DWI is imprisonment with or without hard labor for not less than ten years and not more than thirty years and a $ 5,000.00 fine. In accordance with La. Const. art.

Although, the State later presented evidence at trial in connection with predicate # 3 which, if accepted, allowed for a sentence at hard labor under La. R.S. 14:98(E)(4)(a), sentencing of the defendant under this sentencing enhancement provision was only a possibility, but never a certainty. Thus, as a practical matter, this case was required to be tried in a six-person jury forum since there was only a possibility that the defendant could receive a sentence at hard labor. In Louisiana, a twelve-person jury is required only when the potential sentence is necessarily confinement at hard labor. La. Const. art. I, sec. 17 (A); La.C.Cr.P. art. 782(A). Thus, the defendant's trial was conducted in accordance with the jury composition rules applicable to La.

Given the general nature of Defendant's motion to reconsider, we will review Defendant's claim as a mere excessiveness of sentence claim in light of the\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nature of the Offense\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   At the time of the offense, La.R.S. 14:98(A)(1)(a) relevantly defined Defendant's offense as \"operating any motor vehicle ... when ... [t]he operator is under the influence of alcoholic beverages.\" As previously noted, a defendant convicted of fourth or subsequent offense DWI faced imprisonment, \"with or without hard labor, for not less than ten years nor more than thirty years.\" The first two years were to be imposed without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. However, because of Defendant's prior DWI history, he ultimately fell into a category of offenders who were required to serve their sentence at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The circumstances of Defendant's crime indicate a danger to the community, as he was seen hitting another vehicle while driving, and then destroying two signs on opposite sides of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Nature and Background of Defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant was forty-six years old at the time of the instant offense, and he had been in trouble with the law for virtually the entirety of his adult life, nearly thirty years. As noted by the trial court at sentencing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court finds that the defendant has a substantial criminal history. In fact, Mr. Ellender has spent virtually all of his adult life either incarcerated or on supervised probation or parole. In addition to Louisiana, he has also been arrested and/or convicted in several other states, including Texas, Mississippi, California, and Wyoming.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   By this Court's count, the defendant has been arrested for driving under the influence 12 times and convicted in at least nine of those instances. The defendant has also been arrested and/or convicted of multiple drug and other offenses, including 13 felonies and 17 misdemeanors. The Court finds that subjecting the defendant to supervision has thus far proven totally ineffective, because most of the defendant's offenses were committed while he was under probation or parole supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   It is, therefore, the opinion of this Court that the defendant's pattern of repeated offenses indicates a high likelihood he will reoffend if released from incarceration, placing himself and others in the community at substantial risk of bodily harm. Because of this likelihood and in consideration of Mr. Ellender's considerable criminal history spanning his entire adult life, it is the opinion of the Court that the Defendant is in need of a lengthy custodial environment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sentences Imposed for Similar Crimes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As noted above, the penalty range for DWI fourth offense at the time of Defendant's offense was not less than ten years nor more than thirty years. However, Defendant was adjudicated a fifth felony offender under La.R.S. 15:529.1(A)(4)(a), which held \"[t]he person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for the fourth or subsequent felony for a determinate term not less than the longest prescribed for a\n   first conviction but in no event less than twenty years and not more than his natural life.\" Furthermore, La.R.S. 15:529.1(G) specifically stated \"[a]ny sentence imposed under the provisions of this Section shall be at hard labor without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Under La.R.S. 15:529.1(A)(4)(a) as it stood at the time of Defendant's offense, Defendant faced a sentencing range of thirty years to life. Accordingly, Defendant's fifty-year sentence represents the relative low-end of his potential sentencing range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we did not find any prior cases wherein a fifty-year sentence was upheld on a DWI conviction, this court has previously upheld sentences of greater than twenty years without a habitual offender enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant's lengthy criminal history and long-term refusal to address his addiction issues were addressed by the trial court, which found Defendant unlikely to respond to anything short of incarceration.
