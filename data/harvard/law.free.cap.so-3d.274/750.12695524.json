Zavatsky. For the following reasons, we reverse the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts of the case, as alleged in Mr. Lindquist's request for a medical review panel filed on September 14, 2017, with the Division of Administration are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 22, 2013, Mr. Lindquist underwent spinal surgery performed by Dr.\n   Zavatsky, an employee of Ochsner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Lindquist was sent home that same day for recovery. The next day he went to the emergency room at Ochsner after experiencing an inability to stand as well as pain and weakness in his legs. Diagnostic studies (x-rays) from August 24, 2013, showed a metal artifact in the operative site in Mr. Lindquist's back. Mr. Lindquist was not informed of the presence of the artifact at that time by anyone at Ochsner or Dr. Zavatsky. Mr. Lindquist was discharged from the hospital, and sent home. The next day, August 25, 2013, he was readmitted to the hospital after continuing to experience pain and weakness. An MRI was performed which also evidenced the metal artifact in his spine at the site of the surgery, but Mr. Lindquist was again not informed of it by anyone. He was discharged on August 26, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Lindquist met with Dr. Zavatsky on November 15, 2013, and again on February 17, 2014, at which times he reported continuing symptoms of pain and weakness. He was not informed during either of these visits of the metal artifact, though the presence of the metal artifact is mentioned by Dr. Zavatsky in his November 15, 2013 progress notes following results of an x-ray he had ordered of Mr. Lindquist. Mr. Lindquist continued in Dr. Zavatsky's care through February 14, 2014, for pain and disability. At some point unknown to Mr. Lindquist, Dr. Zavatsky left Ochsner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the following years, Mr. Lindquist continued to experience pain and disability in his spine. On May 25, 2017, an MRI was taken at Ochsner and the metal artifact was again shown in Mr. Lindquist's back at the operative site. At this time, Mr. Lindquist was first told about the metal artifact by a doctor at Ochsner. Mr. Lindquist filed his claim for medical malpractice against Ochsner and Dr. Zavatsky with the Division of Administration a few months later on September 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 22, 2018, Ochsner and Dr. Zavatsky filed a peremptory exception of peremption pursuant to La. R.S. 9:5628 and La. R.S. 40:1231.8. At the hearing on the exception, the parties and the court agreed to construe the exception as a peremptory exception of prescription. In their memorandum in support of the exception and at the hearing on the exception, defendants argued that Mr. Lindquist's claims filed four years after his surgery fell outside the three year prescriptive period set forth for medical malpractice actions in La. R.S. 9:5628 and were therefore prescribed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition, Mr. Lindquist argued that defendants' conduct in failing to inform him of the metal artifact in his back constitutes fraudulent concealment and therefore, under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   , prescription on his claim did not begin to run until he was informed of its presence on May 25, 2017. In response, defendants argued that, even if the court were to consider application of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Lindquist was not prevented from bringing his malpractice suit within three years of the surgery because the x-rays and diagnostic images showing the metal object in his back were in his medical records which were always available to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court rendered judgment sustaining defendants' exception of prescription and dismissed Mr. Lindquist's case\n   with prejudice. A subsequent motion for new trial filed by Mr. Lindquist was denied. Mr. Lindquist appeals the judgment sustaining defendants' exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case presents a\n   <em>\n    res nova\n   </em>\n   issue for this Court: whether a health care provider, who has seen x-rays and MRIs showing a metal object that he left in a patient's back during surgery, and who fails to disclose such to the patient, has engaged in conduct that rises to the level of concealment, misrepresentation, fraud, or ill practices sufficient to trigger the application of the third category of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   to interrupt the prescriptive period set forth in La. R.S. 9:5628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In our discussion below, we will address first the applicable standard of review before examining the applicability of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   in medical malpractice actions, including whether the conduct alleged here,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , fraud by silence, may suspend prescription under La. R.S. 9:5628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ordinarily, the exceptor bears the burden of proof at trial of the peremptory exception, including prescription.\n   <em>\n    Woods v. Cousins\n   </em>\n   , 12-100 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/16/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7016253\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/102/977/#p979\">\n    102 So.3d 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979,\n   <em>\n    writ denied,\n   </em>\n   12-2452 (La. 1/11/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7006344,7006284,7006260\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/107/617/\">\n    107 So.3d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, if prescription is evident on the face of the pleadings, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that the action has not prescribed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7006344,7006284,7006260\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/107/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At a hearing on a peremptory exception pleaded prior to trial, evidence may be introduced to support or controvert the exception. La. C.C.P. art. 931. In the absence of evidence, a peremptory exception must be decided upon the facts alleged in the petition with all of the allegations accepted as true.\n   <em>\n    Lomont v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   , 14-2483 (La. 6/30/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6856952\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/620/#p627\">\n    172 So.3d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 627. Furthermore, when no evidence is introduced at the hearing on the exception, the reviewing court simply determines whether the trial court's finding was legally correct.\n   <em>\n    Felix v. Safeway Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 15-0701 (La. App. 4 Cir. 12/16/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828023\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/627/#p631\">\n    183 So.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631. In a case involving no dispute regarding material facts, but only the determination of a legal issue, a reviewing court must apply the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review, under which the trial court's legal conclusions are not entitled to deference.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6828023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/627/#p631\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The transcripts of this case show that no evidence was introduced by either party at the hearing on the exception prior to the trial court's ruling. Following the trial court's ruling, the court accepted, without defendants' objection, a copy of the request for a medical review panel and an affidavit from Mr. Lindquist supporting his allegations. At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the trial court sustained an objection raised by defendants to the introduction of additional evidence offered by Mr. Lindquist in support of his allegations. This evidence, which included an amended medical review panel request, a second affidavit of Mr. Lindquist, and excerpts from his medical records, was proffered by Mr. Lindquist and placed into the record by the trial court. Because the trial court did not consider any properly admitted evidence prior to its ruling, the manifest-error standard is not applicable, and we review the record\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Prescription Under La.

As an inchoate right, prescription, on the other hand, may be renounced, interrupted, or suspended; and\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   applies an exception to the statutory prescription period where in fact and for good cause a plaintiff is unable to exercise his cause of action when it accrues.

Upon reviewing the record, the Supreme Court found that, because the doctor had disclosed to the patient and her husband that the drill had slipped on the same day as the surgery, the doctor's conduct did not rise to the level of concealment, misrepresentation, fraud, or ill practices, and therefore the Court declined to apply the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   to suspend the running of prescription on the patient's medical malpractice claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   case illustrates that the main focus of inquiry in determining the application of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   under the third category is the conduct of the healthcare provider, though what the patient knows (which is the main focus of the inquiry under the fourth category of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   ) is still relevant to the analysis. Where a plaintiff has actual knowledge of the malpractice, the Court is unlikely to find the physician's conduct rose to the level of fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment such that it would prevent her from timely filing a claim. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit declined to apply\n   <em>\n    contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    non valentem\n   </em>\n   in a medical malpractice case to interrupt the running of prescription because the alleged wrongful conduct, the removal of an I-V needle from the patient's hand, was immediately apparent to the patient. 945 So.2d at 817.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, where the plaintiff has no knowledge of the tortious act and is able to show fraudulent conduct on the part of the tortfeasor, prescription is suspended until the plaintiff is made aware of the truth of the matter.\n   <em>\n    Lennie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12676162\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/251/637/#p643\">\n    251 So.3d at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The trial court in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   did not apply the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the court applied a variation of the third category of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   known as the 'continuous treatment rule' set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Haygood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , a patient filed medical malpractice claims against her dentist for damages stemming from a dental procedure in which half the patient's teeth were extracted and ill-fitting partial dentures were implanted. The patient returned to the dentist several times due to complications from the initial procedure, during which times the doctor made repeated assurances to the patient to \"hang in there\" and attempted to correct his previous work. Following a dispute over payment for the corrective treatments, the dentist refused to see the patient and instructed her to seek treatment with a different health care provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Mrs. Carter filed a medical malpractice claim against the dentist, and, following a bench trial, the trial court found in her favor. On appeal the Third Circuit reversed in part the judgment of the trial court after finding that Mrs. Carter's malpractice claim stemming from the tooth extraction had prescribed because the extraction of a tooth is an act which is immediately apparent and Mrs. Carter had failed to file her claim within one year of the date of the extraction. In its reversal of the appellate court and reinstatement of the trial court's judgment, the Supreme\n   Court found that the dentist's actions and repeated reassurances in effect lulled the patient into inaction and therefore\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   did apply to suspend the running of prescription on the patient's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In reaching its conclusion, the Court's reasoning began with the observation that the third category has been held to encompass situations where an innocent plaintiff has been lulled into a course of inaction in the enforcement of his right by reason of some concealment or fraudulent conduct on the part of the defendant, or because of the defendant's failure to perform some legal duty whereby the plaintiff has been kept in ignorance of his rights.\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , 892 So.2d at 1269,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crump v.

Next, the Court focused on the special relationship between the patient and the health care provider which the Court found to be analogous to the special relationship between an attorney and client. The Court then articulated a 'continuing treatment rule' analogous to the 'continuing representation rule' in legal malpractice cases which would require a plaintiff who is aware of facts indicative of the malpractice to establish the existence of (1) a continuing treatment relationship with the physician, which is more than perfunctory, during which (2) the physician engaged in conduct which served to prevent the patient from availing herself of her cause of action, such as attempting to rectify an alleged act of malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying this new rule to the facts of the case, the Court found that prescription of Mrs. Carter's claims was suspended under the third category of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court in this case applied the continuous treatment rule and found that, because Mr. Lindquist was last treated by Dr. Zavatsky on February 17, 2014, and there was no indication of a further continuing relationship between them, Mr. Lindquist's claim had prescribed. In applying the continuous treatment rule rather than engaging in an analysis of the defendant's conduct to determine whether it rose to a level of concealment, misrepresentation, fraud or ill practices as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   , the trial court legally erred. The application of the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   is a fact driven analysis, and the facts of the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from those of\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , the Court examined the actions and conduct of a dentist dealing with a patient who was aware of what had gone wrong with her initial dental procedure: she had more than half of her teeth extracted and the partials placed did not fit properly. The patient relied on the assertions of the dentist that he would correct the problems, and, because the relationship between patient and doctor is one of trust and confidence, the patient was lulled by these reassurances into not bringing her claim. Both the dentist and the patient were aware of the initial tortious act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In contrast, in this case, Mr. Lindquist alleges both that he was unaware a metal object was left in his back following surgery,\n   and that Dr. Zavatsky and Ochsner were aware of the foreign metal object, as evidenced by the notes in the medical record. A patient in such a situation has a reasonable expectation that his doctor will disclose to him material information of a medical error such as an x-ray showing a metal object at the site of his operation. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Prescription runs against a plaintiff\n   <em>\n    who has knowledge of facts that a condition may be the result of improper treatment\n   </em>\n   only if there is no effort by the physician to mislead or cover up information available to the plaintiff through inquiry or professional medical or legal advice during continuing treatment. (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   892 So.2d at 1273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   According to the allegations in this case, Mr. Lindquist had no knowledge of the facts that the pain and weakness he experienced following surgery may have been caused by improper treatment. The continuous treatment rule as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   is not applicable to the facts alleged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Fraud by Silence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having determined that the continuous treatment rule was erroneously applied by the trial court to this case, we return to the previously articulated standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   to determine whether defendants' alleged conduct in this case rises to the level of concealment, misrepresentation, fraud, or ill practices which prevented Mr. Lindquist from timely filing his medical malpractice claim. In so doing, we consider the arguments put forward by defendants and accepted by the trial court that (1) silence alone, without additional affirmative acts of concealment, does not constitute fraud, and (2) there could be no fraud where the medical records were available to Mr. Lindquist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under La.

At this preliminary stage of the proceedings, we make no findings as to whether defendants breached the duties owed to Mr. Lindquist; however, accepting the allegations as true, we find that defendants' conduct of failing to disclose the results of the x-rays and MRIs indicating a metal foreign object in Mr. Lindquist's back, is a fraudulent act which prevented him from filing his medical malpractice claim. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   , prescription was suspended until such time as Mr. Lindquist learned of the foreign object left in his back during surgery, or May 25, 2017, at which time the one year prescriptive period began to run.

In addressing a similar argument made by defendants in a recent case, this Court held that, for the purposes of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   , the mere availability of information, in and of itself, cannot serve as sufficient constructive knowledge of a plaintiff's cause of action to start the running of prescription.\n   <em>\n    Lennie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12676162\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/251/637/#p643\">\n    251 So.3d at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
