R.S. 14:64.3(A),\" in violation of La. R.S. 14:64 ; second, aggravated second degree battery \"with a dangerous weapon, by intentionally inflicting serious bodily injury,\" in violation of La. R.S. 14:34.7 ; and, third, possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 2, 2017, the defendant entered an unconditional guilty plea to all three counts in exchange for the following concurrent sentences: for armed robbery with a firearm, ten years plus an additional five-year enhancement, all fifteen to be served at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence; for aggravated second degree battery, ten years at hard labor; and, for possession with intent to distribute marijuana, five years at hard labor. The trial judge also ordered the defendant to pay $ 6000.00 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 22, 2018, defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"Uniform Application for Post-Conviction Relief,\" claiming that his guilty pleas were \"not voluntarily, knowingly, nor intelligently entered due in part to grossly ineffective assistance of counsel.\" The district court dismissed the application for post-conviction relief without prejudice, noting that the application was premature pursuant to La. C.Cr.P. art. 924.1 because defendant had not exhausted his right to appeal. On December 2, 2018, the defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"Uniform Application\n   for Post-Conviction Relief\" requesting an out-of-time appeal pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Counterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7604553\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/475/336/#p339\">\n    475 So.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (La. 1985), which the district court granted on January 11, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 11, 2019, the State filed an application for supervisory review with this Court, seeking review of the district court's grant of defendant's motion for out-of-time appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 1, 2019, this Court granted the State's writ application, vacated the trial court's order granting defendant an out-of-time appeal, and denied the defendant's application for post-conviction relief requesting an out-of-time appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Parks\n   </em>\n   , 19-46 (La.

C.Cr.P. art. 916 reads, in pertinent part, that, \"The jurisdiction of the trial court is divested and that of the appellate court attaches upon the entering of the order of appeal.\" We find that, because the order granting defendant's out-of-time appeal was vacated, the jurisdiction of the trial court has not been divested and appellate jurisdiction has, thus, not attached. Accordingly, this appeal is hereby dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPEAL DISMISSED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <em>\n     Anders v.
