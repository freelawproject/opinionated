Guidry, has filed the instant application for supervisory writs from the trial court's January 30, 2019 ruling denying his motion to suppress evidence. For the following reasons, we deny the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant was charged by bill of information that on April 9, 2018, he committed four felony counts in violation of the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substance Law, as follows: possession with intent to distribute Methamphetamine, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, in violation of La.R.S. 40:967 ; possession of Oxycodone, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, in violation of La.R.S. 40:967 ; possession of Hydrocodone, a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, in violation of La.R.S. 40:967, and that he willfully, knowingly, unlawfully and intentionally received or acquired proceeds derived from a violation of the Controlled Dangerous Substance Law, in violation of La.R.S. 40:1041(D). Defendant was also charged with one misdemeanor count of possession of marijuana, a Schedule I controlled dangerous substance, in violation of La.R.S. 40:966. He was arraigned and pled not guilty on May 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 25, 2018, Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence of the drugs seized from his vehicle without a warrant on April 9, 2018, asserting that the search of the vehicle was unconstitutional. The State opposed the motion, specifically alleging that the inventory search, search incident to arrest, and inevitable discovery exceptions, as well as abandonment, were applicable. Following a hearing on January 30, 2019, the trial court denied Defendant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to the State, Defendant was wanted via a fugitive warrant posted on the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) when he was spotted in Vermilion Parish and pursued by law enforcement officers. A high-speed vehicle chase ensued, resulting in the deployment of spike strips. After losing control of his vehicle, Defendant drove into a sugarcane field and then fled on foot. He was apprehended and then placed under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sergeant James Martin, of the Vermilion Parish Sheriff's Department, testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that Defendant lost control of his vehicle after driving nearly half a mile in a sugarcane field while fleeing from officers, who were pursuing him in multiple police units. He stated that the front end of Defendant's vehicle hit a cane row after traveling over a headland in the field and that Defendant then \"got out of the vehicle and took off running.\" When asked if there were any passengers in the vehicle, Sergeant Martin stated, \"No, the vehicle was abandoned.\" During direct examination of Sergeant Martin, the following colloquy occurred as to the events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Q. So at that point, you have this abandoned vehicle. What do you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Well, the vehicle was stuck in the field. There was no way for us to get it out. So a tow truck had to be\n   called. And then including the fact that he led us on a pursuit and he had active felony warrants and then decided to get out the car and run and abandon vehicle, we towed it. We were going to tow it so it was searched. A vehicle inventory was completed and turned in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q. Okay. And among the things that were inventoried, were there any things that led to additional charges being filed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A. The only things that are placed on inventory are things that are being left with the vehicle when the tow company takes them. But while we were searching the car, we did locate methamphetamine, hydrocodone, marijuana and I think that's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sergeant Martin then stated specifically that \"a vehicle inventory was completed and turned in\" before the vehicle was towed. While it was unclear as to when the call for the tow truck was made, there was no choice but to call the tow truck as the vehicle was stuck in the sugarcane field some half mile from the road. The vehicle was searched without a warrant where it came to a stop, and drugs were found inside the vehicle in a duffle bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant seeks review of the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the drug evidence. He asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress when it ruled that the police conducted a valid inventory search of his vehicle. We find no error in the trial court's decision for multiple reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Article 1, Section 5 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974 and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Although a search warrant is required as a general rule in order for a search to be constitutionally permissible, several exceptions to the warrant requirement have developed over time.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The facts established that on May 24, 1987, two officers were responding to a police dispatch when they observed defendant stop his vehicle at the exit of a parking lot and start running away. Believing his actions to be suspicious, one of the officers gave chase on foot, and when he finally caught up with defendant, the defendant hit him. After the defendant was arrested, an investigation determined that the vehicle that he was driving was stolen. The police searched the vehicle, without first obtaining a warrant, and discovered stolen jewelry within. The defendant was charged with battery of a police officer, burglary, and possession of stolen goods.

Lowery testified that he observed Defendant traveling 60 mph in a 55 mph zone. This observation provided him with the necessary reasonable suspicion to believe that a traffic violation had been committed, and he was justified in attempting to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation, even if the purpose of the stop was to investigate for CDS violations. However, rather than cooperating with Trp. Lowery's signals to stop, Defendant refused to stop, leading Trp. Lowery on a chase and ultimately crashing into a tree. This provided Trp. Lowery with probable cause to arrest Defendant for flight from an officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:108.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In the instant case, the stop of Defendant was patently reasonable as he was wanted on a felony warrant. Thereafter, he committed additional crimes by fleeing from the officers in his vehicle and then on foot. Having abandoned his vehicle, he had no expectation of privacy.

Whether the inventory search was conducted in the sugarcane field or at the police station is of no consequence here given the circumstances. The vehicle was, of necessity, going to be searched either prior to or immediately after being towed because the only option was to have it towed since it was stuck and abandoned in a privately owned sugarcane field approximately one-half mile from the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress.
