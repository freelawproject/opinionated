Defendants/appellants, Choice Foundation d/b/a Lafayette Academy Charter School (the \"school\") and Karen Lewis (\"Lewis\"), appeal the October 19, 2017 default judgment in favor of plaintiffs/appellees, Jerry Moore, Jr., individually and on behalf of the minor Jerry Moore, III, and Anitra Moore (collectively, the \"Moores\"), and the April 2, 2018 denial of a motion for new trial. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the default judgment, reverse the denial of the motion for new trial, and remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 2, 2016, the Moores filed a petition for damages, alleging that Jerry Moore, III (\"Little Jerry\") was injured when he fell down the stairs at school on August 19, 2015. According to the petition, Little Jerry is the minor son of Jerry Moore, Jr. and Anitra Moore (\"Mr. and Mrs. Moore\"). Little Jerry is non-verbal, autistic, and requires constant monitoring and assistance while at school. The petition states that Lewis was a paraprofessional employed by the school and assigned to Little Jerry. The Moores allege Lewis was negligent in failing to properly supervise Little Jerry, and the school was vicariously liable for Lewis' negligence. Also, according to the petition, the school was negligent for failing to remedy a hazardous condition of the stairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When none of the defendants filed an answer to the petition, the Moores filed motions for preliminary default on October 26, 2016. On November 4, 2016, the district court entered a preliminary default against Lewis and the school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Nearly a year later, on October 19, 2017, the district court held a hearing at which the Moores moved to confirm the default judgment. On the same date, the district court confirmed the default judgment against Lewis and the school \"in solido and under theory of respondeat superior\" and awarded the Moores damages in the amount of $ 417,249.32, together with interest from the date of judicial demand until paid and all costs of the proceedings. On October 31, 2017, Lewis and the school filed a motion for new trial. Following a hearing on March 9, 2018, the district court denied a new trial in its judgment dated April 2, 2018. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The primary issue before this Court is whether the Moores proved a prima facie case of negligence with competent, admissible\n   evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court has \"broad discretion in [ ] granting or denying a motion for new trial, and we review a denial under an abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Bonnette v.

Specifically, no competent, admissible evidence of breach of duty or causation was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   No eyewitness to Little Jerry's accident testified. No one testified who had any personal knowledge of how Little Jerry's accident occurred. The only evidence in the record of how the accident occurred is hearsay, which is inadmissible. To establish how the accident happened, the Moores rely on an accident report purportedly signed by Lewis, which is hearsay. Likewise, Mr. and Mrs. Moore testified, both in court and via affidavit, to what other people (Lewis and unidentified individuals associated with the school) told them happened to Little Jerry on the day of his injury at school. This is also hearsay and further demonstrates a lack of personal knowledge of the facts of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Moores fail to identify any exception to the hearsay rules, and we find none, that applies here.

Similarly, courts of this state have found that affidavits or testimony, not based on firsthand knowledge of an accident, likewise\n   fail to establish a prima facie case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

This evidence does not prove negligence. If a plaintiff fails to prove any element of the duty/risk analysis, a defendant can have no liability for negligence.\n   <em>\n    Lemann\n   </em>\n   , 2005-1095, p. 7, 923 So.2d at 633. Even if the record evidence supports that a duty existed and the Moores sustained damages, the Moores have failed to show that Lewis or the school breached any duty owed them or that such a breach of duty caused their damages. They have not shown that Lewis did anything wrong with respect to Little Jerry's descent on the stairs or even that the accident occurred on the stairs in question. In the absence of competent evidence, they also have not shown that either Lewis' actions or any condition of the stairs caused Little Jerry's injuries. We find no law permitting an inference that, because a duty may exist for a special needs child and because the child fell, that duty was breached, or such a purported breach of duty caused the damages in question. Without any eyewitness testimony to the accident, or any other competent, admissible evidence of how the accident occurred, the Moores have not proven a prima facie case of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We further recognize that the Moores could have called Lewis as an eyewitness to the accident, but did not. Lewis was served with the petition, and no evidence in the record shows that she could not be located or is otherwise unavailable. This Court has held that the \"unexplained failure of a party to call a witness who possesses peculiar knowledge of material facts pertinent to the resolution of the case entitles the opposing party to a presumption that the witness's testimony would be unfavorable.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldfinch v.

Because of the Moores' unexplained failure to introduce Lewis' testimony substantiating the circumstances of Little Jerry's accident, we presume that Lewis' testimony would have been unfavorable to the Moores' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For these reasons, we find that the district court was manifestly erroneous in concluding that the Moores proved a prima facie case to support the judgment by default. Because the default judgment was confirmed in the absence of competent, admissible evidence supporting a prima facie case of negligence, the judgment is\n   contrary to the law and the evidence, and a new trial should have been granted by the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldfinch\n   </em>\n   , 2008-1447, p. 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063342\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/13/1173/#p1180\">\n    13 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1181 ;\n   <em>\n    Cameron\n   </em>\n   , 47,789, p. 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003156\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/438/\">\n    111 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   445 ; La.

First, Little Jerry left home for school on August 19, 2015, without any injuries. Lafayette knew Little Jerry had special needs and required 24-hour supervision, including during his time at school. While he was at school that day, Little Jerry was, in fact, supposed to be under the constant supervision by a paraprofessional who knew that Little Jerry needed special assistance. The school, through its agents and teachers, owed a duty of reasonable supervision over Little Jerry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallmuth v. Rapides Parish Sch.

Although unable to communicate, Ms. Moore described Little Jerry as highly active and social. She explained that Little Jerry requires twenty-four-hour supervision when moving about the house, getting in and out of vehicles, traversing stairs, eating, using the bathroom, bathing, attending to personal needs, dressing and hygiene. Ms. Moore and her husband enrolled Little Jerry in Lafayette Academy in the fall of 2014, choosing that school over others because it provided a paraprofessional who would assist Little Jerry at all times, providing constant supervision to him while also allowing him to interact with other children. Prior to attending Lafayette Academy, Mr. and Ms. Moore attended a meeting at the school to discuss Little Jerry's special needs, noting his poor coordination, spatial difficulties, and being prone to seizure disorders, for which he took medication. Ms. Moore stated that she specifically advised the school that Little Jerry would need assistance with \"going up and down the stairs because he did not like to look down while going down stairs.\" She explained that Little Jerry would also raise his arms above his head while descending stairs. Lafayette Academy indicated they had an experienced paraprofessional, and they assigned Lewis to supervise Little Jerry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In her affidavit, Ms. Moore reported that, on August 19, 2015, she received a call from Lewis and immediately had to pick up Little Jerry at school because he had fallen on the playground and was crying. Ms. Moore testified that Little Jerry was brought out of the school in a wheelchair and she had to lift him and put him into her car in order to bring him home. Because he is non-verbal, Little Jerry could not tell his mother what had occurred. Ms. Moore noted that Little Jerry had swelling in the knees, left ankle, shoulder scratches, and a left swollen elbow. Ms. Moore and her husband decided to take Little Jerry to a hospital, and Little Jerry was treated at the emergency room. Ms. Moore also attested that Ms. Lewis sent her photographs of the location where the accident occurred, the stairs near the school playground area. These photos were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Ms. Moore indicated in her affidavit that, after she and her husband took Little Jerry to the emergency room on August 19, 2015, he was sent home with a diagnosis of \"right knee swelling\" and \"left shoulder swelling\" but no testing was performed. She also testified that, at first, Little Jerry would not even stand and would \"crawl around.\" After a few days, he would pull up and stand up while holding on to something. He would whine and cry but could not tell his parents what was wrong. She indicated that Little Jerry seemed agitated and in pain - he was also still exhibiting right knee and left shoulder swelling. On August 24, 2015, Mr. and Ms. Moore took Little Jerry back to the emergency room and a CT scan was performed which indicated a femoral neck fracture to the hip. Little Jerry was immediately admitted to the hospital for surgical hip repair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Considering the aforementioned evidence, I find that Plaintiffs sufficiently supported their default judgment, based on a theory of general negligence, with competent, admissible evidence, and that Plaintiffs would prevail at trial. The majority is correct that neither Ms. Moore nor Mr. Moore were eyewitnesses to the accident, as neither was physically present at the time their son was injured. Furthermore, unlike most plaintiffs, Little Jerry is incapable of testifying to the circumstances that led to his injury. However, without considering hearsay evidence, the testimony of Mr. and Ms. Moore established that their son, Little Jerry, a thirteen-year-old, non-verbal, autistic child, was placed in the Defendants' custody and care on August 19, 2015; that Ms. Moore was required to pick him up from Lafayette Academy that afternoon after receiving a call from the school to do so; that Little Jerry was presented to her in a wheelchair and bore signs of physical injury; that Little Jerry was subsequently treated at the emergency room; and, upon a return trip to the hospital, medical professionals discovered that Little Jerry had sustained a femoral neck fracture, which required surgery and follow-up care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The testimony and affidavits offered by Mr. and Ms. Moore also demonstrated that Defendants were placed on notice regarding Little Jerry's limitations and, in particular, that Little Jerry would need assistance using the stairs. Defendants, through its agents, failed to conform their conduct to an appropriate standard of care, in light of their assumed obligation in caring for a child with disabilities, therefore breaching the duty that they owed to Little Jerry.
