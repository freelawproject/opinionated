As discussed below, the trial court's judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2013, Lloyd Vaughn entered into a business venture for the development of a residential development in Fort Mitchell, Alabama. Mr. Vaughn signed a personal guaranty guaranteeing the debt of Westgate Homes, L.L.C., which consisted of two promissory notes, with The Bank of Georgia (The Bank). Westgate defaulted on the promissory notes and filed for bankruptcy. In 2015, The Bank sued Mr. Vaughn to collect the balance Westgate owed on the notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2015, The Bank entered into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement with the FDIC, Fidelity Bank acquired the assets of The Bank, including enforcement rights of promissory notes payable to The Bank. The trial court granted leave for Fidelity Bank to be substituted as plaintiff in place of The Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Fidelity Bank filed two motions for summary judgment. One motion sought judgment against Mr. Vaughn as guarantor of Westgate's debt. The second motion sought dismissal of reconventional demands Mr. Vaughn asserted in his answer to the petition. The trial court denied both motions after hearings held in July 2016, finding that the parties had not had adequate time to conduct discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2017, Fidelity Bank substituted its counsel, and the new counsel filed a peremptory exception of no cause of action to have Mr. Vaughn's reconventional demands dismissed. The trial court sustained the exception, and Mr. Vaughn did not appeal the judgment dismissing those demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2018, Fidelity Bank filed another motion for summary judgment to enforce Mr. Vaughn's guaranty of Westgate's debt. After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion and signed a judgment granting judgment in favor of Fidelity Bank in the principal amount of $ 373,207.92, together with legal interest, late fees, attorney fees, and judicial interest. Mr. Vaughn filed a motion for new trial, which was denied; he then filed a motion for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Vaughn's sole assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The [t]rial [c]ourt erred in granting Fidelity Bank's [m]otion for [s]ummary [j]udgment where genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether Lloyd Vaughn's Guaranty was extinguished by breach by The Bank ...

It supports its motion with documentation evidencing Westgate's promissory notes, Mr. Vaughn's guaranty of the notes, the FDIC's assignment of the notes to it, and an affidavit attesting to the outstanding balances due thereon. Mr. Vaughn does not dispute that he guaranteed Westgate's indebtedness. Instead, he argues that The Bank engaged in actions that caused the real property securing Westgate's indebtedness to be sold below market value. Citing La.Civ. Code art. 3062,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   he asserts that The Bank's actions impaired the value of the real property securing Westgate's indebtedness and extinguished his suretyship.

The requirement that the affidavit show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein enables the court to make a determination as to the competency of the affiant as a witness to the material fact at issue. An affirmative showing of competency cannot be established without a predicate showing of personal knowledge. Otherwise, personal knowledge may be based on hearsay or other incompetent evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Mr. Vaughn's affidavit affirmatively shows that he personally communicated with his business partner and Russell Byrd, a former board member of The Bank who is now a vice-president of the Fidelity Bank, regarding the operations of Westgate, its loans, and the property securing Westgate's indebtedness. We find these statements establish that he has personal knowledge of the statements made therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The following statements in Mr. Vaughn's affidavit are pertinent to Fidelity Bank's claim that his statements are self-serving and, therefore, insufficient to defeat summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   16. Westgate was required to provide the identities of prospective lot buyers to The Bank ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   17.

Russell Byrd used the provided information to identify, negotiate with, and sell property in direct competition with Westgate through bank foreclosure properties and competing businesses that he had a direct stake in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We consider these statements in light of this court's determination that \"[a]ffidavits that are devoid of specific underlying facts to support a conclusion of ultimate 'fact' are not legally sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Cressy v.

We find Mr. Vaughn's affidavit satisfies the requirements of La.Code Civ.P. art. 967 and creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether The Bank's disposition of Westgate's security constitutes an impairment sufficient to extinguish Mr. Vaughn's suretyship as provided in La.Civ.Code art. 3062.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Fidelity Bank argues that although Mr. Vaughn argued the issue of good faith before the trial court, he did not cite La.Civ.Code arts. 1759 and 1983 in support of his arguments; therefore, we should disregard these arguments on appeal. Louisiana Civil Code Article 3062 cross references La.Civ.Code art. 1759,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides that good faith governs the performance of obligations. Article 3062 does not cross reference La.Civ.Code art. 1983\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; however, it requires good faith in the performance of contracts. Article 3062 does not use the term \"good faith,\" yet we believe the duty of good faith is inherent in the relief provided to the surety whose rights have been impaired. Additionally, we observe that \"The appellate court shall render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper upon the record on appeal.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 2164. Accordingly, we find that Mr. Vaughn's failure to cite La.Civ.Code arts. 1759 and 1983 in its brief before the trial court is not fatal to his arguments to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Fidelity Bank failed to demonstrate that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For these reasons, the trial court's judgment granting summary judgment in favor of Fidelity Bank is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. All costs of this appeal are assessed to Fidelity Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Louisiana Civil Code Article 3062 (emphasis added) states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n    The modification or amendment of the principal obligation, or\n    <em>\n     the impairment of real security held for it, by the creditor, in any material manner and without the consent of the surety\n    </em>\n    , has the following effects.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n    <em>\n     An ordinary suretyship is extinguished\n    </em>\n    .\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    A commercial suretyship is extinguished to the extent the surety is prejudiced by the action of the creditor, unless the principal obligation is one other than for the payment of money, and the surety should have contemplated that the creditor might take such action in the ordinary course of performance of the obligation. The creditor has the burden of proving that the surety has not been prejudiced or that the extent of the prejudice is less than the full amount of the surety's obligation.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Louisiana Civil Code Article 1759 states: \"Good faith shall govern the conduct of the obligor and the obligee in whatever pertains to the obligation.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Louisiana Civil Code Article 1983 provides, in pertinent part: \"Contracts must be performed in good faith.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
