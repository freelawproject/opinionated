For the reasons that follow, we amend the trial court's judgment and affirm the judgment, as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Wechem, Inc. (\"Wechem\") is a Louisiana corporation engaged in the manufacture, sale, resale, distribution, and packaging of chemicals, including janitorial, industrial, water treatment and others, and institutional supplies and chemicals. The water treatment chemicals Wechem sells are primarily used in institutional HVAC applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant, Will Evans, was formerly employed by Wechem as a sales representative from 1991 until May 2018. At the time of his hire, Evans worked for Wechem on a commission basis with no formal written employment contract. In October 2007, as a condition of his continued employment, Evans was required to enter into a Sales Representative Exclusive Account Contract (the \"Agreement\"), which contained, among other provisions, an agreement not to compete and an agreement not to solicit customers. Paragraph 8 contained a geographical limitation prohibiting Evans from engaging in any business or selling any products similar to that of Wechem within nine Louisiana parishes and one Mississippi county for a twenty-four month period following his separation of employment with Wechem. Paragraph 10 contained a solicitation prohibition requiring Evans to refrain from selling to or soliciting Wechem's existing customers within the same nine Louisiana parishes and one Mississippi county, also for a period of twenty-four months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   W. Earl Phillips, the president/chief executive officer for Wechem, executed the Agreement on behalf of Wechem on October 4, 2007. Evans initially refused to sign the contract due to concerns that, as written, the Agreement did not protect his future compensation regarding sales commissions. In response to Evans' concerns, Wechem added a compensation addendum, which provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sales Representative shall be paid pursuant to the current Wechem Commission Policy unless a different commission policy is agreed upon by Company and Sales Representative, and the policy is put in writing and signed by the appropriate Wechem representative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once the compensation addendum was incorporated into the employment contract as per Evans' request, Evans signed the Agreement on October 23, 2007. By freely and voluntarily signing the Agreement, Evans conceded that he had read and fully understood \"each and every provision\" and that he \"accept[ed] and agree[d] to the same.\" Evans worked under the terms and conditions of this Agreement from October 2007 until he separated from Wechem in May 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to the compensation addendum, and under the \"Wechem Commission Policy\" existing at the time the Agreement was confected in 2007, commissions on all of Evans' sales were based on a 50/50 split of the profit amount realized on every sale, and his commission percentage averaged from 27% to 29% of gross sales each year. In the fall of 2017, Wechem announced its plan to modify the commission structure of its sales force. This modification differed from the compensation scheme Wechem had in place in 2007 when Evans executed the Agreement, in that it placed an approximate 18% cap on Evans' sales commissions yielding a decrease in Evans' annual commissions. In 2005, Evans received special training and obtained certification as a water technologist. Due to Evans' specialization in water treatment chemicals, Wechem management recognized that Evans' specialization set him apart from other Wechem sales representatives and that the modified compensation scheme would affect him differently. Thus, as a result of back-and-forth negotiations between Evans and Wechem's CEO, Olin Kropog, it was determined that the company's modified 18% cap on commissions as to Evans would be implemented only as to his sale of janitorial products-the commissions on Evans' sale of water treatment chemicals, which comprised approximately 75-80% of his sales, would remain unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In an August 18, 2017 email from Kropog to Evans, Kropog memorialized that Wechem was not going to modify Evans' sales commission on water treatment chemicals, but that Wechem would apply the 18% commission to other non-water treatment products he sold. It is undisputed that the email transmitted by Kropog to Evans was sent in Kropog's capacity as the CEO of Wechem and that the email bore Kropog's electronic signature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Evans was paid pursuant to the modified compensation scheme as outlined in Kropog's August 18, 2017 email, from that time through the date of his separation from the company in May 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2017, while still employed with Wechem, Evans began communicating with Bill Buckley, the Senior Vice President/National Sales Manager of Momar,\n   Inc., a direct competitor to Wechem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, in April 2018, Evans met with Buckley and Momar's owner, Julian Mohr, to discuss Evans' separation from Wechem and his move over to work as a sales representative for Momar. Also while still employed with Wechem, Evans became aware that one of the Mississippi customers he serviced for Wechem had advertised a request for public bid to supply water treatment chemicals. Evans withheld information regarding the upcoming bid opening from Wechem management. Instead, in anticipation of his transfer to Momar and in an attempt to obtain this customer's account for Momar, Evans provided Buckley with information regarding Wechem's contract with this Mississippi customer, which included Wechem's pricing structure and bid package. Additionally, prior to leaving Wechem, Evans admittedly contacted at least three of Wechem's existing customers in an attempt to solicit them to transfer their business to Momar, where he would soon be employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Evans, his resignation from Wechem on May 30, 2018 was a direct consequence of Wechem's change in its commission policy and the resulting loss of his commission earnings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon leaving, Evans immediately began working as a sales representative for Momar selling many of the same and/or similar products sold by Wechem, as well as other products that Wechem does not carry, and providing testing and treatment services. Additionally, within the first weeks of working for Momar, Evans targeted and tried to sell water treatment chemicals to customers that he had previously serviced while employed at Wechem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Also soon after Evans' departure from Wechem, several of Wechem's customers advised Wechem that they were \"moving in a different direction\" and were no longer in need of Wechem's services. Evans conceded that he solicited several of these customers to move their business with him to Momar. According to Wechem, it did not become aware that Evans was in violation of the Agreement until August 2018, when a Wechem salesman attempted to make a sales call on one of its customers and was apprised that Evans had solicited the customer's water treatment business for Momar. Additionally, during his sales calls of former and existing Wechem customers, the Wechem salesman discovered Momar chemicals on the premises of several of these customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After obtaining confirmation that Evans was in breach of the Agreement, Wechem sent a cease and desist letter to Evans and the owner of Momar via certified mail on September 7, 2018. Thereafter, on October 11, 2018, Wechem filed suit against Evans, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against him for violation of the Agreement's non-competition and non-solicitation provisions and for damages for breach of contract. Specifically, Wechem's petition sought to restrain and enjoin Evans\n   for a period of twenty-four months from the date of his separation of employment with Wechem from (1) working for Momar and/or any other competitor of Wechem in Hinds County, Mississippi, and nine Louisiana parishes, and (2) from directly or indirectly soliciting or encouraging any Wechem customer to move its business to Momar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A hearing on the preliminary injunction was held on October 31, 2018. At the conclusion, the trial court orally rendered judgment granting Wechem's request for a preliminary injunction, finding that Wechem would suffer irreparable injury, loss or damage if the preliminary injunction was not issued; that Wechem was entitled to the relief sought; and, that Wechem had carried its burden of showing that it was likely to prevail on the merits. The trial court ruled that Evans was prohibited from working for any Wechem competitor, including Momar, in Hinds County, Mississippi and in the nine Louisiana parishes set forth in the Agreement. The trial court also prohibited Evans from directly or indirectly soliciting any Wechem customers that purchased Wechem products while Evans was employed by Wechem. A written preliminary injunction was entered on October 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The instant appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal, Evans avers that the trial court erred: (1) by enforcing the non-competition Agreement between himself and Wechem, which Wechem purportedly breached by not paying Evans in accordance with the Agreement's compensation addendum; (2) by enjoining Evans from working in parishes in which Wechem failed to establish that it was carrying on a \"like business\" as required by La. R.S. 23:921(C) ; (3) by issuing an order that, effectively, prevents Evans from any employment with his current employer, regardless of whether such employment is \"in competition\" as is required by La. R.S. 23:921 ; and (4) by issuing an order that fails to sufficiently describe the prohibited conduct and/or is otherwise impermissibly overly broad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW AND DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Applicable Legal Principles\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A preliminary injunction is essentially an interlocutory procedural device designed to preserve the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   between the parties pending a trial on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Novelaire Techs., L.L.C. v.

Company reserves the right to assign the Sales Representative to different and other further employment duties and responsibilities other than those defined herein. Notwithstanding said change and assignment, all terms and provisions of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   8.

In addition, there is a clause requiring the sales representative to maintain confidentiality of Wechem's trade secrets and/or confidential information, including customer lists, pricing policies, prices, product development plans, and market strategies. Further, the parties agreed that Wechem is entitled to injunctive relief to prevent or curtail any breach of the Agreement by the sales representative. Finally, the parties agreed that Evans would be paid pursuant to the commission policy Wechem had in effect at the time the Agreement was executed, and that any change in the commission policy would have to be: (1) agreed to by both Wechem and Evans; (2) put in writing; and (3) be signed by the Wechem representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Breach of the Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In his first assignment of error, Evans contends that Wechem's modification to his compensation scheme in August 2017 constituted a breach of the Agreement rendering the non-competition/non-solicitation provisions invalid and unenforceable under La. R.S. 23:921(C). Specifically, Evans contends Wechem was in breach of the Agreement because the change to the company's compensation policy was unilateral as he never agreed to it, the change was not issued by Wechem \"in writing,\" and the change was not signed by the appropriate Wechem representative, as required by the terms of the Agreement's compensation addendum. In short, Evans argues the trial court committed legal error by failing to take Wechem's breach of the Agreement into consideration when granting Wechem's request for a preliminary injunction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At the hearing, Evans conceded in his testimony that discussions and negotiations did take place between himself and Wechem's then CEO, Kopog, regarding Wechem's proposed modification:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Q. Isn't it true that you and management at Wechem entered into a discussion and negotiation as it related to the commission structure for your water treatment business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   A. Yes. I had to -- I had to fight to continue getting the commissions I'd been getting for twenty-six years of service to Wechem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Q. Isn't it true that at the end of the day, Wechem agreed to pay you the commissions that you have previously\n   gotten for your water treatment business throughout the entire time you were at Wechem?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A. Yes. But the other roughly half of my business, the commissions were cut significantly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Also at the hearing, Wechem's CFO, Christine Jones, testified that when she researched Evans' accounts, she was able to determine that his water treatment business comprised approximately 75-80% of his accounts on which the sales commissions he received would remain the same. The remaining 20-25% of Evans' business consisted of non-water treatment, or janitorial, accounts; under the modified commission structure, the sales commissions that he would receive on these accounts were subject to a flat 18% commission. Jones determined that as a result of the reduction in commissions on Evans' janitorial sales, Evans' overall compensation was decreased by 6%. In order to offset some of the income loss Evans was to incur as a result of the modification, Jones testified that Wechem gave him a new account. While Jones testified that under the new commission policy Evans was due to make \"somewhat less money,\" there was the opportunity for him to make more money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Contrary to Evans' contention that Wechem's modification to the commission policy was \"unilateral\" and that he never agreed it, we find that the evidence adduced at the hearing established that the modification to Evans' particular commission scheme was actually the result of negotiations between himself and Wechem management. And while Evans contends that he never agreed to the modification as required by the Agreement, the testimony at the hearing established that Evans worked under the modified commission policy without complaint from August 2017 until his separation from Wechem in May 2018, suggesting that Evans tacitly agreed to the modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We also find that the August 18, 2017 email transmitted by Kopog to Evans, wherein Kopog memorialized Wechem's commission policy for Evans was sufficient to meet the \"writing\" requirement of the Agreement's compensation addendum. Further, Evans does not dispute that the email was transmitted by Kopog, Wechem's CEO, or that the email contained Kopog's signature block:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q. And isn't it true that Olin [Kopog] said to you in this document that he was not changing the commission structure on the water treatment chemicals?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   A.

In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the evidence and testimony introduced at the hearing reflects that Evans worked under the modified compensation scheme for over nine months without complaint. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he rejected the compensation modifications as set forth in the August 18, 2017 email he received from Kopog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on our review of the record, whether the Agreement's compensation addendum was orally modified or done so by written agreement, we find the evidence insufficient to establish that Wechem breached the Agreement as Evans contends. The evidence and testimony adduced at the hearing show that although Wechem made the initial decision that a change in its commission policy for all of its sales representatives was necessary, the actual modification to Evans' commission structure, in particular, was not a unilateral change, but rather, a result of negotiations that took place between Evans and Wechem management. Following those negotiations, the final terms of the modification to Evans' commission scheme were reduced to writing and provided to Evans in a written email, which Evans acknowledged was electronically signed by Kopog, Wechem's CEO. Thereafter, Evans worked under, and received payments pursuant to, the modified compensation policy for an additional nine months prior to his separation from the company, without evidence of complaint. Accordingly, we find the record evidence does not support Evans' contention that Wechem's modification to his commission scheme, whether oral or written, constituted a breach of the Agreement nullifying the non-compensation/non-solicitation provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Validity and Enforceability of the Agreement's Non-Competition/Non-Solicitation Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We further find that the trial court did not err in concluding that the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions comport with La. R.S. 23:921 and are enforceable. The statute permits an employer to prohibit its employee, for a period not to exceed two years, \"from carrying on or engaging in a business similar to that of the employer ...\" and from soliciting the employer's customers within specified parishes where the employer carries on a like business. La. R.S. 23:921(C). It is undisputed that the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions comply with the statute's two-year maximum duration requirement and specifically elucidate the nine Louisiana parishes and one Mississippi county in which Evans is restrained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Further, \"[t]o comply with Louisiana law, a covenant-not-to compete agreement must specifically define the employer's business.\"\n   <em>\n    Daquiri's III on Bourbon, Ltd. v.

App. 5th Cir. 1992). In the instant case, the Agreement's preamble explicitly states that Wechem is engaged in the \"manufacture, sale, resale, distribution, and packaging of chemicals, including janitorial, industrial, water treatment and others and institutional supplies and chemicals.\" Evans suggests that because Wechem, in its brief, more particularly described its business as \"sell[ing] janitorial supplies and water treatment chemicals used in HVAC machinery,\" this is an acknowledgement that the definition of Wechem's business as stated in the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions is \"patently\" overly broad in violation of Louisiana law and, thus, the provisions are null and void. To the contrary, the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions\n   specifically prohibit Evans from selling, attempting to sell, or soliciting the sale of any janitorial, industrial, or water treatment chemicals and institutional supplies for or on behalf of a Wechem competitor that are the same or similar to any of the chemicals and supplies Wechem sold while Evans was employed there. We do not find the Agreement's definition of Wechem's business to be overly broad or in violation of Louisiana law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Evans further contends that the Agreement's language is overly broad in that it acts to limit Evans from working\n   <em>\n    in any capacity\n   </em>\n   with a competitor. We disagree. We find the Agreement's language operates to prohibit only those actions by Evans which directly or indirectly compete with Wechem's business-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , selling, or soliciting to sell, janitorial, industrial, or water treatment chemicals and institutional supplies like or similar to those products sold by Wechem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons stated, we find the Agreement validly operates to prevent Evans from leaving Wechem's employ and competing in a business in direct or indirect competition with Wechem's business for a period of two years within a specifically defined geographical area. In short, the Agreement's language falls within the permissible bounds of La. R.S. 23:921. At the hearing, Evans, who was employed with Wechem for 26 years and knew full well the nature of Wechem's business, testified that the work he now performs for his new employer, Momar, is in direct competition with Wechem's business. Evans also admitted that, both before and after his separation from Wechem, he solicited Wechem clients to move their water treatment business from Wechem with him to Momar. Such actions violated the Agreement's non-competition and non-solicitation provisions. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in its determination that the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions are valid and enforceable against Evans. This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Whether Wechem Carried its Burden of Proving Its Right to a Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In this assignment of error, Evans contends that Wechem failed to carry its burden of establishing its right to injunctive relief in the proscribed parishes of St. John, West Baton Rouge, West Feliciana, Livingston and St. Charles because Wechem failed to introduce any evidence at the hearing showing that it was carrying on a \"like business\" in each of these parishes. Further, Evans argues that one of the locations sought to be enjoined, Iberville Parish, was not included in the Agreement's list of proscribed parishes and thus, the injunction should be dissolved as to Iberville Parish. Evans further contends that Wechem failed to present sufficient evidence to establish its right to injunctive relief in the parishes of East Feliciana, Orleans and East Baton Rouge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It is well established that an applicant seeking a preliminary injunction need only make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that he will prevail on the merits; thus, less proof is required than in an ordinary proceeding for a permanent injunction where the burden of proof is a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorrento Companies, Inc. v.

R.S. 23:921 requires the employer to specify in the Agreement the \"parish or parishes, municipality or municipalities, or parts thereof,\" where the employer is carrying on a like business. In the instant case, in accordance with the statute, Wechem specifically set forth in the Agreement, which was admitted into evidence, the nine Louisiana parishes and one county in Mississippi wherein it was conducting business and to which the non-competition/non-solicitation provisions would apply. We find this sufficient evidence to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that Wechem was conducting business in those parishes for purposes of establishing a right to a preliminary injunction in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    VarTech\n   </em>\n   , the defendants argued that the geographic limitation contained in the non-competition agreements at issue, which specifically listed all 64 parishes in the state as those to which the agreements would apply, was overly broad in that it included parishes in which VarTech did not do business. In upholding the injunction in favor of VarTech in all 64 parishes without evidence of doing \"like business\" on a parish-by-parish basis, the First Circuit noted that (1) the statute contemplates that the parishes the employer specifies in the agreement are those in which it has a location or customers, and (2) the defendants failed to offer any proof to show that the specification made by VarTech in its agreement was invalid.\n   <em>\n    VarTech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321728\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/247/#p260\">\n    951 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hose Specialty &amp; Supply.

According to the Agreement, Wechem was also carrying on \"like business\" in the parishes of St. John, West Baton Rouge, West Feliciana, Livingston and St. Charles. There was no evidence adduced showing that the geographic locations specified by Wechem in the Agreement were invalid;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that they were not carrying on a like business in these parishes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VarTech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8321728\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/951/247/#p260\">\n    951 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   258 ;\n   <em>\n    Hose Specialty &amp; Supply.

Thus, in the absence of such evidence in connection with Wechem's request for a preliminary injunction, we find no error in the trial court's finding that the geographic bounds set forth in the Agreement comply with the requirements of La. R.S. 23:921 and should be enforced for preliminary injunction purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Enforceability of the Trial Court's Order Granting Injunctive Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In his remaining assignments of error, Evans contends that the trial court erred in issuing a preliminary injunction that is overly broad and unenforceable under La. R.S. 23:921(C) because it prevents Evans from working\n   <em>\n    in any capacity\n   </em>\n   for any competitor of Wechem, including Momar, in the proscribed parishes. Alternatively, Evans avers that the trial court's order is null and void because it does not reasonably describe the prohibited conduct as required by La. R.S. 23:921. Evans also argues that, in contravention of the statute, the preliminary injunction impermissibly prohibits all solicitation without regard to any geographical limitation. We find these assignments of error have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   While we have determined that the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions comport with the requirements of La.

The trial court's order provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED\n   </strong>\n   that WECHEM, Inc.'s Request for Preliminary Injunction is hereby GRANTED, and that Will Evans is prohibited from working for any Wechem competitor in the geographic area listed in the Agreement including but not limited to Momar; and that Will Evans is prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting any Wechem customer that purchased Wechem products while Will Evans was employed by Wechem.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   La.

Consequently, the judgment is impermissibly vague and overbroad and not sufficiently specific based upon the evidence presented. Specifically, the Agreement prohibits Evans, for or on behalf of any competitor of Wechem, directly or indirectly, from selling, attempting to sell, or soliciting the sale of products that are the same or similar to those products offered or sold by Wechem while Evans was in its employ. The prohibition is for a period of twenty-four months and is restricted to a specified geographical area. The trial court's injunctive order, however, instead of tracking the Agreement's language-which we find permissible-not only prohibits Evans from selling or soliciting the sale of the same or similar products for a Wechem competitor, it restricts Evans' from working\n   <em>\n    in any capacity\n   </em>\n   for a Wechem competitor \"in the geographic area listed in the Agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order contains no limitation on what type of work Evans is prohibited from pursuing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Yorsch v.

Similarly, we conclude that a trial court may not issue a preliminary injunction which prohibits an employee from working in an area outside of his former employment. In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the scope of the trial court's order prohibiting Evans from working in any capacity for a competitor of Wechem goes not only beyond that permitted by La. R.S. 23:921, but also goes beyond the actual scope of the Agreement. Consequently, we will amend the injunctive order in this respect to conform exactly with the language of the restriction set forth in the Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fern Creek Owners' Ass'n, Inc. v.

R.S. 23:921 and, thus, are valid and enforceable, and find that Wechem has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that it is entitled to a preliminary injunction in this matter. Therefore, pursuant to the authority granted to appellate courts by La. C.C.P. art. 2164, to \"render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper upon the record on appeal[,]\" we hereby amend the trial court's October 31, 2018 order issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of Wechem, Inc. and against Will Evans to track the language of the Agreement's non-competition/non-solicitation provisions. Accordingly, Will Evans is prohibited from acting on behalf of himself or a competitor of Wechem, Inc. that is engaged in a business similar to the type of business conducted by Wechem, Inc., including but not limited to Momar, Inc., directly or indirectly: (1) from selling, attempting to sell, or soliciting, the sale of any janitorial, industrial, water treatment chemicals or products and industrial supplies that are of the same or similar kind as the chemicals, products, or supplies offered or sold by Wechem at any time during Evans' employment with Wechem; and (2) from soliciting or attempting to solicit any customer of Wechem, Inc. that purchased products from Wechem at any time during Evans' employment with Wechem. These prohibitions shall last for a period of twenty-four months from May 30, 2017, the date of Evans' separation from Wechem, Inc., and their application is restricted to the Louisiana parishes of East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Orleans, St. John, West Baton Rouge, Jefferson, West Feliciana, Livingston, and St. Charles, and Hinds County, Mississippi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JUDGMENT AMENDED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, AS AMENDED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Though in Evans' brief on appeal, his counsel argues that the signature block on Kropog's email did not constitute an electronic signature, at the hearing on the preliminary injunction, Evans conceded that the email constituted a \"writing\" and that it bore an electronic signature at the bottom of the email document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Both Wechem and Momar sell janitorial supplies and water treatment chemicals used in HVAC machinery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Evans contends that Wechem has not paid commissions owed to him in accordance with the Agreement's compensation addendum from the fall of 2017 through the date of his resignation in May 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Wechem avers that, in contravention of the Agreement, Evans has sold products to the following entities: DHH East LA Mental Hospital (East Feliciana Parish); Mahalia Jackson Arts Center (Orleans Parish); Neuromedical Center (East Baton Rouge Parish); Trademark Property Company (East Baton Rouge Parish); Johnson Controls for Elayn Hunt Correctional Center (whose business offices are located in East Baton Rouge Parish and its facility is located in Iberville Parish); and Jefferson Parish - General Services.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \"[T]he Civil Code limits individuals' rights in other areas where a derogation of such rights would result in the individual becoming a public burden.
