The circuit court entered judgment in Diolife's favor on both Diolife's action for declaratory relief and on Perera's counterclaims for breach of contract and specific performance. The court found the parties orally modified a written contract and, as a result, Diolife did not breach the contract. Alternatively, the court found that if Diolife breached the contract, Perera suffered no damages. Based on the facts and arguments presented, we reverse on both conclusions and remand for entry of judgment for Perera.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    i. Pre-Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Perera and Diolife entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (\"MIPA\"), in which Perera agreed to sell\n   to Diolife a 5% membership interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings, LLC for $ 200,000. The parties completed this transaction of the MIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The MIPA also gave Perera the option to sell another 5% interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings in exchange for another $ 200,000 from Diolife. The option was exercisable in Perera's sole discretion and required Diolife to tender the purchase price. The MIPA required the sale of the additional interest to close on or before March 31, 2016. This agreement to buy another 5% of Cowboys Saloon Holdings also required Diolife to send written notice to Perera when it was ready to close:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Agreement to Purchase and Sell the Additional Interest\n   </em>\n   . [Diolife] hereby irrevocably covenants and agrees to purchase from [Perera], and [Perera] shall have the option (exercisable in [his] sole discretion) to transfer, sell and deliver to [Diolife], the Additional Interest in exchange for a total purchase price of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($ 200,000.00) payable in cash at the Second Closing .... [Diolife] shall send written notice to [Perera] when it is ready to close on the purchase of the Additional Interest (the \"Closing Notice\"), and such notice shall be sent no later than March 21, 2016 ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The MIPA specifically provided that it could not be amended orally or through the parties' actions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Amendment and Waiver\n   </em>\n   . The provisions of this Agreement may be amended and waived only with the prior written consent of the Seller and the Buyer, and no course of conduct or failure or delay in enforcing the provisions of this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver of such provisions or affect the validity, binding effect or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision hereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties jointly filed a detailed statement of stipulated facts before trial. They agreed that Diolife did not send the written notice by the March 21, 2016 deadline. Instead, on that day, Diolife's counsel sent Perera's counsel an email stating he understood their clients had \"discussed an extension regarding the purchase of an additional 5% membership interest in\" Cowboys Saloon Holdings. He suggested \"moving the notice and closing date\" and attached a draft amended agreement incorporating the proposed new dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Two days later, Diolife's counsel again emailed Perera's counsel, stating, \"Thanks again for our call yesterday. Can you please provide the discussed offer in writing so my client can have something concrete to review?\" Perera's counsel responded, \"2.5% for $ 200,000. Must close by April 15. All other terms of the purchase option remain the same. This is a non-binding offer that only becomes effective upon execution of definitive documents.\" These terms formed the purported oral modification of the MIPA: Perera's sale of a 2.5% interest for $ 200,000, with an April 15, 2016 closing date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Six days later, Perera sent a text message to Diolife's members stating that Cowboys Saloon Holdings was \"raising cash from other big funds and ha[d] commitments for higher valuations.\" The purported commitments at higher valuations was the reason Perera was \"pushing\" Diolife's members to go through with the purchase before the closing deadline. \"Once the deadline passed,\" however, Perera had to convince other investors to allow Diolife to pay $ 200,000 but receive only a 2.5% interest because the company's value was increasing. Perera also stated in the text message: \"If you guys are not interested[,] I am OK with it but I am doing my best. Let me know your thoughts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On April 5, 2016, Diolife's counsel again emailed Perera's counsel, stating he \"believe[d] [their] clients have agreed on these terms. Please confirm same ....\" On April 11, 2016, Perera's counsel emailed Diolife's counsel and attached a \"First Amendment to Membership Interest Purchase Agreement.\" Perera signed the attachment, and it reflected the sale of a 2.5% interest for $ 200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   One day later, Diolife's counsel emailed Perera's counsel stating, \"Our client has informed us that they do not intend to move forward with the transaction. Thanks.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Seven days after Diolife notified Perera that it would not move forward, Perera sent a demand letter to Diolife and stated in his cover letter that it was his \"final attempt to resolve this issue in an attempt to preserve a working business relationship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    ii. The Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nine days after it notified Perera that it would not be completing its purchase of the additional interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings, and only two days after Perera sent his demand letter, Diolife brought an action for declaratory judgment to determine whether Perera had a right to claim a breach of the MIPA. Perera filed a counterclaim alleging a breach of contract and seeking specific performance of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   During the lawsuit, Perera remained willing to perform and signed an affidavit stating, \"I remain ready, willing and able to convey the 5% Additional Interest to\" Diolife. But the circuit court stated in the final judgment that Cowboys Saloon Holdings was formally dissolved and \"run into the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court first entered summary judgment against Perera on his claim for specific performance. Next, after a non-jury trial, the court found for Diolife on its claim for declaratory judgment and on Perera's counterclaim for breach of contract. Perera appeals the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Perera raises three issues on appeal, arguing the court erred by concluding that: (i) the parties entered into an oral modification of the MIPA, (ii) Perera did not suffer any damages even if Diolife breached the MIPA, and (iii) Diolife did not anticipatorily repudiate the MIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with Perera's first two points on appeal and reverse. Because we reverse the judgment, we find it unnecessary to address the third issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    i. Diolife Breached the MIPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The MIPA required Diolife to purchase another 5% membership interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings for $ 200,000 and to close by March 31, 2016. It is undisputed the additional purchase did not happen by the deadline. As a result, Diolife breached the original contract. But Diolife argued, and the circuit court agreed, that the parties orally modified the MIPA before any breach occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We first address whether the parties orally modified the MIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   When a contract does not address modification, oral modification of the contract is generally permissible.\n   <em>\n    Okeechobee Resorts, L.L.C. v. E Z Cash Pawn, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928139,6928167\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/989/\">\n    145 So.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 992 (Fla. 4th DCA 2014) (citations omitted).

When a contract contains such a provision,\n   any alleged oral modification is generally disposed of as a matter of law, and the court should enforce the contract as written.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928139,6928167\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this rule has an exception dating to a 1956 opinion from our supreme court. In\n   <em>\n    Professional Insurance Corp. v. Cahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9910908,9910852\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/916/\">\n    90 So.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1956), the court explained that even when the contract contains a provision precluding oral modification,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [a] written contract or agreement may be altered or modified by an oral agreement if the latter has been accepted and acted upon by the parties in such manner as would work a fraud on either party to refuse to enforce it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9910908,9910852\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/916/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9910908,9910852\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/916/\">\n    at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Okeechobee Resorts\n   </em>\n   , we examined the \"judicial choirs' lack of perfect harmony\" in applying\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   and the various holdings from the courts.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928139,6928167\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/989/\">\n    145 So.3d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we concluded that despite the various applications of\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   remains binding precedent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928139,6928167\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We explained that this requires the plaintiff to prove:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (a) that the parties agreed upon and accepted the oral modification (i.e., mutual assent); and (b) that both parties (or at least the party seeking to enforce the amendment) performed consistent with the terms of the alleged oral modification (not merely consistent with their obligations under the original contract); and (c) that due to plaintiff's performance under the contract as amended the defendant received and accepted a benefit that it otherwise was not entitled to under the original contract (i.e., independent consideration).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928139,6928167\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/145/989/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Applying that test to this case, we conclude that the parties did not modify the MIPA. Diolife argued the parties orally modified the closing deadline and, as a result, it did not breach the contract. And the circuit court agreed, finding the parties agreed-by oral conversations, text messages, and emails-to extend the closing deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   But because the MIPA contains a provision precluding oral modification, to establish an oral modification, Diolife needed to establish that the parties acted on the modification and that it would \"work a fraud\" on Diolife to refuse performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9910908,9910852\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/916/\">\n    90 So.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Diolife failed to meet this burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At best, Diolife presented evidence that on the day of the deadline, its counsel sent an email about a potential revision to the MIPA. Days later, after other emails, Perera's counsel emailed Diolife's counsel: \"... All other terms of the purchase option remain the same. This is a non-binding offer that only becomes effective upon execution of definitive documents.\" Other messages from Perera included requiring Diolife to pay the same $ 200,000 for only 2.5% of stock instead of the 5% set forth in the MIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But the parties did not act on the communication about potentially amending the MIPA. Most significantly, Diolife never acted on the MIPA or the alleged oral modification because Diolife never sent Perera the required funds. Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Cahill\n   </em>\n   requirement that the oral modification must have been \"accepted and acted upon by the parties\" was not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9910908,9910852\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/90/916/\">\n    90 So.2d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As a result, the parties did not amend the MIPA, and Diolife breached the agreement on March 31, 2016, when it failed to close on the purchase of the additional interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Perera Sustained Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The circuit court found that Perera sustained no damages, a conclusion that would require judgment in Diolife's favor even if Diolife breached the contract. The circuit court determined that because the value of a 5% interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings exceeded $ 200,000 on the day of the breach, Perera did not sustain a loss. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In arriving at its conclusion, the court reasoned: 1) \"the value of a 5% membership interest in Cowboys Saloon was higher than the contract value in the MIPA of $ 200,000.00, otherwise Mr. Perera would not have been trying to get $ 200,000.00 for a 2.5% interest\"; and 2) there were text messages between the parties and \"the agreement that Mr. Perera later entered into, which the Court understands did not go forward ....\" The court considered the subsequent agreement but refused to consider that the subsequent agreement did not go forward or that Cowboys Saloon Holdings was dissolved. The court stated that it would not consider that \"point later in time.\" But Perera's attempts to obtain better terms in exchange for excusing Diolife's breach is not evidence of the market value of the 5% interest in Cowboys Saloon Holdings. Furthermore, the court relied on text messages that Perera sent after Diolife's deadline to send notice that it was prepared to complete the purchase. Finally, the \"agreement later entered into\" occurred after the breach. In any event, the court effectively used the out-of-pocket measure of damages to conclude Perera sustained no damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   But, in a breach of contract action, \"[a] non-breaching party is entitled to recover the benefit of its bargain under a contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Educ.

He did not have to search for a potential second investor during the short time between Diolife's correspondence announcing it \"did not intend to move forward with the transaction\" and the date Diolife filed the lawsuit. In total, only nine days elapsed between Diolife's correspondence withdrawing from the MIPA and the date it filed the lawsuit. Even while the lawsuit was pending, Perera testified by affidavit that he remained \"ready, willing, and able\" to conclude the transaction as written in the MIPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On the date of the breach, March 31, 2016, Perera had a right to receive $ 200,000 and, instead, he received nothing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Inc. v.

His text message bragging about the increased value of the company does not change the fact that he did not receive the benefit of the bargain-$ 200,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Yet Diolife passionately argues in its motion that \"the benefit of the bargain measure of damages absolutely requires a plaintiff to prove the actual value of the\n   property at the time of the breach.\" In support of this assertion, Diolife relies on\n   <em>\n    Kind v.
