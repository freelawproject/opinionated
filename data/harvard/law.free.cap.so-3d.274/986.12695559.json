On May 5, 2012, the father filed a contempt petition, which was assigned case number DR-09-900071.01. He later amended his petition to request that the custody provisions of the divorce judgment be modified to award him sole legal and physical custody of the parties' children. In that same action, the mother filed a counterclaim seeking modification of the custody and visitation provisions of the divorce judgment, as well as a finding of contempt against the father. On February\n   28, 2014, the trial court entered a judgment that, among other things, awarded the mother sole legal and physical custody of the children and modified the visitation rights of the father.

The trial court directed, among other things, that the father be taken into custody and held pending the payment of $24,182.60, the total of the amounts for which the father was in arrears for his contemptuous behavior as well as an amount for fees and expenses, as requested by the mother. The father filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the judgment on August 14, 2017. On September 5, 2017, the mother filed a response to the father's postjudgment motion.

The father reasserted those same arguments in his postjudgment motion before the trial court, and he reasserts them before this court in his present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In awarding attorney's fees to the mother in its January 19, 2016, judgment, the trial court stated, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Because the Court finds that the [father] initiated this action without substantial justification, as was evident by the evidence presented at the [f]inal [h]earing, he is assessed and shall pay to the [mother] attorney fees in the amount of $7,500.00 not later than 120 days of the date of this Order.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The mother argued in her answer to the father's mandamus petition in\n   <em>\n    Gallant IV\n   </em>\n   that the trial court's award of attorney's fees was based on the Alabama Litigation Accountability Act (\"the ALAA\"), \u00a7 12-19-270 et seq., Ala.

Code 1975, a part of the ALAA, provides, in pertinent part, that \"[t]he court shall assess attorney's fees and costs against any party or attorney if the court ... finds that an attorney or party brought an action ... without substantial justification.\" Clearly, the trial court's award of attorney's fees mimics the language in \u00a7 12-19-272(c). The father failed to address this argument in his mandamus petition in\n   <em>\n    Gallant IV\n   </em>\n   , he has not addressed it in this appeal, and he has failed to otherwise assert that the trial court could not have relied on the ALAA in fashioning its award of attorney's fees to the mother.

In\n   <em>\n    Gallant IV\n   </em>\n   , this court noted that the materials before us on the father's mandamus petition did not include the father's motion to transfer or any denial of that motion by the trial court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12684492\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/261/350/\">\n    261 So.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205016614\">\n    2017 WL 5016614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We noted, however, that, to the extent an order of the trial court could have been considered a denial of such a motion, the father's petition for a writ of mandamus was untimely following the entry of such an order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205016614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, we have not yet considered the issue of venue. The father cites the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   statute, Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 6-3-21.1, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"(a) With respect to civil actions filed in an appropriate venue, any court of general jurisdiction shall, for the convenience of parties and witnesses, or in the interest of justice, transfer any civil action or any claim in any civil action to any court of general jurisdiction in which the action might have been properly filed and the case shall proceed as though originally filed therein. Provided, however, this section shall not apply to cases subject to Section 30-3-5[, Ala.

Code 1975,] Section 6-3-21, [Ala. Code 1975,] or Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The father asserts that, at all times relevant to this action, the parties and the children have lived in New York or Maine, that all acts or omissions are alleged to have occurred outside Alabama, and that the interest of justice is not served by requiring the parties to litigate over \"1000 miles from the children's home state.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 30-3-5, Ala. Code 1975, the operation of which is not affected by \u00a7 6-3-21.1 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6-3-21.1(a) ), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, venue of all proceedings for petitions or other actions seeking modification, interpretation, or enforcement of a final decree awarding custody of a child or children to a parent and/or granting visitation rights, and/or awarding child support, and/or awarding other expenses incident to the support of a minor child or children, and/or granting post-minority benefits for a child or children is\n   changed so that venue will lie in: (1) the original circuit court rendering the final decree; or (2) in the circuit court of the county where both the current custodial parent or, in the case of post-minority benefits, where the most recent custodial parent, that parent having custody at the time of the child's attaining majority, and the child or children have resided for a period of at least three consecutive years immediately preceding the filing of the petition or other action. The current or most recent custodial parent shall be able to choose the particular venue as herein provided, regardless of which party files the petition or other action.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the present case, the mother sought to enforce a final judgment-i.e., the parties' divorce judgment-awarding child support and other expenses incident to the support of the parties' children. The trial court issued that final judgment; thus, venue in the trial court is in accordance with \u00a7 30-3-5(1). Additionally, because the mother is the current custodial parent, she was entitled to choose the venue in accordance with that statute. Because the trial court was a proper venue, the trial court did not err in denying the father's motion to transfer the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The father next argues on appeal that the mother's contempt complaint was due to be dismissed based on the trial court's lack of personal jurisdiction over him. The father has maintained at all times before the trial court since the mother filed her current complaint for contempt that the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. He reiterated those arguments in open court on August 10, 2017, before testimony proceeded. The mother argues on appeal that this court specifically stated in\n   <em>\n    Gallant II\n   </em>\n   that the trial court retained jurisdiction over the father for purposes of contempt proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    Gallant II\n   </em>\n   , this court relied on\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Stouffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364577\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/214/1192/\">\n    214 So.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala.

Because this court specifically declined to address the father's arguments regarding personal jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Gallant II\n   </em>\n   , the question whether the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction in the present case has not yet been decided by this court such that the law-of-the-case doctrine is applicable. Accordingly, we proceed to address the father's argument regarding the trial court's lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The father argues that neither the parties nor their children continue to reside in Alabama; thus, he asserts, according to the jurisdictional instructions of the Uniform\n   Interstate Family Support Act (\"the UIFSA\"), \u00a7 30-3D-101 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, the trial court has lost exclusive continuing jurisdiction of the case. He argues that the appropriate jurisdiction is the state where he resides. According to \u00a7 30-3D-201(a)(3), Ala. Code 1975, of the UIFSA, \"[i]n a proceeding to establish or enforce a support order ..., a tribunal of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident individual\" if, among other things, \"the individual resided with the child in this state.\" The father does not dispute that he has resided with the children in Alabama or that the trial court obtained personal jurisdiction over him, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3D-201. Instead, the father argues that the trial court\n   <em>\n    lost\n   </em>\n   its continuing jurisdiction of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 30-3D-202, Ala. Code 1975, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Personal jurisdiction acquired by a tribunal of this state in a proceeding under this chapter or other law of this state relating to a support order continues as long as a tribunal of this state has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order or continuing jurisdiction to enforce its order as provided by Sections 30-3D-205, 30-3D-206, and 30-3D-211[, Ala. Code 1975].\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 30-3D-206(b), Ala. Code 1975, provides that \"[a] tribunal of this state having continuing jurisdiction over a support order may act as a responding tribunal to enforce the order.\" The father does not argue that a tribunal of another state has modified the trial court's judgments regarding child support in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 30-3D-203, Ala. Code 1975, provides, in pertinent part, that \"a tribunal of this state may serve as an initiating tribunal to forward proceedings to a tribunal of another state, and as a responding tribunal for proceedings initiated in another state or a foreign country.\" The Uniform Comment to \u00a7 30-3D-203 states, in pertinent part, that, under the UIFSA, \"a tribunal may serve as a responding tribunal even when there is no initiating tribunal,\" which, the Comment explains, \"accommodates the direct filing of a proceeding in a responding tribunal by a nonresident of the Forum, whether residing in a state or anywhere else in the world.\" Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3D-203, the trial court in the present case may serve as a responding tribunal to accommodate the mother's contempt complaint. Accordingly, the trial court has continuing jurisdiction to enforce its orders pursuant to \u00a7 30-3D-206(b) as a responding tribunal, and, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3D-202, the trial court continued to exercise personal jurisdiction over the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The father next argues on appeal that his due-process rights were violated because the mother and the trial court failed to comply with Rule 70A, Ala. R. Civ. P. Rule 70A(c) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"(1)\n   <em>\n    Initiation of Action\n   </em>\n   . A proceeding based on constructive contempt, whether criminal or civil, shall be subject to the rules of civil procedure.

He asserts that the mother failed to allege that she had provided timely requests for reimbursement and timely notice of the amounts that she claimed were owed. He fails, however, to cite any authority indicating that the mother was required to make those allegations in her complaint in order to pursue her contempt claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 28(a)(10), Ala.

Like C.D.M., he does not argue on appeal that he was not given notice of the hearing on the complaints. Indeed, he references two orders of the trial court dated May 25, 2017, and May 30, 2017, respectively, which set the date and time of the hearing on the mother's complaint and amended complaint. Thus, like in\n   <em>\n    C.D.M.\n   </em>\n   , we interpret the father's argument as one asserting that the trial court erred in failing to inform him that his failure to appear at the hearing might result in the issuance of a writ of arrest.

On July 23, 2015, the mother filed a \"motion for clarification\" in the trial court, asking the court to clarify whether the father was allowed to continue paying the mother only the remaining $500 after paying the $1,200 mortgage payment on the marital home or whether he was to pay her the full $1,700, in addition to the mortgage payment. On July 26, 2015, the trial court entered an \"order on [the mother's] motion for clarification,\" which stated, in pertinent part, that \"the issue of child support and the [father's] payment or non-payment of same, together with the amount of any child support arrears will be addressed during the final hearing.\" In its January 19, 2016, judgment, the trial court failed to specifically address the issue raised in the mother's motion to clarify, but it denied all relief not specifically granted. Notably, the mother had not asserted a claim of contempt against the father regarding his purported failure to pay the full amount of child support in her counterclaim before the entry of the trial court's January 19, 2016, judgment.

Further, the father has failed to cite any authority indicating that the denial of the mother's motion for clarification involved the same cause of action as the mother's complaint for contempt and amended complaint for contempt in the present case. Because the father's argument is not properly supported by citation to authority, we affirm the trial court's judgment as to this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    C.D.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945179\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/140/961/#p962\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945179\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/140/961/#p962\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Rule 28(a)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The father last argues on appeal that the trial court erred by awarding the mother attorney's fees in its August 10, 2017, judgment, based on his other arguments on appeal, i.e., that the mother's child-support claims were barred by res judicata and the UIFSA and that the trial court's failure to comply with Rule 70A requires reversal in this case. Having determined that none of those issues raised by the father merit reversal of the trial court's judgment, we conclude that the\n   father's argument regarding the award of attorney's fees to the mother is similarly without merit. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, Thomas, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The father also does not argue on appeal that the mother should have initiated enforcement proceedings in another state.
