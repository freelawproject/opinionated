Relator argues five assignments of error in his writ application. For the following reasons, we deny this writ application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 27, 2016, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury returned a true bill of indictment charging relator with violating La. R.S. 14:30 by committing the first degree murder of Taylor Friloux on June 29, 2016 while engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of armed robbery, aggravated kidnapping, and second degree kidnapping upon her and during the perpetration or attempted perpetration of an aggravated burglary upon a Raising Cane's Restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2018, relator filed eight motions to suppress evidence, challenging evidence seized from the search of a Mercedes automobile (DM-39)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; two searches of the Mercedes pursuant to warrants (DM-40 and -41); an Alcatel cell phone seized from the Mercedes (DM-42); a silver iPhone seized from the Raising Cane's (DM-43); a black Kyocera cell phone (DM-44); a black iPhone 5 (DM-45); and a black and silver iPhone 6S (DM-46). The State filed written responses to each motion. Relator's motions DM-39 through DM-46 were heard at suppression hearings held on February 1, March 9, and March 19, 2018, at which hearings the trial court heard the testimony of witnesses and pertinent evidence was admitted. On August 17, 2018, the parties presented arguments as to DM-39 through DM-41 (regarding the warrantless search and seizure of the Mercedes and the two subsequent search warrants). Relator and the State submitted on their pleadings as to DM-42 through DM-46 (searches of cell phones pursuant to warrants). The trial court denied DM-39 through DM-46 for reasons assigned from the bench at the hearing on this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 6, 2018, relator filed additional motions to suppress evidence seized from relator's Facebook account (DM-77); a black iPhone linked to Ariana Runner, a co-defendant (DM-78); the same black and silver iPhone 6S (DM-79); a cell phone belonging to Candace Rose (DM-80); a cell phone owned by Felix Santiago (DM-82); a phone owned by Taylor Friloux, the victim (the same phone seized from the manager's office)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DM-84); the black Kyocera cell phone (DM-85); the black iPhone 5 (DM-86); and the black Alcatel cell phone (DM-87). The State filed responses to each of these written motions to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 2, 2018, the parties argued DM-77 and submitted DM-78 through DM-87 on the pleadings. After taking the motions under advisement, on November 14, 2018, the trial court denied DM-77 through DM-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Relator filed a timely writ application in this Court. Upon review, this Court found deficiencies in the writ application, namely that it failed to contain the full transcripts of the hearings on the motions to suppress referenced in the writ application, and ordered relator to supplement the writ application with any and all relevant transcripts in an Order dated February 27, 2019. This Court further ordered relator to supplement the writ application, in accordance with Uniform Rules - Courts of Appeal, Rule 4-5(C)(8), with the State's responses to the various motions to suppress and post-hearing memoranda filed by relator. Having received the requested supplements to the writ application, this Court now considers relator's assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. ONE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial judge erred as a matter of law in finding that Det. Ricke had the right to enter the Every property and scrutinize the interior of the Mercedes for evidence after the premises had been secured and after Mr. Every had been removed from the premises (DM-39).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In this assignment, relator argues that in light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Collins v.

He argues that because Detective Ricke was within the curtilage of the home, he was required to have either probable cause to conduct the search of the Mercedes under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement or there must have been exigent circumstances present. He asserts that the Mercedes had no connection to the crime as it was located over twenty miles away from the Raising Cane's and was peered into by the police more than five hours after the incident occurred. He also argues the holding of\n   <em>\n    State v. Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9590401\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/410/1381/\">\n    410 So.2d 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1982) applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State responded that Detective Ricke was legally justified in conducting a warrantless search of the vehicle under the automobile exception as it was probable that the Mercedes contained contraband and/or under the plain view exception. It further argued that the officers had a lawful right to access the driveway, which was not within the curtilage of the home. It argued that the\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   decisions are distinguishable, and that Detective Ricke more than complied with constitutional mandates by obtaining two search warrants for the Mercedes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 5 of the Louisiana Constitution prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. If evidence is derived from an unreasonable search or seizure, the proper remedy is exclusion of the evidence from trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Aston\n   </em>\n   , 12-955 (La.

After pulling up a photo of relator, Officer Glapion drove to LaPlace where, at 5:53 a.m., he saw a black Mercedes driving away from the River Oaks house apparently being driven by relator. Because he could not see the license plate, Officer Glapion established surveillance of the house. At approximately 7:00 a.m., Officer Glapion saw the Mercedes return and pull into the driveway in front of the home's garage. Relator exited the vehicle and entered the house through a rear door on the backside of the garage. Officer Glapion called for assistance, which arrived at approximately 8:10 a.m. Relator was detained shortly thereafter without incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After assisting other officers with a protective sweep of the residence, Officer Glapion left the house and went over to the Mercedes, still parked in the driveway, to speak to officers standing nearby. He looked through the front windshield and observed a sleeve of coins on the front passenger floorboard. Officer Glapion did not enter the vehicle, but stayed on the scene until the arrival of Detective Ricke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective Ricke testified that he arrived at relator's residence around 8:53 a.m. after relator had been detained and transported. He spoke with Officer Glapion and also observed the presence of approximately ten officers from the different agencies of Kenner Police, the U.S. Marshals, and St. John the Baptist Parish in the immediate area who had secured the scene in anticipation of the issuance of search warrants. Detective Ricke looked through the front passenger window and windshield of the Mercedes and observed the roll of coins encased in wrapper that was similar to the coin wrappers he had observed near and inside of the safe at Raising Cane's. He also observed an item he described as a \"Kids Meal kind of thing\" from Raising Cane's. It was determined that the Mercedes was registered to relator's mother, who also lived at the same address. Officers did not enter the Mercedes while it was parked in the driveway. The Mercedes was then towed to the Kenner Police Department while an application for a search warrant was pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court resolved the issue of \"whether the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment permits a police officer, uninvited and without a warrant, to enter the curtilage of a home in order to search a vehicle parked therein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the property that was subject to an illegal search was a stolen motorcycle. The stolen motorcycle was parked at the defendant's girlfriend's house in a partially enclosed area at the top of the driveway and was covered by a tarp but was partially visible by investigating officers while they viewed the property from the street. An officer entered the partially enclosed portion of the driveway, lifted the tarp off the motorcycle, and photographed it. The court found that the area where the motorcycle was parked was inside a partially enclosed top portion of the driveway that adjoined the house and was within the curtilage of the home. Accordingly, the court held that \"[t]he automobile exception does not permit the warrantless entry of a home or its curtilage in order to search a vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was arrested for DWI and related traffic offenses as he parked his car in his driveway after police officers had chased him through the streets for some distance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9590401\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/410/1381/\">\n    410 So.2d at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the defendant was escorted to the patrol car, he stated he did not want anyone driving his car. Nevertheless, in accordance with alleged police policy, the officers radioed for a wrecker to tow the car. While waiting for the wrecker, one officer returned to the private property upon which the car was parked, entered the car, and inspected its interior. He discovered marijuana cigarettes on the console between the front seats and on the left floorboard and seized the cigarettes as evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9590401\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/410/1381/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court held that police had no right to re-enter the private property on which the defendant's car was parked and inspect its interior, including the glove compartment, after the defendant was in custody and removed from the scene since the search of the car was not contemporaneous with the arrest, and there was no probable cause or any circumstances to justify an exception to the warrant requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9590401\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/410/1381/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9590401\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/410/1381/\">\n    410 So.2d at 1383-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both cases cited by relator are readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The curtilage of a home is that \"area to which extends the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The driveway was open to law enforcement officers as well as any other member of the public. Therefore, even if it was a part of the curtilage of the home, this open driveway did not enjoy the same measure of Fourth Amendment protection that a home does, nor that enjoyed by the partially enclosed driveway space where the motorcycle in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   was parked covered by a tarp.

It is also important to note that unlike in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , where the officer uncovered the motorcycle, and\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , where the officers entered the vehicle during the search, no officer entered the Mercedes while it was parked in relator's driveway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Relator also argued that the Mercedes had \"no connection\" to the crime; however, the facts show that the vehicle was clearly connected to relator, who had been identified as a perpetrator of the crime within an hour of its occurrence.

In its post-hearing memorandum, and at the August 17, 2018 hearing, the State argued that the Kenner Police were within their lawful authority as they were working with the St. John the Baptist Parish police and the U.S. Marshal's Task Force. The State argued that even if there was an issue with jurisdiction, exclusion of the evidence was not an appropriate remedy, and no purpose of the exclusionary rule would be served by suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, the victim was murdered in Kenner, Louisiana, which is in Jefferson Parish, and when relator was identified shortly thereafter as a suspect, it was learned that relator lived in St. John the Baptist Parish. Officer Glapion of the Kenner Police Department and the U.S. Marshal's Task Force were sent to LaPlace to investigate. The testimony at the hearing established that this was a multi-jurisdictional investigation, and the Kenner Police Department was working with the St. John the Baptist Parish police and the U.S. Marshal's Task Force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Not all violations of statutory restrictions, such as territorial restrictions as argued by relator, are constitutional violations.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The affidavit also explained that the search was for the purpose of seeking evidence of the crime, including the knife or knives used to stab the victim, the various items of clothing known to be worn by the perpetrators of the robbery as shown by the restaurant's surveillance cameras, cell phones, DNA evidence, and any other evidence deemed to be pertinent to the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The affidavit supporting the second search warrant was substantially the same as the affidavit supporting the first search warrant, but additionally recites that the first search was unable to access the Mercedes' trunk due to security features, but that the keys had subsequently been obtained from the car's registered owner and that a second search warrant, for the car's trunk, was requested at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Upon review, we find that the facts and circumstances reflected in the affidavits were sufficient to support a reasonable belief that relator participated in the robbery, the murder of the victim, and the fair probability that evidence of the offenses may have been found in the Mercedes.

Further, upon surveillance of the known getaway car, Donald, who matched the description of a second armed perpetrator, was seen entering the Toyota Highlander.

Thus, relator argues that the search warrants were fatally flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Upon review, we find that whereas the writ application includes the motion to suppress regarding Runner's phone and the State's response thereto, relator failed to attach a copy of the affidavit in support of the search warrants for Runner's phone. The party seeking relief is responsible for filing and attaching all documents and exhibits in connection with an application for writs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uniform Rules - Courts of Appeal, Rule 4-1. We are unable to adequately review this claim without the affidavit, and hence deny this argument on the showing made. Further, we note that Detective Ricke testified at the hearing on March 9, 2018 that he interviewed Runner on July 1, 2016, during which he obtained her consent to search her cell phone where conversations between herself, Donald, and relator were found. Accordingly, this assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Rose iPhone Warrant (DM-80)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Rose iPhone belonged to Candace Rose and was searched three times pursuant to warrants. Allegedly, because \"they were good friends and were with each other in the days leading up to the robbery,\" Rose received a \"Snapchat\" message from relator, informing her that the Raising Cane's restaurant would be robbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Specifically, relator challenges the warrants on the basis that because the affiant does not provide the source of the information, the affidavit does not satisfy probable cause since the commissioner could not have assessed the \"veracity, reliability, or basis of knowledge\" of the source. He argues that the affiant's belief that the message was likely sent by relator was mere speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Relator has included with the writ application his motion to suppress the evidence seized from Rose's iPhone (DM-80) and the State's response thereto. The transcript from the March 19, 2018 hearing indicates that the affidavit for the search warrant for Rose's iPhone was admitted. However, relator has failed to attach a copy of the affidavit for this Court's review. The party seeking relief is responsible for filing and attaching all documents and exhibits in connection with an application for writs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Uniform Rules - Courts of Appeal, Rule 4-1.

Specifically, relator challenges the affidavit on the basis that it states that Santiago may have had prior knowledge of the robbery and that he had cell phone text/call contact with the suspect. Relator argues that there is no indication when Santiago had cell phone communication with relator and no identification of the source that Santiago had prior knowledge of the plans to rob the Raising Cane's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Relator has included with the writ application his motion to suppress the evidence seized from Santiago's iPhone (DM-82) and the State's response thereto. The transcript from the March 19, 2018 hearing indicates that the affidavit for the search\n   warrant for Santiago's iPhone was admitted.

FIVE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The trial judge erred as a matter of law in denying the motions to suppress evidence seized from Joshua Every's Facebook account (DM-77).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In this assignment, relator alleges, as he did below in his motion to suppress evidence, that the search warrant for his Facebook account was issued without a sufficient showing of probable cause. He argues that Detective Ricke failed to provide the dates on which certain Facebook posts were made by relator, so the issuing magistrate was unable to properly determine whether the information contained in the affidavit was stale. He also alleges that Detective Ricke failed to include the race of the murder victim or that one of the victims at the Raising Cane's was black, which would have refuted Detective Ricke's assertion that the posts showed relator's \"history of hatred toward the white race.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The State responded below to defendant's motion to suppress, arguing that relator's Facebook posts were public, and thus, he had no expectation of privacy in them. The State asserted that nonetheless, a search warrant subsequently was obtained and relator's posts showed his motive and intent to commit the robbery and murder. The State contended that relator's argument attempting to refute Detective Ricke's theory that relator's actions constituted a hate crime had no bearing on the constitutionality of the search warrant. The State alternatively argued that suppression would be inappropriate if there was any issue with the affidavit under the good faith exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   At the November 2, 2018 hearing, Detective Ricke testified that during July 2016, he viewed relator's public Facebook page and utilized its public contents to complete a search warrant affidavit. He subsequently obtained private records from relator's Facebook page via a search warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The search warrant affidavit, in addition to the details regarding relator and Donald entering the Raising Cane's armed and relator's alleged killing of the victim and the identification of relator as the perpetrator by eyewitnesses, provided the substance of the posts observed by Detective Ricke, but not the dates upon which they were posted. At the hearing, Detective Ricke acknowledged that his affidavit failed to include these dates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   An affidavit supporting a search warrant is presumed to be valid, and the defendant has the burden of proving that the representations made in the affidavit are false. That burden requires the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affidavit contains intentional misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

These facts have little bearing on the core of the probable cause showing. In addition to the information regarding relator's Facebook page, the probable cause affidavit alleged that relator and Donald entered the Raising Cane's armed, and relator had stabbed the victim, ultimately leading to her death. Detective Ricke indicated that it sought this particular search warrant to discover other information relevant to the murder, robbery, and a possible hate crime. Considering what Detective Ricke was able to observe publicly on Facebook, it was reasonable to assume that further evidence would be found on relator's Facebook account. Thus, we find that the affidavit recited sufficient facts to establish probable cause for the issuance of this search warrant.

In his writ application, however, relator notes that the affidavits are identical in all aspects relating to probable cause.
