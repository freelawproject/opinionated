He alleged the viewing of the VIN by police was an unconstitutional search because it was conducted during an unlawful warrantless intrusion into the curtilage of his home. Furthermore, even if the intrusion into the curtilage was not unlawful, the search of the vehicle was not a search incident to arrest and the automobile exception did not apply. Defendant relied on\n   <em>\n    Collins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611993\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1663/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), to support his claims. In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court was called upon to determine whether the automobile exception permitted the warrantless entry of a home or its curtilage in order to search a vehicle therein. The Supreme Court found that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State called a single witness at the hearing on Defendant's motion to suppress. Officer Joshua Hebert was employed by the Abbeville Police Department on February 1, 2017. He observed Defendant driving a maroon GMC Yukon on Charity Street. Defendant was not wearing a seat belt. Officer Hebert activated the vehicle's lights. Defendant either flagged Officer Hebert to follow him or go around him. Officer Hebert then activated the vehicle's siren and \"called in the vehicle for refusing to stop.\" Defendant stopped six or seven blocks later at his residence. Defendant pulled \"head first\" into the driveway \"in front of the front door.\" Officer Hebert pulled up behind Defendant. Defendant was placed on the ground because he refused to stop. He was then handcuffed. Backup officers subsequently arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Detective Trent Guidry ran the VIN on the Yukon, and it came back stolen from Harris County, Texas. The VIN was visible through the front windshield, and police had to stand in the driveway to see it. Defendant had been handcuffed and arrested at that time. Police did not have a\n   search warrant. Defendant's residence was depicted in Defense Exhibit 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court denied the motion, finding the case distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , as Defendant was running away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his writ application, Defendant argues police entered the curtilage of his home to search the vehicle without a warrant, and there were no exigent circumstances present that would have permitted such entry without a warrant. Defendant asserts the State attempted to justify the intrusion by claiming his failure to stop was an exigent circumstance. However, even if that were true, hot pursuit did not justify a search of his curtilage after police had already arrested him. The State presented no evidence suggesting that destruction of evidence was a concern. Moreover, the evidence was not in plain view. Defendant contends the search in this case is identical to that in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We now discuss the facts of\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   During the investigation of two traffic incidents involving an orange and black motorcycle with an extended frame, Officer David Rhodes learned that the motorcycle was probably stolen and in Collins' possession. Officer Rhodes discovered photographs on Collins' Facebook profile of an orange and black motorcycle parked in the driveway of a house, drove to the house, and parked on the street. From there, he could see what appeared to be the motorcycle under a white tarp parked in the same location as the motorcycle in the photograph. Without a search warrant, Office Rhodes walked to the top of the driveway, removed the tarp, confirmed that the motorcycle was stolen by running the license plate and vehicle identification numbers, took a photograph of the uncovered motorcycle, replaced the tarp, and returned to his car to wait for Collins. When Collins returned, Officer Rhodes arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court discussed the meaning of curtilage as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [T]the Fourth Amendment's protection of curtilage has long been black letter law. \"[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first among equals.\"\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

In addition, it is unreasonable to have an expectation of privacy in an object required by law to be located in a place ordinarily in plain view from the exterior of the automobile. The VIN's mandated visibility makes it more similar to the exterior of the car than to the trunk or glove compartment. The exterior of a car, of course, is thrust into the public eye, and thus to examine it does not constitute a \"search.\" See\n   <em>\n    Cardwell v.
