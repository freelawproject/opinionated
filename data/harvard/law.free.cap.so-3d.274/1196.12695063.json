Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455565\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/751/47/#p48\">\n    751 So.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48 (Fla. 1999). Having carefully considered the response and finding it fails to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed, we conclude that he is abusing the judicial process and should be barred from further pro se filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Therefore, in order to conserve judicial resources, Appellant is prohibited from filing with this Court any further pro se filings concerning the above referenced case. The Clerk of this Court is directed not to accept any further pro se filings concerning the referenced case. Any future filings regarding the referenced case will be summarily rejected by the Clerk, unless filed by a member in good standing of The Florida Bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Isley v.
