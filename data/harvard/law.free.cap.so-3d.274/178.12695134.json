With the exception of Defendant's conviction for possession of a stolen firearm, which we reverse, we affirm Defendant's other convictions, amend one of Defendant's sentences, and remand this matter with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 6, 2015, at 5:00 a.m., Andrew Davis (\"Davis\"), a Frito-Lay route salesman, stopped at the Save More convenience store in Alexandria, Louisiana. After he loaded empty boxes in the back of his truck, an individual wearing a sweatshirt with a hood approached him. The individual pointed a handgun at Davis and demanded his workbag that contained a check made out to Frito-Lay, cell phones, and a scanner. Also, the individual demanded Davis's wallet and telephone. When he threw his phone to the hooded individual, Davis ran into the convenience store and called the police. Later, Davis would identify Defendant in court as the individual who robbed him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After speaking with police, Davis returned to work. Between 7:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., Davis and his boss drove his boss's vehicle to the area of the robbery to look for Davis's workbag should it have been discarded. As they drove about the area, they saw a few guys staring at them; some were standing on the street and others were standing under a nearby carport. Suddenly, Davis and his boss were fired upon; three bullets struck the passenger door and one struck the outside, passenger mirror. At that point, Davis and his boss fled the area, drove to Damico's Bingo Hall, and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to Davis, several witnesses, whose testimony will be elaborated upon later, testified as to Defendant's identity, including Jeraldine Hampton (\"Hampton\"), an eyewitness to the shooting; and Delric Carpenter (\"Carpenter\"), an area resident. The jury was also presented with forensic evidence that matched a bullet from the truck with a handgun discarded at Defendant's residence near Davis's cellphone and product scanner. They also heard jailhouse telephone evidence where Defendant admitted the police recovered \"my gun, my cell phone, and a check out my safe.\" The jury also viewed the handgun recovered from the top of Defendant's carport and the check made out to Frito-Lay that was found in Defendant's home safe. Fingerprint evidence was also presented that demonstrated Defendant was a prior- convicted felon at the time of these offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After a multi-day jury trial, Defendant was convicted on all charges enumerated above that were brought against him in the bill of information. After receiving a presentence investigative report, the trial court sentenced Defendant to forty years at hard labor for armed robbery; ten years at hard labor for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon; twenty years at hard labor for each conviction for attempted second degree murder; ten years at hard labor for intimidating a witness; and one year at hard labor for illegal possession of a stolen firearm. The court imposed all the sentences concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant timely appealed, presenting four assignments of error argued by court-appointed counsel, as well as one pro se assignment of error. They are as follows: (1) the jury erred in returning a verdict of guilty of illegal possession of a stolen firearm; (2) the convictions were based on circumstantial evidence that failed to establish Defendant's identity beyond a reasonable doubt, and the jury was unduly influenced by an invalid charge, namely the illegal possession of a stolen firearm;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) the trial court erred in denying Defendant's challenges for cause regarding prospective jurors Katrina McCain (\"McCain\") and John Parker (\"Parker\"), and jurors James Alwell (\"Alwell\") and Kenneth Taylor (\"Taylor\"); (4) the trial court erred in granting the State's challenges for cause regarding prospective jurors Ben Rosier (\"Rosier\") and Jonathan Richards (\"Richards\"); and (5) the trial court erred in allowing Defendant to proceed to trial in leg shackles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    ERRORS PATENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In compliance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, we review all criminal appeals for errors patent on the face of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Oliveaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9644569\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/312/337/\">\n    312 So.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.1975). After carefully reviewing the record, we find one error patent, as well as court minutes of sentencing that require correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We first note the trial court sentenced Defendant to serve ten years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for intimidating a witness. Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:129.1, the applicable sentencing statute, does not authorize a restriction of benefits. Accordingly, Defendant's sentence is illegally excessive. Therefore, we amend Defendant's sentence for intimidating a witness to delete the denial of benefits and remand to the trial court with instructions to amend the court minutes accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Finally, our review of the sentencing transcript shows the trial court imposed a $ 1,000.00 fine as required by La.R.S. 14:95.1(B) for Defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Notwithstanding, the court minutes fail to reflect the imposition of this fine. \"It is well established that where there is a conflict between the minutes and the transcript, the transcript shall prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7485998\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/626/501/#p503\">\n    626 So.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (La.App. 3 Cir. 1993),\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 93-3125 (La. 2/3/95),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7455463,7455603,7455549,7455503\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/649/400/\">\n    649 So.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we direct the trial court to correct the sentencing minutes to include the $ 1,000.00 fine that was imposed for Defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is a common thread between the first two assignments of error, namely, the sufficiency of the evidence regarding Defendant's conviction for the illegal possession of a stolen firearm and the sufficiency of the evidence as to all of Defendant's convictions. In the first assignment of error, Defendant contends the State failed to present sufficient evidence to support his conviction for the illegal possession of a stolen firearm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the second assignment of error, Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove any of the charged offenses and particularly asserts\n   that the State failed to establish his identity beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we will address those two assignments of error first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. Kennerson\n   </em>\n   , 96-1518, p. 5 (La.App. 3 Cir. 5/7/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12019054\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/695/1367/#p1371\">\n    695 So.2d 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1371, we articulated the well-established analysis for such claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is raised on appeal, the critical inquiry of the reviewing court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

It is the role of the fact finder to weigh the respective credibility of the witnesses, and therefore, the appellate court should not second guess the credibility determinations of the triers of fact beyond the sufficiency evaluations under the\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

In order for this Court to affirm a conviction, however, the record must reflect that the state has satisfied its burden of proving the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Illegal Possession of a Stolen Firearm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Louisiana Revised Statutes 14:69.1(A)(1) provides: \"Illegal possession of stolen firearms is the intentional possessing, procuring, receiving, or concealing of a firearm which has been the subject of any form of misappropriation.\" In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the State determined that the handgun was stolen from James Smith and that robbery was not reported, the evidence is void of any proof that Defendant was involved with the theft or that he knew or should have known the handgun was stolen. Therefore, we reverse Defendant's conviction for illegal possession of a stolen firearm and vacate the sentence imposed for that conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Identity Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his pro se assignment of error, Defendant first contends the State failed to establish his identity beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jurisprudence on this area of the law is well established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, an appellate court in Louisiana is controlled by the standard enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Davis described the events of the robbery, including that Defendant's face was not covered. He also identified Defendant in open court. The evidence further showed that a check made out to Frito-Lay taken during the robbery was found in Defendant's home safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Regarding the attempted murder convictions, Davis testified that when he and his supervisor drove through the neighborhood near the crime scene to see if they could find Davis's stolen workbag, someone shot at them, striking the truck three times. Although Davis did not see the shooter, area resident Carpenter testified that Defendant admitted to him both the shooting and the earlier robbery. Also, the jury heard a prior recorded statement by another area resident, Hampton, that she had seen Defendant firing a handgun, although she was not sure what his target was.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, a bullet recovered from the truck matched a handgun that was discarded at Defendant's residence near Davis's cellphone and product scanner. Also, in a telephone call from the jail, Defendant admitted the police had recovered \"my gun, my cell phone, and a check out my safe.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Concerning Defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, not only does some of the evidence already mentioned put a weapon in Defendant's hand, fingerprint evidence demonstrated that at the time of the offenses, he was a prior-convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The remaining conviction, intimidating a witness, was supported by testimony that Defendant contacted associates via the jail phone line, telling them to harm or frighten witnesses in the case. In his testimony, even though Defendant denied directly threatening Hampton, he admitted he made various threatening statements, but claimed he was merely angry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , we find, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, that the State proved the elements of each crime charged, including Defendant's identity, beyond a reasonable doubt. As discussed above, the record is replete with evidence, including direct evidence, that Defendant was the person who committed these crimes. Therefore, we find no merit to this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   However, before leaving this discussion, we address Defendant's further assertion that his conviction for possession\n   of a stolen weapon, now reversed and vacated, unduly influenced the jury. In all aspects, save our reversal of Defendant's conviction for possession of a stolen weapon, the State convicted Defendant for each of the other crimes with evidence, direct and circumstantial, that proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant perpetrated those crimes. Therefore, we find no merit to Defendant's contention that his conviction for one of the crimes for which he was charged tainted the jury's convictions on all the remaining crimes.

His contention is twofold: first, McCain allegedly said if Defendant did not testify, she would likely vote guilty; second, she has relatives involved in law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant's argument to the trial court and before us is that McCain said Defendant would be guilty if he would not testify. Our review of the record shows this question first arose when the State asked the prospective jurors en masse if they would be biased against Defendant if he chose not to testify. Our review of the record indicates none of the jury venire responded positively to that question. Thus, to this extent we find no support for Defendant's first contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Later, defense counsel specifically asked McCain about Defendant's right not to testify. She responded, \"I just feel like why wouldn't he.... Like if, he's not, if he feels like he's not guilty why wouldn't he go against it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asked nothing further. Nonetheless, in argument to the trial court, defense counsel, extrapolating from McCain's limited statement, urged the trial court to grant his cause challenge because McCain \"[would] hold that against him if he didn't testify.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When this cause challenge was made, the State interjected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   All he asked her was a simple question, uh, and she indicated that she may have some issue with that. When I questioned her and the rest of the panel, I went over that thoroughly. None of them had any issue if he did not testify. Matter of fact, ... I had to go over that over and over again. They were all satisfied with that. She did not say that to [defense counsel]. [Defense counsel] spent about five seconds with her before this guy over here who had the situation\n   with his daughter in Bossier Parish began to speak, and then [defense counsel] diverted his attention to him, never went back to her to follow up on that but I did, I had earlier.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In its ruling on this cause challenge, the trial court recognized McCain's hesitancy. Nevertheless, the trial court stated, \"[I]t was not the impression of the Court ... she would hold it against [Defendant], if he did not testify. [The State] is correct that ... she indicated ... during his voir dire that she understoood, that ... he did not have to testify.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Dotson\n   </em>\n   admonishes trial courts to avoid seizing upon snippets of testimony in the evaluation of cause challenges.\n   <em>\n    Dotson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368443\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/234/34/#p45\">\n    234 So.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the court is directed to examine the entire voir dire examination. In the present case, the trial court performed its function as\n   <em>\n    Dotson\n   </em>\n   admonished-it reviewed the voir dire examination as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As a reviewing court,\n   <em>\n    Dotson\n   </em>\n   cautions us to give great deference to the trial court's determination on challenges for cause because that resolution is based upon the trial court's personal observation during the entire voir dire examination. Abiding by that instruction in the present case, we cannot say the trial court exercised that discretion in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner to prejudice Defendant. Thus, we find no support for Defendant's assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant next draws our attention to another basis for his cause challenge, namely, McCain's association with law enforcement. During voir dire, McCain told the court that her husband and father-in-law are employees of the corrections system; her husband is a counselor at the Pollock Prison, and her father-in-law is a warden at the Cottonport Prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This court has long recognized that relationships to members of law enforcement do not, by themselves, support challenges for cause.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record shows McCain was forthright about her familial relationship with members of law enforcement. Despite that, McCain unambiguously stated when questioned by both Defendant and the State that these relationships in no way would influence her, and she would be fair and impartial if selected. After carefully considering both aspects of Defendant's argument, we find the trial court did not err when it refused Defendant's cause challenge to McCain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    Prospective juror, Parker\n   </strong>\n   : Defendant next contends the trial court erred when it denied his challenge for cause as to Parker. He argues that Parker, a retired Alexandria Police Department employee and part-time Alexandria crime prevention officer, should have been successfully challenged for cause. Defendant's argument is threefold: (1) Parker knew every police officer on the State's witness list; (2) he is employed as a crime prevention officer; and (3) his son is a Louisiana State Trooper, his nephew is a Rapides Parish jailer, his brother is a narcotics' officer with the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office, and his father was a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant's challenge for cause involves two lines of analysis, one that involves Parker as an actively employed law enforcement officer and another that involves Parker as one who has familial connections to law enforcement. We will address these separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

If a law enforcement officer testifies under oath during voir dire that he can be a fair and impartial juror, the trial judge has the discretion to determine whether that officer is speaking the truth. The disqualification of all law enforcement officers from service on a jury disregards whether or not the judge, whose rulings on challenges for cause are given great deference in all other instances, accepts the officer as a fair and impartial juror. We find that such a disqualification amounts to an irrebuttable presumption of untrustworthiness in law enforcement officers and is an affront to police officers in this state.

Parker made it abundantly clear that despite his employment, he would be fair and impartial and would not give law enforcement testimony any greater weight. Even after Defendant further pressed Parker on the question, he reiterated he would \"give fair consideration to both sides.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As regards Parker's familial relationships with law enforcement officers, we recognized earlier in this opinion that this court has long recognized that relationships to members of law enforcement do not, by themselves, support challenges for cause.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7629199\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/447/495/\">\n    447 So.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   When we review Parker's forthright testimony during voir dire, we find no basis to justify a cause challenge as to him either as a law enforcement officer or his familial relationships with law enforcement officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we find no merit to Defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss Parker for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror, Taylor\n   </strong>\n   : Defendant contends that the trial court erred when it failed to grant his challenge for cause as it related to Taylor. Defendant argued that Taylor, the director of a religious charitable organization, would be unable to fully concentrate on the trial because he had a paid, non-refundable three-night stay in Dallas that began the following Sunday night.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As a matter of background, Defendant's jury was selected on June 5-6, 2018, a Tuesday and Wednesday. On June 7, 2018, a Thursday, the jury began hearing evidence. On June 8, 2018, a Friday, the jury found Defendant guilty as charged on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant challenged Taylor for cause on the speculative ground that he\n   would be unable to concentrate on the trial. Notwithstanding, our review of the record shows no instance where Taylor expressed that he would not be able to concentrate on the trial; rather, he simply brought his future schedule to the trial court's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Taylor was a seasoned juror, having served on multiple juries, two involving criminal trials. Defendant has made no showing that Taylor would not have been impartial or that he was prejudiced in any way by Taylor's inclusion as a juror. Under these facts, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner, resulting in prejudice to the accused. Therefore, we find no merit to Defendant's argument that the trial court should have excused Taylor for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    Juror, Alwell:\n   </strong>\n   The thrust of Defendant's argument is that Alwell's father was a chip salesman, as was the victim of the crime for which Defendant was on trial, and his father was robbed.

Although Alwell expressed a possibility that his familial history would make it difficult for him to sit as a juror, the burden was on Defendant to follow-up with questions to reasonably show that Alwell could not have been fair and that he could not have rendered an impartial verdict according to the law and the evidence. This he did not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we find Defendant's assignment of error, urging this court to reverse the trial court's multiple denials of the challenges for cause, lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Trial Court's Grant of State's Challenges for Cause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant next contends the trial court erred when it granted the State's cause challenges as it related to prospective jurors Rosier and Richards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 800(B) provides, \"The erroneous allowance to the state of a challenge for cause does not afford the defendant a ground for complaint, unless the effect of such ruling is the exercise by the state of more peremptory challenges than it is entitled to by law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Based upon La.Code Crim.P. art. 800(B), a defendant does not have grounds to complain about the granting of the State's challenge for cause, unless the effect of the ruling is to allow the State to exercise more peremptory challenges than the law allows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the record does not have a description of the leg restraints, the trial court made two observations when it addressed Defendant's motion for a new trial. First, the trial court noted for the record that the leg restraints were under Defendant's clothes. Second, the trial court explained that Defendant did not limp when he approached and left the witness stand during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The mere fact that a defendant is shackled or garbed in the presence of the jury does not alone constitute a basis for reversal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Considering the trial court's first-hand observation of Defendant at trial, there is nothing in the record which shows the use of leg restraints prejudicially affected Defendant or warranted a reversal of his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Therefore, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we reverse Defendant's jury conviction for illegal possession of a stolen firearm and vacate the sentence imposed for that conviction. In all other respects, we affirm Defendant's convictions. We further amend Defendant's sentence for intimidating a witness to delete the denial of benefits and remand to the trial court with instruction to amend the court minutes accordingly. Lastly, we remand this case to the trial court to correct the sentencing minutes to include the $ 1,000.00 fine was imposed for Defendant's\n   conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    CONVICTION REVERSED, IN PART, AND THAT SENTENCE VACATED; OTHER CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED; SENTENCE AMENDED, IN PART; AND CASE REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Defendant urges this assignment of error pro se.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Although the State concedes that this conviction should be reversed for insufficient evidence, we have chosen to discuss this assignment of error to more fully address the second aspect of these assignments of error, the latter having been raised pro se.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendant does not contest in his pro se brief that the crimes occurred.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    At trial, Hampton stated she did not remember the shooting incident.
