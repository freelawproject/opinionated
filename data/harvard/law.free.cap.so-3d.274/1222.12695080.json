Her primary contention on appeal is that the trial court erred in denying her motion to suppress evidence obtained from a personal flash drive plugged into her work computer. Following our review of the record, and the issues raised on appeal, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 2013, Edwards was arrested and charged with two counts of official misconduct after an investigation revealed she had falsified police records in an apparent attempt to get her husband, Clyde Edwards (Clyde), fired from his job at a sports apparel and footwear store. Clyde's\n   boss, Jose Raij, contacted police after he received a phone call from someone identifying herself as Miami-Dade police detective Diann Mich. The caller told Raij that Clyde should be fired because he was being investigated by police, and that there were police reports regarding the investigation. Raij asked to see a copy of the police reports and, at 4:09 p.m. on July 8, 2013, Raij received the following email:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   Mr. Raij, attached are two reports I am able to release to you at this time. As we discussed, please do not discuss the open case with the suspect. I will forward you the complete file in a couple of days. Thank you, Diann\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Two police reports were attached to the email, indicating that Clyde was being investigated for selling counterfeit sports shoes. However, further investigation by Raij and Miami-Dade Police revealed that the two police reports had been falsified, and were emailed to Raij from a copy machine located on the second floor of the Miami-Dade County Police Department Intracoastal District Station, where Edwards worked. The evidence against Edwards included the testimony of three fellow police officers, who testified that they saw Edwards near that copy machine on the second floor of the police department on July 8 around 4 p.m., and the contents of a USB flash drive (the \"flash drive\") that was seized from Edwards' work computer prior to her arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Police determined that the falsified records were placed on the flash drive on July 8, 2013 between 3:47 p.m. and 4:01 p.m.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    Edwards' defense was that she could not have created and sent the falsified police reports because she was not at the police department at the time the reports were emailed to Raij, having left work early that day not feeling well. She claimed that she had an office visit with her therapist from 2 to 3 p.m., and thereafter, had lunch and picked up her daughter from daycare at 4:20 p.m.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-12\">\n    Prior to trial, Edwards moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the flash drive attached to her work computer at the time it was seized, asserting that the flash drive was her personal property, and was thus illegally seized at the time her work computer was legally seized. After an evidentiary hearing, the court denied Edwards' motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the flash drive, determining she had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the flash drive and its contents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-13\">\n    Following trial, a jury convicted Edwards of both counts of official misconduct, and she was thereafter sentenced to probation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    When reviewing a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress, the appellate court \"affords a presumption of correctness to a trial court's findings of fact but reviews de novo the mixed questions of law and fact that arise in the application of the historical facts to the protections of the Fourth Amendment.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    <em>\n     Wyche v.

A legitimate expectation of privacy consists of both a subjective expectation and an objectively reasonable expectation, as determined by societal standards. The reasonableness of an expectation of privacy in a particular place or item depends on context. Specifically, the reasonableness of an employee's expectation of privacy in his or her office or the items contained therein depends on the \"operational realities\" of the workplace, and not on legal possession or ownership. The likelihood that a person has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in an office setting is increased where the area or item searched is \"reserved for [the defendant's] exclusive personal use.\" Other factors that have been considered in determining the legitimacy of an expectation of privacy in an item seized from an office include the employee's relationship to the item, whether the item was in the employee's immediate control when it was seized, and whether the employee took actions to maintain a sense of privacy in the item. Many times, an employee may have a legitimate expectation of privacy in his or her personal office and in personal items stored in a desk or file cabinet.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    <em>\n     Kelly v.

The armory is kept locked at all times, but several administrative officers had keys to the office, and one master key is hidden somewhere in the department in case officers get locked out. At all relevant times, Edwards and her co-worker, Officer Michnowicz, both had desks and computers in the armory.

Not everything that passes through the confines of the business address can be considered part of the workplace context, however. An employee may bring closed luggage to the office prior to leaving on a trip, or a handbag or briefcase each workday. While whatever expectation of privacy the employee has in the existence and the outward appearance of the luggage is affected by its presence in the workplace, the employee's expectation of privacy in the\n    <em>\n     contents\n    </em>\n    of the luggage is not affected in the same way. The appropriate standard for a workplace search does not necessarily apply to a piece of closed personal luggage, a handbag or a briefcase that happens to be within the employer's business address.

Barrows conducted all of his city work on his personal computer, and he did not install a password or attempt to exclude anyone from using it, rather leaving it running at all times on his shared desk at the office. When a city employee attempted to troubleshoot a problem with the office computer, he went on Barrows' personal computer, while Barrows was absent, and discovered child pornography. When this was reported to the sheriff, Barrows' computer was seized. The trial court denied Barrows' motion to suppress the files found on his computer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The appellate court affirmed, finding that Barrows had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the personal computer. Although the court recognized that \"private ownership is an important factor telling in favor of Fourth Amendment protection, ... the significance of personal ownership is particularly weakened when the item in question is being used for business purposes.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869278\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1246/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869278\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1246/\">\n     at 1248\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Furthermore, the court held that even more important \"is Mr. Barrows's failure to password protect his computer, turn it off, or taken any other steps to prevent third-party use. ... Given these facts, we are hard-pressed to conclude that Mr. Barrows harbored a subjective expectation of privacy. He certainly did not possess a reasonable one.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1246/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869278\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/1246/\">\n     at 1248-49\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
