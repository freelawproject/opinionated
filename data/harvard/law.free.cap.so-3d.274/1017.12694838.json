For the reasons that follow, this Court reverses the circuit court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Section 13A-6-81(a) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"A person commits the crime of a school employee engaging in a sex act with a student under the age of 19 years if he or she is a school employee and engages in sexual intercourse as defined by Section 13A-6-60(1) or deviant sexual intercourse as defined by 13A-6-60(2) with a student, regardless of whether the student is male or female.

(C. 92-102, 142-56.) Specifically, Solomon and Witt asserted that, as applied to them, \u00a7 13A-6-81 is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    539 U.S. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), and the Due Process Clause because it \"criminalizes consensual sexual activity conducted in private.\" (C. 95.) Solomon and Witt argued that the statute is overbroad and unconstitutional. They asserted that the State has no legitimate interest in regulating consensual sexual acts. They further argued that \u00a7 13A-6-81 \"violates Equal Protection in that it criminalizes a personal relationship between two consenting parties that is not criminalized between other similarly situated parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (C. 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 4, 2017, the circuit court held a hearing on Solomon's and Witt's motions to declare \u00a7 13A-6-81 unconstitutional. At the hearing, Witt argued \"that the statute is extremely overbroad to the point that it's unconstitutional.\" (R. 4.) Witt asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The statute does not specify a teacher/student relationship. It simply states student and school employee, which would make the statute apply to anybody across the board from the top all the way down to the very lowest janitor or groundskeeper cutting the grass.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (R. 4-5.) Witt argued that \u00a7 13A-6-81 fails to restrict its application to school employees\n   who have some position of authority over the student; thus, she \"can ... come up with just dozens upon dozens of scenarios which might make this apply, which obviously is an absurd application of this.\" (R. 6.) Witt then argued that \"[b]ecause this is so overbroad, Your Honor, the statute is just by its very nature unconstitutional.\" (R. 8.) Witt also asserted that \u00a7 13A-6-81 is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   because it regulates morality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In response, the State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The people of Alabama have spoken through their elected representatives that some people cannot consent to sex, even though they may be otherwise of legal age with certain classes of individuals. The teacher -- the school employee/student sex prohibition is not the only such statute. For example, Alabama Code \u00a7 14-11-31 makes it unlawful for jailers or correctional officers or probation officers to have sex with people under their care and supervision. Consent is not an issue. And similarly we have \u00a7 13A-13-3, incest, consent is not a defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The reason for this if you go back and take a good -- one of the reasons for these prohibitions is to prevent victimization of persons who have no real ability to refuse sexual advantages from someone who is in a position of authority and power over them. That person has a duty to provide care and supervision and the victim, and we're talking victims here, is expected to obey those people without question. And, indeed, in school context the victim is expected to look up to that individual as a role model. Janitors can turn you in as a student. We expect the student to obey any school official when it comes to obeying school rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Now, the Alabama Code requires that with very few exceptions every child between 6 and 17 has to attend school. They're not there necessarily by choice. In society in general and parents in particular must be confident when they send their sons and daughters to school every fall and they meet a new teacher the teacher is not replenishing their dating pool.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Now, the Defendant's reply is\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   , but\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   specifically stated that its holding did not apply to minors. The present case does not involve minors. Verbatim quote, 'In Alabama we classify persons as children at different ages for different purposes': the age you can drive, the age you can drive unrestricted, the age you vote, purchase cigarettes, purchase alcohol, and, yes, the age at which you can have sex with school personnel. Those distinctions have a rational purpose, and in the case of the teacher's right to have sex with 16 to 19 year olds must be subordinate to the social necessities of running a school system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Lawrence v. Texas\n   </em>\n   talks about people, not minors. We've established that\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   does not apply to minors, and it also talks about\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   does not involve persons who might be -- who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused. Everybody has that special teacher in their background who helped them make serious life decisions that have followed them into adulthood. We must be confident that our teachers are nurturing our students, not victimizing them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Now, if we allow such dating then you're really talking about you have break-ups, you have jealousy, you have potential angry parents who may or may not get violent. Students have to be on constant guard because they don't know\n   when a teacher is singling them out for specialized treatment or school personnel is singling them out for special treatment, that they're not being groomed for sexual activity as opposed to being educated. And it also gives the teachers and school personnel a safe harbor to reject a student advances without crushing the student's ego. These are all very reasonable and rational purposes for a statute that forbids school employees from having sex with teachers or other school personnel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Now, overbreadth is a facial challenge and the burden is on the Defendant to show the State that that state statute is invalid in all applications. And to do that at the very least they would have to show at trial and that would be necessary to go all the way to trial, that portion of it, in order to determine whether or not this is the behavior that the legislature intended to address and no farther.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Yes, you can create hypotheticals wherein you can make virtually any law appear overbr[oad]. It's a magician's trick. For example, a pediatrician conducting a routine physical examination could theoretically be charged with violating a child molestation statute. A hypothetical could be created to make a very plain and constitutional statute appear otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"They suggest that the sixteen-year-old student can consent to sex with a school employee. That's not so. We've demonstrated the statute says you can't consent. Yes, they can have sex with other adults, but the interaction with other adults is generally not in an environment where they're expected to be, to persons they are expected to trust, and persons that are expected to obey.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"All students are vulnerable to persons with power and influence in some way, shape, or form. It's important for us to remember the function of a school. The reason we entrust school employees with our children and we must have some confidence that those employees will act in a responsible manner, and it's not unreasonable to criminalize what is essentially the rape of a nonconsenting individual.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (R. 11-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On August 8, 2017, the circuit court entered the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"The cause comes before the Court on the motions for the Court to hold Ala. Code [1975] \u00a7 13A-6-81(a) [,] unconstitutional filed by the Defendant[s] [Solomon and Witt]. The State filed ... response[s] to the motion[s] and the parties appeared before the Court for a hearing on the motion[s] on April 4, 2017. Upon consideration of the motions, the arguments of counsel, the record in each case, and the relevant legal authorities, it is hereby ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"1. These cases are before the Court strictly on the allegation in the indictments, no testimony or evidence was taken at the hearing. The indictments make allegations that are identical in all respects excepting the parties to each charge: '...[the Defendant,] a school employee, did engage in a sex act or devia[nt] sexual intercourse with [the victim,] a student under the age of 19 years, in violation of Section 13A-6-81 of the Code of Alabama ....' That is the complete allegation. Accordingly, the Court cannot determine (1) whether the parties were consenting adults (2) whether the school employees were in any position\n   of authority, in fact, over the students (3) whether the school employees, in fact, abused any position of authority they had to coerce, groom, or otherwise obtain the illegitimate consent of the alleged victims. Under Alabama law, students who have reached the age of 16 have the capacity to consent to sex unless there is some circumstance that removes them from the pool of adults with [that] capacity and places them in a situation where they might not easily refuse consent. It is this Court's finding that the law grants these students the capacity to consent until and unless there is some showing that authority was used to obtain illegitimate or coerced consent. If no such position of authority is alleged, the Defendant must be permitted to show consent as a defense to the crime alleged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"2.

In\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of the United States held that any 'legitimate state interest' advanced by legislation must 'justify its intrusion into the personal and private life of [individual adults engaging in consensual, non-commercial sex]' and that the interest advanced by the State of Texas in that case did not so justify the intrusion, violating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   opinion specifically called out that the holding would be more difficult to apply in situations where ... both parties were not clearly adults or where consent could not be easily refused. However, it would be incorrect to confuse difficulty in applying with a lack of application.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"3. In Alabama, 'anyone 16 years of age is technically not a \"child,\" but is one capable of consenting to sexual intercourse.'\n   <em>\n    Parks v.

Crim. App. 1990). The\n   <em>\n    Parks\n   </em>\n   opinion removes 16-year-old to 18-year-old persons from 'child' for purposes of consent to sex, but it is unclear whether it casts these students as 'clearly adults' for purposes of\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   . What is clear from\n   <em>\n    Parks\n   </em>\n   is that the State of Alabama has established that 16-year-old persons are fully 'capable of consenting to sexual intercourse.' Accordingly, the Court is satisfied that, as a matter of law, every act covered by the statute at issue is one in which both parties have the capacity to consent, just as any person who was clearly an adult.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"4. The Court recognizes that the State of Alabama has a legitimate purpose in protecting the people of Alabama from those who would use positions of authority (Teacher, Wardens, Clergy, Psychologists) to overwhelm those over whom they hold such authority (Student, Prisoners, Congregants, Patients) and thereby obtain coerced or illegitimate consent to sexual activity as well as from school environments\n   where children or young adults are groomed or coerced into exploitive or abusive conduct. The statute at hand embeds an irrebuttable presumption that any sexual encounter between an employee of any school and any student in the State (without qualification as to class, school, or school system) is conclusively the result of misuse of authority. The law takes away the right of the employee to assert a defense that legal consent was freely and legitimately given -- abrogating the student's capacity to consent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"5.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Kansas legislature implicitly recognized the disparity of power inherent in a teacher/student relationship and enacted legislation prohibiting sex between teachers or other school employees with position of authority when the student was enrolled at the school where the offender was employed. The one key distinction separates the Kansas statute from Alabama's law. The Alabama statute has no requirement that the school employee had any position of influence or authority. The Alabama statute includes school employees 'of any kind' without regard to school or system. In each of the cases cited by the State where similar statutes were at issue, the statute was expressly limited in scope to students who were in the same school or, at a minimum, the same school system:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Paschal v.
