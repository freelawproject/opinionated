In no case shall a petition alleging ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on direct review be filed more than 4 years after the judgment and sentence become final on direct review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Torres filed the instant habeas corpus petition on February 27, 2019, more than eight years after his judgment and sentence became final, we dismiss the petition as procedurally barred under rule 9.141(d)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.
