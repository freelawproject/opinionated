Saunders, and Phyllis M. Keaty, Judges.\n </judges>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   SAUNDERS, Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On October 24, 2017, Defendant, Edwin Paul Frinks, was charged by bill of information with the attempted second-degree murder of Travis Darnell James, Jr., in violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1. On June 20, 2018, an eleven-to-one jury found Defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted manslaughter, in violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and 14:31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 23, 2018, the trial court denied a \"Motion for New Trial\" filed by defense counsel which alleged the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence and arguing the trial court's rulings allowing two witnesses, Mark O'Brien and Wendy Warsham,\n   to testify as to what the victim, who also testified, told them constituted prejudicial error. Defendant waived sentencing delays and was sentenced to nine years at hard labor with credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 26, 2018, a \"Motion to Reconsider Sentence\" was filed with the trial court, stating only that Defendant's sentence \"was excessive.\" That motion was denied without reasons on July 31, 2018. Defendant now appeals his conviction and sentence, assigning numerous errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following opening statements, the State called Detective Mark Brady of the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office. Detective Brady testified he photographed the area where law enforcement first encountered the victim, Travis James, on Interstate 49. He then went to St. Landry Parish and took photographs of Defendant and his vehicle, noting he saw no evidence of injuries to Defendant despite his claims he was hit in the back of the head. Detective Brady did note Defendant had scratches on his arms but stated they did not appear to be fresh injuries. He also went to the hospital and photographed the victim, whom he noted had road rash all over him and a serious stab wound to the chest that was too bandaged to photograph. Detective Brady noted a knife handle was recovered from the passenger-side door panel of Defendant's car and while it had blood on it, there was no blade. He suggested the knife handle \"didn't have enough blood on it\" to indicate it had been used to stab the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On cross-examination, Detective Brady acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of how the stab wounds to the victim occurred or what weapon caused them. Detective Brady testified he did not believe this case \"appear[ed] to be self-defense[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State then called Dr. Samantha Zeringue, a trauma surgeon at Rapides Regional Medical Center. Dr. Zeringue testified that she was on call on July 30, 2017, when Travis James was brought into the emergency room (\"ER\"). She testified that he came in as a level two trauma, meaning he was severely injured but was stable, but then became a level one trauma patient when his blood pressure dropped after arrival. Dr. Zeringue noted she was informed she had a patient who had been thrown from a car with multiple stab wounds. She also noted Mr. James had a collapsed lung and affected mentation and that the ER physician had already placed a chest tube to allow Mr. James's lung to re-inflate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Zeringue noted Mr. James's face, arms, and back had a lot of \"road rash,\" abrasions to the skin that are dressed and treated like burns. She testified Mr. James spent eight days in the hospital, seven of which he had a chest tube while his lung recovered from a deep laceration. Dr. Zeringue testified Mr. James had a urine drug test administered when he was admitted and testified positive for opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, and marijuana. She noted, however, that he had likely been given opiate pain medication in the ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State then called the victim, Mr. Travis Darnell James, Jr. Noting he was currently incarcerated following a guilty plea to illegal possession of a firearm, Mr. James acknowledged prior arrests for simple burglary, two possessions of CDS II, \"unauthorized use,\" refusal to stop for an officer, criminal trespass, and disturbing the peace. Mr. James stated he remembered being in Rapides General \"[a] little bit.\" However, he stated he did not remember being stabbed or going to the hospital. Mr. James remembered having road rash and multiple stab wounds but did not remember how he received any of\n   them. He stated he did not remember anything from July 29 or July 30, 2017. When asked to explain what was going on with him, Mr. James stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Whoever did it, I forgave them. I don't think it's going to do nothing for me or nobody else if they doing time just like me. Put it in God's hands. That's what it is. I don't remember. Can't nothing make me. It's not going to help me at all. Whoever goes to jail for it, it's not going to do nothing for nobody. I'm already in jail. That can't be changed. Jail is no place for nobody. God forgives. I believe in second chances regardless of whatever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although he acknowledged that he has previously sold drugs, Mr. James did not remember selling drugs to Defendant. Furthermore, when asked if he could not remember or if he did not want to remember, Mr. James stated, \"Don't remember because I didn't want to remember. I have head trauma from the highway. My memory is bad.\" Mr. James testified he did not remember how long he stayed in the hospital. He did not remember trying to flag down cars on Interstate 49. Mr. James testified he did not know Defendant and that Defendant did not stab him. He remembered having stab wounds and getting help from a state trooper but did not remember anything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State then called Trooper Mark O'Brien, a ten-year veteran of the Louisiana State Police. He testified that in the early morning hours of July 30, 2017, he responded to a call that a pedestrian was walking along I-49 and was informed before he arrived that the pedestrian was naked. Trooper O'Brien testified he encountered the pedestrian around mile marker sixty-four or sixty-five heading south. He noted that initially, the individual approached him from the median and Trooper O'Brien almost hit him. Seeing the individual was naked, scraped up, and bloodied, Trooper O'Brien called for an ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trooper O'Brien testified the individual told him he had been stabbed. Defense counsel objected and the trial court overruled the objection based upon the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Trooper O'Brien testified the individual was having trouble breathing, and he could hear air coming out of the individual's chest. He testified the individual told him he had been stabbed and thrown out of \"a silver Jeep with a North Carolina plate.\" Trooper O'Brien acknowledged the individual did not say who stabbed him or how it happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State then called Ms. Wendy Worsham, a paramedic with roughly twenty years' employment by Acadian Ambulance. She testified to responding to a call on July 30, 2017, regarding an injured male on I-49. Upon arrival, she found the individual had \"been stabbed several times and had a lot of road rash on him.\" She stated that he was upset and crying, but that he was able to speak logically. Defense counsel again objected to her being asked what the individual said to her, and the trial court again overruled the objection based on the excited utterance exception. Ms. Worsham testified Defendant told her \"that he was stabbed and was thrown out or had fallen out on the interstate.\" She recalled the vehicle he described had \"Carolina license plates[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Worsham noted she placed a seal on Travis James's chest to treat his chest wound, then they loaded him into the ambulance and treated him while en route to Rapides General. She testified that Mr. James did not know how fast the car was moving when he exited the vehicle but \"he just said fast.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On cross-examination, Ms. Worsham testified she did not think she gave him\n   any medication. She also acknowledged telling a Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office detective that Mr. James claimed the car had been going \"probably about a hundred miles per hour.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State then called Ms. Josie Lazare, who in July of 2017 was an employee at the Tiger Trax truck stop off I-49, Exit 40. She noted the store was locked when Defendant arrived and asked to use the phone. She stated he told them he thought he had hit someone or ran over someone. Ms. Lazare testified they let him use the phone outside, that a woman called the phone back to talk to him, then law enforcement arrived and told Ms. Lazare and her co-worker to stay inside. On cross-examination, Ms. Lazare noted she told law enforcement Defendant's shirt was ripped and noted he was very quiet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State then called Lieutenant Ryan Savoie, a four-year veteran of the St. Landry Parish Sheriff's Office. Lieutenant Savoie testified he responded to a call in the early morning of July 30, 2017, at the Tiger Trax truck stop regarding a male subject who told the clerks \"he thought he had killed somebody on the interstate.\" He testified Defendant was sitting on an ice chest behind his van when Lieutenant Savoie arrived. After being informed the incident took place further north on I-49, Lieutenant Savoie called Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office to let them know what was happening, then sat with Defendant while awaiting the arrival of Rapides Parish deputies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Lieutenant Savoie testified Defendant told him he had been attacked, so Lieutenant Savoie called for an ambulance to check Defendant out and stated they found no injuries on him. He stated once he learned the victim was found in Rapides Parish, it was not his investigation so he simply waited with Defendant until the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office arrived to investigate. On cross-examination, Lieutenant Savoie acknowledged he did not recall Defendant having a tear on his shirt and that Defendant was very cooperative and did everything Lieutenant Savoie asked of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State then called Sergeant Justin Woodson, a detective with the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office. He stated he initially responded to the location on I-49 where Mr. James was found and noted there were several places with blood on the roadway, some money on the side of the road, and some clothing in the median. He and Detective Brady then proceeded to the Tiger Trax truck stop. Sergeant Woodson testified Defendant waived his rights and gave a statement, noting Defendant admitted he had relapsed and sought to buy drugs in Alexandria where he met an individual whose name he did not know, but who sold him drugs. Defendant told Sergeant Woodson he returned to buy drugs a second time but there was an altercation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sergeant Woodson testified Defendant told him he felt he was being set up and the guy attacked him and was hitting him with an unknown, hard object in the head when Defendant managed to take the unknown weapon and strike the man with it before taking off down I-49. Following that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Defendant] said they went down - they were going down the interstate, he turned on the light - the inside light and looked at the other gentleman and noticed he was covered with blood. He said he kind of freaked out a little bit and was telling the guy that he needed to get him to the hospital. The guy said he refused to go to the hospital and then according to him, the next thing he knew the door came open and the guy tried to jump out. He reached to grab him, grabbed his pants, but the guy went out without his pants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sergeant Woodson confirmed Defendant said he did not know with what he had been hit, but claimed he hit Mr. James with the same object after taking it away from him while driving. Woodson noted the only injury he observed on Defendant was a small scratch on his upper, right arm. Sergeant Woodson noted Defendant \"was shook up.\" He stated he sought an arrest warrant for Defendant because \"the evidence that was present did not support his story of being attacked first. Especially by a knife. I mean, he had no injuries from a knife.\" Sergeant Woodson then noted Defendant never said he was attacked by a knife, but claimed it had to be a knife since the victim had stab wounds and Defendant claimed he hit the victim with the same weapon that had been used on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sergeant Woodson testified Defendant's vehicle was \"like a mid-sized SUV.\" He stated that he spoke to Mr. James at the hospital on July 30, 2017, but noted Mr. James \"was heavily sedated.\" All he said was, \"you know, they stabbed me, they got me. Somebody stabbed me.\" But he wouldn't go into any details. He testified he returned to the hospital twice; the first time, Mr. James was in a procedure, and the second time, Mr. James had already been released.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On cross-examination, Sergeant Woodson acknowledged it was possible Defendant could have had injuries that he did not see and that he did not know for sure that Mr. James was stabbed by a knife. The State rested its case-in-chief following Sergeant Woodson's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant took the stand in his own defense. Defendant testified he grew up in Pineville before attending college in South Carolina on a football scholarship. He testified that on July 30, 2017, he was living in Pensacola, Florida. He acknowledged that he was required to register as a sex offender due to a conviction for having sex with a sixteen-year old when he was eighteen. He did not specify the crime for which he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant testified he was in Alexandria on July 29, 2017, to visit his two sons who live with their mother and to give their mother money for their school clothes and supplies. He stated that he had stopped at a gas station for gas and Red Bull before getting on the highway when Mr. James approached him and asked him if he was \"looking for something?\" Defendant testified this \"triggered a relapse [;]\" noting he had not done drugs in almost a year up to that point. He testified that his drug issues arose while he was dealing with undiagnosed PTSD and severe depression, which were diagnosed in January of 2017. He also testified he had tried to commit suicide twice, once by crashing a car and once via cocaine overdose in January of 2017, prior to his diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant testified that he did not know Mr. James prior to being approached at the gas station but agreed to drive Mr. James around in exchange for some drugs despite his instincts telling him to \"just go.\" Defendant stated he did not know the approximate time he met Mr. James. Eventually, Defendant decided he was ready to leave and told Mr. James he would drop him off wherever he wanted but that it was time for him to leave. Defendant testified that he was not accustomed to driving around Alexandria as he had not gotten his driver's license until he was living in South Carolina. He stated Mr. James had him driving in circles, so he pulled over and told him to get out. At that point, he looked away and Mr. James hit him in the head multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant stated he grabbed Mr. James and tried to disarm him, claiming \"I was defending myself.\" He testified that Mr. James then began screaming \"Y'all come on, y'all come on.\" Stating he was afraid\n   because he did not know how many people Mr. James had coming, Defendant testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   I drove out. That same time I'm trying to drive I'm dealing with him. I don't know - I was trying to take the object from him. I didn't know what it was. He kept swinging and hitting. And I was defending myself against that. Stopping him from hitting me and hitting him back. And after a while, you know, he stopped.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant testified the victim was hitting him in the face and broke his glasses during he exchange. When asked what happened next, Defendant testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   So, I don't have - I didn't have a phone to call anybody. But, you know, when he stopped I could - he was like: [\"]Man, I'm hurting. I'm hurt bad.[\"] And it cut the light on and I see there's blood. And I'm like oh my gosh, you know. And I start panicking. And you know I'm taking you to a hospital. And he didn't want to go to a hospital. And I said, I was, you know, trying to explain to him you need a hospital. He didn't want to go because he was scared to go to jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant testified it was around 1:30 a.m. He then continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Yes, and I'm trying to explain to him: I'm gonna [sic] take you to a hospital, I'm gonna [sic] take you to a hospital. And before I knew it, the interior light came on again and, you know, he was trying to get out the vehicle, jump out the vehicle and I try to reach for him but it was too late. You know, all I was able to grab was his shorts. But his momentum took him all the way out of the vehicle and I was gonna [sic] stop him and go get him but I saw another vehicle coming up behind me. And it was coming up real fast. So, I didn't know if it was a police officer or if it was the people that he was trying to communicate with. So, I say to myself: Well, just keep driving but drive fast. If it's a police officer, they gonna [sic] cut blue lights on you. You know? Because you're speeding. Or they'll see him and they'll, you know, come after me. You know? But no lights came on and the car just kept coming up on me. So, I didn't know if that was his friends or whatever. And come to find out, it was a little sports car out there joyriding that night. And by the time the car caught up with me and went around, I didn't know where I was at. I saw the lights to the station. I stopped at that station and told them to call the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant testified he was driving well over one hundred miles per hour, trying to get himself pulled over for speeding so he could speak with law enforcement about what had happened. He stated the phone law enforcement found in his vehicle was not his and that he \"didn't know about that phone.\" Defendant recounted approaching the women in the Tiger Trax truck stop and telling them to call law enforcement before telling law enforcement everything that had happened. Asked if he intended to kill Mr. James, Defendant stated his intent was \"[t]o keep him from killing me. That was my only intent. I wanted to make it out alive.\" He also testified that he did not push Mr. James out of his vehicle, he tried to keep Mr. James inside of the vehicle in order to get him medical attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendant testified he hit Mr. James with the same object with which Mr. James attacked him, stating he stopped when Mr. James \"stopped striking against me.\" He further testified that he believed, if he had not acted in self-defense he \"would have been dead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On cross-examination, Defendant clarified he grew up in Pineville but was unfamiliar with Alexandria. He repeated that\n   he was defending himself with the weapon he took away from Mr. James, stating \"Every time he'd hit me, I would hit him back.\" He reaffirmed that he did not know he was stabbing Mr. James, as he did not know what the weapon was. Defendant testified he was trying to hit Mr. James with his hand, but the item taken from the victim was still in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant stated he saw Mr. James had a lot of blood on him but thought it was from his nose and mouth, which were both bleeding. He testified that while trying to get away from the situation Mr. James ended up on the highway. Defendant would not admit to any time period on cross-examination, other than to say, \"It was dark.\" He acknowledged that he never turned on his emergency lights until he reached the Tiger Trax. After stating he thought Mr. James's pants were still in his car when he called police, Defendant acknowledged telling Sergeant Woodson that he threw the victim's pants out of the window. Defendant maintained that he did not intentionally throw the pants out of the window and that he did not throw anything else out of the window. Defendant again stated he knew nothing about any phone law enforcement found during their inventory of his vehicle. Defendant testified he told the clerk at the Tiger Trax that he thought he killed somebody because, \"My common sense told me somebody that jumps out of a vehicle going over a hundred miles and [sic] hour might be dead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant clarified that Mr. James attacked him first, that he disarmed Mr. James and began to hit him with the item he took away, and Mr. James continued hitting him without a weapon. He again testified that he stopped hitting Mr. James as soon as Mr. James stopped hitting him. Finally, he clarified that when he said he thought he had killed someone, he thought Mr. James had died not from Defendant's striking him but from his jumping out of the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defense counsel then called Sergeant Woodson and questioned him about the recovery of a phone from Defendant's car. Sergeant Woodson stated he was unaware of any phone being recovered because the inventory was actually performed by a crime scene detective, although Sergeant Woodson stated he was present during said inventory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defense counsel then called Detective Brady, who noted a cell phone was recovered from the driver's side door. Detective Brady testified he was unaware whether the phone was functioning at the time it was recovered. At that time the presentation of evidence ended and the case was submitted to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record. After reviewing the record, we find no errors patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS ONE AND TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In his first two assignments of error, Defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to prove his guilt and the State failed to disprove that his actions were justified as self-defense. The analysis for insufficient-evidence claims is well settled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   When the issue of sufficiency of evidence is raised on appeal, the critical inquiry of the reviewing court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Finally, while Defendant did stop and notify law enforcement of what happened, the jury could have disbelieved his testimony that he was searching for help given he drove at least twenty miles south before he stopped.

Under\n   <em>\n    Hongo\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's inaccurate instruction regarding specific intent in the instant case is harmless error because the jury would have reached the same verdict given the sufficiency of the evidence.

Although Mr. James testified that he did\n   not remember how he received the wounds that he received on July 30, 2017, both Trooper O'Brien and Ms. Warsham testified that Mr. James told them (at separate times) that he had been stabbed. Defense counsel objected that such testimony was hearsay, and the trial court agreed with the State's contention the statements were excited utterances and therefore were admissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendant contends Mr. James's statements should have been inadmissible because the State failed to lay the proper foundation for the statement to Trooper O'Brien to be an excited utterance and that too much time had elapsed between the event and Mr. James's statement to Ms. Warsham for the statement to be considered an excited utterance.

Both Trooper O'Brien and Ms. Warsham testified Mr. James told them he had been stabbed. Although Defendant contends the admission of the statements would be \"not harmless as Travis James testified at trial that he did not know how he was injured and he did not remember most of the day of July 30, 2017[,]\" the statements are merely cumulative. Further, even if Defendant is correct regarding Mr. James's testimony, Dr. Zeringue clearly identified Mr. James's wounds as severe road rash and multiple stab wounds. Mr. James did not identify who stabbed him or why he was stabbed, he merely stated he was stabbed, which corroborates Dr. Zeringue's identification of his wounds. Additionally, Mr. James testified he remembered having stab wounds and the jury saw pictures of some of Mr. James's stab wounds. Without addressing whether the trial court erred in introducing Mr. James's statements to Trooper O'Brien and Ms. Warsham, we find that any possible error would be harmless given the cumulative and corroborative nature of the statements.

The majority acknowledges that a conviction for attempted manslaughter requires proof of specific intent to kill. Specific intent to inflict great bodily harm is not an element of attempted manslaughter. The jury was erroneously instructed, and the instruction, in my view, was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The jury requested a second instruction on attempted manslaughter. The initial error was duplicated. The jury was again instructed that \"[m]anslaughter is the killing of a human being when the defendant has a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm.\" The clear inference is that the jury was confused by the initial instruction. After the second instruction, the jury deliberated for an hour before returning the responsive verdict of attempted manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   It is factually undisputed that Mr. James had multiple stab wounds ; it is equally undisputed that he had severe road rash. James denied knowing how he received the injuries and denied even knowing Frinks. The testimony was somewhat ambivalent on whether James was pushed or had fallen from a moving vehicle. The evidence was also inconclusive with regard to whether the more serious injuries were caused by the stabbing as opposed to James jumping from a moving vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
