R.S. 14:44\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   one count of aggravated rape, in violation of La. R.S. 14:42\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the kidnapping and rape of the victim, V.P. (hereinafter referred to as \"V.P.\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that occurred on January 31, 1990. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty. On June 12, 2014, Defendant appeared for a\n   <em>\n    Quatrevingt\n   </em>\n   hearing to challenge the admissibility of the DNA evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which the district court denied and allowed the introduction of the DNA evidence by the State of Louisiana (\"the State\"). Thereafter, the State noticed its intent to introduce evidence under La. C.E. art. 412.2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the district court granted. In response, Defendant filed a writ application for supervisory review of the district court's ruling. Both this Court and the Louisiana Supreme Court denied Defendant's writ applications.\n   <em>\n    State v. Warner\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0339, p. 1 (La.

On January 26, 2018, the district court denied\n   Defendant's motion for a new trial. On March 15, 2018, the district court sentenced Defendant to life imprisonment without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on both counts with credit for time served. The district court also assessed prosecution costs and court costs against Defendant in the amount of $ 57,387.00. Defendant now files this appeal and asserts five (5) assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 31, 1990, V.P. was walking home with her infant son on Annunciation Street near the St. Thomas Housing Development in New Orleans, when she was approached by a black male suspect in a vehicle. The suspect brandished a gun and ordered V.P. and her son into the vehicle. The suspect then drove V.P. and her son to the nearby park and forced her to perform oral sex on him. Subsequently, the suspect vaginally raped V.P. After the incident, V.P. underwent a rape examination. The male's DNA produced from the examination was then uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System (\"CODIS\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Officer Derrick Williams\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At Defendant's trial, the State called Officer Derrick Williams (\"Officer Williams\"), of the New Orleans Police Department (\"NOPD\") Sex Crimes Unit, as its first witness to testify to the \"other crimes\" evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On direct examination, Officer Williams testified that there was a call of attempted aggravated rape, during the early morning hours of November 2010, at the intersection of Broad Street and Washington Avenue. He explained that he was not the responding officer; however, he had an opportunity to interview the victim at NOPD's office. Based on the information provided during that interview, he was able to obtain an arrest warrant for Defendant, for the charge of attempted forcible rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On cross-examination, Officer Williams confirmed that he was made aware of the tenant-landlord relationship between the victim and Defendant. Officer Williams denied knowledge of communications between the parties regarding an invitation for Defendant to come to the victim's apartment for dinner in exchange for rent payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Williams also confirmed that there was no physical evidence or sexual assault kit available to corroborate the victim's allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, on re-direct examination, Officer Williams recounted that the victim seemed very matter of fact while explaining the incident. Additionally, he testified that the victim stated there was no penile-vaginal penetration, but Defendant's penis did touch her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gina Pineda Murphy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State's next witness was Gina Pineda Murphy (\"Ms. Murphy\"), a DNA consultant with a specialty in forensic human DNA testing. Ms. Murphy was formerly\n   employed by ReliaGene Technologies (\"ReliaGene\"), the testing company that received V.P.'s rape kit in May 2005. Ms. Murphy explained that ReliaGene was contracted with the NOPD Crime Laboratory in 2005 to test the backlog of rape kit cases. All of the rape kits that tested positive for seminal fluid were analyzed to obtain DNA profiles. She explained the document handling, standard operating procedure, and testing protocols employed to ensure the integrity of DNA samples and reliability of results. She stated that once the integrity of the samples was determined to be adequate, the samples were assigned a case number and logged into a computer database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained that those procedures and protocols were properly followed to ensure that the integrity of DNA samples had not been compromised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   She recalled the rape kit, in the present case, contained two samples: (1) an intimate swab from the victim and (2) a victim-known blood stain card, which were tested by two independent analysts. From these results, a report was generated that included the summary of ReliaGene's findings. The initial report was issued in September of 2005. Ms. Murphy recounted that, while Hurricane Katrina (\"Katrina\") occurred in August of 2005, the laboratory neither received any water damage, nor were any of the samples housed in that facility damaged or harmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also recounted that the testing of the DNA samples in this case were performed prior to Katrina, and only the generation of the data analysis and final report was needed after Katrina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Murphy then explained the DNA test results, asserting that a male DNA profile was developed from the testing of the vaginal swab obtained during V.P.'s rape examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   She further explained that, at the time of testing, the donor's identity could not be determined because there were no known samples in CODIS to compare; thus, the profile was uploaded in CODIS to await \"a hit.\" To qualify the integrity of the male DNA profile developed in this matter, Ms. Murphy indicated that the DNA sample tested was neither \"contaminated\" nor \"degraded.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On cross-examination, Ms. Murphy testified as to the chain of custody of the DNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   samples received from V.P.'s rape examination. She indicated that they received the DNA samples from NOPD's Crime Lab, and once it was at the facility, there was an internal chain of custody followed in handling the samples. Defendant indicated that the chain of custody document, introduced as Defense Exhibit 1, did not indicate that the DNA samples were transferred from NOPD's Crime Lab to ReliaGene's facility. To contest this assertion, Ms. Murphy indicated the signature of the agent who transferred the samples was evidenced on the document, even though she admitted the document did not evince the term \"transfer\" on its face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On redirect examination, Ms. Murphy indicated that the chain of custody document introduced is a three-page document that contains different rows or lines utilized to document the transfers of the DNA samples. She urged that the documents indicate that the DNA samples were transferred and evinces the time and the agent who completed the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V.P.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   V.P. testified that, on the night of the incident, she was playing cards, with her infant son, at a friend's residence in the St. Thomas Housing Development. At the end of the night, she decided to find the nearest pay phone to call for a ride home because it was very late.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As she waited at the pay phone, a vehicle pulled up. The suspect brandished a gun and ordered her to \"get in.\" She testified that, once she got into the vehicle, the suspect attempted to force her to perform oral sex. Her infant son, who had been placed in the backseat, was incessantly crying and trying to get in the front seat with her. However, she testified that the driver continuously knocked him down over the seat. The suspect then drove V.P. and her son to a nearby park, where he ordered her to get out of the vehicle. However, due to her son's crying, he brought her back to the vehicle. Once back inside of the vehicle, the suspect ordered her to perform oral sex on him and then vaginally raped her. After the incident was over, the suspect dropped V.P. and her son off on a corner and ordered them out of the vehicle. It was at this time that V.P. used a phone to call her mother to inform her of the rape. V.P. testified that her mother picked her up and drove her to the police station. From there, she was transported to a hospital to receive a rape examination where a vaginal swab was taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   V.P. testified that, at that time, she could not provide an accurate description of her attacker because it was dark outside. However, sometime later, she contacted the police to identify a suspect she believed to be her attacker based on a conversation she had with her former boyfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the description of the man provided by her former boyfriend, she identified her attacker as August Quinn (\"Mr. Quinn\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, V.P. decided not to move forward with prosecuting because she was unsure of the identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After the dismissal of the case against Mr. Quinn, V.P.'s case became a cold case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   V.P. testified that a few years ago, she was contacted by a Detective, who notified her that Defendant was her attacker based on DNA evidence obtained from CODIS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   She informed the Detective that she neither knew Defendant, nor did she ever have a consensual sexual relationship with him. At trial, she maintained that she did not know him and could not make an identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On cross-examination, V.P. recalled that she gave the police the following description of her attacker: a black male with a mustache, about 5'8?-5'9? and approximately 160-180 pounds. She further admitted that she initially identified someone else as her attacker. However, she recounted that she \"had a change of heart\" in moving forward with the prosecution due to uncertainty surrounding the identification. Again, the defense asked if V.P. knew Defendant, which she vehemently denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On re-direct examination, V.P. stated that it was not until her name was revealed in opening statements that Defendant asserted a story that her sister testified on Defendant's behalf in an unrelated criminal matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   V.P. also urged that her purpose for testifying in this matter was to prevent a crime, of this degree, from being committed against another person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dr. David Ross\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State called Dr. David Ross (\"Dr. Ross\") as its next witness. Dr. Ross, an Emergency physician, performed V.P.'s rape examination on the night of January 31, 1990. Dr. Ross explained that he was an emergency medicine resident at Charity Hospital at that time. One of his duties included performing examinations, documenting physical evidence, and collecting evidence of patients who presented as victims of sexual assault; thus, he was the doctor who received V.P. upon her arrival at the hospital and generated her sexual assault evaluation report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   He memorialized that V.P. provided a statement that she was \"forced at gunpoint in a car and raped vaginally and orally multiple times.\" Further, he indicated V.P. had not showered or douched prior to the examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   He also referenced that the document indicated that V.P. was \"aloof but cooperative, distant\" during the evaluation, which he stated is not an uncommon response of sexual assault victims. He also documented that V.P.'s underwear had been torn and that the examination revealed that V.P. possibly had body fluid on her \"right buttocks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Ross testified that V.P. did not exhibit any signs of intoxication. Moreover, he indicated that sperm was found in V.P.'s vagina, but no evidence of any physical injuries. However, he indicated that the lack of physical injuries is not a dispositive factor that negates a sexual assault occurred. He explained that it is not uncommon that the vagina of a victim does not evince trauma due to the organ's resilience, especially if a victim has given birth. Lastly, V.P.'s clothing, along with the vaginal swabs from the examination, was collected, packaged, and sealed and turned over to NOPD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sergeant Francis Jarrott\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State then called Sergeant Francis Jarrott (\"Sgt. Jarrott\") of NOPD's Cold Case Sex Crime Unit to testify. He explained that he became involved with the instant case upon receipt of the CODIS match notification letter\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2011 indicating a DNA match between a sexual assault investigation and Defendant. After receiving this notification, he applied for a search warrant to obtain a buccal swab from Defendant to confirm the CODIS match with the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab (\"the State Police\"). In May of 2011, a buccal swab of the inner cheek of Defendant's mouth was obtained and mailed to the State Police for confirmation. In October of 2011, the State Police confirmed that the DNA obtained from Defendant's buccal swab matched the DNA profile from V.P.'s rape kit. Sgt. Jarrott also noted that the State Police provided a crime lab report that provided a statistical analysis of the DNA profile. He provided the report which indicated that the chance of another person with the exact same DNA profile as the one contained in V.P.'s rape kit was 1 in 8.5 billion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Anne Montgomery\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the State called Ms. Anne Montgomery (\"Ms. Montgomery\"), who was\n   qualified by the district court as an expert in the field molecular biology and DNA analysis. She was employed by the NOPD Crime Lab from 2001 until 2007. She provided that she was hired as a professional contractor by the City of New Orleans and tasked with setting up a DNA lab in NOPD's Crime Lab. She described the process in which DNA profiles are indexed from the local and state levels to the federal combined DNA index system, which is CODIS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   She noted that the federal government had concerns about the volume of sexual assault kits throughout the United States that had not been analyzed or processed due to personnel shortages. Thus, in response, the National Institute of Justice developed a grant program to provide states with funding to reduce the volume of sexual assault backlog kits. Using these federal grant funds, Ms. Montgomery was able to pay private labs to process NOPD's backlogged rape kits. She recounted that this project began in 2003 and NOPD used two labs to process these kits. ReliaGene was the primary lab NOPD utilized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As it relates to the instant matter, Ms. Montgomery discussed the samples retrieved from V.P., testifying to the procedures employed by the NOPD Crime Lab in verifying the results from the raw data. Ms. Montgomery also provided insight as to the procedures utilized to ensure that the proper protocols were followed by ReliaGene. She recalled that the male DNA profile obtained from V.P.'s vaginal swabs were uploaded in CODIS in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, she documented the general chain of custody of transferring DNA samples from NOPD Crime Lab to ReliaGene, noting that when a sample was relinquished from one lab to another, there was always documentation of who relinquished it and who received it. In this case, V.P.'s vaginal swabs were transferred by NOPD to ReliaGene prior to the occurrence of Hurricane Katrina, and noted that the swabs remained in the custody of ReliaGene until the NOPD Crime Lab was operational following the storm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   ReliaGene processed and signed off on this case in September 2005. The information was in the CODIS database from 2006 until 2011 when the DNA profile was matched to Defendant. Moreover, Ms. Montgomery opined, from the statistical data provided in the DNA profile issued by the State Police, that \"to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty and to the exclusion of others, barring an identical twin, that [Defendant was] the donor of that profile.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Phillip Simmers\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Phillip Simmers (\"Mr. Simmers\"), a DNA analyst at the Louisiana State Crime Lab, was also called by the State to testify. Mr. Simmers, qualified by the court in\n   DNA analysis, testified that, in 2011, he compared the biological evidence contained on the buccal swab from Defendant to the DNA profile uploaded from the CODIS database. From this comparison, he determined that the profiles were identical and belonged to Defendant. Mr. Simmers opined that the DNA profile, which originated from a mixture of the DNA of V.P. and that of Defendant, was 8.54 billion times more likely to be observed from a mixture of V.P.'s DNA and Defendant's DNA, than if it had originated from the victim and an unrelated, random individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendant\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the State rested its case, Defendant took the witness stand in his own defense. He testified that he was first made aware of the identity of V.P. in the State's opening statement. Upon this revelation, he immediately informed his defense attorney that he knew V.P. He also testified that he informed his defense counsel that her sister had testified for him in an unrelated case in 1990. He adamantly denied raping V.P. and insisted that he never committed sexual assault on anyone.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On cross-examination, when questioned as to why he did not assert the defense of consent prior to trial, he explained that V.P.'s name was redacted from all reports of the incident and indictment and he had not known her identity until opening statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further provided that V.P. lived in his former neighborhood and he had engaged in consensual sex with her at her residence, in return he provided payment for her services. He also stated that the two had engaged in consensual sexual relationships more than once, but did not remember if the pair had engaged in consensual sex the night of the incident at issue. Moreover, Defendant did not affirm that he disputed the integrity of the DNA evidence as being contaminated or compromised; rather, he asserted his omission of guilt for this crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Errors Patent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A review of the record does not reveal any errors patent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignments of Error\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant asserts the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (1) Whether the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury's verdict of guilty on any count;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (2) Whether the district court erred in not granting Defendant's motion for new trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (3) Whether Defendant's right of effective assistance of counsel, pursuant to Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was violated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (4) Whether the provision of the Louisiana Constitution allowing non-unanimous jury verdicts violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and is entitled to retroactive application of changes in Louisiana Constitutional Law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (5) Whether Defendant's right against cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines, pursuant to the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, was violated by the district court when assessing prosecution costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we find that Defendant's fifth assignment of error is meritorious. However, we find the remaining assignments of error lack merit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignments of Error No. 1 and No. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In Defendant's first assignment of error, he argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support the jury's guilty verdict. Consequently, in his second assignment of error, Defendant argues the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. For ease of discussion, we address both assignments of error together in this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown\n   </em>\n   , set forth the standard for evaluating a claim of insufficient evidence, stating that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, Louisiana appellate courts are controlled by the standard enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

To support this assertion, he asserts two arguments. First, Defendant argues that V.P. never identified him as her perpetrator, but instead identified another man. He also argues V.P.'s initial description of her attacker does not match him. Second, he argues that the State did not negate every\n   reasonable hypothesis of innocence, averring that the State did not consider that he had a consensual sexual relationship with V.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At trial, the jury heard testimony from V.P. who vividly narrated the events that took place the night of the incident, recounting that Defendant forced her into his vehicle at gunpoint and forced her to perform oral sex before vaginally raping her. She also recalled the fear and degradation she experienced during this incident and the cruel treatment her infant son was subjected to at the hands of Defendant. Dr. Ross also testified that V.P. came to the hospital the night of the incident to receive a rape examination; thus, confirming that the vaginal swabs were taken the night of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The jury also heard the un-refuted testimony of the State's DNA experts, Ms. Montgomery and Mr. Simmers, who eliminated any uncertainty regarding Defendant's DNA profile that was extracted from the vaginal swabs taken from V.P. In fact, Ms. Montgomery opined that scientific evidence exists as to the reasonable certainty that the DNA extracted was Defendant's DNA. Mr. Simmers corroborated her testimony by stating the report evidenced that the DNA profile, which originated from a mixture of the DNA of V.P. and that of Defendant, was 8.54 billion times more likely to be observed from a mixture of V.P.'s DNA and Defendant's DNA, than if it had originated from V.P. and an unrelated, random individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As to Defendant's assertion that V.P. initially identified another man as her attacker, V.P. did not negate this fact; however, she vehemently insisted that she did not move forward with the prosecution because could not affirmatively assert that this man was her attacker. Further, as to V.P.'s initial description of her attacker, she maintained that, despite giving a description to the police, she could not identify her attacker. Notably, however, V.P.'s initial description is similar to that of the Defendant. Comparable to V.P.'s initial description, the record before us reflects that Defendant is a black male, approximately 200 pounds, and 5'11?.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As to Defendant's assertion that he had a consensual sexual relationship with V.P., she adamantly denied knowing Defendant or ever having a consensual sexual relationship with him. She also urged that this incident was rape; that it was not a consensual sexual incident. Thus, viewing all of the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the State proved that Defendant was guilty of this crime.

However, this \"newly discovered evidence\" was discovered\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   trial. According to Defendant's own testimony, he learned of the identity of V.P., during the State's opening statement. The Louisiana Supreme Court established, in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the first prong of the test to obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was not met. Moreover, based on the testimony and DNA evidence presented at trial, it cannot be said that Defendant's alleged additional witnesses\n   would have produced a different verdict. The jury heard Defendant's assertion regarding a prior relationship with V.P. at trial, and based on its verdict, did not find Defendant's testimony to be credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, we reject Defendant's third assertion that the State violated its ethical obligations by withholding the victim's full name from defense counsel prior to trial.

Thus, Defendant's assertion that the district court denied its motion of continuance is erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based on the aforementioned, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Defendant's motion for a new trial.
