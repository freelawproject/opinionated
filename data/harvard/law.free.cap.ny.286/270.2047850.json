Summary judgment has been granted on motion by the corporation and by some of the individual defendants. Since the action continues as to the non-moving defendants, plaintiffs are entitled to have the corporation retained as a nominal party defendant in so far as relief is sought against the remaining individual defendants <em>in favor of </em>the corporation. To the extent that the plaintiffs sought relief against the corporation, and in all other respects except as noted above, the dismissal of the complaint was proper. The judgment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>however, should be modified so that the corporation will be retained as a nominal party defendant in the action con- \u00a1 tinning against the non-moving individual defendants. <em>t </em>The judgments should be modified in accordance with this \u00a1 opinion and as so modified affirmed, without costs. , !</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Lehman, Ch.
