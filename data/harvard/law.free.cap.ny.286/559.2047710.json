Y. 614; <em>Matter of Marion, </em>174 Misc. Rep. 897.) The trial court properly allowed 487 signatures where the signers correctly stated their addresses and their 1940 election districts instead of the 1941 election districts, the numbers of their election districts having been changed by the board of elections in 1941. <em>(Matter of Hagler </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>252 App. Div. 741.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-10\"><em>Abraham Multer, E.

Laws, ch. 17) must be complied with. Finding No. 6 does not show compliance here. <em>(Matter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>of McElroy </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>286 N. Y. 686.) Change of election districts by maps filed in 1941 does not excuse the Signers from compliance with the provisions of the statute. The petition, therefore, does not contain sufficient signatures even if we were to hold that the signatures of the two sets of petitions might be counted together.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The orders should be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Lehman, Ch.
