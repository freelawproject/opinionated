Order affirmed, without costs or disbursements. We agree with the Family Court\u2019s conclusion that the best interests of the parties\u2019 son will be served by an award of permanent custody to the mother. The adduced evidence supports a finding of her fitness as a parent, as well as a finding of her perseverance in such role during a period of pecuniary difficulty and while petitioner was virtually continuously in arrears in his court-ordered support payments. Hopkins, J. P., Rabin, Cohalan and Weinstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
