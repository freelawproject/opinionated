But here the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit is entirely defective. It states no fact whatever, except that the defendant admitted \u201c the receipt of the money sued for.\u201d The relations between the parties are undisclosed. The plaintiff gives us no insight into his real position; no clue to the averment that the moneys were received \u201c for his use.\u201d Something should at least have transpired to justify the bringing of the suit and the framing of a general averment. So far the court should have been taken into the plaintiff\u2019s confidence. As it is, this affidavit is entirely blind. It seems studiously to avoid a frank disclosure of what induced the plaintiff to proceed. The order was, therefore, very properly vacated. It would be intolerable were parties to be subjected to inquisitorial examinations upon such papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The order appealed from should be affirmed, with ten dollars costs and the disbursements of the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
