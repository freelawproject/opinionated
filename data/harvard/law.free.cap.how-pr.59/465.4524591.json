Welch, as landlord, commenced summary proceedings under the statute, before chief justice Shea of the ETew York marine court, to dispossess Mary Ann Jackson, as an overholding tenant, from the premises 2128 Third avenue. The proceedings, after several adjournments, were, by the written consent of the parties, continued before Mr. justice MoAdam, who tried the proceeding and finally filed an opinion ordering judgment for the landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Mrs. Jackson thereupon obtained from the supreme court \u25a0 an alternative writ of prohibition enjoining judge McAdam from issuing a warrant or proceeding further in the matter, upon the ground that he had no power to continue the proceeding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">The hearing was had upon the motion to make the writ absolute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-6\"><em>Geo.

Pr., </em>19), and contended that all questions as to jurisdiction was put at rest by the written consent of the parties; that having jurisdiction of the subject matter, consent gave him jurisdiction over the parties, citing <em>Cowen\u2019s Treatise [Kingsley\u2019s 5th ed.] sec. </em>20; <em>McCormick </em>agt. <em>The Pennsylvania Central Railroad Company </em>(49 <em>N. Y., </em>303). He claimed that the case of <em>Benjamin </em>agt. <em>Benjamin </em>(5 <em>N. Y., </em>383) was inapplicable because the statute in force at that time provided that if the tenant filed a counter affidavit, the matters controverted <em>\u201c'must be t/ried by a ju/ry </em>\u201d (2 <em>R. S. [2d ed.], p. </em>423, <em>sec. </em>34). In other words, that the justice should not try the issue. The matters were controverted and the justice, in that case, instead of trying the issues by a jury as required by statute, tried them himself. The court, therefore, held that he had no powers and that as the statute did not give him jurisdiction, consent could not confer it. Whereas, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Under the present statute, justice McAdam was authorized to try this or any other summary proceeding without the aid of a jury,-and that the distinction between the two cases was, therefore, marked and apparent. The conduct of the relator\u2019s counsel in signing a stipulation which they intended to be binding only in case the justice decided in favor of their client was condemned, as not only trifling with a confiding adversary but with the court itself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b473-5\">Lawrence, <em>J. </em>\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">I am of opinion that this writ ought to be dismissed, and I refer to the points presented by the learned justice of the marine court with approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Writ dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
