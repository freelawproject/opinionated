Plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to enforce these judgments against Defendants-Appellants Alavi Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue Company (together, \u201cDefendants\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d) and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (\u201cTRIA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">This appeal requires us to determine whether Defendants qualify, as a matter of law, as the \u201cforeign state\u201d of Iran or an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d thereof, such that Defendants\u2019 properties may be turned over to help satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 judgments against Iran under the FSIA. We are also called upon to determine whether, under the TRIA, (1) Defendants qualify, as a matter of law, as Iran or an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d thereof insofar as Iran is a \u201cforeign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d and (2) Defendants\u2019 properties are \u201cblocked assets\u201d that may be turned over to help satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 judgments against Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">We conclude that Defendants in this case do not <em>equate </em>to the \u201cforeign state\u201d of Iran for purposes of the FSIA or the TRIA. We further conclude that Defendants cannot be deemed \u201cagencies or in-strumentalities\u201d of Iran under the FSIA, but that Defendants\u2019 status as \u201cagencies or instrumentalities\u201d of Iran under the TRIA and their properties\u2019 status as \u201cblocked assets\u201d under that statute is not foreclosed as a matter of law. Nevertheless, we identify questions of fact that prevent either of these TRIA questions from being decided on summary judgment. Accordingly, we vacate the summary judgment award in favor of Plaintiffs and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">\u201cWe of course view the record in the light most favorable to [the Defendants], who [are] appealing from an adverse grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Lombard v.

Overview of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">The background facts of this case are provided in detail in an accompanying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>opinion. <em>In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, </em>14-2027 <em>(\u201cIn re 650 Fifth Ave.\u201d). </em>We assume familiarity with that opinion, and provide an abbreviated version of events here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">A. Iran\u2019s Involvement With The Ala-vi Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue Company</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Alavi Foundation (\u201cAlavi\u201d or \u201cthe Foundation\u201d) traces its origins to 1973, when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, incorporated the eponymous Pahlavi Foundation as a New York not-for-profit corporation, and endowed it with several million dollars. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the formation of the Bonyad Mostazafan, an entity charged with managing property expropriated by the revolutionary government, and the Pahlavi Foundation was renamed the Mostazafan Foundation of New York. The Foundation took on its present name in 1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since its inception, Alavi has purchased and maintained several properties in the United States, including a 36-story office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue in New York City (\u201cthe Building\u201d), the construction of which was financed by loans Alavi received from Bank Melli, a bank wholly owned by Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">650 Fifth Avenue Company (\u201c650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u201d or \u201cthe Partnership\u201d) is a partnership created under New York law in 1989 as part of a plan to relieve Alavi of tax obligations that it incurred as a result of the mortgages Bank Melli held on the Building. Specifically, Alavi, together with the Government of Iran, the Bonyad Mos-tazafan, and Bank Melli, agreed to a plan whereby Bank Melli used a chain of straw companies to enter into a partnership with Alavi. Through a series of circular transactions, instead of holding mortgages on the Budding, Bank Melli became a 35% (and eventually 40%) owner of 650 Fifth Ave. Co. and, thereby, a partial owner of the Building. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave., </em>14-2027, at 14-19 (discussing details of 1989 tax transaction). Alavi owns the other 60% of 650 Fifth Ave. Co. and, until 2008, served as 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s managing partner, administering the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership. <em>See id. </em>at 18-19 (describing ownership and management of Partnership). Although Assa Corporation, which was owned by Assa Company Limited (collectively, \u201cAssa\u201d), has always been Alavi\u2019s record partner in 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Bank Melli has owned the entities since their creation. <em>See id. </em>at 14-22 (explaining evidence of Bank Melli\u2019s relationship with Assa).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">In addition to ample record evidence of Bank Melli\u2019s involvement with Alavi, Assa, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., as detailed in our accompanying opinion, the record also indicates that other Iranian government entities and officials continued to exercise some control over Alavi\u2019s affairs after its creation in 1973. As relevant to this action, record evidence shows that (1) from 1982 to 1991, a Bonyad Mostazafan employee sat on Alavi\u2019s Board and provided reports about Alavi to Iran\u2019s Prime Minister or the head of the Bonyad Mostazafan every three months, <em>see In re 650 Fifth Ave., </em>14-2027, at 21-22; (2) in the early 1990s, Alavi\u2019s Board composition changed \u201cas directed by the Supreme Leader\u201d of Iran, <em>id.; </em>(3) around that same time, Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations exercised a \u201cposition of responsibility\u201d over Alavi\u2019s affairs, <em>id.; </em>and (4) in 2007, certain Alavi board members and Alavi\u2019s then-President, Farshid Jahedi, met with Iran\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>Ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, see <em>id. </em>at 27-28. Other record evidence, however, suggests that, at least in the 2000s, Alavi operated independently of Iran. See, <em>e.g., </em>App\u2019x 5705-07 (testimony of Alavi board member Abbas Mirakhor that Alavi\u2019s decisions were made by Alavi\u2019s Board and President without interference by Iran); App\u2019x 6565-66 (declaration of Alavi\u2019s financial manager Han-ieh Safakamal that Alavi managed own assets and chose own employees); App\u2019x 6652-53 (declaration of Alavi\u2019s program coordinator confirming lack of Iran\u2019s participation in Alavi\u2019s affairs).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">B. Relevant Sanctions Against Iran 1. Financial Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In March 1995 \u2014 six years after 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s formation \u2014 President Clinton issued a series of Executive Orders pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\u201cIEEPA\u201d), formally declaring the Government of Iran a threat to this nation\u2019s security and imposing broad financial sanctions. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 12,957, 60 Fed. Reg. 14615 (Mar. 15, 1995); Exec. Order No. 12,959, 60 Fed. Reg. 24757 (May 6, 1995). Those Executive Orders authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the financial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Pursuant to that authority, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) determined that Bank Melli was owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, and thus subjected it to, among other things, limitations on the receipt of services from U.S. financial institutions beginning June 6, 1995, except as authorized by an OFAC license. <em>See </em>Implementation of Executive Order No. 12959 With Respect to Iran, 60 Fed. Reg. 40881-02 (Aug. 10, 1995). OFAC also subsequently promulgated a series of Iranian Transactions Regulations (\u201cITRs\u201d) relevant to this action, which took effect on August 20, 1997, and which generally prohibit United States entities from conducting business with or providing services to \u201cthe Government of Iran.\u201d The \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d is defined in the ITRs as \u201c[t]he state and the Government of Iran, as well as any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof,\u201d \u201c[a]ny person owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the foregoing,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny person ... acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of the foregoing.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304 (2012); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 560.203, 560.204, 560.207, 560.208, 560.301. Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. are United States entities subject to these orders and regulations and prohibited thereby from conducting business with or providing services to Bank Melli or any other instrumentality owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, the Government of Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In 1995, after the first of the relevant Executive Orders imposing sanctions on Iran was issued, Bank Melli formally divested its ownership of Assa. Our accompanying opinion, <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave., </em>14-2027, held that there was no genuine dispute of fact that Assa was <em>owned or controlled </em>by the Government of Iran even after 1995. We also held, however, that a triable issue of fact exists as to whether Alavi provided services to Assa after 1995 <em>knowing </em>it was so owned or controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">2. Blocking Regime</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">In addition to conferring authority on the President to regulate and prohibit transactions to deal with threats to this nation\u2019s security, foreign policy, or economy, the IEEPA authorizes the President to block property to address such threats. <em>See </em>50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702. In 2012, President Obama, acting pursuant to the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>conferred on him under the IEEPA, issued Executive Order 13,599 \u201cto take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, particularly in light of the deceptive practices of the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks to conceal transactions of sanctioned parties.\u201d Exec. Order No. 13,599, 77 Fed. Reg. 6659, 6659 (Feb. 5, 2012) (hereinafter \u201cExec. Order 13,599\u201d). As relevant here, that Order states that \u201c[a]ll property and interests in property of the Government of Iran, including the Central Bank of Iran, that are in the United States ... <em>are blocked </em>and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.211 (implementing blocking order). The Order defines \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d to mean the \u201cGovernment of Iran, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof ... and any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran.\u201d Exec. Order 13,599.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">OFAC periodically publishes (1) a list of \u201cSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons\u201d (\u201cSDN List\u201d), and (2) since January 16, 2016, a list of persons whose property is blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13,599 because they satisfy Executive Order 13,599\u2019s definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d or \u201cIranian financial institution\u201d (\u201cExecutive Order 13,599 List\u201d). <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7560.211, Note 1 (2016). Defendants Alavi and ,650 Fifth Ave. Co. have never been named on either list. Bank Melli and Assa, however, have both been named on the SDN List: in 2007, Bank Melli was added to the SDN List pursuant to weapons of mass destruction (\u201cWMD\u201d) nonproliferation sanctions and, in 2008, Assa was added to the SDN List based on the Treasury Department\u2019s determination that Assa was a front company for Bank Melli.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">On January 16, 2016, the United States implemented the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (\u201cJCPOA\u201d), a multilateral agreement pursuant to which the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>viously imposed on Iran and removed various entities subject to those sanctions from the SDN List, including Bank Melli and Assa. <em>See </em>JCPOA Annex II; <em>see also id. </em>Attachment 3 (identifying Assa Co. Ltd., Assa Corp., and Bank Melli as entities removed from SDN List pursuant to JCPOA). Bank Melli was thereafter- added to the Executive Order 13,599 List. <em>See </em>OFAC, <em>List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599, </em>https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/ downloads/13599/135991ist.pdf (last visited July 9, 2016). The Treasury Department has explained that even after January 16, 2016, \u201cindividuals and entities meeting the definition of the Government of Iran or an Iranian financial institution [as defined in the ITRs], remain persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13599 and section 560.211\u201d of the ITRs and, accordingly, \u201cU.S. persons continue to be broadly prohibited from engaging in transactions or dealings with these individuals and entities.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, <em>Guidance Relating to the Lifting of Certain U.S. Sanctions Pursuant to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Implementation Day, </em>at 28 (Jan. 16, 2016), https://www.treasury.gov/ resourcecenter/sanctions/Programs/ Documents/implement_guide_jcpoa.pdf (hereinafter <em>\u201cJCPOA Guidance\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Plaintiffs began filing these turnover actions in December 2008, shortly after the Government initiated its civil forfeiture action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Though Plaintiffs and the Government both seek to seize Defendants\u2019 properties, they proceed on fundamentally different theories that require fundamentally different proofs. Plaintiffs hold money judgments <em>against Iran. </em>To take Defendants\u2019 properties under the FSIA or the TRIA, then, Plaintiffs must show (at least) that Defendants somehow <em>\u201care\u201d </em>Iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof as contemplated by those statutes. The Government, by contrast, must show that Defendants <em>committed a forfei-table offense </em>under the IEEPA, the ITRs, or the money laundering statutes, a burden that does not necessarily require proof that Defendants are the state of Iran or an agency or instrumentality thereof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Government need not and does not allege that Defendants \u201care\u201d Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Defendants opposed Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed attachments, moving for summary judgment in this turnover action on August 17, 2013. They argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs\u2019 FSIA or TRIA claims because neither Defendant meets the definition of a \u201cforeign state\u201d or an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of a foreign state under the FSIA, and, further, as to the TRIA claim, that Defendants\u2019 assets have not been seized or frozen by the United States. The District Court denied Defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Plaintiffs moved for an award of summary judgment and turnover of Defendants\u2019 properties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argued that the Defendants \u201care\u201d Iran because they meet the definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d set forth in Executive Order 13,599 and the implementing ITRs. <em>See </em>Exec. Order 13,599; 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">In an Opinion and Order,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the District Court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the turnover action because Defendants \u201care\u201d the foreign state of Iran for FSIA and TRIA purposes. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, </em>No. 08 Civ. 10934(KBF), 2014 WL 1516328 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2014) <em>(\u201cIn re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action\u201d). </em>The District Court\u2019s conclusion rested on three alternative grounds. First, the District Court ruled that Defendants met the definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d under Executive Order 13,599 and the ITRs, which definitions it concluded could be used to supplement the FSIA\u2019s definition of \u201cforeign state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10-11. Second, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>held that Defendants could also be considered a foreign state as the \u201calter egos\u201d of Iran. <em>Id. </em>at *12. Third, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>concluded that Defendants \u201care\u201d Iran because they satisfy the FSIA\u2019s definition of agency or instrumentality. <em>Id. </em>at *13-14. The District Court further ruled that because Defendants \u201care\u201d Iran, they are a \u201cterrorist party\u201d within the meaning of the TRIA, and their assets are \u201cblocked\u201d under Executive Order 13,599. <em>Id. </em>at *14-15. Based on these conclusions, the District Court granted Plaintiffs summary judgment on their FSIA and TRIA claims and ordered the turnover of Defendants\u2019 specified assets. Following entry of a final judgment, Defendants timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions under the FSIA, including whether a foreign state or its property is or is not shielded by immunity. <em>See Walters v. Indus. &amp; Commercial Bank of China, Ltd., </em>651 F.3d 280, 286 (2d Cir. 2011). \u201cWe accord deferential review to a district court ruling on a petition for an order of attachment or execution under the FSIA, and we will reverse only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285-86. A district court abuses its discretion \u201cif it applies legal standards incorrectly, relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, or proceeds on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">I. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The FSIA provides the exclusive basis for obtaining subject matter jurisdiction over a foreign state. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., </em>488 U.S. 428, 443, 109 S.Ct. 683, 102 L.Ed.2d 818 (1989). It states th\u00e1t foreign states \u201cshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this chapter.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604; <em>see Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>507 U.S. 349, 355, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">In the underlying actions giving rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 money judgments, district courts exercised subject matter jurisdiction over Iran pursuant to the Act\u2019s terrorism ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>eeption, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This exception abrogates immunity where \u201cmoney damages are sought against a foreign state for personal injury or death\u201d caused by certain acts, such as torture, extrajudicial killing, or material support thereof, if such acts are \u201cengaged in by an official, employee, or agent of such foreign state while acting within the scope of his or her office, employment, or agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where this exception applies, \u201cthe foreign state shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606; <em>see also Weinstein v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>609 F.3d 43, 48 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In addition to conferring a presumption of jurisdictional immunity on foreign sovereigns, the FSIA presumes attachment and execution immunity over a foreign sovereign\u2019s property. <em>See Walters, </em>651 F.3d at 287-88. Thus, where a valid judgment has been entered against a foreign state, the foreign state\u2019s United States property is immune from attachment and execution unless a statutory exception applies. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The District Court found three attachment exceptions applicable to Defendants: two under the FSIA, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1610(a)(7), 1610(g), and one under \u00a7 201 of the TRIA, codified as a note to \u00a7 1610 of the FSIA. Each provides instances where a foreign sovereign\u2019s property is attachable to satisfy terrorism-related judgments. Here, we address the first two exceptions for attachment and execution of a foreign state\u2019s property, FSIA \u00a7\u00a7 1610(a)(7), 1610(g); below, we address the applicability of \u00a7 201 of the TRIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">A. FSIA Exceptions: \u00a7 1610(g) and \u00a7 1610(a)(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Section 1610(g) strips FSIA attachment immunity from the property of a \u201cforeign state\u201d or of its \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d if the underlying judgment was entered under \u00a7 1605A\u2019s terrorism exception. Section 1610(a)(7) does the same with particular reference to property \u201cused for a commercial activity in the United States,\u201d where the underlying judgment was entered under either \u00a7 1605A or its predecessor. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1610(a)(7). Whether these exceptions afford attachment jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 turnover claims thus turns on the threshold question of whether Defendants may be deemed a \u201cforeign state\u201d or an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of a foreign state under the FSIA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">B. Foreign States under the FSIA</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">The FSIA does not define \u201cforeign state\u201d except to state that it \u201cincludes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection (b).\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a). Our Court has long construed \u201cforeign state\u201d as used in the FSIA to mean an entity bearing the \u201cattributes of statehood,\u201d which include a defined territory and population, self-governance and foreign relations, and the capacity to wage war and to enter into international agreements. <em>Morgan Guaranty Tr. Co. of N.Y. v. Republic of Palau (\u201cMorgan Guaran</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>ty\u201d), </em>924 F.2d 1237, 1243-44 (2d Cir. 1991) (citing <em>United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., </em>299 U.S. 304, 318-19, 57 S.Ct. 216, 81 L.Ed. 255 (1936), and Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 201 (1987)) (concluding that U.S. trust territory of Palau was not foreign state within meaning of FSIA because, although it bore some attributes of statehood, it lacked ability to maintain diplomatic ties, enter into treaties, and join other states in making international law); <em>see Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille Lauro Ed Altri-Gestione Motonave Achille Lauro in Amministrazione </em>Straordinaria, 937 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1991) (rejecting FSIA defense of Palestine Liberation Organization because it did not meet definition of \u201cforeign state\u201d as one that has \u201ca defined territory and a permanent population, under the control of its own government, and that engages in, or has the capacity to engage in, formal relations with other such entities\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The Supreme Court has cited these traditional sovereign characteristics in concluding that Somalia\u2019s former prime minister could not be sued as a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA in a suit brought by Somali victims of governmental abuse in the 1980s. <em>Samantar v. Yousuf, </em>560 U.S. 305, 308, 314-15, 130 S.Ct. 2278, 176 L.Ed.2d 1047 (2010). The Court traced the history of sovereign immunity from the common law through the enactment of the FSIA, analyzed the text and legislative history of the statute, and concluded that the FSIA codified a \u201crestrictive theory of sovereign immunity,\u201d with \u201c[t]he term \u2018foreign state\u2019 on its face indicatpng] a body politic that governs a particular territory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 130 S.Ct. 2278 (citing Restatement (Seo-ond) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 4 (1964-1965)). Following this controlling precedent here, we conclude that Defendants, a New York-registered foundation and similarly registered partnership, themselves bear none of the attributes of statehood and, thus, cannot be equated to the foreign state of Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In concluding otherwise, the District Court relied on Executive Order 13,599, which defines the \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d to include \u201cany person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran.\u201d Exec. Order 13,599. Similarly, the ITRs\u2019 \u201cGeneral Definitions\u201d subchapter defines the \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d to include \u201c[a]ny person to the extent that such person is, or has been, since the effective date, acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of the [Government of Iran].\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304. This reliance on Executive Branch definitions to construe \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA raises several concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">First, <em>Morgan Guaranty </em>did not bless the use of just any \u201cother sources\u201d in divining the meaning of \u201cforeign state.\u201d 924 F.2d at 1243. In <em>Morgan Guaranty, </em>we looked specifically to international law in identifying the \u201cattributes of statehood\u201d that define a \u201cforeign state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1243-44. <em>Morgan Guaranty </em>did not invite courts to substitute other sources for the ones it employed and thereby to reach a different conclusion from the one dictated by that case in construing the identical statutory term.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Second, Executive Order 13,599 expressly states that its expansive definition of the Government of Iran is \u201c[f]or the purpose of this order.\u201d Exec. Order 13,599. The Order and its implementing ITRs were designed principally to further the United States\u2019 sanctioning regime against Iran. <em>See </em>31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304. Nowhere do those sources purport to supplement the FSIA\u2019s definition of a foreign state. Thus, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>elude that these Executive Branch definitions, however helpful in identifying forfei-table offenses, cannot be used to expand sovereign statehood under the FSIA for a single \u201cforeign state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">This conclusion is consistent with a principal purpose of the FSIA, namely, \u201cto transfer the determination of sovereign immunity from the executive branch to the judicial branch, thereby reducing the foreign policy implications of immunity determinations and assuring litigants that these often crucial decisions are made on purely legal grounds and under procedures that insure due process.\u201d H,R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at *7 (1976), <em>reprinted, in </em>1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6606; <em>see also Samantar, </em>560 U.S. at 323 n. 19, 130 S.Ct. 2278 (noting that the State Department \u201csought and supported the elimination of its role with respect to claims against foreign states and their agencies or instrumentalities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In borrowing from Executive Branch definitions of Iran, the District Court erroneously reasoned that the key question here is not whether Iran is a foreign state (it certainly is), but \u201cwhether the [D]efen-dants have acted in such a manner as to render them, too, equivalent to Iran.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *11. That miscast the relevant inquiry for determining if a defendant satisfies the definition of \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA, which asks whether that defendant itself possesses of the attributes of statehood long established in international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\"><em>Samantar </em>illustrates this seemingly semantic but enormously substantive distinction. Somalia, like Iran, is certainly a \u201cforeign state,\u201d but in considering whether Somalia\u2019s former prime minister was a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA, the Supreme Court did not ask, as the District Court did here, \u201cwhether the defendant ] ... acted in such a manner as to render [him] ... equivalent to [the state].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly rejected an argument urging that line of inquiry. <em>See Samantar, </em>560 U.S. at 318-19, 130 S.Ct. 2278. Instead, the Court\u2019s inquiry turned on whether the defendant bore traditional attributes of statehood (or otherwise qualified as a subdivision, agency, or <em>instrumentality) </em>\u2014 not on whether the defendant acted sufficiently on behalf of the foreign state. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">In sum, we conclude that a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA is not properly defined by reference to an Executive Order authorizing broad sanctions on a particular country. Rather, it is, defined according to established constructions of the term. Because there is no question here that Defendants lack the traditional attributes of statehood, they are not themselves \u201cforeign states.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">C. Agencies or Instrumentalities of a Foreign State under the FSIA</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The FSIA does, however, reach beyond the international law understanding of foreign states to the extent it includes within that term, for FSIA purposes, a foreign state\u2019s agents or instrumentalities. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a) (stating that \u201c \u2018foreign state\u2019 ... includes ... an agency or instrumentality\u201d thereof). The FSIA defines \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">(a) An \u201cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u201d means any entity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any third country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b). All three statutory elements must be satisfied to render an entity an agency or instrumentality under the FSIA. Because jurisdiction \u201cdepends upon the state of things at the time ... the action [is] brought,\u201d <em>Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, </em>538 U.S. 468, 478, 123 S.Ct. 1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), an entity\u2019s agency or instrumentality status under the FSIA \u201cis determined at the time of the filing of the complaint,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 480, 123 S.Ct. 1655, and not necessarily \u201cas of the time an alleged tort or other actionable wrong occurred,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 471, 123 S.Ct. 1655.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Defendants argue that the District Court erred in its alternative ruling that, as a matter of law, they each \u201cfall within the definition of an \u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign state\u2019 under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b), and in turn constitute a \u2018foreign state\u2019 itself within the meaning of the FSIA.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *13. Defendants do not dispute that they are \u201cseparate legal person[s], corporate or otherwise,\u201d from Iran and thus that they meet the first prong for FSIA agency or instrumentality status under \u00a7 1603(b)(1). They do argue, however, that they are not \u201corgan[s]\u201d of, or majority owned by, Iran under \u00a7 1603(b)(2), and that they are U.S. citizens exempted from FSIA agency or instrumentality status under \u00a7 1603(b)(3). Because we agree with the latter argument, we need not address the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">To qualify as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under the FSIA, \u00a7 1603(b)(3) states that the person or entity cannot be \u201ca citizen of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(3). Section 1332(c) defines the citizenship of corporations (and representatives of decedents\u2019 estates). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1332(c). Section 1332(e) defines what is meant by \u201cStates.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1332(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">In deciding that the Defendants were not \u201ccitizen[s] of a State of the United States\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1603(b)(3), the District Court stated that it was \u201cmindful that the Shah incorporated the Foundation in New York in 1973, and that the partnership was created in New York.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *13. The District Court nonetheless deemed Defendants citizens of Iran under the equitable \u201calter ego\u201d principles set forth in <em>First Nat\u2019l City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba (\u201cBancec\u201d), </em>462 U.S. 611, 103 S.Ct. 2591, 77 L.Ed.2d 46 (1983), which permit courts to disregard defendants\u2019 corporate form when \u201c\u2018the doctrine of corporate entity ... would work fraud or injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *13 (quoting <em>Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 629, 103 S.Ct. 2591). The court reasoned that \u201c[t]o allow [Defendants\u2019] corporate status as American entities to dominate their actual function as organs of Iran would violate the [fraud or injustice] principles\u201d set forth in <em>Bancec. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">As an initial matter, we note that Plaintiffs do not here challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1603(b)(3) would ordinarily preclude Alavi, a New York-based corporation, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., a New York-based partnership, from satisfying the FSIA\u2019s definition of agency or instrumentality. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *13-14. Indeed, even when moving for summary judgment before the District Court, Plaintiffs did not argue that Defendants satisfied \u00a7 1603(b)\u2019s definition of \u201cagencies or instrumentalities.\u201d On appeal, Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>argue only that the District Court \u201cproperly disregarded the fact that Defendants are ... citizens of [New York].\u201d Acosta Appellees Br. 108-12. Thus, we assume without deciding that Defendants cannot satisfy \u00a7 1603(b)(3) unless <em>Bancec </em>can properly be applied to disregard an entity\u2019s citizenship.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">We conclude that <em>Bancec </em>cannot be so applied to \u00a7 1603(b)(3), which unambiguously exempts from FSIA agency or instrumentality status all \u201ccitizen[s] of a State of the United States as defined in section 1332(c) and (e) of this title.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(3). As explained <em>infra, Bancec\u2019s </em>\u201cfraud or injustice\u201d exception is appropriately considered in entertaining challenges to the presumption of corporate separateness and alter ego status, as was the case in <em>Bancec </em>itself. It is not a basis for questioning corporate citizenship in the context of determining agency or instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>mentality status as defined in the FSIA. <em>See Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 629, 103 S.Ct. 2591.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Accordingly, because (1) Plaintiffs do not here challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 1603(b)(3) would ordinarily preclude Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., both U.S.-based entities, from satisfying the FSIA\u2019s definition of agency or instrumentality, and (2) <em>Bancec </em>cannot be used to disregard \u00a7 1603(b)(3)\u2019s exemption of U.S.citizen entities from that definition, we conclude that Defendants are statutorily disqualified as agencies or instrumentalities of Iran under FSIA \u00a7\u00a7 1610(a)(7) and 1610(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">D. Alter Ego Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The District Court also used <em>Bancec </em>separately to conclude that, regardless of Defendants\u2019 status as agencies or instru-mentalities of Iran, they are Iran\u2019s alter egos and, therefore, jurisdiction properly lies over Defendants just as it would over Iran. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *12. Defendants fault the District Court\u2019s conclusion on two grounds: (1) Bancec\u2019s alter ego analysis does not permit a court to expand FSIA jurisdiction to reach entities that do not otherwise satisfy that statute\u2019s definition of \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d and (2) in any event, the record evidence is insufficient to establish that Defendants are alter egos of Iran. Although we disagree with the first argument, we agree with the second and, accordingly, conclude as a matter of law that Defendants cannot be equated to the foreign state of Iran under <em>Bancec.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">In arguing that Bancec\u2019s alter ego principles cannot provide jurisdiction over an entity that does not otherwise satisfy the FSIA\u2019s agency or instrumentality definition, Defendants maintain that the issue in <em>Bancec </em>was whether an entity that indisputably qualified as an agency or instrumentality could be held substantively liable for the debts of a foreign state despite its separate incorporation and juridical status. In <em>Bancec, </em>a Cuban government-owned trade bank sued an American bank to collect an unpaid debt, and the American bank counterclaimed, asserting a right to offset the value of foreign assets that had been nationalized by the Cuban government. <em>See Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 613-15, 103 S.Ct. 2591. The Cuban bank, relying on its separate juridical status, asserted that it could not be held liable for Cuba\u2019s debts. <em>See id. </em>at 613, 103 S.Ct. 2591. The Supreme Court disagreed and, although recognizing the presumption that \u201cgovernment instrumentalities established as juridical entities distinct and independent from their sovereign should normally be treated as such,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 626-27, 103 S.Ct. 2591, held that the presumption could be rebutted, and an alter ego relationship established, if (1) the instrumentality \u201cis so extensively controlled by its owner that a relationship of principal and agent is created,\u201d or (2) the recognition of an instrumentality\u2019s separate legal status would work a \u201cfraud or injustice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 629, 103 S.Ct. 2591 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Defendants\u2019 argument that this alter ego test cannot be used to establish FSIA jurisdiction is foreclosed by <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Braspetro Oil Services Co., </em>199 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. 1999) (per curiam). There, we adopted the district court\u2019s reasoning in affirming a finding of FSIA jurisdiction over a party (Brasoil) based on Bancec\u2019s alter ego analysis. <em>See U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Braspetro Oil Servs. Co., </em>No. 97 Civ. 6124(JGK), 1999 WL 307666, at *7-11 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 1999), <em>aff'd, U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Braspetro Oil Servs., </em>199 F.3d 94 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>1999).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Brasoil itself failed to satisfy the FSIA\u2019s agency or instrumentality test because it was not majority-owned by a foreign state of an organ of a foreign state, and was created under the laws of a third country. <em>See U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. v. Braspetro Oil Servs., </em>1999 WL 307666, at *6-7. The court nonetheless concluded that Brasoil was a foreign state under the FSIA because it was the alter ego of two entities (Petrobras and Braspetro) that constituted \u201cforeign states\u201d under the FSIA by virtue of their status as agencies or instrumentalities of Brazil. <em>See id. </em>at *7, 9, 11.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court explained that \u201c[a]l-though <em>Bancee </em>dealt with the ability of an American corporation which was sued by an instrumentality of Cuba to set off its own liabilities against the liabilities of Cuba, courts have applied <em>Bancee </em>to determine FSIA jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7 n. 5. Accordingly, the court determined that this non-agency or instrumentality could be considered a foreign state under alter ego analysis, and denied Brasoil\u2019s motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at *6-7, 11-14. Defendants\u2019 argument that they are legally foreclosed from qualifying as Iran\u2019s alter egos for jurisdictional purposes, therefore, fails.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Nevertheless, we conclude that there is no record evidence that Alavi and, therefore, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., of which Alavi owns 60%, is \u201cso extensively controlled by [Iran] that a relationship of principal and agent is created.\u201d <em>Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 629, 103 S.Ct. 2591. The \u201ctouchstone inquiry for \u2018extensive control\u2019 \u201d is \u201cwhether the sovereign state exercise[d] significant and repeated control over the instrumentality\u2019s day-to-day operations.\u201d <em>EM Ltd. v. Banco Central de la Republica Argentina, </em>800 F.3d 78, 91 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Cir. 2015). The factors relevant to this inquiry include \u201cwhether the sovereign nation: (1) uses the instrumentality\u2019s property as its own; (2) ignores the instrumentality\u2019s separate status or ordinary corporate formalities; (3) deprives the instrumentality of the independence from close political control that is generally enjoyed by government agencies; (4) requires the instrumentality to obtain approvals for ordinary business decisions from a political actor; and (5) issues policies or directives that cause the instrumentality to act directly on behalf of the sovereign state.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Here, the record evidence cited by the District Court and Plaintiffs indicates, at most, Iran\u2019s high-level involvement in Ala-vi\u2019s affairs: (1) the Shah created Alavi in 1973, (2) the Bonyad Mostazafan and Bank Melli assisted Alavi in resolving its tax problem in the 1980s, (3) the Ayatollah directed the removal of certain board members, (4) Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations had some supervisory role,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (5) one Bonyad Mostazafan employee sat on the Alavi board. This evidence, however, is insufficient to demonstrate Iran\u2019s <em>disregard </em>for Alavi\u2019s separate corporate form, <em>see EM Ltd., </em>800 F.3d at 91, much less Iran\u2019s exercise of <em>day-to-day </em>control over Alavi. Indeed, Plaintiffs fail to identify any record evidence suggesting such control. <em>See id. </em>at 92-94 (concluding that allegations that the \u201cPresident ... appointed] [Argentina\u2019s central bank\u2019s] officers for an unspecified period without Senate approval and ... remov[ed] BCRA governors who supported the central bank\u2019s independence from the executive branch,\u201d and that Argentina sought assistance of bank in responding to debt crisis were insufficient to show day-to-day control under <em>Bancec); cf. McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>52 F.3d- 346, 351-52 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (concluding that <em>Bancec </em>presumption of separateness was rebutted where government entities \u201cheld 52 percent of [the corporation\u2019s] stock and controlled six of the seven seats on its board of directors,\u201d government shareholders \u201cforced the [corporation] to disregard its commercial missions,\u201d and Iran influenced \u201c[r]outine business decisions, such as declaring and paying dividends to shareholders and honoring [the corporation\u2019s] contractual commitments\u201d). Thus, given the lack of evidence demonstrating Iran\u2019s day-to-day control of Alavi, we conclude, as a matter of law, that Defendants cannot be deemed Iran\u2019s alter egos under Bancec,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>II. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The TRIA provides jurisdiction for execution and attachment proceedings to satisfy a judgment for which there was original jurisdiction under the FSIA if certain statutory elements are satisfied. Weinstein, 609 F.3d at 52. Section 201(a) of the TRIA sets forth these required elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in subsection (b), in every case in which a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism, or for which a terrorist party is not immune under [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(7) ], the blocked assets of that terrorist party (including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party) shall be subject to execution or attachment in aid of execution in order to satisfy such judgment to the extent of any compensatory damages for which such terrorist party has been adjudged liable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">TRIA \u00a7 201(a), Pub. L. No. 107-297, sec. 201(a), 116 Stat. 2322, 2337-40 (2012) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 note). Here, neither party disputes that there was original jurisdiction under the FSIA for the Plaintiffs\u2019 underlying judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Thus, to attach Defendants\u2019 properties under the TRIA, Plaintiffs must show (1) that the Defendants are a \u201cterrorist party\u201d or an \u201cagency or instrumentality of that terrorist party,\u201d and (2) that the Defendants\u2019 properties are \u201cblocked assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the same reasons we rejected the conclusion that Defendants \u201care\u201d the foreign state of Iran for purposes of the FSIA, we reach that same conclusion insofar as the state of Iran is a designated \u201cterrorist party\u201d under the TRIA. We conclude, however, that insofar as the attachment jurisdiction of both statutes also reaches an \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d of Iran, the FSIA\u2019s definition of that phrase in \u00a7 1603(b) does not apply to the TRIA. Therefore, our conclusion that Defendants cannot be deemed agencies or instrumen-talities of Iran under the FSIA does not prevent Defendants from qualifying as agencies or instrumentalities of Iran under the TRIA. We nevertheless remand the case for further proceedings because material questions of fact preclude a summary judgment determination that (1) Defendants are, indeed, agencies or instrumen-talities for TRIA purposes, and (2) their properties are \u201cblocked assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">A. Terrorist Parties under the TRIA</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Under the TRIA, three entities qualify as a \u201cterrorist party\u201d: (1) \u201ca terrorist,\u201d (2) \u201ca terrorist organization (as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [ (\u201cINA\u201d) ] (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi))),\u201d or (3) \u201ca foreign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) or section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371).\u201d TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(4). Iran is a \u201cforeign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism\u201d under TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(4), making it a \u201cterrorist party\u201d for TRIA purposes. <em>See </em>Determination Pursuant to Section 6(i) of the Export Administration Act of 1979\u2014Iran, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>49 Fed. Reg. 2836-02 (Jan. 28, 1984); <em>accord Weinstein, </em>609 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The District Court held that Defendants also qualify as a \u201cterrorist party\u201d under the TRIA. Its reasoning was as follows: (1) Iran has been designated as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism\u201d since 1984, and therefore is a \u201cterrorist party\u201d within the meaning of TRIA,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (2) Defendants \u201care\u201d Iran, and thus are a terrorist party within the meaning of TRIA. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *14. In reaching the latter conclusion, the District Court appears to have relied on its FSIA analysis, <em>i.e., </em>that Defendants \u201care\u201d the foreign state of Iran because they (1) satisfy Executive Order 13,599\u2019s definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran,\u201d (2) satisfy the FSIA\u2019s definition of agencies or instru-mentalities, and (3) are alter egos of Iran under <em>Bancec. </em>We have already explained why we reject each of those conclusions. Accordingly, because Defendants are not themselves a \u201cforeign state designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d for their properties to be subject to TRIA attachment and execution, Defendants must be \u201cagencies or instrumentalities\u201d of Iran under TRIA \u00a7 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">B. Agencies or Instrumentalities of a Terrorist Party under the TRIA</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Section 201(a) of the TRIA confers an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over post-judgment execution and attachment proceedings against property held in the hands of an agency or instrumentality of the terrorist party, even if the agency or instrumentality is not itself named in the judgment. <em>Weinstein, </em>609 F.3d at 50. As this Court has previously explained, this basis for subject matter jurisdiction derives from the plain language of TRIA \u00a7 201(a), which \u201cclearly differentiates between the party that is the subject of the underlying judgment itself, which can be any terrorist party (here, Iran), and parties whose blocked assets are subject to execution or attachment, which can include not only the terrorist party but also \u2018any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. Thus, the fact that Plaintiffs obtained their underlying judgments against <em>Iran, </em>not specifically against <em>Alavi </em>or <em>650 Fifth Ave. Co., </em>does not prevent Plaintiffs from attaching Defendants\u2019 properties under the TRIA if, <em>inter alia, </em>Defendants qualify as agencies or instrumentalities of Iran under the TRIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">While the FSIA defines \u201cagency or instrumentality,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the TRIA, unfortunately, does not. Defendants argue that because the TRIA is codified as part of the FSIA, the terms \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d have the same meaning in the TRIA as they do in the FSIA. See Appellants Br. 32. The \u201cnormal rule of statutory interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>tation\u201d is \u201cthat identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning.\u201d <em>See IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, </em>546 U.S. 21, 34, 126 S.Ct. 514, 163 L.Ed.2d 288 (2005). But this rule is \u201cnot rigid,\u201d and \u201cthe meaning of identical words well may vary to meet the purposes of the law.\u201d <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162, 171 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, a statutory provision\u2019s placement in a particular section \u201ccannot substitute for the operative text of the statute.\u201d <em>Fla. Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., </em>554 U.S. 33, 47, 128 S.Ct. 2326, 171 L.Ed.2d 203 (2008). Indeed, \u201c[n]o accepted canon of statutory interpretation permits \u2018placement\u2019 to trump text, especially where ... the text is clear and our reading of it is fully supported by the legislative history.\u201d <em>Padilla v. Rumsfeld, </em>352 F.3d 695, 721 (2d Cir. 2003), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds by Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Although both the FSIA and the TRIA permit property in the United States held by certain \u201cagencies or instrumentalities\u201d to be attached, under the FSIA the entity must be an \u201cagency or instrumentality of a <em>foreign state,\u201d </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b) (emphasis added), whereas, under the TRIA, the entity must be an \u201cagency or instrumentality of th[e] <em>terrorist party.\u201d </em>TRIA \u00a7 201(a) (emphasis added). Thus, the text of the TRIA unambiguously reaches more broadly to permit the attachment of property in circumstances not covered by the FSIA or FSIA immunity. <em>See Weinstein, </em>609 F.3d at 50; <em>see also Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, </em>709 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir. 2013). Specifically, unlike the FSIA, the TRIA permits attachment and execution against individual \u201cter-rorises]\u201d and \u201cterrorist organization^]\u201d (and <em>their </em>agencies and instrumentalities). TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(4). Individual terrorists and many terrorist organizations encompassed in the TRIA\u2019s definition of \u201cterrorist party\u201d are distinguishable from FSIA foreign states and their agencies and in-strumentalities in an important respect: they can be <em>non-state actors. See </em>TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(4) (defining \u201cterrorist party\u201d to include \u201ca terrorist,\u201d and \u201ca terrorist organization (as defined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the [INA] (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi))\u201d); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi) (section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the INA, defining \u201cterrorist organization\u201d to encompass nonstate terrorist entities)); <em>Ruth Calderon-Cardona v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>867 F.Supp.2d 389, 394 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (noting that while \u201cterrorist\u201d is not further defined in TRIA, term has been interpreted to require that individual be \u201cnatural person\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 394 (observing that Section 212(a)(3)(b)(vi) of the INA \u201cis' aimed at non-governmental groups like al Qaeda and Hezbollah, not foreign states\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Precis\u00e9ly because TRIA \u00a7 201 encompasses non-state actors and, thus, reaches more broadly than the FSIA, it would contravene a plain reading of the TRIA to cabin its reach by applying the FSIA\u2019s definition of agency or instrumentality\u2014 which requires a foreign state principal. <em>See Corley v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 314, 129 S.Ct. 1558, 173 L.Ed.2d 443 (2009) (noting that \u201ca statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, we agree with the Eleventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Circuit that \u201capplying the FSIA\u2019s definition of agencies or instrumentalities to TRIA would leave only terrorist states as potential sponsors of agencies or instru-mentalities under TRIA \u00a7 201, eviscerating TRIA\u2019s effectiveness vis-\u00e1-vis non-state terrorist organizations.\u201d <em>Stansell v. Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, </em>771 F.3d 713, 731 (11th Cir. 2014). That \u201ccannot stand, as TRIA\u2019s definition clearly contemplates nonstate judgment debtors being subjected to TRIA execution.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">We recognize that where, as here, the alleged terrorist party is a <em>foreign state </em>designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, as opposed to an individual terrorist or non-state terrorist organization, applying the FSIA\u2019s definition of \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d to the TRIA might appear less problematic. <em>See </em>TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(4). Just as with non-state terrorist organizations, however, state sponsors of terrorism may operate with less transparency than other sovereign countries, making application of \u00a7 1603(b)(3)\u2019s factors unrealistic. <em>See Stansell, </em>771 F.3d at 732 (noting that state-owned enterprises generally have clear ownership structures \u201cthat make[] application of \u00a7 1603(b) feasible,\u201d while \u201cterrorist organizations ... operate in the shadows out of necessity,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>\u201ca corporation organized under Florida law will almost certainly not list [a terrorist organization] as a shareholder of record\u201d but, rather, \u201cwill operate through layers of affiliated individuals and front companies\u201d); Exec. Order 13,599 (explaining additional steps necessary to address Iran\u2019s threat to this nation due to \u201cdeceptive practices\u201d used by Iran and its banks to \u201cconceal transactions of sanctioned parties\u201d); U.S. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, Press Release, Treasury Designates Bank Melli Front Company in New York City, http://www.treasury.gov/presscenter/ press-releases/Pages/hpl330.aspx (last visited July 8, 2016) (explaining \u201cscheme to use a front company set up by Bank Mel-li \u2014 a known proliferator [of weapons of mass destruction] \u2014 to funnel money from the United States to Iran\u201d in violation of sanctions (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Thus, we conclude that \u00a7 1603(b) of the FSIA does not apply selectively to foreign states designated as a state sponsor of terrorism under the TRIA. The plain language of the TRIA refers only to \u201cthe blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party,\u201d and does not differentiate among the variety of entities that might qualify as a \u201cterrorist party.\u201d <em>See </em>TRIA \u00a7\u00a7 201(a), 201(d)(4). It is against the background of this statutory structure that we determine that Congress did not intend for FSIA \u00a7 1603(b) to apply selectively to the TRIA. Thus, because the FSIA definition of \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d \u2014 and specifically the three requirements specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b) \u2014 do not pertain to those terms in the TRIA, our conclusion that Defendants cannot be agents or instrumentalities of the \u201cforeign state\u201d of Iran for purposes of FSIA jurisdiction does not foreclose Defendants being agencies or instrumentalities of Iran as a designated terrorist party under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>TRIA. Defendants\u2019 argument for reversal on this ground fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">At the same time, however, questions of fact preclude a TRIA award in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor as a matter of law. Because the terms \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d are undefined under the TRIA, we construe these words according to their ordinary meanings. <em>See, e.g., Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 182 L.Ed.2d 903 (2012); <em>see also Stansell, </em>771 F.3d at 732 (using \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d of \u201cagency\u201d and \u201cinstrumentality\u201d in TRIA \u00a7 201). We determine the ordinary meaning of these terms in light of the statutory text of the TRIA as a whole. <em>See Deutsche Bank Nat\u2019l Trust Co. v. Quicken Loans Inc., </em>810 F.3d 861, 868 (2d Cir. 2015) (\u201c[SJtatutory interpretation must begin with the plain language, giving all undefined terms their ordinary meaning while attempting to ascertain how a reasonable reader would understand the statutory text, considered as a whole.\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u201cInstrumentality\u201d is a means through which a function of another entity is accomplished, analogous to a branch of a governing body. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cinstrumentality\u201d as \u201ca means or [a]gency through which a function of another entity is accomplished, such as a branch of a governing body\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1172 (1993) (defining instrumentality as \u201csomething that serves as an intermediary or agent through which one or more functions of a controlling force are carried out: a part, organ, or subsidiary branch esp. of a governing body\u201d); <em>OED Online, Oxford University Press, </em>June 2016 (defining instrumentality as \u201c[t]hat which serves or is employed for some purpose or end; a means, an agency\u201d); Mer<em>riam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary </em>22 (10th ed. 1993) (defining instrumentality as a \u201cmeans\u201d or an \u201cagency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">\u201cAgency\u201d is an entity acting on another\u2019s behalf or providing a particular service on another\u2019s behalf. <em>See OED Online, Oxford University Press, </em>June 2016 (defining agency as \u201c[a] person or organization acting on behalf of another, or providing a particular service\u201d); <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1172 (1993) (defining agency as \u201ca person or thing through which power is exerted or an end is achieved\u201d); <em>Mernam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary </em>22 (10th ed. 1993) (defining agency as \u201ca person or thing through which power is exerted or achieved\u201d). As ordinarily understood, an entity that is an \u201cagency\u201d or an \u201cinstrumentality\u201d is distinct from, even if a part of, the entity for which the agency or instrumentality is acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">To demonstrate that Defendants are \u201cagencies or instrumentalities\u201d of a terrorist party under the TRIA, therefore, Plaintiffs must show that each Defendant (1) was a means through which a material function of the terrorist party is accomplished, (2) provided material services to, on behalf of, or in support of the terrorist party, <em>or </em>(3) was owned, controlled, or directed by the terrorist party.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See Stansell, </em>771 F.3d at 723 (explaining that party seeking to execute against assets of terrorist party\u2019s agency or instrumentality under TRIA \u201cmust ... establish that the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>ported agency or instrumentality is actually an agency or instrumentality\u201d). Neither in the District Court nor before this Court have the parties addressed whether, to satisfy the TRIA\u2019s definition of agency or instrumentality, Plaintiffs must here show that Defendants knew, or reasonably should have known, that they were functioning for, providing material services on behalf of, or being owned, controlled, or directed by the terrorist party (here, Iran). Nor have they addressed whether an innocent-owner-type defense would be available to a terrorist\u2019s agency or instrumentality. <em>Cf. </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 988(d) (providing for innocent-owner defense to civil forfeiture where third-party claimant proves by preponderance of evidence that he \u201c(i) did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture; or (ii) upon learning of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, did all that reasonably could be expected under the circumstances to terminate such use of the property\u201d). We do not decide these questions here, leaving them for further consideration on remand. We note only that whether Defendants satisfied any one of the identified aspects of agency or instrumentality is a disputed question of fact in this case. Although the record demonstrates as a matter of law that Bank Melli owned and controlled Assa even after 1995, such that Alavi was providing services to Bank Melli (and, therefore, Iran) through the time of the filing of the civil forfeiture complaint, questions of fact persist as to whether Alavi did so with knowledge. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave., </em>14-2027, at 56-59.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Further, insofar as Plaintiffs contend that Alavi itself was sufficiently owned, controlled, or directed by Iran to render it an agency or instrumentality of a terrorist party under the TRIA, questions of fact exist as to whether Alavi was so owned, controlled, or directed at the time Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints were filed. <em>See Dole Food Co., </em>538 U.S. at 480, 123 S.Ct. 1655. Although there is record evidence that Iran created Alavi in 1973, supervised its Board in the 1980s and 1990s, and controlled its affairs to a certain extent around that same time, the only recent record evidence of Iran\u2019s control is a 2007 meeting between Alavi board members, Alavi\u2019s then-President Farshid Jahedi, and Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, at which Plaintiffs contend Kha-zaee instructed Jahedi with respect to Ala-vi\u2019s management. A set of notes dated October 5, 2007, purportedly from that meeting, however, are too ambiguous to support a matter-of-law conclusion that Iran controlled Alavi at that time. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave., </em>14-2027, at 27-28 (explaining that authorship of notes is unknown and speaker referenced therein is unclear). Moreover, in urging that Iran does not control Alavi, Defendants highlight, among other things, the testimony of Abbas Mirakhor, an Alavi board member from 1991 through 2005, who maintained that Alavi\u2019s decisions were made by its Board and President without interference by Iran, <em>see </em>App\u2019x 5705-07; the declaration of Hanieh Safakamal, Alavi\u2019s financial manager since April 2000, who stated that Alavi managed its own assets and chose its own employees, <em>see </em>App\u2019x at 6565-66; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the declaration of Ali Aliabadi, Alavi\u2019s program coordinator since 2005, who confirmed the lack of Iran\u2019s participation in Alavi\u2019s affairs, <em>see </em>App\u2019x 6652-53. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Defendants as we must on summary judgment review, <em>see Cortes, </em>802 F.3d at 228, we conclude that questions of fact as to the extent of Iran\u2019s control over Alavi at the relevant time require vacatur of the District Court\u2019s judgment in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor. This conclusion is not inconsistent with our matter-of-law determination that Defendants are not the alter egos of Iran, <em>see supra </em>at 128-31, 128 S.Ct. 2326, because \u201c[t]he level of state control required to establish an \u2018alter ego\u2019 relationship is more extensive than that required to establish ... \u2018agency,\u2019 \u201d <em>U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

The TRIA defines \u201cblocked asset\u201d as \u201cany asset seized or frozen by the United States under section 5(b) of the Trading With the Enemy Act [ (\u201cTWEA\u201d) ] (50 U.S.C.

Both blocking regimes \u201cauthorize the President to freeze the assets of foreign enemy states and their agencies and instrumentalities\u201d in order to \u201cput control of foreign assets in the hands of the President so that he may dispose of them in the manner that best furthers the United States\u2019 foreign-relations and national-security interests.\u201d <em>Bank Markazi v. Peterson, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1310, 1318, 194 L.Ed.2d 463 (2016). (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">Defendants argue that their assets are not blocked as required for TRIA attachment because Defendants have not been added to the SDN List and the United States does not have a possessory interest in their assets.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth herein, we conclude that (1) all assets belonging to an entity that satisfies Executive Order 13,599\u2019s definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d are automatically blocked, regardless of whether that entity is on the SDN or Executive Order 13,599 List, but (2) whether Defendants satisfy that definition depends on the resolution of disputed questions of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">First, the relevant Executive Order and implementing ITRs undermine the argument that an entity\u2019s assets qualify as \u201cblocked assets\u201d only if that entity is on the SDN List or Executive Order 13,599 List.

In explaining that the Central Bank of Iran\u2019s properties are \u201cblocked assets\u201d under the TRIA, the Court did not rely on the bank\u2019s SDN status or its inclusion on the Executive Order 13,599 List but, rather, explained that the President invoked his IEEPA authority in Executive Order 13,599 and \u201cblock[ed] \u2018[a]ll property and interests in property of any Iranian financial institution, including the Central Bank of Iran, that are in the United States.\u2019 \u201d 136 S.Ct. at 1318 (quoting Exec.

Accordingly, if Defendants satisfy Executive Order 13,599\u2019s definition of Government of Iran, their assets are automatically blocked pursuant to that Order regardless of whether they are on the SDN List or Executive Order 13,599 List.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Nor are we persuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that, even assuming Executive Order 13,599 blocks all property belonging to the \u201cGovernment of Iran,\u201d that does not render that property blocked within the meaning of TRIA because it is not \u201cseized or frozen by the United States\u201d pursuant to the IEEPA. In so arguing, Defendants rely on <em>Smith v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, </em>346 F.3d 264 (2d Cir. 2003), in which we explained that, for purposes of the TRIA, \u201c[t]o seize or freeze assets transfers <em>possessory </em>interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">As an initial matter, we agree with Defendants that the District Court erred in concluding that Defendants\u2019 assets were \u201cseized or frozen\u201d within the meaning of the TRIA because \u201cthe Court-appointed Monitor and Interim Trustee,\u201d who has control over Defendants\u2019 properties, had obtained a \u201cpossessory interest\u201d in those properties. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Private Action, </em>2014 WL 1516328, at *15. As relevant here, the plain text of the TRIA permits attachment of assets \u201cseized or frozen by the United States ... under sections 202 and 203 of the [IEEPA].\u201d TRIA \u00a7 201(d)(2)(A). It does not \u201creach those funds which the government has been given authorization to control through another means.\u201d <em>United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>722 F.3d 677, 685 (5th Cir. 2013).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Any control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the court-appointed monitor has over Defendants\u2019 properties, therefore, is insufficient to render them blocked for purposes of the TRIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We nevertheless conclude that, pursuant to Executive Order 13,599, the United States has acquired a \u201cpossessory interest\u201d in Defendants\u2019 properties. That Order prohibits transferring or otherwise dealing in property within the United States that belongs to the \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d as defined therein, and further authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to promulgate necessary regulations to carry out those prohibitions, <em>see </em>Exec. Order 13,599, thus providing the government with sufficient control of such property to be recognized as a possessory interest, <em>see </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1284 (9th ed. 2009) (defining \u201cpossessory interest\u201d as \u201cright to control property, including the right to exclude others, by a person who is not necessarily the owner\u201d). <em>Smith, </em>346 F.3d at 271-72, supports this conclusion. In <em>Smith, </em>we concluded that certain judgment creditors could not rely on the TRIA to attach previously blocked Iraqi assets because they were no longer \u201cblocked assets\u201d due to President George W. Bush\u2019s March 20, 2003 confiscation order. <em>See id. </em>at 271-72. The Iraqi assets at issue were \u201cfroze[n]\u201d when President George H.W. Bush issued Executive Order 12,722, which ordered that \u201c \u2018[a]ll property and interests in property of the Government of Iraq ... are hereby blocked,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 268 (quoting Exec. Order No. 12,722, 55 Fed. Reg. 31803 (Aug. 2, 1990)). The assets were then confiscated pursuant to President George W. Bush\u2019s March 20, 2003 confiscation order, which \u201cconfiscated and vested in the Department of the Treasury\u201d \u201c[a]ll blocked funds held in the United States in accounts in the name of the Government of Iraq,\u201d Exec. Order No. 13,290, 68 Fed. Reg. 14306, 14307 (Mar. 20, 2003). Viewed in this context, <em>Smith\u2019s </em>statement that there was \u201cno dispute that the Iraqi Assets at issue were \u2018blocked funds\u2019 within the meaning of TRIA \u00a7 201(a) at the time the President issued the confiscation Order,\u201d 346 F.3d at 269, is properly understood to mean that, pursuant to Executive Order 12,722, the assets were blocked until a President ordered their confiscation, not that blocking was <em>effected </em>by the confiscation order. <em>Smith </em>thus supports the conclusion that Executive Order 13,599, which uses blocking language similar to Executive Order 12,722, freezes all U.S. property belonging to the Government of Iran.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Indeed, the absence of a confiscation order here helps, rather than hurts, Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to attach Defendants\u2019 properties under the TRI\u00c1. In concluding in <em>Smith </em>that TRIA\u2019s reference to \u201cblocked assets\u201d did not include confiscated assets, we distinguished seizing or freezing assets \u2014 which \u201ctransfers <em>possessory </em>interest in the property\u201d \u2014 with confiscating assets \u2014 which \u201ctransfers <em>ownership </em>of terrorist property by vesting right, title, and interest as the President deems appropriate.\u201d 346 F.3d at 272 (emphasis in original) (discussing legislative history in which Senator Harkin stated that \u201cassets as to which the United States claims ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>are not included in the definition of \u2018blocked assets\u2019 \u201d (quoting 148 Cong. Rec. S11528 (daily ed. Nov. 19, 2002) (other internal quotation marks omitted))). The IEEPA permits confiscation only \u201cwhen the United States is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked by a foreign country or foreign nationals,\u201d and the President \u201cdetermines\u201d that the \u201cforeign person, foreign organization, or foreign country\u201d whose property is being confiscated \u201cplanned, authorized, aided, or engaged in such hostilities or attacks against the United States.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(1)(C). The confiscation order in <em>Smith </em>followed the President\u2019s \u201cdeter-min[ation] that the United States and Iraq are engaged in armed hostilities.\u201d Exec. Order No. 13,290, 68 Fed. Reg. 14306, 14307 (Mar. 20, 2003). The lack of a confiscation order here signals only that the President has made no such determination with respect to Iran \u2014 not that the United States lacks a possessory interest in U.S. property belonging to the Government of Iran.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Accordingly, because (1) President Obama specifically invoked his IEEPA authority in issuing Executive Order 13,599, and (2) that Order seizes or freezes the U.S. property of any entity satisfying the definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran,\u201d (3) regardless of whether that entity is included on the SDN List or Executive Order 13,599 List, if Defendants satisfy Executive Order 13,599\u2019s definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran,\u201d their assets are blocked and, therefore, subject to attachment under TRIA \u00a7 201. Nevertheless, for the same reasons we concluded that disputed questions of material fact preclude determining as a matter of law whether Defendants are agencies or instrumentalities under the TRIA, <em>see supra </em>at 135-37, we cannot determine as a matter of law that Defendants satisfy the definition of \u201cGovernment of Iran,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that they are a \u201cpolitical subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including ... any person owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of Iran,\u201d Exec. Order 13,-599.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We therefore remand for further proceedings to resolve these factual disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">1. As to .summary judgment ordering turnover of Defendants\u2019 property under the FSIA,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">(a) Defendants do not qualify, as a matter of law, as the foreign state of Iran such that Defendants\u2019 properties may be turned over to help satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 judgments under the FSIA, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">(b) Defendants d\u00f3 not qualify, as a matter of law, as the agencies or instrumentalities of the foreign state of Iran such that Defendants\u2019 properties may be turned over to help satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 judgments under the FSIA, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">(c) Defendants do not quality as the alter egos of Iran under <em>Bancec, </em>462 U.S. at 627, 103 S.Ct. 2591, such that Defendants\u2019 properties may be turned over to help satisfy Plaintiffs\u2019 judgments under the FSIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">2.

However, we identify questions of fact that prevent either of these TRIA questions from being decided on summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Accordingly, the only issues returning to the District Court for further proceedings are (1) Defendants\u2019 status as agencies or instrumentalities under the TRIA, and (2) whether their asserts are \u201cblocked\u201d under that statute. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">.

Thus, in this opinion, the term \"Defendants\u201d refers only to Defendants-Appellants Alavi Foundation and 650 Fifth Avenue Company.

Alavi was incorporated under the laws of the state of New York in 1973 and has been a recognized New York not-for-profit corporation ever since. Certainly, nothing in the record indicates that New York has ever sought to withdraw that recognition. Thus, Alavi is unequivocally a \u201ccitizen of a State of the United States\" that falls outside the ambit of agency or instrumentality status under \u00a7 1603(b)(3). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c).</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">Unlike Alavi, 650 Fifth Ave. Co. is not a corporation; it is a partnership. The pertinent language of the FSIA excludes from the definition of \u201cagency or instrumentality\u201d an entity that is \u201ca citizen of a State of the United States <em>as defined in </em>section 1332(c) and (e) of this title.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(3) (emphasis added). Section 1332(c), which defines the citizenship of corporations, makes no mention of partnerships, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1332(c), and Congress has \"never expanded this grant of citizenship to include artificial entities other than corporations.\u201d <em>Americold Realty Tr. v.

Exp. Check Advance of SC LLC, </em>591 F.3d 698, 702 (4th Cir. 2010). Congress did not amend \u00a7 1603(b) to incorporate this CAFA definition. Rather, it renumbered prior \u00a7 1332(d) (defining \"States\u201d) as \u00a7 1332(e) to accommodate CAFA's insertion as \u00a7 1332(d), <em>see </em>Pub. L.

The District Court did not conclude, and Plaintiffs do not here argue, that even assuming Iran did not exercise sufficient control over Alavi, under <em>Bancec </em>s second prong recognizing Defendants' separate legal status would \"work a fraud or injustice.\u201d <em>EM Ltd., </em>800 F.3d at 91. Any such argument, therefore, is waived. <em>See Vera v.

Congress enacted TRIA \u00a7 201 to \" 'deal comprehensively with the problem of enforcement of judgments rendered on behalf of victims of terrorism in any court of competent jurisdiction by enabling them to satisfy such judgments through the attachment of blocked assets of terrorist parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Harrison v.

Allowing judgment creditors to attach their judgments to the U.S. properties of non-state actors that have carried out terrorist attacks is thus consistent with Congress's comprehensive goals in enacting the TRIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b159-8\">. <em>Cf.
