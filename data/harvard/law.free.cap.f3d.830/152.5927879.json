Plaintiffs owned two convertible notes issued by SBAC. After converting the notes into equity and/or cash, plaintiffs brought this breach of contract claim, alleging that SBAC failed to pay the interest owed on the underlying notes following the conversion. The district court dismissed the claim with prejudice, holding that there was no reasonable interpretation of the underlying contract that entitled the plaintiffs to both the benefits of the conversion and the final interest payment. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the contract unambiguously entitled them to the post-conversion interest payment. In the alternative, plaintiffs argue that the contract was ambiguous and that the court should have conducted fact finding to allow the plaintiffs to submit evidence of industry custom and usage for similar convertible debt instruments. Plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred by denying plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Plaintiffs held two sets of SBAC issued convertible notes (collectively, \u201cnotes\u201d). One set of notes was issued in 2008 and matured in 2013, and the other was issued in 2009 and matured in 2014. The notes were hybrid debt/equity instruments pursuant to which plaintiffs lent money to SBAC, and in return, plaintiffs received periodic interest payments. Plaintiffs also had the option to convert the notes into SBAC shares or into cash. SBAC issued the notes pursuant to two indentures that were substantively identical to one another except for the applicable interest rates, dates, and offering amounts. The indentures dictated the terms of the notes and the obligations of the parties. Plaintiffs converted their notes into equity shares and/or cash near the date at which the notes were to mature. Plaintiffs assert that under the indentures SBAC was required to pay them interest after the conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">a. Structure of the Interest Payments <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">Section 2.03(c) of the indentures (\u201cPayment of Interest Clause\u201d) states the parties\u2019 obligations surrounding interest payments. The provision states in part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANb\">Interest shall be payable on [the two Interest Payment dates] of each year ... to the Person in whose name any Note is registered on the Register at the close of business on any Regular Record Date with respect to the applicable Interest Payment Date, except that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>interest payable on the Maturity Date will be paid to the Person to whom the principal amount is paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">J.A. at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Under the indentures, therefore, SBAC was required to pay interest to noteholders on specified dates \u2014 Interest Payment Dates \u2014 which were scheduled every six months throughout the term of the notes. Two weeks before every Interest Payment Date was a Regular Record Date. The noteholders on the Regular Record- Date were entitled to receive the interest payment for the upcoming Interest Payment Date. As noted above, the Payment of Interest Clause creates an exception to this arrangement such that the final interest payment would be paid to the person to whom the principal would be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Section 2.03(b) of the indentures (\u201cPayment on Maturity Provision\u201d) describes the parties\u2019 obligations if a noteholder declines to convert the notes before the Maturity Date. Section 2.03(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">The Notes shall mature on [the Maturity Date], unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with the provisions hereof. On the Maturity Date, each Holder shall be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Maturity Date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">J.A. at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">b. The Wash Clause and Maturity Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Under the terms of the indentures, plaintiffs had the right to convert their notes at any time up until two trading days before the Maturity Date. J.A. at 79. Plaintiffs refer to the later portion of Section 2.03(c) as the \u201cWash Clause.\u201d The Wash Clause applies to noteholders who convert their notes during the two week period after the Regular Record Date but before the Interest Payment Date. The Wash Clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-14\">Notwithstanding [the Payment of Interest Clause] any Notes ... surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date but prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment [from the Holder] ... of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">J.A. at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">Thus, if a noteholder converts between the Regular Record Date and the Interest Payment Date, the payment by the note-holder under the Wash Clause cancels out the interest payment received by the note-holder on the Interest Payment Date. A noteholder who wishes to avoid the impact of the Wash Clause \u2014 and receive both the interest payment and equity shares and/or cash \u2014 may choose to hold the note until it receives the interest payment and then convert the note after the Interest Payment Date.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-17\">Section 2.03(c)(i) (\u201cMaturity Exception\u201d) states that no Wash Clause \u201cpayment need be made ... with respect to conversions after the close of business on [the final Regular Record Date prior to the Maturity Date.]\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. at 46. Plaintiffs allege that market convention has developed the Maturity Exception to allow noteholders who want to convert and receive the final interest payment and who would have converted immediately after the Interest Payment Date in other periods, to do so in the Final Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>c. Plaintiffs\u2019 Conversions</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u25a0 Plaintiffs were noteholders on the final Regular Record Date of the notes\u2019 term but converted their notes prior to the Maturity Date. Plaintiffs thus converted their notes during the Final Period. Pursuant to the Maturity Exception to the Wash Clause, plaintiffs did not pay SBAC in the amount of interest payable on the Maturity Date. SBAC did not pay plaintiffs the interest on the notes for the final six month period.'Plaintiffs assert that under the plain language and structure of the indentures, SBAC was obligated to pay them interest because they were notehold-ers on the final Regular Record Date and received conversion compensation on the Maturity Date. Plaintiffs contend that SBAC has improperly withheld more than $8 million in accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">d. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Plaintiffs filed suit against SBAC in the Supreme Court of New York, New York County on November 19, 2014. In their complaint, Plaintiffs assert two identical causes of action: a breach of contract claim for each set of notes. One month after suit was filed, SBAC removed the case to federal court. SBAC moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion, holding that there was no reasonable interpretation of the underlying contract that entitled the plaintiffs to both the benefits of the conversion and the final interest payment. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">a. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC, </em>750 F.3d 227, 232 (2d Cir. 2014). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss without leave to amend on the ground that amendment would be futile. <em>Hutchison v. Deutsche Bank Sec. Inc., </em>647 F.3d 479, 490 (2d Cir. 2011) (recognizing that although this Court reviews a denial of leave to amend under an abuse of discretion standard, \u201c[w]hen the denial of leave to amend is based on a legal interpretation, such as a determination that amendment would be futile, a reviewing court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">b. Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">The indentures are governed by New York state law. J.A. at 97. Under New York state law, a breach of contract claim must allege: \u201c(i) the formation of a contract between the parties; (ii) performance by the plaintiff; (iii) failure of defendant to perform; and (iv) damages.\u201d <em>Orlander v. Staples, Inc., </em>802 F.3d 289, 294 (2d Cir. 2015). \u201cIt is a well-established rule in this Circuit that the interpretation of Indenture provisions is a matter of basic contract law.\u201d <em>Bank of N.Y. Trust Co. v. Franklin Advisers, Inc., </em>726 F.3d 269, 276 (2d Cir. 2013) (internal quotation omitted). At the motion to dismiss stage, a district court may dismiss a breach of contract claim only if the terms of the contract are unambiguous. <em>See Eternity Global Master Fund Ltd. v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y., </em>375 F.3d 168, 178 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that \u201cif a contract is ambiguous ..., a court has insufficient data to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim\u201d). \u201cWhether or not a writing is ambiguous is a question of law to be resolved by the courts.\u201d <em>Orlander, </em>802 F.3d at 294 (quoting <em>W.W.W. Assocs., Inc. v. Giancontieri, </em>77 N.Y.2d 157, 565 N.Y.S.2d 440, 443, 566 N.E.2d 639 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">A contract is ambiguous under New York law \u201cif its terms could suggest more than one meaning when viewed ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>jectively by a reasonably intelligent person who has examined the context of the entire integrated agreement and who is cognizant of the customs, practices, usages and terminology as generally understood in the particular trade or business.\u201d <em>Chesapeake Energy Corp. v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon Trust Co., </em>773 F.3d 110, 114 (2d Cir. 2014) (internal quotation omitted). A contract is unambiguous, however, if \u201cthe contract language has a definite and precise meaning ... and concerning which there is no reasonable basis for a difference of opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Law Debenture Trust Co. of N.Y. v. Maverick Tube Corp., </em>595 F.3d 458, 466 (2d Cir. 2010)). We analyze the ambiguity of a provision under the \u201cnormal rules of contract interpretation: \u2018words and phrases should be given their plain meaning\u2019 and a \u2018contract should be construed so as to give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orlander, </em>802 F.3d at 295 (quoting <em>Shaw Grp. Inc. v. Triplefine Int\u2019l Corp., </em>322 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Here, the parties do not dispute that plaintiffs have adequately pled that there was a contract, that plaintiffs performed under the contract, and that the plaintiffs suffered damages. The only issue in dispute is whether, as a matter of law, SBAC\u2019s refusal to pay plaintiffs the final interest payment constituted a failure to perform under the indentures. We hold that it was not and affirm the' district court\u2019s judgment dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">c. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The full text of Section 2.03(c), the Payment of Interest Clause, requires SBAC to pay interest on a biannual basis to persons who are registered as noteholders on the respective Regular Record Date preceding an Interest Payment Date. J.A. at 46. The Wash Clause specifies that when a noteholder converts the note after the Regular Record Date but before the Interest Payment Date, the noteholder must pay SBAC the amount that the note-holder will receive from SBAC on the subsequent Interest Payment Date. The result is that the payments cancel each other out, and the noteholder does not reap the benefit of receiving both an interest, payment and equity/cash from a conversion if the noteholder converts during the two week period before the Interest Payment Date. The Wash Clause allows interest payments to flow only to those noteholders who remain debtholders until the end of each six month cycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Payment of Interest Clause explicitly alters the designation of the recipient of the final interest payment. The clause states: \u201cthe interest payable on the Maturity Date will be paid to the Person to whom the principal amount is paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the identity of the noteholder on the final Regular Recording Date \u2014 the one preceding the Maturity Date \u2014 is irrelevant for purposes of the final interest payment because it is the person who is paid the principal amount on the Maturity Date who is entitled to receive the final interest payment. Section 2.03(b), the Payment on Maturity Provision, identifies the person who receives the principal amount. That, provision states that the \u201cNotes shall mature on [the Maturity Date], unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with the provision hereof [and that] each Holder shall be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Read in conjunction with the Interest Payment Clause, the Payment on Maturity Provision unambiguously directs SBAC to pay the final interest payment and the principal to the holder of a note that was not \u201cearlier converted or repurchased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, because plaintiffs had earlier con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>verted the notes, prior to the Maturity-Date, they were not noteholders on the Maturity Date and are not entitled on that basis, therefore, to the principal amount or the final interest payment. With respect to who may receive the final interest payment, the indentures are unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Unsurprisingly, plaintiffs disagree and advance several arguments for why they are entitled to the final interest payment. First, plaintiffs contend that the Wash Clause and the Maturity Exception, when read in conjunction with the entirety of the Payment of Interest Clause, entitle plaintiffs to the final interest payment. Plaintiffs argue that the only reasonable interpretation of Section 2.03(c) is that SBAC is obligated to pay interest for conversions made after the Final Regular Recording Date but before the Maturity Date. Otherwise, plaintiffs argue, the Wash Clause would be superfluous and the Maturity Exception would be doubly superfluous. Plaintiffs contend that the Maturity Exception to the Wash Clause would be unnecessary if the Payment of Interest Clause did not require SBAC to pay the final interest payment after plaintiffs converted because, if this were so, the Wash Clause would not apply at all, and thus, an exception to it would be equally redundant. 'To avoid reading the indentures in a way that creates redundant clauses, plaintiffs assert, we should interpret the Payment of Interest Clause as requiring SBAC to pay the final interest payment when plaintiffs converted in the Final Period and interpret the Maturity Exception to the Wash Clause as exempting plaintiffs from having to pay the reciprocal amount to SBAC in a wash payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We disagree. Although clever, plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the indentures is unreasonable because it rests on a misunderstanding of the interplay between the Wash Clause and the Payment of Interest Clause. The Wash Clause begins with the phrase: \u201cNotwithstanding the foregoing.\u201d J.A. at 46. The \u201cforegoing\u201d in this phrase refers to the Payment of Interest Clause, which describes the interest payment rules.' Thus, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d the interest payment rules \u2014 which include the different rule for the final interest payment on the Maturity Date \u2014 the Wash Clause applies. The Wash Clause, therefore, applies to every conversion that occurs between a Regular Recording Date and an Interest Payment Date, including conversions that occur during the Final Period. The Wash Clause obligates all noteholders who convert during one of these periods to pay SBAC the \u201camount equal to the interest otherwise payable,\u201d J.A. at 46, \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d SBAC\u2019s obligation to pay note-holders interest in the first instance. Thus, under the Wash Clause, the final Regular Recording Date and final Interest Payment Date trigger plaintiffs\u2019 obligations, whereas under the Payment of Interest Clause, the final Regular Recording Date and final Interest Payment Date (i.e. the Maturity Date) do not trigger SBAC\u2019s corresponding interest payment obligations. This dynamic creates a one-sided obligation for a noteholder who converts during the Final Period. Rather than being redundant, the Maturity Exception is the simplest mechanism, within this particular interest payment structure, to ensure SBAC does not receive a windfall payment from noteholders. Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertions, this is the only reasonable interpretation of the Wash Clause and the Maturity Exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed reading, moreover, would allow noteholders who convert in the Final Period to reap the additional benefit of obtaining interest plus cash and/or stock while noteholders who convert in any other period would only get cash and/or stock. Plaintiffs contend that their reading does not grant additional benefits to a notehold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>er who converts in the Final Period and is consistent with the structure of the indentures because in every other period note-holders have the option of waiting until the day after the Interest Payment Date to convert in order to receive both an interest payment plus cash and/or stock. We are unpersuaded. As described above, the indentures structure the interest payments in six-month intervals whereby a noteholder receives interest for holding a note through a six-month cycle. That a note-holder can convert anytime during the subsequent cycle does not alter the plain language of the Payment of Interest Clause or the structure of the interest payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Similarly, we are unpersuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the following language in the notes obliges SBAC to pay the final interest payment: SBAC \u201cwill pay interest on the Notes ... to the Persons who are registered holders of Notes at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the [Regular Record Date] next preceding the Interest Payment Date even if Notes are canceled after the record date and on or before the Interest Payment Date, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture.\u201d J.A. at 106, 197. Because this language does not create any new or different obligations than those in the indentures and explicitly defers to the indentures if there is a contradiction between the notes and the indentures, we rely on the plain language of the indentures when analyzing the respective obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Focusing on the conversion of their notes, plaintiffs farther argue that the district court mischaracterized when the conversion of their notes took place and erred in not finding that they were the party \u201cto whom the principal amount is paid\u201d thus entitling them under the Payment of Interest Clause and Payment on Maturity Provision to the final interest payment. J.A. at 46. This argument turns on the distinction throughout the indentures between surrendering a note for conversion and the actual conversion itself and relies on an alternative reading of the term \u201cprincipal.\u201d Plaintiffs assert that although they surrendered their notes for conversion prior to the Maturity Date, the act of conversion occurred on the Maturity Date, and thus the notes were not \u201cearlier converted.\u201d J.A. at 46. They argue, moreover, that because the equity a noteholder receives upon conversion is calculated based on a conversion rate that is premised on the principal amount, their conversion on the Maturity Date was, in fact, the payment of the principal amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed interpretations of the Payment of Interest Clause and Payment on Maturity Provision are unreasonable. Article 10 of the Indentures, entitled Conversion of Notes, defines \u201cConversion Date\u201d as \u201c[t]he date the Holder satisfies the foregoing requirements.\u201d J.A. at 82. The \u201cforegoing requirements\u201d are set forth in a list of steps \u2014 including submitting notice, fulfilling obligations under the Wash Clause, and paying transfer taxes \u2014 which can be satisfied by a note-holder unilaterally. <em>Id. </em>The Conversion Date is, therefore, the date the noteholder effectively submits its notes for conversion. Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the notes were \u201cconverted\u201d on a later date when the equity shares were distributed to the plaintiffs is incorrect. Furthermore, that the value of the equity shares is dependent on the principal amount does not contradict or change the fact that when a noteholder exercises the right to convert a note, the noteholder relinquishes the note \u2014 and thus the right to the principal and interest \u2014 in exchange for equity shares or cash. The principal is not paid during conversion, but rather transformed from a principal amount to equity shares or cash. Plaintiffs cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>overcome this fact by ignoring it and proposing to equate the value of the principal as a standard for conversion with the principal amount itself. The indentures are unambiguous and do not entitle plaintiffs to the final interest payment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Finally, plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by dismissing their complaint without granting them leave to amend. Plaintiffs argue that because the district court dismissed the complaint, in part, on the basis that plaintiffs failed to support their argument relating to market convention and industry practice with anything other than conclusory allegations, plaintiffs should be allowed to re-plead more specific facts to cure this pleading defect. Plaintiffs, however, do not explain what market convention evidence they would submit in their amended complaint to support their market convention theory. Regardless, because we have determined that the plain language and structure of the indentures unambiguously foreclose plaintiffs\u2019 right to the final interest payment, we agree with the district court that re-pleading would be futile. <em>See Thea v. Kleinhandler, </em>807 F.3d 492, 496-97 (2d Cir. 2015) (\u201cProposed amendments are futile if they would fail to cure deficiencies or state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d (internal quotation omitted)). We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to re-plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">SECTION 2.03 Date and Denomination of Notes: Payment at Maturity; Payment of Interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">(b) Payment at Maturity.

On the Maturity Date, each Holder shall be entitled to receive on such date $1,000 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Maturity Date. With respect to Global Notes, principal and interest will be paid to the Depositary in immediately available funds. With respect to any certificated Notes, principal and interest will be payable at the \u25a0 Company\u2019s office or agency in New York City, which initially will be the office or agency of the Trustee located at 100 Wall Street, Suite 1600, New York, New York 10005, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration and at the Company\u2019s office or agency in Miami, Florida, which initially will be the office or agency of the Trustee located at 200 South Biscayne Blvd, Suite 1870, Miami, Florida 33131, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Notes or portion thereof surrendered for conversion after the close of business on the Regular Record Date for an Interest Payment Date but prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the interest otherwise payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount being converted; provided that no such payment need be made:</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">(i) with respect to conversions after the close of business on April 15, 2018;</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">(ii) with respect to conversions during such period commencing on the date the Company has given notice of a Fundamental Change pursuant to Section 10.01(4) to, and including, the second Scheduled Trading Day immediately preceding the corresponding Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; or</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">(iii)with respect to any overdue interest, if overdue interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such Notes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-14\">.

While we'agree that Section 10.02(g) supports the general proposition that, upon conversion, interest stops accruing and SBAC is not required to pay ongoing interest payments, because we determine here that the text of the Payment of Interest Clause is dispositive of whether plaintiffs are entitled to the final interest payment, we do not analyze Section 10.02(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
