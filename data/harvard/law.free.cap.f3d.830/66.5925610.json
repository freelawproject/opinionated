We also consider challenges to the September 9, 2013 order denying a motion to suppress evidence seized from the Alavi Foundation\u2019s and the 650 Fifth Avenue Company\u2019s office. Three concerns prompt us to vacate the judgment as to Claimants Alavi Foundation (\u201cAlavi\u201d or \u201cthe Foundation\u201d) and the 650 Fifth Avenue Company (\u201c650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u201d or \u201cthe Partnership\u201d), of which Alavi is a 60% owner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">First, we identify material issues of fact as to whether the Alavi Foundation knew that Assa Corporation, its partner in the 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Partnership, continued after 1995, to be owned or controlled by Bank Melli Iran, which is itself owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, a designated threat to this nation\u2019s national security. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 12,957, 60 Fed. Reg. 14615 (Mar. 15, 1995). Accordingly, we vacate summary judgment and remand the case for trial as to the Alavi Foundation and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, we conclude that the District Court erred in <em>sua sponte </em>considering and rejecting the Claimants\u2019 possible statute of limitations defense without affording notice and a reasonable time to respond. Thus, we vacate that part of the judgment without prejudice for reconsideration on proper notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Third, in rejecting the Claimants\u2019 motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a challenged warrant, the District Court erred in ruling that the Claimants\u2019 civil discovery obligations \u201cobviate the need for any Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, </em>970 F.Supp.2d 204, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) <em>(\u201cIn re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision\u201d). </em>The Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule applies in civil forfeiture cases, and a party\u2019s civil discovery obligations do not automatically render Fourth Amendment rights and remedies inapplicable. We likewise identify error in the District Court\u2019s alternative ruling that every item of unlawfully seized evidence would have been inevitably discovered. While discovery obligations might shield unlawfully seized items from suppression under the inevitable discovery doctrine, <em>see United States v. Eng, </em>971 F.2d 854, 861 (2d Cir. 1992), such a conclusion requires a district court, \u201cfor each particular piece of evidence, specifically [to] analyze and explain how, if at all, discovery of that piece of evidence would have been more likely than not inevitable absent the [challenged search],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 862 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the record fails to demonstrate that particularized review, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>remand to allow the District Court to conduct the requisite analysis. On remand, the Government may also pursue its argument \u2014 raised before the District Court and on appeal \u2014 that the good-faith .exception to suppression applies in this case. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s challenged judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cWe of course view the record in the light most favorable to [the Claimants], who [are] appealing from an adverse grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Lombard v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., </em>280 F.3d 209, 211 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>accord Cortes v. MTA New York City Transit, </em>802 F.3d 226, 228 (2d Cir. 2015).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">I. The Alavi Foundation</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Alavi Foundation traces its origins to 1973, when the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, incorporated the eponymous Pahlavi Foundation as a New York not-for-profit corporation, and endowed it with several million dollars. The Pahlavi Foundation\u2019s stated mission was, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[t]o render support and assistance for the study and promotion of the arts and.sciences\u201d and to support \u201cestablished charitable, philanthropic, educational and civic endeavors.\u201d App\u2019x 5971-72. In 1974, the Pahlavi Foundation acquired property at 650 Fifth Avenue in New York City (\u201cthe Property\u201d). In 1975, at the direction of the Shah, Bank Melli \u2014 a bank wholly owned by the Iranian government \u2014 loaned the Pahlavi Foundation $42 million, thus providing the Foundation with funds to construct a 36-story office tower on the Property, <em>i.e., </em>the Building, and Bank Mel-li with two mortgages on that Property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which deposed the Shah, Iran\u2019s new Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered the formation of the Bo-nyad Mostazafan, an entity charged with managing property expropriated by the revolutionary government, including that at 650 Fifth Avenue. In 1980, the Pahlavi Foundation was renamed the Mostazafan Foundation of New York. The Foundation took on its present name in 1992.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Since its inception, Alavi has purchased and maintained several properties in the United States. In addition to the Building, Alavi acquired seven real properties in the 1980s and 1990s, including two parcels of land in Rockville, Maryland, one property in Houston, Texas, one property in Carmichael, California, two parcels of land in Prince William County, Virginia, and one block of lots in Queens, New York (collectively, \u201cAlavi Real Properties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Alavi\u2019s bylaws state that its Board controls the organization\u2019s affairs and property and appoints corporate officers and directors, while its President supervises operations and reports to the Board. The bylaws make Alavi\u2019s Board and President responsible for, <em>inter alia, </em>operational decisions such as charitable efforts, personnel decisions, and program management. Consistent with New York not-for-profit law, <em>see </em>N.Y. Not-For-Profit Corp. Law \u00a7\u00a7 501, 601 (McKinney 2016), Alavi has never had formal owners, members, or shareholders. The record reflects that Alavi remains a not-for-profit corporation in \u201cgood standing,\u201d and New York regulatory authorities have never sought to dissolve or remove the organization\u2019s corporate status, or taken any action against Alavi, its directors, officers, or employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">II. The 650 Fifth Avenue Company</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">650 Fifth Ave. Co. is a partnership created under New York law in 1989 as part of a plan to relieve Alavi of certain tax obligations. Although Alavi has always been a tax-exempt not-for-profit organization, as a result of Bank Melli\u2019s 1975 mortgages on the Property, rental income from the Building was taxable as debt-financed unrelated business income. As explained by the Iranian Deputy Prime Minister (and then-head of the Bonyad Mostazafan) in a July 25, 1987 letter to the Prime Minister, \u201cone of the major problems of the New York Mostazafan Foundation stem[med] from the debt it owe[d] to the New York branch of Melli Bank\u201d because the resulting tax obligations left insufficient funds for the Foundation to provide $1.5 million in services as required by its articles of association. Supp. App\u2019x 285. Thus, Alavi, together with the Government of Iran, the Bonyad Mostazafan, and, ultimately, Bank Melli, sought to eliminate the tax obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In his July 25, 1987 letter, the Deputy Prime Minister proposed a series of transactions that would allow Alavi to pay off the Bank Melli debt using money from the Government of Iran. First, he proposed creating \u201cCompany A\u201d in New York and transferring to it both ownership of the Building and the Bank Melli loan. Second, he proposed establishing \u201cCompany B\u201d in Europe \u201cwith anonymous shares.\u201d Supp. App\u2019x. 287. Third, he proposed allocating $45 million to the Bonyad Mostazafan, which would then loan the sum to Company B to purchase 40% of Company A\u2019s stock from Alavi. These transactions would thereby permit permitting Alavi to pay off the Bank Melli loans. This plan was to be executed in 1988 but when that failed to occur, apparently due to Bank Melli\u2019s failure timely to \u201cresolv[e] the issue of a partnership in the Foundation\u2019s building,\u201d App\u2019x 6907, Alavi and the Bonyad Mosta-zafan began considering alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">In May 1989, Seyed Mohammad Badr Taleh (\u201cBadr\u201d), then Alavi\u2019s Managing Director, met with representatives of the Bo-nyad Mostazafan and Bank Melli. Meeting minutes reveal that the participants agreed substantially to carry out the 1987 plan by forming a company \u201c[o]n behalf of Bank Melli\u201d that would \u201cmake partnership with\u201d Alavi in order to alleviate Alavi\u2019s tax obligations. App\u2019x 6913; <em>see also </em>App\u2019x 8694 (minutes from 1992 meeting between Alavi and Bank Melli explaining that Melli <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>entered into 1989 Partnership with Alavi \u201cto save the Foundation and prevent it from paying $3 million in annual taxes\u201d). To accomplish this partnership, Bank Melli would \u201cestablish a Company in Jersey Island,\u201d and \u201cthe established company via other Company will participate with the NY Foundation.\u201d App\u2019x 6913.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">In light of these tax concerns and the agreed solution, the \u201cCompany in Jersey Island\u201d was formed as Assa Company Limited (\u201cAssa Limited\u201d) in 1989, which then and to this day wholly owns the \u201cother Company\u201d incorporated in New York, Assa Corporation (together, \u201cAssa\u201d). The understanding, as evident from a 1989 letter in which an Assistant Director of the Bonyad Mostazafan explained the Assa-Alavi partnership, was that \u201cAssa ... belonged] to Bank Melli.\u201d App\u2019x 6918-19. Indeed, Assa was the vehicle by which Bank Melli carried out the series of circular transactions that effectively relieved Alavi of its tax obligations without surrendering Melli\u2019s interests in Alavi income. As explained in Bank Melli correspondence, Bank Melli financed Assa Limited, Assa Corporation purchased a 35% share in the 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Partnership from Alavi, and Alavi used the funds to pay off the Bank Melli mortgages. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 6923-24. Pursuant to the 1989 partnership agreement, Alavi contributed the Building, then valued at approximately $128 million, to the newly formed 650 Fifth Ave. Co., while Assa contributed $44.8 million in cash, which Assa had received from Bank Melli and which Alavi returned to Bank Melli as payment for its mortgage debt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In October 1989, Alavi and Assa formed a partnership under New York law known as the 650 Fifth Ave. Co. In securing the requisite leave of the New York Supreme Court for a transaction divesting all, or substantially all, assets of a non-profit organization, <em>see </em>N.Y. Not-For-Profit Corp. Law \u00a7\u00a7 510(a)(3), 511 (McKinney 1989), Alavi\u2019s then-president Badr stated in a verified petition that Assa Corporation was owned by Assa Limited, which was in turn \u201cbeneficially owned by two individuals, Mr. Mohammad Behdadfar and Mr. Mohsen Kakavand,\u201d and that the formation of the Alavi-Assa partnership \u201crepresented] an arms-length transaction.\u201d App\u2019x 6152. The filing explained that the 650 Fifth Ave. Co. partnership was formed to resolve Alavi\u2019s tax liability arising from the Building\u2019s rental income, which had been taxable as unrelated business income. App\u2019x 6152-52. No mention was made of Bank Melli\u2019s relationship to Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Based on their initial contributions, Ala-vi received a 65% interest and Assa received a 35% interest in 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Alavi later sold a further 5% to Assa; Alavi now holds 60% of the interest in the Partnership, while Assa holds 40%. Based on their ownership interests, Alavi and Assa received <em>pro rata </em>distributions of 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s income from the Building. Between 2002 and 2004, the Building generated approximately $17 million in annual revenues. Between 2006 and 2009, the Building generated between $19 million <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and $21 million in annual revenues. Thus, through the circular transactions just discussed, instead of Alavi owing a mortgage debt of approximately $45 million to Bank Melli, Bank Melli owned 35% (and, later, 40%) of the Building, initially valued at $44.8 million, and received a commensurate share of that Building\u2019s substantial\u2014 and now tax-free \u2014 -rental income. Since the Partnership\u2019s founding and until commencement of these forfeiture proceedings, Alavi served as 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s managing partner, administering the day-to-day affairs of the Partnership, including management of the Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">III. Iran\u2019s Involvement with Alavi, Assa, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Before 1995</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As the preceding section shows, there is ample evidence of Bank Melli\u2019s involvement with Alavi, Assa, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. before 1995. <em>See, e.g., </em>App\u2019x 6918 (Bonyad Mostazafan correspondence explaining that the partnership between Alavi and Assa \u201cis based on prior agreements between the Ministry of Finance, Bank Melli Iran, and\u201d Bonyad Mostazafan); App\u2019x 6923-24 (Bank Melli correspondence explaining that structure of Assa entities was based on \u201cample study at the New York Foundation, the Central Office of the Foundation, and Bank Melli in Tehran\u201d). Record evidence further shows that after Assa\u2019s formation and prior to 1995, Bank Melli and Assa maintained a close \u2014 and at times inseparable \u2014 relationship. Indeed, Bank Melli had a substantial ownership interest in Assa from its founding through 1995. From 1990 until 1992, two Bank Mel-li officials indirectly held approximately 96% of Assa\u2019s total shares through another straw entity, Harter Holdings Ltd. (\u201cHar-ter Holdings\u201d), split equally. In 1993, the officials\u2019 shares were transferred to Bank Melli Iran, which then held the 96% indirect interest in Assa until 1995.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Record evidence indicates that Bank Melli sought to conceal its ownership of Assa through these arrangements. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 7094 (Bank Melli correspondence dated December 29, 1993 explaining that Bank Melli took over ownership of Assa Limited and Harter Holdings because, with Channel Islands incorporation, \u201caccessing the ownership backgrounds of the companies behind the captioned corporation is not an easy task for investigators,\u201d and questioning \u201cwhether Mr. Naghshi-neh \u2014 the Assa Corp New York Director whose affiliation with the Bank could be easily proven \u2014 could be replaced with another individual whose affiliation with the Bank could not be easily proven\u201d); App\u2019x 7103 (Bank Melli correspondence dated June 25, 1994 discussing risk of seizure of \u201celements connected to the Islamic Republic of Iran\u2019s assets in the United States,\u201d and asking its New York office to estimate \u201cpercentage of risk of the seizure of ... properties in case of the revelation of the ownership by Assa Corporation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Several letters between Alavi and Bank Melli officials also indicate that they viewed Assa as interchangeable with Bank Melli before 1995. Moreover, in 1992, representatives for Alavi and Bank Melli met in Tehran to discuss 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s need for a $1.7 million loan. Meeting minutes reflect that Bank Melli\u2019s representative confirmed Bank Melli\u2019s commitment to stand by Alavi and to approve the loan if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Alavi adopted a specific plan to pay the debt it owed to Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Record evidence also indicates that, in addition to Bank Melli, other Iranian government officials exercised some control over Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s affairs before 1995. From approximately 1982 to 1991, a Bonyad Mostazafan employee, Seyed Mojtaba Hesami-Kiche, sat on Ala-vi\u2019s Board and, every three months, provided reports about Alavi to the Prime Minister of Iran or the head of the Bonyad Mostazafan.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, minutes from a 1991 meeting in Zurich, Switzerland indicate that Alavi\u2019s Board of Directors made changes in the Board\u2019s composition \u201cas directed by the Supreme Leader\u201d of Iran, ostensibly referring to the Ayatollah. App\u2019x 8647. In a subsequent 1991 letter to the Ayatollah, Alavi\u2019s Managing Director, Badr, expressed concern that Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations would exercise a \u201cposition of responsibility connected to [Alavi\u2019s] affairs\u201d going forward. App\u2019x 8674. In a subsequent letter to an individual named Sobhani, Badr stated that, as a result of \u201cinadvisable actions\u201d taken by former executive directors of Ala-vi and Iran\u2019s Ambassador, \u201cboth the Foundation and the assets of Bank Melli will face obliteration.\u201d App\u2019x 8663. That letter further explained that if the connection between Alavi and the Government of Iran were discovered, board members, including Hesami-Kiche, could \u201cbe culpable of a heavy offence.\u201d App\u2019x 8662-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">IV. Sanctions Against Iran</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In March 1995 \u2014 six years after 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s formation \u2014 President Clinton issued a series of Executive Orders pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\u201cIEEPA\u201d), formally declaring the Government of Iran a threat to national security and imposing broad financial sanctions. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 12,957, 60 Fed. Reg. 14615 (Mar. 15, 1995); Exec. Order No. 12,959, 60 Fed. Reg. 24757 (May 6,1995). Those Executive Orders authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to promulgate rules and regulations to implement the financial sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Pursuant to that authority, the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) determined that Bank Melli was owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, thus subjecting it to, among other things, limitations on the receipt of services from U.S. financial institutions beginning June 6, 1995, except as authorized by an OFAC license. <em>See </em>Implementation of Executive Order No. 12959 With Respect to Iran, 60 Fed. Reg. 40881-02 (Aug. 10, 1995). OFAC also subsequently promulgated a series of Iranian Transactions Regulations (\u201cITRs\u201d) relevant to this action, which took effect on August 20, 1997, and which generally prohibit United States entities from conducting business with or providing services to the \u201cGovernment of Iran.\u201d The \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d is defined in the ITRs as \u201c[t]he state and the Government of Iran, as well as any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof,\u201d \u201c[a]ny person owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the foregoing,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny person ... acting or purporting to act, directly or indirectly, for or on behalf of the foregoing.\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.304 (2012); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 560.203, 560.204, 560.207, 560.208, 560.301. Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. are United States entities subject to these orders and regulations and prohibited thereby from conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ing business with or providing services to Bank Melli or any other instrumentality owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of, the Government of Iran.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Y. Bank Melli\u2019s Relationship with 650 Fifth Ave. Co. After 1995</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In 1995, after the first of the relevant Executive Orders imposing sanctions on Iran was issued, Bank Melli formally divested its ownership of Assa. Bank Melli\u2019s Harter Holdings shares were acquired by two individuals, Davood Shakeri and Fate-meh Aghamiri. Together, Shakeri and Aghamiri indirectly held 100% of Assa\u2019s shares until 1999, when they directly acquired 100% of Assa\u2019s 100 shares.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Proffered records indicate that Shakeri and Aghamiri acquired their shares in Harter Holdings and in Assa for \u00a3l/share.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> App\u2019x 10319, 10325, 10361. Shakeri and Aghamiri directly held 100% of Assa\u2019s shares until 2008.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">In support of its claim that Bank Melli nevertheless continued to exercise control over Assa after 1995, the Government primarily relied on two categories of evidence: (1) emails from Hassan Dehghani Tafti (\u201cTafti\u201d), Assa\u2019s sole representative in the United States (\u201cTafti emails\u201d) and (2) notes purportedly from a 2007 meeting between Alavi\u2019s new President, Farshid Jahedi (\u201cJahedi\u201d), and Iran\u2019s Ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Kha-zaee (\u201cKhazaee\u201d) (\u201cKhazaee-Jahedi meeting\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">A. Tafti Emails</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">In 2005, Tafti sent three emails to Moh-sen Ghadimipour, then head of Bank Mel-li\u2019s Overseas Network Supervisory Department (\u201cONSD\u201d). First, in February 2005, Tafti requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that ONSD provide him with \u201cthe signature of the [Assa] share holders, Mrs. Aghamiri and Mr. Shakeri.\u201d App\u2019x 7156. Second, in July 2005, Tafti advised Ghadimipour that the \u201cshare holders are forbidden from having residences [in Iran], and as per the view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the legal experts, [the United States] may freeze the capital of the share holders.\u201d App\u2019x 7129. Tafti requested that ONSD make \u201csome arrangement that the residence location of the share holders of Assa, Mr. Davood Shakeri and Mrs. Agha-miri be changed to another country.\u201d App\u2019x 7129. Finally, also in July 2005, Tafti wrote Ghadimipour that \u201c[c]hanging the share holder of Assa Ltd. is possible, but the share holder should reside in a [tax free country].... Otherwise, the country of residence will collect a tax from the income of the share holder.\u201d App\u2019x 7134. The Government argues that these communications show that Assa\u2019s post-1995 record owners were only fronts for Bank Melli, which continued to control Assa\u2019s holdings in 650 Fifth Ave. Co. The August 2005 response Tafti received is further evidence of Bank Melli\u2019s control: \u201cWith reference to the email of 7/7/2005, regarding the location of residence of the shareholders, this is to inform you that, <em>as per the orders of the Bank Manager, </em>until the appointment of the qualified individuals, act as before.\u201d App\u2019x 7143 (emphasis added). Although this email and three others in the record indicate that they were sent by (or, in some, from Tafti to) the \u201cshareholders of Assa,\u201d each bore the same email address \u2014 \u201cONSD_ir@yahoo.com\u201d\u2014used on several of the Ghadimipour emails, <em>see, e.g., </em>App\u2019x 7134, 7143, 7152, 10401, 10404.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">B. Khazaee-Jahedi Meeting</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In 2007, certain Alavi board members and President Jahedi met with Ambassador Khazaee at the Ambassador\u2019s residence. The record does not indicate the purpose of the meeting, how it was arranged, or what, if any, action was taken as a result of the meeting. The Government nevertheless maintains that two sets of meeting notes support its contention that Khazaee instructed Jahedi with respect to the management of Alavi.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The first set of notes, dated October 5, 2007, bears the heading \u201cBoard Meeting,\u201d references \u201cKhazaee\u201d and \u201cJahedi,\u201d and includes, <em>inter alia, </em>the following statements: \u201c[s]hould only allocate to Shiites,\u201d App\u2019x 8720; \u201cASSA: Daily expenses? Payments? Investment policy?,\u201d App\u2019x 8711, 8721; \u201cThe composition of the Board of Trustees = Whatever I decide should be approved and it should not be otherwise,\u201d App\u2019x 8722; and \u201cI have to definitely see the proposed allocations before a final decision is reached. I have to be kept informed and I have to be able to state my opinion in order for you to make a decision,\u201d App\u2019x 8724 (emphasis in original). Although the authorship of these notes is unknown, the Government submits that their content supports an inference that they were taken by Alavi\u2019s President Jahedi and that the speaker referenced therein is Khazae'e.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The second set of notes is from the journal of Alavi\u2019s secretary, Alireza Ebra-himi (\u201cEbrahimi\u201d) and references dates that do not match the purported October 2007 meeting: shortly after the heading \u201cMr. Alireza Ebrahimi\u2019s Journal, Summer 2003\u201d are three other dates, Friday, July 25, Sunday, July 27, and Sunday, August 10. App\u2019x 7109. These notes contain stray statements that may indicate a desire to sell Bank Melli\u2019s share in Assa. One statement reads, \u201cDr. Kharrazi -\u00bb Assa share -&gt; Sell it,\u201d App\u2019x 7109, and another reads, \u201cMr. Zarif -&gt; Assa Bank Melli 40% share -&gt; I cannot sleep at night -&gt; The issue of Board of Trustees will be solved, When? -\u00bb Transfer,\u201d App\u2019x 7110.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">VI. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">A. The Initial Civil Forfeiture Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">On December 17, 2008, the United States filed this civil action in the Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>District of New York seeking forfeiture of property owned by Assa and Bank Melli based on violations of the IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a71701 <em>et seq., </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957. Simultaneously, the Treasury Department added Assa to the Specially Designated Nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) list based on its determination that Assa is a front company for Bank Melli.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the initial complaint recounted the history of Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., it did not seek forfeiture of either entity\u2019s property. That same day, however, District Judge Holwell entered a protective order prohibiting, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[a]ll persons and entities having actual knowledge\u201d of the order, which included Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., from \u201cdestroyfing] any documents relating in any manner or part to the allegations in the Complaint, including but not limited to the books and records of the Fifth Avenue Company, the Pahlavi Foundation, the Mostazafan Foundation, the Alavi Foundation, Assa Corporation, Assa Company Ltd., and/or Bank Melli.\u201d App\u2019x 5185. In addition to the preservation requirements, the order required 650 Fifth Ave. Co. \u2014 but not Alavi \u2014 to make its \u201cbooks and records\u201d \u201cavailable for inspection to the United States.\u201d App\u2019x 5186.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">B. The Separate Criminal Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Also on December 17, 2008, the Government served a grand jury subpoena on Alavi, seeking evidence of IEEPA violations and money laundering. The Government sought \u201cany and all documents relating or referring to\u201d the 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Assa, and Bank Melli Iran, \u201cfrom January 1, 1989 to the present.\u201d App\u2019x 5192-93. The subpoena was served on Alavi President Jahedi. The following day, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) observed Jahedi throwing papers responsive to the subpoena into a public trash bin. Jahedi subsequently pled guilty to obstruction of justice for these actions and was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment. Judgment, <em>United States v. Jahedi, </em>No. 1:09-cr-00460-SAS (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 30, 2010), ECF No. 52; <em>see also United States v. Jahedi, </em>681 F.Supp.2d 430 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). The FBI ultimately retrieved the documents discarded by Jahedi. Although the Government submitted photographs of the torn documents in connection with its opposition to Claimants\u2019 motion to suppress, the documents themselves were not submitted by the Government in support of its motion for summary judgment as to the forfeitability of the Defendant Properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">C. The Criminal Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">On December 19, 2008, the day after Jahedi\u2019s attempted destruction of documents, the FBI sought, obtained, and executed a criminal search warrant for the offices of Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz issued the two-page warrant, which referenced supporting \u201c[a]ffidavit(s) ... made before me by Special Agent George Ennis that he has reason to believe that [listed property] is now being concealed\u201d at the addresses specified to be searched. App\u2019x 5140. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>boilerplate language, the warrant stated that the magistrate judge was \u201csatisfied that there is probable cause to believe that the property so described is being concealed\u201d on the premises and that \u201cthe grounds for application for issuance of the search warrant exist as stated in the supporting affidavit(s).\u201d App\u2019x 5140. It then \u2022authorized the FBI to search and seize:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">1. Any and all ... documents or records concerning or relating to the ownership of, rental of, mortgaging of, or investing in [Assa, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., or Bank Melli Iran.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">2. Any and all documents concerning or relating to financial books and records, bank accounts, disbursements, money transfers or employment records of [Assa, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Alavi, or Bank Melli Iran] or any of the officers and employees of these entities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">3. Any and all computers; central processing units; external and internal drives; external and internal storage equipment or media; computerized data storage devices; hard disks or floppy disks; CD-ROMs[;] ... and related or connected computer or data storage equipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">App\u2019x 5141. The warrant does not identify the crimes for which agents were authorized to search or seize the listed property. Nor does the warrant place any temporal limit on the property to be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">The twelve-paragraph Ennis affidavit ' supporting the warrant described the history of Alavi, including the tax issue that led to the formation of 650 Fifth Ave. Co. Moreover, unlike the search warrant, the Ennis affidavit stated that the property sought constituted evidence of, among other crimes, violations of the IEEPA, the ITRs, and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956, 1957. It explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">In 1999, [OFAC] identified Bank Melli and its offices worldwide as entities \u201cowned or controlled by the Government of Iran.\u201d 31 C.F.R. Part 560, App. A. Accordingly, Bank Melli is subject to the Iranian Transactions Regulations (\u201cITR\u201d), Title 31 United States Code of Federal Regulations, Part 560, and Assa Co.\u2019s interest in the Building and its rents is subject to civil forfeiture, as fully set forth in [the attached December 17, 2008 civil Complaint]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">[Although the property and funds which are subject to forfeiture belong to Bank Melli and its related entities, the transactions underlying Bank Melli\u2019s acquisition of its interest in the Building [were] not an arms-length transaction with Ala-vi, but rather [were] structure[d] both to evade Alavi\u2019s tax liability and to conceal Bank Melli\u2019s interest in the Building. Accordingly, I submit that there is probable cause to believe that Alavi committed the same crimes alleged as a basis for the forfeiture sought in [the original Complaint], and that Alavi and its directors, employees, and other agents, committed, conspired to commit, and aided and abetted the same violations by Alavi and Bank Melli, among others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8K\">App\u2019x 5145-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">The warrant was executed on Claimants\u2019 offices the day it was obtained. The FBI seized nearly all computers, servers, and electronic storage devices found therein, along with over two hundred boxes of papers, records, and other tangible materials, some documents dating back thirty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">D. The Amended Civil Forfeiture Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">Almost a year after the search of Claimants\u2019 offices, on November 12, 2009, the Government filed an amended civil forfeiture complaint, adding Alavi\u2019s and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s properties as defendants-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>in-rem. In total, the Government sought forfeiture of \u201c[a]ll right, title, and interest\u201d of (1) Alavi, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Assa, and Bank Melli Iran, and all property traceable thereto, (2) the Building, including all improvements and attachments, and all property traceable thereto, (3) the Alavi Real Properties, with all improvements and attachments thereon, and (4) the contents of nine bank accounts, and all funds traceable thereto. The Government asserted that the Defendant Properties are for-feitable (1) as proceeds of violations of the IEEPA and certain ITRs issued by the Department of the Treasury,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (2) as proceeds traceable to property involved in money laundering. The parties engaged in discovery for nearly four years thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">E. Judgment Creditor Actions</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Soon after the Government filed its initial forfeiture complaint, various plaintiff groups began to file actions against Assa, Alavi, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., seeking attachment and turnover of Defendants\u2019 properties to satisfy judgments obtained against Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d) for acts of terrorism. Those judgment creditor actions generally allege that Assa, Alavi, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. are sufficiently related to Iran to render their property subject to turnover pursuant to the FSIA, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1610(a), (g), and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (\u201cTRIA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 107-297, 116 Stat. 2322, 2337 (codi-fled at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610 note). Although not at issue in the instant appeal, these judgment creditor actions are here relevant to the extent that, before the District Court, they were consolidated with the civil forfeiture action for purposes of pretrial motions and, if necessary, trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">F. The District Court\u2019s Judgments</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Since its commencement in 2008, this forfeiture action has generated numerous decisions by the District Court. As relevant here, on September 9, 2013, the District Court denied Alavi\u2019s and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized during the December 2008 search, which they alleged violated their Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d 204.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On September 16, 2013, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States, forfeiting all of Assa\u2019s, Alavi\u2019s, and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s interests in the Defendant Properties, with the exception of the Alavi Real Properties and three Alavi-only bank accounts. <em>In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, </em>No. 08 CIV. 10934(KBF), 2013 WL 5178677, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.

In granting summary judgment, the District Court <em>sua sponte </em>raised and rejected the Claimants\u2019 possible statute of limitations defense. <em>Id. </em>at *36-38. On April 18, 2014, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>granted summary judgment to the Government as to the Alavi Real Properties and three Alavi-only bank accounts. <em>In re 650 Fifth Avenue and Related Properties, </em>No. 08 CIV. 10934(KBF), 2014 WL 1516328, at *21-31 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2014). Finally, on May 28, 2014, at Alavi\u2019s and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s request, the District Court entered final judgment as to the Government\u2019s claims of forfeiture against these Claimants\u2019 properties. <em>See </em>Fed.

The IEEPA Theory of Forfeiture</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">The Government\u2019s first civil forfeiture claim arises under the IEEPA, a federal statute that empowers the President of the United States to employ economic sanctions and other measures to deal with threats to this nation\u2019s security, foreign policy, or economy, which have their source \u201cin whole or substantial part outside the United States,\u201d and for which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>has declared a national emergency. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1701-1702. The relevant civil forfeiture statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">(a)(1) The following property is subject to forfeiture to the United States: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar4\">(C) Any property, real or personal, which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to ... any offense constituting \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d (as defined in section 1956(c)(7) of this title), or a conspiracy to commit such offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C). Section 1956(c)(7) defines \u201cspecified unlawful activity\u201d to include offenses under \u201csection 206 (relating to penalties) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1956(c)(7)(D). Section 206 of the IEEPA makes it \u201cunlawful for a person to violate, attempt to violate, conspire to violate, or cause a violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition issued under this chapter,\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705(a), and provides for both civil and criminal penalties, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1705(b) (providing civil fine of $250,000 or amount twice transaction on which violation is based); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1705(c) (providing for up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and criminal fine up to $1,000,000). The orders, regulations, and prohibitions referenced in section 206 are set forth in several Executive Orders and related ITRs promulgated by OFAC. This chain of interlocking statutes can thus be summarized as follows: property that \u201cconstitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to\u201d violations of executive orders and ITRs promulgated pursuant to the IEEPA is subject to forfeiture. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1956(c)(7)(D); 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In 1995, President Clinton, acting pursuant to his authority under the IEEPA, issued two executive orders relevant to the present action. Executive Order 12,957 found that \u201cthe actions and policies of the Government of Iran constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\u201d and declared \u201ca national emergency to deal with that threat.\u201d Exec. Order No. 12,957, 60 Fed. Reg. 14615, 14615 (Mar. 15, 1995). Executive Order 12,959 imposed broad financial sanctions on Iran, including a prohibition on \u201cthe exportation from the United States to Iran, the Government of Iran, or to any entity owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, or the financing of such exportation, of any goods, technology ... or services.\u201d Exec.

It is undisputed that Bank Melli, a bank owned by the Iranian government, is the \u201cGovernment of Iran\u201d under the ITRs. <em>See id.; see also </em>Implementation of Executive Order No. 12959 with Respect to Iran, 60 Fed.

Ownership and Control</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">Claimants argue that the District Court erred in concluding, as a matter of law, that Bank Melli owned Assa after 1995. In so arguing, they rely on (1) corporate records showing that Bank Melli sold its interest in Assa to Shakeri and Agha-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>miri in 1995, (2) testimony from a former Bank Melli employee who stated that he understood that Melli was required by U.S. law to divest its ownership in Assa after five years, and (3) testimony from another former Bank Melli employee that he was. unaware of any relationship between Melli and Assa after 1995. The argument fails because the records do not show a <em>bona fide </em>transfer in that they report only trivial consideration for an entity worth tens of millions of dollars. Further belying a <em>bona fide </em>transfer is Bank Melli's strong motive to conceal its continued ownership of Assa after 1995 changes in U.S. law, previous use of straw entities to conceal its ownership interests, and documented continued involvement with Assa after 1995, while evading inquiries about the straw owners. On this record, even \u201cdraw[ing] all reasonable inferences\u201d in Claimants\u2019 favor, <em>Mhany Mgmt., Inc., </em>819 F.3d at 620, the evidence on which they rely is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to Bank Melli\u2019s post-1995 ownership and control of Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">First, assuming the admissibility of the proffered corporate records showing that Bank Melli divested its ownership interest in Assa in 1995, those records do not raise a question of fact precluding summary judgment because they fail to indicate a <em>bona fide </em>transaction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Rather, they show that Shakeri and Aghamiri each acquired 50 shares first in Harter Holdings and then in Assa for a total of \u00a350 (\u00a3l/share). Given that Assa had assets worth approximately $40 million, that consideration is so trivial as to belie a <em>bona fide </em>transfer. <em>See United States v. Premises and Real Property with Buildings, Appurtenance and Improvements at 500 Delaware Street, Tonawanda, New York, </em>113 F.3d 310, 312 (2d Cir. 1997) <em>(\u201c500 Delaware </em>Street\u201d) (upholding finding that a father was straw owner of home transferred to him by arrested son for $1 to avoid forfeiture); <em>United States v. Reckmeyer, </em>836 F.2d 200, 208 (4th Cir. 1987) (explaining that third party can avoid forfeiture of property under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853 by establishing that he is \u201cbona fide purchaser for value,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>he gave \u201cvalue to the defendant in an arms\u2019length transaction with the expectation that [he] would receive <em>equivalent value in return\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Even if it is possible that the corporate records do not reflect the true price Shakeri and Aghami-ri paid for Assa, such a possibility is necessarily speculative in the absence of any other record evidence of the transfer price. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>See, e.g., DiStiso v. Cook, </em>691 F.3d 226, 229-30 (2d Cir. 2012) (explaining that court reviewing motion for summary judgment \u201ccannot credit a [nonmovant\u2019s] merely speculative or conclusory assertions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Second, the record shows that Bank Melli had a strong motive in 1995 for concealing its continuing ownership and control of Assa behind straw purchasers. President Clinton\u2019s 1995 Executive Orders and related ITRs prohibited United States entities, such as Alavi, from providing services to instrumentalities of the Government of Iran, such as Melli, or entities fronting for it, as Assa had from its creation. <em>See </em>Exec. Order No. 12,957, 60 Fed. Reg. 14615 (Mar. 15, 1995); Exec. Order No. 12,959, 60 Fed. Reg. 24757 (May 6, 1995); Iranian Transactions Regulations: Implementation of Executive Orders 12957 and 12959, 60 Fed. Reg. 47061-01 (Sept. 11, 1995). Indeed, soon after the 1995 Orders, OFAC formally identified Bank Melli as owned or controlled by the Government of Iran, <em>see </em>Implementation of Executive Order No. 12959, 60 Fed. Reg. 40881-02 (Aug. 10, 1995), thereby making it illegal for Melli to own an interest in 650 Fifth Ave. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Third, even if the 1995 sanctions could admit an inference of true divestiture in order to comply with U.S. law, such an inference is not reasonable here. Not only did the recorded consideration for Bank Melli\u2019s Assa holdings not reflect a <em>bona fide </em>sale, but record evidence demonstrates that, well before 1995, Bank Melli had concealed its ownership and control of Assa while still profiting from Building-generated income. In 1989, Bank Melli (on behalf of Iran), created a chain of straw entities stretching from the Jersey Islands to the United States <em>(e.g., </em>Assa Corporation, Assa Limited, Harter Holdings, 650 Fifth Ave. Co.) that it used to effect circular money transfers that allowed Alavi to discharge its mortgage debt to Melli (and thereby avoid tax obligations on Building income), while effectively transferring a 35% \u2014 subsequently 40% \u2014 interest in that Property and its income to Bank Melli (and thereby to Iran). Thus, even though Bank Melli\u2019s ownership and control of Assa prior to 1995 appears undisputed, corporate records show that from 1989 to 1993, Assa\u2019s shares were held not directly by Bank Melli but, through Harter Holdings, by straw owners, Mohammad Beh-dadfar, a member of Melli\u2019s Board, and Mohsen Kakavand, a regional manager of Melli\u2019s London office. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 6918 (Bo-nyad Mostazafan correspondence from 1989 explaining that \u201cAssa ... belonged] to Bank Melli\u201d); App\u2019x 9888 (Bank Melli correspondence explaining that \u201ctransfer of the Assa Channel Island shares of the mother company to the bank\u201d was not a problem because \u201cunderstanding \u25a0 has always been that the ownership of the mother company was with Bank Melli\u201d); App\u2019x 10346-53 (corporate records documenting ownership of Assa\u2019s shares from 1989 to 1993). Moreover, Alavi, in its verified petition seeking leave of the New York Supreme Court to transfer ownership of the Building to 650 Fifth Ave. Co., concealed Bank Melli\u2019s true ownership of Assa by identifying Behdadfar and Kakavand as owners, misrepresenting that the Assa-Alavi partnership was an \u201carms-length transaction.\u201d App\u2019x 6152.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Record evidence from before 1995 also shows that even after Bank Melli became the record owner of Harter Holdings (and, through it, of Assa), Bank Melli intended to conceal its involvement with these straw entities. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 7094 (1993 letter from Bank Melli department stating that ownership of Harter and Assa Limited was transferred to Melli in part because, with their Channel Islands registration, \u201caccessing the ownership backgrounds of the companies behind the captioned corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tion is not an easy task for investigators,\u201d and asking \u201cwhether Mr. Naghshineh \u2014 the' Assa Corp New York Director whose affiliation with the Bank could be easily proven - could be replaced with another individual whose affiliation with the Bank could not be easily proven\u201d); App\u2019x 7103 (1994 letter from Bank Melli department to director of Bank Melli New York asking him to \u201cestimate the percentage of risk of the seizure of [U.S. properties] in case of the revelation of the ownership by Assa Corporation\u201d). Such evidence of Bank Mel-li\u2019s pre-1995 intent to conceal its ownership of Assa behind straw entities and purchasers is probative, though not determinative, of Bank Melli\u2019s similar intent in seeming to transfer Assa ownership for trivial consideration to even more remote straw purchasers in 1995. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed. R. Evid. 403, 404(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Fourth, after 1995, Assa\u2019s sole United States representative, Tafti, continued to communicate on management matters with ONSD, which had been involved in Assa\u2019s affairs since its creation, <em>see, e.g., </em>App\u2019x 6923-24, 7094, 7103, 9885. Notably, Tafti communicated with ONSD head Ghadimip-our about structuring Assa\u2019s record ownership to avoid running afoul of sanctions on Iran. Tafti requested that Ghadimipour supply him with copies of Aghamiri\u2019s and Shakeri\u2019s signatures, and that he instruct Aghamiri and Shakeri to drop Iran as their residence to avoid the risk of capital in their names being frozen by the United States. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 7129, 7156. Tafti further advised Ghadimipour that if a new Assa shareholder were selected, it should be someone.who resided in a tax free country. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 7134. Implicit in these communications is <em>Bank Melli\u2019s </em>control of Assa shareholder selection to conceal its own prohibited interest in U.S. property. Communications purportedly from the \u201cAssa shareholders\u201d to Tafti warrant no different conclusion because each is sent to, or from, an ONSD email address, thus further demonstrating Bank Melli\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In urging otherwise, Claimants suggest that Bank Melli was merely an intermediary between Assa and the record shareholders. But that hypothesis is a speculative one given the lack of evidence that Shakeri and Aghamiri ever exercised any control over Assa, participated in any of its decisions, or received any income therefrom. <em>See DiStiso v. Cook, </em>691 F.3d at 229-30 (explaining that court reviewing motion for summary judgment \u201ccannot credit a [nonmovant\u2019s] merely speculative or conclusory assertions\u201d). Such speculation is further undermined by Tafti\u2019s failure to identify Assa\u2019s shareholders or to arrange a meeting with them despite repeated requests from Alavi\u2019s attorneys and representatives in the United States. <em>See, e.g., </em>App\u2019x 10691, 10694, 10697, 10709, 10713. Indeed, record evidence indicates that Tafti planned to address the \u201cabsence of Mr. Shakeri\u201d at a meeting with Citibank either by explaining that Shakeri was on a vacation or that he had resigned as director and that Tafti and Assa\u2019s lawyer had become Assa\u2019s directors. App\u2019x 7152. The record only bolsters the conclusion that Shakeri and Aghamiri were not <em>bona fide </em>owners of, and never exercised control over, Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Despite the totality of evidence demonstrating Bank Melli\u2019s continued control over Assa after 1995, Claimants contend a genuine issue of material fact on that point is raised by the testimony of two former bank employees. Mohammad Karjooravy, the director of Bank Melli\u2019s New York office from 1986 to 1994 who was closely involved in the formation of Assa and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., testified that Bank Melli intended to be involved in the partnership \u201cfor a short time,\u201d and that he understood U.S. regulation to require Melli to divest its ownership interest within five years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>App\u2019x 10875, 10382-83. At best, this evidence demonstrates only Bank Melli\u2019s intent to divest its record ownership in Assa. It does not undermine, much less refute, record evidence showing that Melli did not intend to divest itself of actual ownership or control of Assa, or showing that the 1995 sale of Assa was not a <em>bona fide </em>transfer of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Gholamreza Rahi, an Assistant Director for Bank Melli\u2019s ONSD at the time of the formation of Assa and 650 Fifth Ave. Co., and the director of Bank Melli\u2019s New York office from 1994 to 2003, testified that he did not know who owned Assa after Bank Melli divested its indirect interest in 1995. Claimants contend that Rahi\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge ... strongly suggests ... that there was no ownership relationship between Bank Melli and Assa after 1995.\u201d Claimants Br. 46. Rahi\u2019s ignorance, however, is not probative of Bank Melli\u2019s post-1995 relationship with Assa because the record evidence does not indicate that the New York office was involved in Assa\u2019s affairs after 1995. Indeed, as discussed. <em>supra, </em>after 1995, Bank Melli\u2019s ONSD was involved with Assa\u2019s affairs, and the record is devoid of testimony from a then-employee of <em>that </em>department regarding post-1995 ownership or control of Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">In sum, the record evidence convincingly demonstrates that Bank Melli, and therefore the Government of Iran, continued to control Assa after 1995, and admits no genuine issue of triable fact on that question.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">2. Alavi\u2019s Knowledge of Bank Melli\u2019s Post-1995 Ownership and Control of Assa</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">While the record admits no factual dispute as to Bank Melli\u2019s ownership and control of Assa after 1995, there is a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Claimant Alavi knew of that ownership.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ants' offered several post-1995 letters from Alavi employees and attorneys to Assa representatives inquiring about the identity of Assa\u2019s \u201cowners\u201d or \u201cstockholders.\u201d For example, in 1995, Alavi\u2019s counsel asked Assa\u2019s counsel to identify Assa\u2019s new owners. Also in 1995, Mohammad Geramian (\u201cGeramian\u201d), the President of Alavi from 1991 to 2007, inquired as to Assa\u2019s new owners. In 2003 and in 2007, new counsel at Alavi sent letters to Assa\u2019s counsel inquiring about Assa\u2019s owners and directors and requesting a meeting with them. Moreover, Abbas Mirakhor (\u201cMirakhor\u201d), a member of Alavi\u2019s Board of Directors from approximately 1991-2005, provided deposition testimony that he did not know who the actual owners of Assa were, despite Alavi\u2019s \u201cgood faith efforts\u201d to identify them. App\u2019x 5721. Mirakhor testified that he had no reason to believe that the other members of the Board knew either. This evidence, viewed most favorably to Alavi, could allow a reasonable jury to find that the Government failed to carry its burden on the issue of Alavi\u2019s knowledge of Bank Melli\u2019s (and, therefore, Iran\u2019s) continuing ownership and control of Assa after 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In concluding otherwise, the District Court relied almost exclusively on pre-1995 evidence, observing that \u201cAlavi\u2019s own documents [from this time period] are replete with references to board members\u2019 awareness of the decision-making authority of the Ayatollah over the composition of the Foundation\u2019s board, of the role that the Iranian Ambassador was to play in the Foundation\u2019s business with respect both to the Building and its charitable activities.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *18. A court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that pre-1995 knowledge demonstrates post-1995 knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Nor can such a conclusion be reached based on notes in Ebrahimi\u2019s journal, specifically the note inscribing \u201cAssa <em>-&gt; </em>Bank Melli 40% share.\u201d App\u2019x 7109-10. Even if this note, together with the totality of evidence, might permit .a factfinder to conclude that Alavi knew of Bank Melli\u2019s post-1995 control of Assa, they do not compel that conclusion as a matter of law. A reasonable juror could conclude that the note reflects only the pre-1995 assignment of a 40% share of 650 Fifth Ave. Co. to Bank Melli (through Assa) in return for Melli\u2019s 1989 financing of tax-avoidance transactions. Notes from the Khazaee-Jahedi meeting are no more conclusive as to Ala-vi\u2019s knowledge of Bank Melli\u2019s or the Government of Iran\u2019s post-1995 control over Assa.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">In sum, because testimonial and documentary evidence raises a genuine dispute as to whether Alavi was aware of Bank Melli\u2019s continuing ownership and control of Assa after 1995, this issue cannot be resolved by summary judgment. Further, because a triable issue exists as to Alavi\u2019s knowledge of Bank Melli\u2019s ongoing ownership or control, it necessarily follows that a triable issue exists as to whether the Claimants \u201cintended specifically\u201d to provide services to the Government of Iran, by way of Bank Melli, in providing services to Assa after 1995. 31 C.F.R. \u00a7560.204. The Government may ultimately prove these disputed issues of knowledge and intent at trial, but the question cannot be answered as a matter of law so as to support summary judgment on the Government\u2019s claim that these Claimants committed a forfeitable offense under IEEPA and the ITRs. We therefore vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>summary judgment award on these claims as to these Claimants and remand for further proceedings, including trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">B. The Money Laundering Theory of Forfeiture</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The Government\u2019s second civil forfeiture claim arises under the money laundering statutes. In relevant part, the civil forfeiture statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">(a)(1) The following property is subject to forfeiture to the United States:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">(A) Any property, real or personal, involved in a transaction or attempted \u2022 transaction in violation of section 1956, 1957 or 1960 of this title, or any property traceable to such property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(A). To show that the property was \u201cinvolved in\u201d such a transaction, the Government has the burden of proving that \u201cthere was a substantial connection between the property and the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 983(c)(3). The Government claims that Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. committed a forfeitable offense by committing three types of money laundering violations prohibited by \u00a7 1956: promotion money laundering, concealment money laundering, and international money laundering. In relevant part, \u00a7 1956 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">(a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">(A) [Promotion] (i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) with intent to engage in conduct constituting a violation of section 7201 or 7206 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-12\">(B) [Concealment] knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part \u2014 (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity [shall be guilty of an offense]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-14\">(a)(2) [International] Whoever transports, transmits, or transfers, or attempts to transport, transmit, or transfer a monetary instrument or funds from a place in the United States to or through a place outside the United States or to a place in the United States from or through a place outside the United States\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-15\">(A) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-16\">(B) knowing that the monetary instrument or funds involved in the transportation, transmission, or transfer represent the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and knowing that such transportation, transmission, or transfer is designed in whole or in part \u2014 (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity; or (ii) to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-17\">shall be [guilty of an offense].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-18\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)-(B), (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-19\">Knowledge of unlawful activity \u2014 or intent to carry out an unlawful activity \u2014 is an element of every one of the three money laundering offenses. To secure summary judgment based on promotion or concealment money laundering, the Government must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that there is no genuine dispute that the Claimants knew that \u201cproperty involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1956(a)(1). To secure summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>based on international money laundering, the Government must show, <em>inter alia, </em>no genuine dispute that the Claimants either (1) intended to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity, or (2) knew-that the funds being transferred were proceeds of specified unlawful activity. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1956(a)(2); <em>accord United States v. Ness, </em>565 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Here, the Government alleges that the Claimants engaged in proscribed money laundering by committing IEEPA violations. As discussed above, however, whether Claimants violated the IEEPA depends on the disputed question of Claimant Ala-vi\u2019s knowledge of Bank Melli\u2019s post-1995 control of Assa, which gives rise to a triable issue as to its culpable intent in providing services to Assa pursuant to their partnership in 650 Fifth Ave. Co. These material issues preclude determining Claimants\u2019 involvement in money laundering violations as a matter of law and, thus, require us to vacate the award of summary judgment on this claim for forfeiture and to remand the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">II. The Statute of Limitations Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">To avoid running afoul of the statute of limitations, the Government must file its civil forfeiture action \u201cwithin five years after the time when the alleged [forfeita-ble] offense was discovered.\u201d 19 -U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. In their answer to the complaint, the Claimants asserted that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s claims are barred, in whole or in part, by the statute of limitations.\u201d App\u2019x 2570. However, the Claimants did not move for summary judgment on this defense, and the Government did not argue that it was entitled to summary judgment on the defense in its motion. Nonetheless, the District Court raised and decided the statute of limitations defense <em>sua sponte, </em>entering summary judgment in favor of the Government. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *36. The District Court reasoned that it \u201cscoured the record to determine if there is a triable issue as to this defense\u201d and determined that there was no triable issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">This decision was in error. The Federal Rules state that a court may grant summary judgment <em>sua sponte </em>only \u201c[a]fter giving notice and a reasonable time to respond\u201d and \u201cafter identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (\u201c[District courts are widely acknowledged to possess the power to enter summary judgments <em>sua sponte, </em>so long as the losing party was on notice that [it] had to come forward with all of [its] evidence.\u201d). While we have held that \u201cit is not necessarily reversible error in our Circuit for a district court to grant summary judgment against the moving party without notice or opportunity to defend,\u201d we have \u201cfirmly discouraged\u201d even that practice and \u201cmade clear that grants of summary judgment without notice will be tolerated only ... when the facts before the district court were fully developed so that the moving party suffered no procedural prejudice.\u201d <em>Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, </em>201 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sized that \u201ccare should be taken by the district court to determine that the party against whom summary judgment is rendered has had a full and fair opportunity to meet the proposition that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be tried.\u201d <em>Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics GmbH v. Pacificlink Int\u2019l Corp., </em>401 F.3d 28, 33 (2d Cir. 2005) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Here, the District Court granted summary judgment against the nonmovant Claimants\u2019 statute of limitations defense without affording the Claimants any \u2014 let alone a full and fair \u2014 opportunity to present evidence as to the applicability of the defense. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *3, *36-38. The Claimants had no notice that the District Court would consider their statute of limitations defense because the Government did not seek summary judgment on it or any other defense. Indeed, in its motion for summary judgment, the Government requested that the District Court afford it a subsequent opportunity to address the Claimants\u2019 innocent owner defense if it initially granted summary judgment in its favor on the issue of \u201cforfeitability of the defendants <em>in rem.\u201d </em>Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 689 at 48, n.15. This effectively put the Claimants and the District Court on notice that the Government did <em>not </em>intend for the Claimants\u2019 affirmative defenses to be addressed on its summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In light of the Government\u2019s express cabining of its summary judgment motion to its affirmative liability claims, it was particularly important for the District Court to put the Claimants on notice of its intention <em>sua sponte </em>to consider the statute of limitations defense, and to afford Claimants a reasonable opportunity to respond before deciding the issue against them. This is not a case where the record was so fully developed that Claimants plainly suffered no prejudice from the procedural error. <em>Cf. Bridgeway Corp., </em>201 F.3d at 139. In fact, it was hardly developed at all on the statute of limitations question.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, the District Court procedurally erred in <em>sua sponte </em>considering the Claimants\u2019 statute of limitations defense and deciding in favor of the Government. <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>III. The Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion for clear error as to the district court\u2019s factual findings and <em>de novo </em>as to its legal conclusions. <em>United States v. Getto, </em>729 F.3d 221, 227 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">A. The Fourth Amendment Applies to the Seizures at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV., It further provides that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the Fourth Amendment \u201ccontains no provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands,\u201d the Supreme Court has established \u201can exclusionary rule that, when applicable, forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, 555 </em>U.S. 135, 139, 129 S.Ct. 695, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The exclusionary rule is \u201c \u2018designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139-40, 129 S.Ct. 695 (quoting <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">It' is well-established that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s exclusionary rule applies in forfeiture eases. <em>See 500 Delaware Street, </em>113 F.3d at 312 n. 3; <em>see also One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, </em>380 U.S. 693, 696, 85 S.Ct. 1246, 14 L.Ed.2d 170 (1965) (holding that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture proceedings); <em>Austin v. United States, </em>509 U.S. 602, 608 n. 4, 113 S.Ct. 2801, 125 L.Ed.2d 488 (1993) (observing that \u201cthe [Supreme] Court has held that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeiture proceedings\u201d); <em>Krimstock v. Kelly, </em>306 F.3d 40, 49 (2d Cir. 2002) (explaining that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment protects claimants against unreasonable seizures of their property in the civil forfeiture context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">The District Court, however, concluded that there was no need to consider the Claimants\u2019 Fourth Amendment challenges to the seized evidence in \u2019this case because the Claimants\u2019 pre-existing civil discovery and production requirements \u201cobviate[d] the need for any Fourth Amendment analysis.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d at 211. In fact, discovery or production obligations do not displace Fourth Amendment protections. Rather, such obligations may trigger the inevitable discovery doctrine to shield from suppression even evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Eng, </em>971 F.2d 854, 861 (2d Cir. 1992). Because we here identify a Fourth Amendment defect in the seizure warrant, we proceed to consider whether the Government demonstrated inevitable discovery. We conclude that the District Court failed to make the requisite findings with sufficient particularity and, therefore, we vacate its suppression ruling and remand for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">B. The Warrant Was Constitutionally Defective</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The Fourth Amendment requires a search warrant \u201cparticularly [to] describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Such particularity is necessarily tied to the Amendment\u2019s probable cause requirement. \u201cBy limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search, the requirement ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Garrison, </em>480 U.S. 79, 84, 107 S.Ct. 1013, 94 L.Ed.2d 72 (1987). Thus, for a warrant to meet the particularity requirement, it must identify the alleged crime for which evidence is sought. <em>See United States v. George, </em>975 F.2d 72, 76 (2d Cir. 1992) (observing that warrant lacked particularity where \u201c[n]othing on the face of the warrant tells the searching officers for what crime the search is being undertaken\u201d); <em>United States v. Galpin, </em>720 F.3d 436, 447 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that search warrant generally authorizing police officers to search defendant\u2019s physical property and electronic equipment for evidence of \u201cNYS Penal Law and or Federal Statutes\u201d violated the particularity requirement (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In <em>Groh, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s particularity requirements must be satisfied \u201cin the warrant, not in the supporting documents.\u201d <em>Groh v. Ramirez, </em>540 U.S. 551, 557, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004). However, \u201ca court may construe a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>warrant with reference to a supporting application or affidavit if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation, and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557-58, 124 S.Ct. 1284. Thus, for a warrant to be sufficiently particular, the alleged crimes must appear in either (1) the warrant itself, or (2) in a supporting document if the warrant uses appropriate words of incorporation and if the supporting document accompanies the warrant. <em>See id. </em>But for an attached affidavit properly to be incorporated into a warrant, the warrant must contain \u201cdeliberate and unequivocal language of incorporation.\u201d <em>United States v. Waker, </em>534 F.3d 168, 172-73 <em>&amp; </em>n.2 (2d Cir. 2008) (per cu-riam) (finding supporting affidavit incorporated by reference in warrant where it was attached to warrant, warrant stated that supporting affidavit \u201cis incorporated herein by reference,\u201d and magistrate had \u201cinitialed the [relevant] portion of the attached affidavit\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also Groh, </em>540 U.S. at 557-58, 124 S.Ct. 1284. Language in a warrant that simply references an underlying affidavit does not incorporate the affidavit so as to allow the documents together to satisfy the particularity requirement. <em>See Groh, </em>540 U.S. at 554-55, 124 S.Ct. 1284 (concluding that, although warrant referenced affidavit insofar as it \u201crecite[d] that the Magistrate was satisfied the affidavit established probable cause,\u201d warrant \u201cdid not incorporate by reference\u201d list of items to be seized that was contained in application); <em>George, </em>975 F.2d at 76 (holding \u201crecitation in ... warrant that it [was] issued upon the basis of an application and affidavit\u201d insufficient to incorporate affidavit by reference (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">On its face, the warrant in this case plainly lacked particularity as to the crimes at issue. Indeed, the Government concedes this point. <em>See </em>Government Br. 81 (acknowledging that \u201cwarrant should have listed the alleged offenses, but did not\u201d). Nor did the warrant particularize categories of computerized information for which there was probable cause to seize, or the temporal scope of the materials that could be seized. Instead, the warrant authorized the search and seizure of (1) '\u201c[a]ny and all ... documents or records concerning or relating to the ownership of, rental of, mortgaging of, or investing in [Assa, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Alavi, or Bank Melli Iran],\u201d (2) \u201c[a]ny and all documents concerning or relating to financial books and records, bank accounts, disbursements, money transfers or employment records of [Assa, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., Alavi, or Bank Melli Iran] or any of the officers and employees of these entities,\u201d and, most broadly, (3) \u201c[a]ny and all computers; central processing units; external and internal drives; external and internal storage equipment or media; computerized data storage devices; hard disks or floppy disks; CD-ROMs[;] ... and related or connected computer or data storage equipment\u201d located on the premises to be searched.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> App\u2019x 5141.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>While the Ennis affidavit supporting the warrant does reference the potential charges for which evidence was sought, noting that \u201cBank Melli is subject to the Iranian Transactions Regulations ... and Assa Co.\u2019s interest in the Building and its rents is subject to civil forfeiture, as fully set forth in\u201d the initial 2008 complaint against Assa and Bank Melli, that affidavit was neither attached to the warrant nor incorporated by deliberate and unequivocal language. The warrant only referenced the affidavit. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 5140 (\u201cAffidavit(s) having been made before me by Special Agent George Ennis.... \u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cI am satisfied ... that the grounds for application for issuance of the search warrant exist as stated in the supporting affidavit(s)-\u201d). Thus, even assuming that the affidavit can be construed to signal that only evidence relating to the alleged forfeitable offenses was to be seized, the failure of deliberate incorporation precludes a reviewing court\u2019s reliance on the affidavit to cure the warrant\u2019s lack of particularity. <em>See Groh, </em>540 U.S. at 557-58, 124 S.Ct. 1284.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>C.

The inevitable discovery doctrine \u201crequires the district court to determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search, what <em>would have happened </em>had the unlawful search never occurred.\u201d <em>United States v.

Vilar, </em>729 F.3d 62, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). We have previously characterized the Government\u2019s obligation as one of \u201ccertitude\u201d that the evidence would have been discovered. <em>Heath, </em>455 F.3d at 58 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In <em>Eng I </em>and <em>Eng II, </em>we identified the need to guard against government actions taken \u201cas an after the fact insurance policy to validate an unlawful search under the inevitable discovery doctrine\u201d and, toward that end, set forth courts\u2019 procedural obligations in making inevitable discovery determinations. <em>See Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>accord Eng II, </em>997 F.2d at 989-90. The facts at issue in <em>Eng I </em>and <em>Eng II </em>bear repetition here. In February 1989, federal officials investigated the defendant for narcotics and money laundering violations. <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 856. In the course of this investigation, the officials unlawfully searched and seized contents of the defendant\u2019s safe without a warrant, violating the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 856-58.

After defendant was charged with three counts of tax evasion, he moved to suppress certain evidence as derived from the unlawful search of his safe. <em>Id. </em>at 857-59. The district court concluded that the inev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>itable discovery doctrine applied and admitted all of the challenged evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 858-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On appeal, <em>Eng I </em>laid out (and <em>Eng II </em>reiterated) a two-step process for making inevitable discovery determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 861-62; <em>Eng II; </em>997 F.2d at 989-90. First, the court must evaluate \u201cthe progress of the investigation at. the time of the government misconduct\u201d to determine whether \u201can active and ongoing investigation ... was in progress at the time of unlawful search.\u201d <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861\u201462; <em>see Eng II, </em>997 F.2d at 989-90. At this step, the government must establish that the investigation was not \u201ctriggered or catalyzed by the information unlawfully gained\u201d by the illegal search but, rather, that \u201cthe alternate means of obtaining the [challenged] evidence\u201d was, \u201cat least to some degree, imminent, if yet unrealized\u201d at the time of the unlawful search. <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Eng II, </em>997 F.2d at 989-90, 992. Second, the \u201ccourt must, <em>for each particular piece of evidence, </em>specifically analyze and explain how, if at all, discovery of that piece of evidence would have been more likely than not inevitable absent the [unlawful] search.\u201d <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 862 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Eng II, </em>997 F.2d at 989-90. Applying these standards in <em>Eng, </em>we ruled that a subpoena issued contemporaneously with an unlawful search was not enough to \u201cvalidate an unlawful search under the inevitable discovery doctrine.\u201d <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we subsequently explained, in language particularly relevant in this case, the \u201cdetailed showings of each of the contingencies involved\u201d in the <em>Eng </em>formulations are necessary to avoid encouraging \u201cofficers to <em>obviate or nullify the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement </em>by baldly asserting that they inevitably would have had the probable cause needed to obtain a warrant.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>455 F.3d at 64 (emphasis added) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">This precedent makes clear that Claimants\u2019 civil discovery and protective order obligations were not enough, by themselves, to support a conclusion that the Fourth Amendment was \u201cnot implicated\u201d in the suppression challenge presented. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d at 212-13. Moreover, this precedent precludes a general conclusion that all of the evidence seized pursuant to the challenged warrant was nonetheless admissible in the Government\u2019s forfeiture action because it would have been inevitably discovered in civil discovery or as a result of the protective order. In reaching that conclusion here, the District Court reasoned in two paragraphs of factual findings that \u201c[a]s to Alavi, such historical facts exist and demonstrate inevitable discovery\u201d for all of the evidence seized in the December 2008 search because \u201c[t]he preexistence of civil litigations which each carried common law preservation obligations, the production obligations under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the fact that Alavi failed to object to the scope of those obligations and actually produced the disputed documents moot the constitutional question central to this motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">This analysis was insufficient to support a finding that the Government would inevitably have discovered the entire contents of Alavi\u2019s computers, electronic storage devices, servers, and over 200 boxes of documents pursuant to the protective order and civil discovery obligations. Specifically, the District Court failed to make clear that it was \u201cviewing affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,\u201d and making particularized find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ings as to \u201cwhat <em>would have happened </em>had the unlawful search never occurred.\u201d <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861 (emphasis in original); <em>see In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d at 211-13. The former consideration should properly have been informed by (1) the initial civil forfeiture action, filed on December 17, 2008, which sought forfeiture only of Assa\u2019s assets, although it discussed in detail the history of Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co.; (2) the District Court\u2019s December 17, 2008 protective order in that action, which, among other things, (a) required 650 Fifth Ave. Co. to make available for inspection to the United States all of its books and records and (b) prohibited any person or entity with actual knowledge of the protective order from destroying documents relating to the forfeiture complaint\u2019s allegations; (3) the December 17, 2008 grand jury subpoena to Alavi seeking all documents relating, or referring, to Assa, 650 Fifth Ave. Co., and Bank Melli, for the period January 1989 to December 2008; and (4) Jahedi\u2019s observed destruction of documents responsive to that subpoena the following day. With respect to these pre-search events, we make several observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">First, in explaining that \u201cAlavi was under a pre-existing duty prior to the 2008 search to <em>provide </em>its books and records to the Government for inspection \u2014 all of them,\u201d the District Court overstated Ala-vi\u2019s obligations under the protective order. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d at 211-12 (emphasis added). That order imposed no production obligation on Alavi; rather, it prohibited \u201c[a]ll persons and entities having actual knowledge of [the] Protective Order\u201d from \u201cdestroy[ing] any documents relating in any manner or part to the allegations in the [2008 forfeiture] Complaint.\u201d App\u2019x 5185. Insofar as the protective order required 650 Fifth Ave. Co., a separate entity of which Alavi is a 60% owner, to make its books and records \u201cavailable for inspection to the United States,\u201d <em>id</em>. at 5186, the District Court failed to explain how that inspection obligation would have resulted in the Government inevitably obtaining possession of such records. <em>See, e.g., Nix, </em>467 U.S. at 447, 104 S.Ct. 2501 (establishing that, under the \u201cinevitable discovery\u201d doctrine, evidence <em>obtained </em>during the course of an unreasonable search and seizure should not be excluded \u201cif the government can prove that the evidence would have been <em>obtained </em>inevitably\u201d without the constitutional violation (emphasis added)); <em>accord Heath, </em>455 F.3d at 55. Logically, an obligation to make a massive quantity of materials available for inspection does not mean that the authorized inspector will inevitably obtain each individual material made available. Here, it is not manifest that the Government would have obtained <em>every </em>item seized from Alavi \u2014 computers, electronic storage devices, servers, and over 200 boxes of documents \u2014 pursuant to 650 Fifth Ave. Co.\u2019s obligation to make certain documents available (or Alavi\u2019s obligation not to destroy certain documents).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Second, the District Court failed to explain how the Government would have obtained every item of seized evidence in the pre-existing civil suit, whether pursuant to the Claimants\u2019 production obligations or through civil discovery. The only action pending at the time of the search was the initial civil forfeiture action, which related to Assa\u2019s property and which imposed upon Claimants, at most, a common law obligation of preservation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>See Kronsich </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>150 F.3d 112, 126 (2d Cir. 1998) (explaining that \u201cobligation to preserve evidence arises when the party has notice that the evidence is relevant to litigation \u2014 most commonly when suit has already been filed, providing the party responsible for the destruction with express notice, but also on occasion in other circumstances, as for example when a party should have known that the evidence may be relevant to future litigation\u201d). Thus, for the same reasons just discussed with respect to the protective order, further findings are necessary to conclude that any, common law preservation obligation would inevitably have resulted in the Government obtaining each item of seized evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Third, insofar as the Government here relies on the December 17, 2008 subpoena, we note that the District Court did not rely on that subpoena in reaching its inevitable discovery conclusion. Thus, we leave it to that court on remand to determine whether the Government has carried its burden to show that \u201ca response to the subpoena producing the evidence in question\u201d was inevitable. <em>Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Finally, we are mindful that, in 2012, in response to a joint document request from the Government and judgment creditors, Claimants did produce the same documents that were seized during the December 2008 search. The Government, however, sought those documents from Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. only after amending its complaint to seek forfeiture of their interests. Many of the amended complaint\u2019s allegations against Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. derived from documents seized during the December 19, 2008 search. On this record, we cannot confidently conclude that a request for production in the <em>amended </em>forfeiture action was not tainted by the challenged search so as to admit a finding of inevitable discovery. <em>Cf. Vilar, </em>729 F.3d at 84-85 (concluding that evidence was properly admitted under inevitable discovery doctrine despite unlawful search because documents were subsequently produced pursuant to grand jury subpoena and, among other things, \u201cthe subpoena was not issued on the basis of any information unlawfully seized\u201d from defendant\u2019s office).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">This is not to say that the Government lacked sufficient evidence to commence a forfeiture action against Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. before the challenged search. Indeed, based on facts alleged in the initial forfeiture complaint and issuance of the December 17, 2008 subpoena, the Government\u2019s investigation may well have been sufficiently advanced prior to the December 19, 2008 search to make both Claimants\u2019 addition to the forfeiture complaint even without the unlawfully seized evidence and, therefore, their disclosure obligations, inevitable. Because the District Court declined to consider this argument below, however, the record does not now permit us to reach such a conclusion. Rather, the District Court may consider this issue on remand. <em>See Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861-62 (explaining that \u201cinevitable discovery analysis logically must begin with the progress of the investigation at the time of the government misconduct,\u201d and that court conducting such analysis must determine what would have happened \u201cin light of what the government knew and was pursuing at the moment before the unlawful search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">In remanding this case to the District Court, we note that the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>has long rejected the notion that the Government can circumvent the exclusionary rule by using lawful processes to obtain evidence that it previously seized illegally. <em>See Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U.S. 385, 392, 40 S.Ct. 182, 64 L.Ed. 319 (1920). In the enduring words of Justice Holmes, \u201c[t]he essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392, 40 S.Ct. 182. Allowing the Government to immunize an illegal search simply by obtaining the evidence in a subsequent legal request would \u201creduce[ ] the Fourth Amendment to a form of words.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 362, 94 S.Ct. 613. Thus, we cannot rubber stamp the Government\u2019s assertion that it would have inevitably discovered unlawfully obtained evidence in a subsequent lawful mechanism simply because the latter mechanism is pursued. To secure an exception from the exclusionary rule on the ground of inevitable discovery, the Government must make a \u201cdetailed showing[ ] of each of the contingencies involved\u201d and the District Court must find each contingency satisfied with respect to each item of seized evidence. <em>Heath, </em>455 F.3d at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Eng I, </em>971 F.2d at 861-62; <em>Eng II, </em>997 F.2d at 989-90; <em>United States v. Stokes, </em>733 F.3d 438, 444 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">D. The Good Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">On appeal, the Government argues, with some force, that, whether or not the inevitable discovery exception applies, no suppression of evidence is warranted in this case because the executing agents relied in good faith on the December 19, 2008 search warrant. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984); <em>see also United States v. Rosa, </em>626 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining that although unincorporated, unattached supporting documents cannot cure constitutionally defective warrant, \u201cthose documents are still relevant to our determination of whether the officers acted in good faith\u201d). Because the District Court did not address the Government\u2019s good-faith argument, we decline to consider it for the first time on appeal. Rather, we leave the Government to pursue it on remand in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">1. As to summary judgment ordering forfeiture of Claimants\u2019 property,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">(a) the record admits no factual dispute as to Bank Melli\u2019s (and therefore Iran\u2019s) continuing ownership and control of Assa after 1995, but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">(b) the record, viewed most favorably to Claimants, reveals disputes of fact as to Claimants\u2019 knowledge of that ownership, which preclude an award of summary judgment against them as to both the IEEPA and money laundering theories of forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-12\">2. The District Court procedurally erred in <em>sua sponte </em>considering and rejecting Claimants\u2019 statute of limitations defense without first affording the parties notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard..</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">3. As to the District Court\u2019s challenged denial of suppression,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">(a) it is well settled that the Fourth Amendment applies in civil forfeiture actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">(b) where, as here, the Government concedes that evidence was seized pursuant to a warrant lacking the requisite particularity, civil orders of protection and production do not obviate Fourth Amendment concerns, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>though they can trigger an inevitable discovery exception to suppression;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-4\">(c) the inevitable discovery exception requires a court to \u201cview[ ] affairs as they existed at the instant before the unlawful search,\u201d and make particularized findings with respect to each item of seized evidence as to \u201cwhat would have happened had the unlawful search never occurred,\u201d <em>United States v. Eng, </em>971 F.2d 854, 861 (2d Cir. 1992); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">(d) remand is required to allow the District Court to conduct the requisite inevitable discovery analysis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">4. On remand, the Government may pursue its argument that the good-faith exception to suppression also applies in this case. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s summary judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-7\">.

[s]uch ... services are intended specifically for supply ... directly or indirectly, to Iran or the Government of Iran\u201d). Further, although the IEEPA prescribes criminal penalties for the \"willful[]\u201d violation of an IEEPA-promulgated regulation, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705(c), the civil penalties provision specifies no similar <em>mens rea </em>requirement, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1705(b); <em>Humanitarian Law Project v. U.S. Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>578 F.3d 1133, 1150 (9th Cir. 2009) (explaining that IEEPA\u2019s civil penalty provision does not have a <em>mens rea </em>requirement). Nevertheless, the District Court determined that knowledge was an element of an IEEPA or ITR violation. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *22 (noting that \"determining if there is a triable issue of fact as to whether Claimants have violated, attempted to violate, or conspired to violate the IEEPA (and its implementing ITRs) requires inquiry into ... whether there is a triable issue as to knowledge\u201d). Likewise, on appeal, the Claimants argue, and the Government does not dispute, that to secure forfeiture based on Claimants\u2019 violation of IEEPA or the ITRs, the Government had to show that Claimants provided services to Assa after 1995 knowing that the entity continued to be owned and controlled by Bank Melli and, therefore, by Iran. Thus, we assume without deciding that the challenged summary judgment can be affirmed only if no material questions of fact exist as to Claimants' <em>knowing </em>violation of IEEPA-promulgated ITRs. <em>See New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC, </em>787 F.3d 638, 662 (2d Cir. 2015) (explaining that arguments not raised before district court are forfeited on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">.In addition to 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7560.204, 560.206, the District Court determined that Alavi and 650 Fifth Ave. Co. violated 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.208, which states that no United States person \"may approve, finance, facilitate, or guarantee any transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by this part if performed by a United States person or within the United States.\u201d Because we do not identify any underlying violation of 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 560.208 on the record before us, summary judgment cannot be affirmed on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">. The only corporate records of the 1995 sale were attached as exhibits to (1) a declaration of Shakeri, and (2) a declaration of Claimants' attorney. The first declaration was stricken from the record when Shakeri failed to appear for deposition as ordered by the District Court, <em>see </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 37, and that sanction is not challenged on appeal. As to the second declaration, it is not apparent that Claimants' attorney is competent to authenticate these records. Because the Government did not question authenticity before the District Court, we assume, without deciding, the admissibility of these records at trial. <em>See Porter v. Quarantillo, </em>722 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 2013) (explaining that \"[o]nly admissible evidence need be considered by the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment\u201d); <em>H.

Assa Corporation's 1993 tax return indicates over $44 million in assets and, although the record does not appear to contain Assa's 1994 or 1995 returns, those for 2000 and 2001, similarly indicate assets over $40 million, supporting an inference that Assa\u2019s 1995 assets totaled over $40 million. <em>See </em>App'x 10869-71. Indeed, the conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Assa held a 40% interest in 650 Fifth Ave. Co., whose principal asset, the Building, was valued at $128 million in 1989 and which generated annual rental income of $17 million at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\">. While we agree with the District Court that the record evidence shows that there is no triable issue of fact as to the Government of Iran's continued control of Assa after 1995, we take exception to its suggestion that it could draw adverse inferences at summary judgment based on individuals\u2019 invocation of their Fifth Amendment privilege, <em>see In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *15 n. 28 (stating that court \"may, but need not, draw an adverse inference based on a witness's assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d at summary judgment stage). The District Court also suggested that it could impose Rule 37 sanctions on two of these persons for failing to appear for court-ordered depositions, by \"assuming]\u201d that their testimony would have \u201cfurther supported the Government\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *15. As we have previously held, a court may not draw negative inferences against a nonmov-ing party on a summary judgment motion. <em>See Stichting Ter Behartiging Van de Belangen v. Schreiber, </em>407 F.3d 34, 55 (2d Cir. 2005). We need not pursue the error further in this case, however, because, ultimately, the lack of testimony from those witnesses meant that there was no record evidence to dispute the overwhelming evidence of Bank Melli\u2019s post-1995 control of Assa. <em>See In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b117-12\">. We here refer only to Alavi\u2019s knowledge because, as the 60% owner of 650 Fifth Ave. Co., its knowledge would be imputed to the Partnership. <em>See </em>N.Y. Partnership Law \u00a723 (\u201cNotice to any partner of any matter relating to partnership affairs, and the knowledge of the partner acting in the particular matter, acquired while a partner or then present to his mind, and the knowledge of any other partner who reasonably could and should have communicated it to the acting partner, operate as notice to or knowledge of the partnership, except in the case of a fraud on the partnership committed by or with the consent of that partner.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-13\">Relying on this same principle, the Government argues that, regardless of Alavi\u2019s knowledge, Assa\u2019s knowledge of its true ownership and control can be imputed to 650 Fifth Ave. Co. The District Court, however, did not reach this question, and, in light of Claimants\u2019 argument that Assa\u2019s knowledge cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>imputed to the Partnership because Assa defrauded both the Partnership and Alavi \u2014 a matter that may require further factual devel-opmenl \u2014 we leave it to the District Court to consider this question in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. Because we vacate the District Court\u2019s award of summary judgment on both the IEE-PA and money laundering theories of forfeiture, we need not consider Claimants' challenge to the District Court's determination as to which of their property interests \"constitute[] or [are] derived from proceeds traceable to\u201d an IEEPA violation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(a)(1)(C), or were \"involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of section 1956 ... or ... traceable to such property,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 981(a)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\">. The District Court had repeatedly denied Claimants' attempts to obtain discovery that might show when the Government learned of the Claimants\u2019 alleged forfeitable offenses. <em>See Swatch Grp.

No different conclusion is warranted by <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of University of Georgia, </em>263 F.3d 1234, 1264 (11th Cir. 2001), which the District Court cites in support of its conclusion that the \"Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating no triable issue as to this defense.\u201d <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Summary Judgment Decision, </em>2013 WL 5178677, at *36. In fact, controlling Supreme Court and Second Circuit case law sets forth the principle that a non-moving party must have some evidence permitting a reasonable juror to find in its favor with respect to an affirmative defense. <em>See, e.g., Celotex, 477 </em>U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548; <em>FDIC v. Giammettei, </em>34 F.3d 51, 54-55 (2d Cir. 1994). Moreover, the District Court seems to have relied on <em>Johnson </em>for the proposition that the Claimants were obligated to raise the statute of limitations defense in their opposition papers; that proposition cannot be derived from <em>Johnson. </em>First, <em>Johnson </em>concerned a motion for final summary judgment on all issues, not \u2014 as here \u2014 a motion for partial judgment that did not address the statute of limitations defense and that expressly contemplated further briefing and argument. <em>See Johnson, </em>263 F.3d at 1264. Further, <em>Johnson </em>addressed a nonmov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ant's failure to advance a particular <em>argument </em>in support of an issue on which a party had moved for summary judgment, not a failure to argue a distinct issue \u2014 here, an affirmative defense \u2014 on which the movant had never sought summary judgment. <em>See id. </em>Thus, <em>Johnson </em>is inapposite to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. The District Court also erred in ruling that the Claimants \"waived\u201d their Fourth Amendment right to challenge the reasonableness of the search and seizure by failing to raise an objection to civil discovery requests and comporting with the protective order. <em>In re 650 Fifth Ave. Suppression Decision, </em>970 F.Supp.2d at 212 (\u201cBy failing to so object [to its obligations under the protective order and in civil discovery], Alavi waived any such objection now.\u201d). In raising this waiver argument on appeal, the Government relies on cases in which the failure to object to discovery requests waived any objection to those requests. <em>See, e.g., Richmark Corp. </em>v. <em>Timber Falling Consultants, </em>959 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir. 1992) (concluding that party arguing that Chinese law interfered with its ability to comply with discovery requests waived any such objection where it failed to object within time required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 33 and 34); <em>In re United States, </em>864 F.2d 1153, 1156 (5th Cir. 1989) (explaining that, \"as a general rule, when a party fails to object timely to interrogatories, production request or other discovery efforts, objections <em>thereto </em>are waived\u201d). Yet Claimants do not object to the civil discovery requests, which are wholly separate from the warrant authorizing the challenged search. Rather, Claimants contend that the Government unlawfully seized materials from their office based on a deficient warrant and, thus, should not be permitted to rely on those materials in this case. Claimants raised the possibility of asserting such a challenge in March 2012 \u2014 before complying with their civil discovery obligations in May and July 2012 \u2014 but explained to the District Court at that time that they were waiting for the Government to produce the warrant and supporting materials. <em>See </em>App\u2019x 2636-37. Nor is there any contention that Claimants thereafter failed timely to file their suppression motion: the District Court did not set a deadline for Claimants\u2019 motion to suppress, <em>cf. </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 16, and it was filed prior to the date on which the parties filed their summary judgment motions, and before the then-scheduled trial start date of September 9, 2013, <em>see </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(C), (c)(1) (providing that deadline to file motion to suppress evidence, if not otherwise set by court, is \"start of trial\u201d). In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that Claimants waived their Fourth Amendment challenge.
