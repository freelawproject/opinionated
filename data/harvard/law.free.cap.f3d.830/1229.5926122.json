Instead, she wrote herself $767,218.99 in checks drawn from conser-vatorship accounts belonging to 31 minors, 2 incapacitated adults, and 2 estates. After she was found out, she pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 and the district court sentenced her to 72 months imprisonment. Birge appeals that sentence, contending that the district court erred in applying the vulnerable victim enhancement, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Al.l(b)(l), when it calculated her guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of the vulnerable victim enhancement, but we \u201cgive due deference to the district court\u2019s determination that a victim was vulnerable, as this is a factual finding.\u201d United States v. Kapordelis, 569 F.3d 1291, 1315-16 (11th Cir. 2009). The sentencing guidelines provide that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels if the defendant \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). A vulnerable victim is \u201ca victim of the offense of conviction ... who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2. \u201cThe vulnerability that triggers \u00a7 3A1.1 must be an \u2018unusual\u2019 vulnerability which is present in only some victims of that type of crime.\u201d United States v. Davis, 967 F.2d 516, 524 (11th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">As the chief clerk of a probate court, Birge knew or should have known that in Georgia, conservators are appointed to protect the assets of those who lack the capacity to do so themselves. See O.C.G.A. \u00a7 29-5-l(a) (\u201cThe court may appoint a conservator for an adult only if the court finds the adult lacks sufficient capacity to make or communicate significant responsible decisions concerning the management of his or her property.\u201d); id. \u00a7\u00a7 29-3-8(a)-(b), 29-3-20(b), 29-3-64(a) (providing for the appointment of a conservator for unemaneipated minors). As a result, she knew or should have known that the beneficiaries of conservatorships were \u201cparticularly susceptible to [her] criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-11\">Birge argues that even so, the district court should not have applied the enhancement to her because there is no evidence that she \u201ctargeted\u201d the vulnerable victims. An earlier version of the commentary to \u00a7 3A1.1 provided that the enhancement applied \u201cto offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.1 (1994). Our decisions under that version of the commentary to \u00a7 3A1.1 stated that \u201cthe applicability of section 3A1.1 turns on the defendant\u2019s decision to target the victim.\u201d United States v. Long, 935 F.2d 1207, 1211 (11th Cir. 1991), superseded by regulation on other grounds as stated in United States v. Yount, 960 F.2d 955, 957 (11th Cir. 1992); see also Long, 935 F.2d at 1210 (citing the previous version of the commentary to state that \u201c[s]eetion 3A1.1 is intended to enhance the punishment for offenses where the defendant selects the victim due to the victim\u2019s perceived susceptibility to the offense\u201d); Yount, 960 F.2d at 957 (\u201cThe [then-current] version appears to require that the victim of the offense must have been unusually vulnerable and specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>ically targeted in the offense.\u201d). But see United States v. Salemi, 26 F.3d 1084, 1088 (11th Cir. 1994) (applying the vulnerable victim enhancement because the victim was a six month old baby, even though the district court found that the defendant\u2019s \u201cmental and emotional condition clouded his ability to perceive the baby\u2019s peculiar vulnerability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">In 1995, the Sentencing Commission amended the commentary to \u00a7 3A1.1, removing the sentence, \u201cThis adjustment applies to offenses where an unusually vulnerable victim is made a target of criminal activity by the defendant,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.l (1994) (emphasis added), and replacing it with the sentence: \u201c[The adjustment] applies to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable victim in which the defendant knew or should have known of the victim\u2019s unusual vulnerability,\u201d id. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2 (1995). See id. App. C, Amend. 521 (1995). The Commission explained that it had \u201cnoted some inconsistency in the application of \u00a7 3A1.1 regarding whether this adjustment required proof that the defendant had \u2018targeted the victim on account of the victim\u2019s vulnerability,\u2019 \u201d so it intended the amendment \u201cto clarify application with respect to this issue.\u201d Id. That amended language remains in effect today. See id. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">\u201cCommentary in the Guidelines Manual interpreting or explaining a guideline is binding on the courts unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with or a plainly erroneous interpretation of that guideline.\u201d United States v. Rodriguez, 65 F.3d 932, 933 n.1 (11th Cir. 1995). Despite the amendment to the commentary, statements made in passing in a lot of this Court\u2019s opinions might be taken to imply that the enhancement still applies only when the defendant \u201ctargeted\u201d the vulnerable victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See United States v. Pierre, 825 F.3d 1183, 1194-97, 2016 WL 3254027, at *7-8 (11th Cir. June 14, 2016); United States v. Moran, 778 F.3d 942, 978-79 (11th Cir. 2015); United States v. Bradley, 644 F.3d 1213, 1287-89 (11th Cir. 2011); United States v. Day, 405 F.3d 1293, 1295-96 (11th Cir. 2005); United States v. Phillips, 287 F.3d 1053, 1056-58 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v. Frank, 247 F.3d 1257, 1259-60 (11th Cir. 2001); United States v. Gonzalez, 183 F.3d 1315, 1326-27 (11th Cir. 1999), superseded by regulation on other grounds as stated in United States v. Diaz, 248 F.3d 1065 (11th Cir. 2001); United States v. Rudisill, 187 F.3d 1260, 1268-69 (11th Cir. 1999); United States v. Arguedas, 86 F.3d 1054, 1057-58 (11th Cir. 1996); United States v. Malone, 78 F.3d 518, 520-23 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\"> \u201cUnder our prior precedent rule, a panel cannot overrule a prior one\u2019s holding even though convinced it is wrong.\u201d United States v. Steele, 147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc). But that rule applies only to holdings, not dicta. See McNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1077 (11th Cir. 1996) (\u201c[W]e are not required to follow dicta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>contained in our own precedents.... \u201d). Each of the decisions that we cited above, which are all of the ones we have found on this point, held that the defendant was eligible for the enhancement in circumstances in which the defendant actually did target a vulnerable victim. See Pierre, 825 F.3d at 1196, 2016 WL 3254027, at *8 (\u201cAs the district court found, and the evidence supports, the appellants specifically targeted inmates based on their perceived vulnerability to the tax refund fraud offense.\u201d); Moran, 778 F.3d at 979 (\u201c[T]hese defendants and their co-conspirators targeted the [victims] in order to further the fraudulent activity.\u201d); Bradley, 644 F.3d at 1289 (stating that the defendant targeted the victims because he \u201cexploited] [the victims\u2019] need for medication so he could make a profit\u201d); Day, 405 F.3d at 1296 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that she did not know her co-conspirators were targeting the vulnerable victims because the evidence showed that she had a role in selecting the victims); Phillips, 287 F.3d at 1057-58 (affirming application of the enhancement because the defendant targeted a rural bank at a time when he knew police would not be in the area); Frank, 247 F.3d at 1259-60 (affirming application of the enhancement where the defendant selected the victim of a carjacking because he was a cab driver who was required to respond to a call from the dispatcher); Gonzalez, 183 F.3d at 1327 (concluding that the defendants \u201cselected their victims in furtherance of their conspiracy\u201d because they were \u201ceasy targets because of their presence in the house\u201d that the defendants were invading); Rudisill, 187 F.3d at 1269 (affirming application of the enhancement because the defendant knew that his co-conspirators were targeting elderly victims); Arguedas, 86 F.3d at 1058 (upholding application of the enhancement where the defendant \u201cbefriended and later targeted\u201d the victim and was aware of his \u201cprecarious financial situation\u201d); Malone, 78 F.3d at 522 (holding that use of the enhancement was appropriate because \u201cthe defendants specifically targeted [the victim], knowing that his obligations as a dispatched cab driver made him more vulnerable to carjackings than other drivers of cars\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">None of those decisions held, and none could have held, that a defendant is not eligible for the enhancement unless she targeted a vulnerable victim, because in each one of those cases the defendant did target a \u201cvulnerable victim.\u201d As we have explained time and again: \u201c[A] decision can hold nothing beyond the facts of that case.\u201d Edwards v. Prime, Inc., 602 F.3d 1276, 1298 (11th Cir. 2010) (collecting cases). That means that the language in our earlier decisions about a \u201ctargeting\u201d requirement for the enhancement is dicta. See id. (\u201cA holding that X + Y is enough to violate a provision does not mean that X alone is not enough. And that is true even if we say in the opinion that X alone would not be enough.... All statements that go beyond the facts of the case ... are dicta. And dicta is not binding on anyone for any purpose.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">We are not bound by the dicta contained in our earlier opinions. See McNely, 99 F.3d at 1077. Instead, we are bound by the guidelines and the commentary to the guidelines, which state that the vulnerable victim enhancement applies so long as the defendant \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1); id. \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2 (\u201cSubsection (b) applies to offenses involving an unusually vulnerable victim in which the defendant knows or should have known of the victim\u2019s unusual vulnerability.\u201d); see also Rodriguez, 65 F.3d at 933 n.1. Because Birge knew or should have known that the victims of her scheme were vulnerable, the district court did not err in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>applying the vulnerable victim enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">. We do not address decisions that discussed the vulnerable victim enhancement but not a \"targeting\u201d requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Kapordelis, 569 F.3d 1291, 1315-16 (11th Cir. 2009) (discussing only whether the victims were vulnerable); United States v. Amedeo, 370 F.3d 1305, 1317 (11th Cir. 2004) (same); United States v. Levy, 374 F.3d 1023, 1029 (11th Cir. 2004) (concluding that any challenge to the vulnerable victim enhancement had been waived); United States v. Shenberg, 89 F.3d 1461, 1475-76 (11th Cir. 1996) (holding that the enhancement was properly applied even where the victim was fictitious). Nor do we address opinions that were published after Amendment 521\u2019s effective date, but that reviewed sentences imposed before its effective date. See United States v. Page, 69 F.3d 482, 487-88 (11th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
