The suit was filed on September 27,. 1923, within a year and a day of the alleged disturbance. Of course there is no evidence on the part of defendant to contradict this testimony or to cast, any doubt upon- its truth or correctness: This proof unassailed, is sufficient under Art. 46 et seq. of the Code of| Practice, to maintain plaintiff\u2019s action. If on the other hand there- is no such property as that described in plaintiff\u2019s petition, the defendant is not- injured, for the reason that the judgment cannot be executed and will be mere brutum fulmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">As to the damages, plaintiff says that she had to pay a lawyer thirty-five dollars to file this suit, and that she suffered damages in the sum of fifty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">We know of no law or any precedent in jurisprudence, sanctioning the imposition of attorney\u2019s fees against a defendant in' a possessory action, where the action is not accompanied by the issuance of an anallary injunction. Counsel for plaintiff cites a decision of this court to that -effect. We have no access to that decision, but if applicable here, it should be overruled. As to actual and compensatory damages, we can well conceive that defendant\u2019s acts in cutting wood on the land, posting the premises and erecting a fence thereon may have caused damage to plaintiff in the sum of fifty dollars. While plaintiff\u2019s estimate does not rest upon given details and it may be merely her conclusions from the facts, we do not think it should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">For these reasons, the judgment appealed from should be amended by striking out therefrom the item of damages for attorney\u2019s fees fixed at thirty-five dollars, and that it should otherwise be affirmed at the cost of plaintiff and appellee, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
