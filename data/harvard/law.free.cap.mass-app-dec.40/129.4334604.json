There was a finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $684.00. The case was reported because the defendant claims, to be aggrieved by the admission of evidence over its objections and by the denial of some of its requested rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">It appears that one Graham Parnell requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the plaintiff to do some carpenter work on a dormer which the defendant was to construct on a house in Milford. Parnell told the plaintiff to bill the defendant and that the defendant was to pay the bill. The defendant objected to this conversation. It was admitted <em>de bene. </em>At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved to strike the evidence. Its motion was denied and the defendant\u2019s rights saved.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Before commencing work the plaintiff called the defendant\u2019s office \u201cand was informed by a young lady that the defendant did have a contract to build the dormer. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Being very busy at the time the plaintiff \u201ccontacted the Thornhill &amp; Son Construction Co. to do the carpenter labor for Graham Parnell.\u201d Thornhill did the work between September 18 and September 28, 1966 and submitted a bill for $684.00 to the plaintiff which the plaintiff paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection Thornhill was allowed to testify <em>de bene </em>that \u201cParnell told him that he was superintendent for the Larkin Co., Inc.\u201d At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved to strike Thornhill\u2019s testimony on the ground that there was no evidence that Parnell was in fact superintendent of Larkin Co., Inc. with authority to speak in its behalf. The judge denied the motion and the defendant claimed a report.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">After the work was done the plaintiff\u2019s representative then contacted one Davidi Bailey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the defendant\u2019s president and general manager, about payment. Bailey told him that he had already paid Parnell and was certainly not going to pay anyone else. \u201cThis was the first contact that the plaintiff had with Mr. Bailey.\u201d Bailey denied that Parnell hadi authority to hire anyone in behaJlf of the Larkin Co. He testified that he had a contract to build the dormer in Milford and had subcontracted certain of the labor to Parnell to whom he paid by checks, admitted in evidence, $150.00 on September 9, $150.00 on September 23, and $152.81 on September 29, 1966. He further testified that he had hired Baker Bros., a labor subcontractor, to work on the job. The defendant was paid $3000. for the construction of the dormer.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Parnell was unavailable at the time of trial, both parties having unsuccessfully tried to locate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The judge allowed requested rulings that on the law and the evidence a finding was warranted for the defendant. See <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>315 Mass. 54. <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538, 541-542. He denied the following requested rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u201c1. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant had any business dealings with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">2. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the person or persons that the plaintiff did business with were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>either agents or servants of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">3. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the work done or materials provided by the plaintiff were for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">4. There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the defendant or its representatives ordered any work or materials from the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">His decision states \u201cI find that the plaintiff was hired to furnish carpenter labor to build dormer by one Parnell acting in behalf of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The basic question, the answer to which must control the decision, is whether Parnell could be found, upon any reasonable view of competent evidence, to have been acting as representative or agent of the defendant in procuring services of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">As bearing on the basic question we first consider the evidence admitted over the defendant\u2019s objections. In our opinion it was prejudicial error to have admitted the evidence that Parnell told the plaintiff to bill the defendant and that the defendant would pay the bill. It was also prejudicial error to have admitted the evidence that Parnell told Mr. Thornhill that he was superintendent for The Larkin Co., Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">The statement of a person that he is the agent of another is inadmissible to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>extent and nature of Ms authority. Parnell\u2019s statement to the plaintiff and to Thornhill were merely statements of Ms conclusions with reference to his representative capacity so far as the defendant was concerned. They were not statements of fact. The evidence would not have been admissible even if Parnell had been a witness and had undertaken to so testify. <em>Eastern Paper &amp; Box Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Herz </em>Mfg. <em>Corp., </em>323 Mass. 138, 144. <em>McNicholas </em>v. <em>N.E. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>196 Mass. 138, 142-143. <em>Beaucage </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>206 Mass. 492, 500. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry W. Barry Co., </em>256 Mass. 491. <em>Friend Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Armstrong Bldg. Fin. Co., 276 </em>Mass. 361, 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">With the exclusion of Parnell\u2019s statements nothing remains which would warrant the finding that Parnell was the defendant\u2019s representative with authority to act or speak in its behalf. The call to the defendant\u2019s office by the plaintiff\u2019s representative before commencing work elicited only the information that the defendant in fact had a contract to build the dormer. It proved nothing so far as Parnell\u2019s relationship to the defendant was concerned. The remaining evidence becomes inconsequential. It would warrant a finding that Parnell had a contract with the defendant to do work for which he was paid and that Parnell Mred, but did not pay the plaintiff. It has no bearing upon Ms alleged agency. Neither does the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>maining evidence support a finding of apparent or ostensible authority of Parnell to speak or act for the defendant. \u201cThe apparent scope of an agent\u2019s authority is limited, \u2014 , to that which falls within the general Class of acts done by him over a considierable period of time.\u201d <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Ornsteen, </em>311 Mass. 477, 482. Nor was such apparent authority created by any acts or words of those responsible for the conduct of the defendant\u2019s business which could reasonably be interpreted\" to cause a third person, such as the plaintiff, to believe that the defendant consented to have Parnel employ the plaintiff in its behalf. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Simplex Time Recorder Co., </em>316 Mass. 217, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">There is no competent evidence to show, nor from which it might reasonably be inferred, that the plaintiff and the defendant had any contracturai arrangement with each other, directly or by agency. <em>Farquhar </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>132 Mass. 340, 342. <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>19 Mass. App. Dec. 186. Accordingly, rulings numbers, 1, 2, 3 and 4 which the defendant requested should have been given. Their denial was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The finding for the plaintiff should be reversed and judgment ordered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
