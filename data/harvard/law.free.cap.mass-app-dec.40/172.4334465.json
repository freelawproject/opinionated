The only evidence as to the value of the damaged items before and after the spillage was given by the plaintiff\u2019s president-treasurer, one Harold Maloomian, who also testified that $65.00 was paid by the plaintiff to clean up the debris resulting from the spillage. There was no objection to the admission of this evidence when offered, but at the close of Mr. Maloomian\u2019s testimony, the defendant moved that the said evidence as to value and as to the cost of cleaning up be stricken. The court denied the motion and found for the plaintiff in the amount of $669.25.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">The case comes here on a report by the trial justice of his denial of the defendant\u2019s aforesaid motion to strike, his denial of requests for rulings numbered 7, 8, 9, 12 and 13 and his action in granting request numbered 10, but finding \u201cthe [D]efendant\u2019s negligence [to be] the proximate cause of the [P]laintiff\u2019s damage\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\">We turn first to the question of the propriety of the denial of the motion to strike., It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>appears that the evidence sought to be excluded was admitted without objection. It therefore was competent for all purposes including its use as evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein, <em>Regan </em>v. <em>John J. Amara &amp; Sons Co., </em>348 Mass. 734, 737, and entitled to its \u201cnatural probative force\u201d. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>1968 A.S. pp. 599, 600. See <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Liacos, </em>Handbook of Massachusetts Evidence (4th Ed.) 69. Objections to such evidence, once admitted, \u201ccannot as of right be insisted upon by means of motion's to strike out\u201d. <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Dabrowski, </em>295 Mass. 358, 360; <em>Leonardi </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>351 Mass. 697 and cases cited at page 706. The denial of the motion presented no question of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The trial justice expressly found that Mr. Maloomian was qualified to testify to the value of the damaged property. Such a finding is not to be reversed unless there was no evidence to warrant it. <em>Arena </em>v. <em>John P. Squire Co., </em>321 Mass. 423, 425. The evidence amply supported this finding. He was the president and treasurer of the plaintiff which owned the property and was personally familiar with it. (See <em>Winthrop Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Elroth Co., Inc., </em>331 Mass. 83, 85). The defendant attempts to make a point of the fact that Mr. Maloomian\u2019s opinion of the value of the property, in its damaged condition, was based on observations made three days after the damage occurred. The trial justice however, expressly found that the value thus given \u201cwas the value in [the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>ness\u2019] opinion immediately following the damage\u201d. There was no error in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Turning now to the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, the disposition of which aggrieved him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Bequests numbered 7, 8 and 9 seek rulings which if allowed would deny any probative force to the testimony of Mr. Maloomian, referred to above, as to the value of the damaged property and the cost of cleaning up the premises. As we have already stated, in upholding the denial of defendant\u2019s motion to strike such testimony, it is entitled to its full weight. The result is the same when the attack is made by requests for rulings, <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Dabrowski, </em>supra, page 360. The trial justice did not err in denying these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Request No. 10 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-8\">\u201cThe (D)efendant is not liable for damage which was not the probable, natural and direct consequence of his negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXS\">The trial justice granted this request \u201cas a statement of law\u201d, but he found \u201cthat the [Defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of the [P]laintiff\u2019s damage.\u201d To this finding, the defendant took exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">A finding of fact, however, is not subject to review by this Division unless the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant it is brought into question by a request for ruling. <em>Stella </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>348 Mass. 458, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Request No. 12 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXo\">\u201cThere is no evidence from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>amount of damage caused by the [Plaintiff\u2019s wrongful failure to use reasonable effort to minimize the damage, could be found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b183-10\">Glenn M. Shriberg for plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A1y\">Jacob Geisinger for defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The trial justice denied the request, finding specially that \u201cthe [P]laintiff made sales of the damaged goods and had the cellar cleaned within a reasonable time.\u201d By his finding the trial justice made it clear that the assumption in the request of a wrongful failure by the plaintiff to minimize the damages was not found by him to be the fact. The request was properly denied. <em>Liberatore </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>315 Mass. 538, 543, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Request No. 13 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cThe [P]laintiff has not sustained the burden of proof in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">This in effect requested the court to rule that the evidence did not warrant a finding for the plaintiff. The evidence is ample to support the general finding for the plaintiff and by implication the subsidiary findings essential thereto of negligence on the defendant\u2019s part and resulting damage to plaintiff\u2019s property. <em>M. DiMatteo Construction Company </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 568, 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">We find no error in the rulings complained of; and the report is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\"> The report doesn\u2019t disclose the circumstances prompting these acts on the part of the defendant other than as being purely voluntary on his part.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
