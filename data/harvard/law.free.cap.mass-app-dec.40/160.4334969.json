The ad damnum of the writ is $300. The alleged trustee was served with process on December 4, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The trustee filed its answer under oath asserting at the time of the service of the writ upon it, its books disclosed a sum of $217.54 owing to one E. D. Kaulback &amp; Son.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Thereafter, on December 26, 1967, the defendant, Albert W. Woodard, d/b/a E. D. Kaulback &amp; Son, failed to make an installment payment on a promissory note dated July 21, 1967, payable to the trustee, Malden Trust Company. Under the terms of the note, the entire balance of the principal then owing became due and payable. At that time the trustee applied the amount previously attached against the principal owing on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">On January 5, 1968, the trustee filed a motion to amend its answer. The amended answer asserted that as of this date the trustee had no goods, effects or credits of the principal defendant. On the same day the defendant was defaulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">On January 9, 1968, the plaintiff filed a motion to charge the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Thereafter, on January 12, 1968, both the trustee\u2019s motion to amend its answer and the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge trustee were heard by the court and taken under advisement. The court denied the trustee\u2019s motion to amend its answer and allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend its answer and allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">The trustee claiming to be aggrieved by the rulings of the trial judge requested the trial judge to report the case to this Division for determination.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b169-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Henry Lewin for plaintiff</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Aso\">Spencer &amp; Stone for Defendant</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">There was no error in denying the trustee\u2019s motion to amend its answer. \u201cThe allowance of an amendment was, of course, within the discretion of the judge. In an action of law an exercise of discretion can be revised only when the matter \u2018is so clear that discretion is superseded by imperative legal duty\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">No imperative legal duty existed to require the allowance of the amendment in this case. <em>Charity </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>354 Mass. 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The answer of the trustee asserted that at the time of the service of the writ, its books disclosed funds owing to the defendant. The answer was under oath and must be considered as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The trustee was clearly chargeable. There was no error in the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to charge the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">G.L. c. 246, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">It is unnecessary in view of the above to discuss the right of set-off claimed by the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">There being no error, the report is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
