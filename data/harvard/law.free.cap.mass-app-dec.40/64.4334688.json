From these it would appear that the defendant executed a note in favor of the plaintiff in the amount of $1,512.00 and for security gave a chattel mortgage on an automobile. On November 29,1965 the plaintiff repossessed the car and sold same at auction on December 30,1965. The net amount realized at the sale was $787.00. It was admitted by the treasurer of the plaintiff company that no notice was sent to the defendant of the time or place of the sale. There was a finding for the defendant and the plaintiff brings this report.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">There was no error. G.L.c. 106, \u00a7 9, 504(3) provides in part with respect to the disposition of collateral after default.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cUnless the collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market, reasonable notification of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made shall be sent by the secured party to the debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">This particular statutory provision was passed with a view to protecting the interest of the borrower. The court has expressly found that the collateral, a 1963 Ford, was not perishable or one which \u201cthreatens to decline speedily in value\u201d or is a type \u201ccustomarily sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>on a recognized market.\u201d In the known circumstances the provisions of the statute must be followed. They were not in the cause under review. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Capen, </em>7 Met. 287, <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Keough, </em>7 Cush. 536, 537, <em>Mogul </em>v. <em>Boston Acceptance Co., </em>328 Mass. 424, <em>Clark </em>v. <em>A &amp; T Transp.
