J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AWP\">This is an action of contract transferred under the provisions of G.L. c. 231 \u00a7 102C to the District Court for trial. The plaintiff\u2019s administratrix (plaintiff) seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>recover for personal services alleged to have been rendered by him to the defendant\u2019s testator (defendant). The defendant denied the allegations, pleaded the statute of limitations and declared in set-off alleging that the plaintiff owed the defendant Twenty-nine hundred ($2900.) dollars for money loaned. After a trial there was a finding for the defendant and also a finding for him on his declaration in set-off. The plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by the denial of several of his requests for rulings of law claimed a report. This report was dismissed by order of the trial judge because it was not double spaced as required by <em>Rule 31 of the Rules of the District Courts (1965). </em>From this order of dismissal the plaintiff claimed the report now before us. The only issue presented is the propriety of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Rule 31 of the Rules of the District Courts (1965) in its applicable part reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">\u201cThe draft report and all papers intended for use before the Appellate Division shall. . .be printed or typewritten upon opaque paper. . .The typewriting or printing including all quotations shall <em>be double-spaced____\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We observed in part in <em>Allston Supply Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Interstate Plumbing and Heating Supply Corp., </em>25 Mass. App. Dec. 139 at 140-141.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzbH\">\u201cAll rules of court, duly made, 'have the force of law, and are binding upon the court and the parties, and cannot be waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>or ignored. Such rules are to be respected and enforced. <em>Flynn, Pet., </em>265 Mass. 310, 313.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b172-6\">Benjamin Apkin, of North Adams for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b172-8\">Joan Keyes Scott, of Williamstown for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-5\">\u201cProvisions of statutes and rules of court regulating procedure are construed strictly, <em>Famigletti </em>v. <em>Neviackas, </em>324 Mass. 70, 72 and failure to comply is fatal to the right to prosecute an appeal. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>William C. Barry, Inc., </em>295 Mass. 94, 97.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUl\">The report is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
