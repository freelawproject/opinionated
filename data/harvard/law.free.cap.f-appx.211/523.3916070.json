The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> found Gammon failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), did not produce evidence of harassment so severe as to alter his employment conditions, and offered no evidence of retaliation for filing discrimination charges. After a de novo review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">Gammon claims Flowers and Burks, who are white, denied him promotions, transfers, training, and equal pay because he is an African American. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>contends he produced both direct and indirect evidence of race discrimination. He claims race was a factor in the AHP denying him promotions to First Lieutenant and Second Lieutenant positions. While he rated as well or better than other candidates in a number of areas considered by the AHP in deciding promotions (e.g., educational level, years of experience, and certificates awarded), Gammon admits the successful white candidates scored higher than he did on an objective evaluation of job knowledge (which accounted for 40% of the promotional consideration) and, as a result, he was not the top-rated candidate for either position. During Gammon\u2019s interview for the First Lieutenant position, Burks told him his haircut was unprofessional and he was too old for the haircut, and asked, \u201cWhat happened to your hair? Why did you cut all of your hair off?\u201d Gammon testified these remarks were racist. In addition, the successful candidate for the First Lieutenant position had previously gone hunting with Flowers. Neither the hair comments nor hunting incident show a strong causal link \u201cbetween the alleged discriminatory animus and the challenged decision\u201d and thus do not constitute direct evidence of racial discrimination. <em>Griffith v. City of Des Moines, </em>387 F.3d 733, 736 (8th Cir.2004). Moreover, Gammon did not meet his burden to produce \u201c \u2018specific, tangible evidence\u2019 that employees who were \u2018similarly situated in all respects\u2019 to him received different treatment.\u201d <em>Philip v. Ford Motor Co., </em>413 F.3d 766, 768 (8th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Gammon also failed to establish a prima facie case of race discrimination as to the transfer, training, and pay issues. He offered no evidence AHP denied him transfer, training, or educational upgrade opportunities as he alleged. Further, while Gammon\u2019s proffered evidence shows a number of white sergeants earn more per year than Gammon, some white sergeants earn the same or lesser amounts. Gammon provided no basis for distinguishing among a variety of factors that might explain the pay differences such as step placement or merit pay. While he alleges unit patrol officers receive higher pay than weigh station officers, he admits he has never requested to be assigned to a patrol unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The district court also properly dismissed Gammon\u2019s hostile work environment and retaliation claims. The sole evidentiary basis for the hostile work environment claim is an incident in which a lieutenant called a patrolman a \u201cnigger\u201d and referred to all other African American AHP employees using the same word. \u201c[R] acial slurs alone do not render a work environment hostile as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Singletary v. Mo. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>423 F.3d 886, 893 (8th Cir.2005). Finally, while Gammon alleged the AHP retaliated against him because he filed discrimination charges with the EEOC, he presented no evidence to support any causal connection between his charges and any adverse employment action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-13\">. The Honorable Susan Webber Wright, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. To the extent the issue is before us, we also affirm the district court\u2019s adverse grant of summary judgment on Gammon\u2019s disparate impact claim because Gammon did not present evidence of statistical disparities sufficiently substantial to raise an inference of causation between an identifiable, facially neutral personnel policy or practice and a disparate effect on African American AHP employees. <em>See Watson v.
