Win-gate pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). The district court originally sentenced Wingate to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, based upon its mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines, and its enhancement of Wingate\u2019s base offense level based upon facts found by a preponderance of the evidence by the court and not charged in the indictment or admitted by Wingate, in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which case was decided after the original sentencing, but before Wingate\u2019s appeal. We affirmed Wingate\u2019s conviction but vacated his sentence. On remand, the district court sentenced Win-gate to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, below the applicable mandatory statutory minimum sentence. The Government appeals, contending as its sole assertion of error that the district court erred in sentencing Wingate below the twenty-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">The decision in <em>Booker </em>did not change the rule that, absent motion by the Government on the basis of substantial assistance, judges are not at liberty to depart below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence, and a mandatory statutory limitation must be implemented where applicable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 288, 163 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). In finding that the district court correctly determined Wingate\u2019s base offense level, and directing the district court to resentence Wingate in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we did not intend for the district court to disregard applicable statutory law, including the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence applicable to Wingate\u2019s conviction. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.1 (2004). Accordingly, we vacate Wingate\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\"> <em>See United States v.
