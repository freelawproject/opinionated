Upon Querubin\u2019s timely appeal, we affirmed his conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Querubin, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 233 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). On remand, the district court resentenced Querub\u00edn to 252 months\u2019 imprisonment. Querub\u00edn again appeals. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-21\">On appeal, Querub\u00edn repeats several arguments previously made in his first appeal of the original judgment and order of the district court. However, this court has previously considered and rejected these arguments on appeal. Therefore, these claims are precluded by the mandate rule, which \u201cforecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court,\u201d as well as \u201cissues decided by the district court but foregone on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>(4th Cir.1993). A trial court may reopen an issue on remand only if (1) there has been a dramatic change in the controlling legal authority, (2) significant new evidence has been discovered, or (3) a blatant error has occurred that will result in serious injustice if not corrected. <em>Id. </em>at 67. Because Querub\u00edn has not shown that any of the exceptions to the mandate rule apply, the district court did not err in refusing to consider these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Querub\u00edn also asserts that the district court erred because his sentence was supported by facts not based upon prior convictions, not found by the jury, and not admitted by Querub\u00edn himself. In a post-Booker sentencing, the district court must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">After <em>Booker, </em>the sentencing court is authorized to make factual findings in order to appropriately determine the defendant\u2019s advisory range under the guidelines, as the district court did in the present case. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). Therefore, because the district court sentenced Querubin under an advisory guideline scheme, no Sixth Amendment error occurred. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (in <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing, district court should make all factual findings appropriate to determination of advisory guideline range). Moreover, the district court properly calculated and explicitly considered the guidelines range as well as the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a), and we thus find the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Querub\u00edn also contends that the district court did not follow this court\u2019s mandate in resentencing because it did not follow the sentencing ranges referenced in this court\u2019s opinion. However, this court only referenced specific offense levels in the context of describing the <em>Booker </em>error. This court stated in its original opinion that \u201c[o]n remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all the factual findings appropriate for that determination.\u201d Quer<em>ubin, </em>150 Fed.Appx. at 236. The district court fully complied with and followed this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Querubin\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
