On appeal, Pearson challenges only the denial of relief with respect to his claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213 (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order on the ground that Pearson failed to state a claim under the ADA.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Pearson v. Cushwa, </em>No. CA-03-1603-RDB (D.Md. Dec. 20, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b183-15\"> The district court dismissed Pearson\u2019s ADA claim based on Eleventh Amendment immunity and did not reach the merits of the claim. However, in <em>Constantine v. Rectors &amp; Visitors of George Mason Univ., </em>411 F.3d 474 (4th Cir.2005), this court ruled that Congress effectively and intentionally abrogated the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit under Title II of the ADA. Thus, the Eleventh Amendment did not bar Pearson from bringing suit against Maryland prison officials. Nevertheless, because Pearson did not state a claim under the ADA, summary judgment for the Defendants was proper. We offer no criticism of the district judge, who resolved this issue without the benefit of our decision in <em>Constantine.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
