In criminal cases, a defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that \u00a7 3582 proceeding is criminal in nature and ten-day appeal period applies and collecting cases adopting rule). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of up to thirty days to file a notice of appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985). These time periods are mandatory and jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The district court entered its order denying the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on May 8, 2006. The ten-day appeal period expired on May 22, 2006. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2). Stotts filed his notice of appeal, at the earliest, on June 23, 2006 \u2014 outside both the ten-day appeal period and the thirty-day excusable neglect period, which expired on June 21, 2006. Therefore, Stotts\u2019 notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
