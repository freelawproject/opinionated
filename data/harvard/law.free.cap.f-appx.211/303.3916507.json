Because the Commissioner\u2019s decision is in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Miller filed applications for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits in 2000, alleging pain in her neck, shoulders, and left hip; carpal tunnel syndrome; major depression; panic disorder; and anxiety. The Commissioner denied her applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">A hearing was held before an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) at which Miller, her husband, a medical expert witness, and a vocational expert witness testified. The ALJ reviewed the Commissioner\u2019s decision and determined Miller was not disabled, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">As part of his determination, the ALJ gave little weight to the opinion of Miller\u2019s treating physician, Charles Marable, that Miller was disabled and could not work. The ALJ stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">In reaching my conclusions, I have considered the opinions of Ms. Miller\u2019s treating physicians, including Dr. Marable, that the claimant is disabled. I am familiar with Dr. Marable in particular, and I know him to be a constant advocate for his patients. Accordingly, I therefore carefully examine his opinions and the remaining evidence in each case. While I decide each case based on the evidence before me, I am mindful that I need to look closely at any opinion rendered by Dr. Marable. In this case, I did not find his opinions convincing or supported, to the degree he has found that the claimant is unable to engage in any work activity. Hence, I gave his opinions little weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny social security benefits only to determine whether the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the proper legal standards were used to evaluate the evidence. <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 498 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). Miller argues the ALJ erred by according little weight to Marable\u2019s opinion, claiming it should have been given great weight because it was supported by substantial evidence. Additionally, she urges that the ALJ erred by using information outside the record in determining the weight to accord Marable\u2019s opinion. Miller does not contend that substantial evidence does not support the Commissioner\u2019s decision, so we review the decision to determine whether it is in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">The ALJ did not err by according little weight to Marable\u2019s opinion; the ALJ\u2019s decision was in accordance with law. Miller is correct that treating physician\u2019s opinions should be given great weight. <em>Martinez v. Chater, </em>64 F.3d 172, 176 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994)). Also, \u201c[a] treating physician\u2019s opinion on the nature and severity of a patient\u2019s impairment will be given controlling weight if it is \u2018well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>is not inconsistent with other substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We have distinguished, however, between the weight given to a treating physician\u2019s medical opinion on the nature and severity of an impairment and his opinion on whether the patient is disabled and cannot work. We do not require that an ALJ justify a decision to give little weight to a physician\u2019s opinion that a patient is disabled or unable to work, because such decisions are reserved for the Commissioner. <em>Frank v. Barnhart, </em>326 F.3d 618, 620 (5th Cir.2003). An ALJ need not give special weight to treating physicians\u2019 opinions if they have no special significance. \u201cAmong the opinions by treating doctors that have no special significance are determinations that an applicant is \u2018disabled\u2019 or \u2018unable to work.\u2019 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(e)(1). These determinations are legal conclusions that the regulation describes as \u2018reserved to the Commissioner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The ALJ gave little weight to Marable\u2019s opinions that Miller was disabled and unable to work \u2014 the two opinions that <em>Frank </em>states have no special significance and need not be given any weight. The ALJ specifically explained that he gave little weight to Marable\u2019s opinion \u201cthat the claimant is disabled\u201d and that \u201cthe claimant is unable to engage in any work activity.\u201d Because <em>Frank </em>makes plain that an ALJ need not give special weight to conclusions about disability or ability to work, the ALJ did not err. Even if Marable\u2019s opinions were supported by substantial evidence, as Miller stresses, the ALJ was not required to give them special weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Miller\u2019s argument that she was prejudiced because the ALJ looked to evidence outside the record to reject Marable\u2019s opinion on disability also fails. Even if the ALJ considered an extrajudicial source, the consideration did not result in a decision on the merits on that basis, because the ALJ was not required to give Marable\u2019s opinion about Miller\u2019s disability any special weight and because disability is an issue reserved for the Commissioner to decide.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether Miller was disabled was never Marable\u2019s question to answer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should , not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\">. <em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966) (\"The alleged bias and prejudice to be disqualifying must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\">. Miller cites <em>Oshkeshequoam v. Barnhart, </em>274 F.Supp.2d 985, 999 (C.D.Ill.2003), to support her contention that she was improperly prejudiced as a result of the ALJ's bias. That court, however, did not hold that an ALJ\u2019s bias improperly prejudices an applicant. The court rejected the ALJ\u2019s finding that a treating physician was biased \u2014 it did not even involve an ALJ\u2019s being biased. <em>See id. </em>(\"ALJ Welsch reiterates ALJ Lipe\u2019s statement that Dr. Mack should not be found to be credible because he 'tries to give his patients a break.\u2019 However, there is no evidence in the record that Dr. Mack is biased in favor of Plaintiff, other than the fact that Dr. Mack has concluded upon his extensive, long-care treatment of Plaintiff that she is disabled.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
