McBride filed this \u00a7 1983 action alleging several violations of the U.S. Constitution stemming from his criminal conviction by a jury of only five members and seeking damages therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Heck v. Humphrey </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-20\">In order to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-21\">512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). If this type of \u00a7 1983 action is brought before the challenged conviction or sentence is invalidated, it must be dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Thus, \u201cthe district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the conviction or sentence has already-been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">In this case, all of McBride\u2019s claims stem from the central allegation that his criminal trial was unconstitutional because there were only five members of the jury panel instead of six. In order to rule in favor of McBride on his \u00a7 1983 claims, therefore, we must determine that his trial was unconstitutional. Because this determination would necessarily render his conviction and sentence invalid, and because McBride has not proven that his conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, the complaint must be dismissed pursuant to <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
