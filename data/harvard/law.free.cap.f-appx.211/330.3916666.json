Medina argues that the immigration proceedings should be reopened because he had reasonable cause for failing to appear at the immigration hearing. He also argues that the BIA abused its discretion by dismissing as untimely his motion to reopen his immigration proceedings based upon his eligibility for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Medina\u2019s factual argument that he did not receive notice of the hearing is belied by the record. Rather than directly address the BIA\u2019s determination that the hearing notice that was served on his attorney was effective as to Medina pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 292.5, Medina argues that he failed to appear due to counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. However, Medina admittedly failed to follow the procedural requirements necessary to use counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness as a basis for reopening. <em>See Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000) <em>(citing Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637, 639 (BIA 1988)). He thus cannot successfully rely on his counsel\u2019s actions to support his assertion that his counsel\u2019s performance constitutes reasonable cause for his failure to attend the hearing. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, Medina has failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for his absence at the immigration hearing. <em>Williams-Igwonobe v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 453, 455 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Similarly, Medina\u2019s argument that his motion should not be considered time-barred is premised on his counsel\u2019s performance. As discussed above, Medina admittedly failed to follow the procedural requirements necessary to use counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness as a basis for reopening. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496. He therefore cannot rely on counsel\u2019s purported ineffectiveness to circumvent the time-bar. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). To the extent that Medina is arguing that equitable tolling</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">should apply to his case, even if the doctrine of equitable tolling applied in this instance, Medina\u2019s conclusional, unsupported arguments do not indicate that Medina\u2019s case is the rare and exceptional case that warrants equitable tolling. <em>See, e.g., Fierro v. Cockrell, </em>294 F.3d 674, 682 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Medina\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496. Medina\u2019s petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
