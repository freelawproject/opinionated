We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The district court dismissed Hamar\u2019s failure-to-accommodate claim, ruling that Hamar had not exhausted his administrative remedies before the EEOC with respect to that claim. We agree. Hamar, represented by counsel, filed the following charge with the EEOC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">PERSONAL HARM:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">On August 29, 2003 I was discharged RESPONDENT\u2019S REASON FOR ADVERSE ACTION:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">No reason given</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">I believe that I have been discriminated against in that I have been perceived as having a disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">He argues that from this charge, which asserts only a disparate treatment claim, an investigation into Ashland\u2019s failure to accommodate his disability could reasonably have been expected to grow.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the scope of Hamar\u2019s administrative charge is too narrow to have exhausted a claim for failure to accommodate. The two relevant claims, failure to accommodate<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and disparate treatment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> represent distinct categories of disability discrimination under the ADA. The EEOC could not reasonably have been expected, when presented with a claim alleging disparate treatment arising on August 29, 2003, to investigate the entirely distinct failure-to-accommodate claim arising from January 2003 through June of 2003. The three <em>circuits </em>that have considered this very same question agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-17\">Moreover, although Hamar complained only of wrongful termination in his EEOC charge, he asserted only failure-to-accommodate in his federal complaint. Yet on appeal Hamar argues that his complaint actually did assert a wrongful-termination claim, but that the district court\u2019s ruling ignored it. Ashland responds that it was never put on notice of such a claim and that Hamar raises this issue for the first time on appeal. We hold that even if such a claim is present, Hamar has submitted no evidence, and indeed could have submitted no evidence, in support of it. This is because Ashland discharged everyone, not just Hamar. <em>See McCann v. Texas City Refining, Inc., </em>984 F.2d 667, 674 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t cannot be said that TCR discharged McCann because of her age; TCR sold the refinery and discharged everyone.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Finally, the district court dismissed Hamar\u2019s failure-to-hire claim against Air Products, ruling that the company was not a successor employer to Ashland. On appeal, Hamar argues that the district court misunderstood his theory, and he now argues that his theory of liability rested on common-law agency principles.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Charitably construed, his argument is that once the Ashland Managers were notified by Air Products that they would keep their jobs, they became agents of Air Products, and that their efforts to undermine Ha-mar\u2019s return to work effected a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>hire violation. Without commenting on viability of such a theory, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal. The burden of proving an agency relationship is on the party asserting it,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Hamar points to no evidence which tends to establish this agency relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
