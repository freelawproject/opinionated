We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Johnson v. Kilgore, </em>No. 7:05-ev-00728-JLK, 2006 WL 42281 (W.D.Va. Jan. 6 and Feb. 7, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"A6k\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
