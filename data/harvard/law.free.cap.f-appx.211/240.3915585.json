The district court dismissed those claims as frivolous. Taylor also alleged that he was unconstitutionally deprived of his personal photographs. The district court dismissed this claim because Taylor had an adequate state postdeprivation remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">To demonstrate an Eighth Amendment violation, a prisoner must show that he was deprived of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities or some basic human need. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). He must also show that prison officials knew of and disregarded \u201can excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. \u201cPrisoners have a right to protection from extreme cold.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 353 (5th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Taylor has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claim of excessive heat exposure as frivolous. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 581 (5th Cir.1995). Nor has Taylor shown an abuse of discretion with respect to the dismissal of his claim regarding the water temperatures in the shower. He acknowledged at a Spears<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> hearing that prison officials were working to resolve that problem. We do not consider Taylor\u2019s argument, raised for the first time in this court, that he was forced to move into a cell that had human feces on the door and toilet. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Taylor\u2019s claim regarding the deprivation of his medically necessary snacks was not an abuse of discretion; Taylor\u2019s allegations in the district court indicated that prison officials tried to get the snacks to Taylor. <em>See Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507. Finally, the district court did not err in dismissing Taylor\u2019s claim relating to the loss of his photographs on the basis that Taylor has an adequate state postdeprivation remedy. <em>See Thompson v. Steele, </em>709 F.2d 381, 383 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We turn now to Taylor\u2019s remaining allegations. Taking Taylor\u2019s allegations as true, he was arguably subjected to extreme cold without adequate protection and prison officials were indifferent to his health and safety in this regard. <em>See Beck v. Lynaugh, </em>842 F.2d 759, 760-61 (5th Cir.1988). The district court thus erred in dismissing this claim as frivolous. <em>See Berry, </em>192 F.3d at 507. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Taylor\u2019s claim regarding exposure to extreme cold and wet conditions is vacated. This case is remanded for further proceedings on that issue. The district court should also address Taylor\u2019s claim regarding unsanitary shower conditions due to poor drainage. The judgment of the district court is, in all other respects, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
