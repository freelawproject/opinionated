On appeal, we granted the parties\u2019 joint motion for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On remand, Kirkpatrick objected to his sentence enhancements under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2A3.4(b)(3), 4B1.5 (b)(1) (2003), because they were determined by the district court by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court overruled the objections and again sentenced Kirkpatrick to seventy-one months in prison and three years of supervised release. On appeal, Kirkpatrick\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in determining Kirkpatrick\u2019s advisory guideline range. Kirkpatrick was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">We will affirm a sentence imposed by the district court as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). A sentence may be unreasonable for both substantive and procedural reasons. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). A sentence within a properly calculated advisory guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). This presumption can only be rebutted by showing the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439). In considering whether the sentence is unreasonable, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-20\">We have reviewed the record and conclude Kirkpatrick\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court properly found his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>advisory guideline range using facts found by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005). Both the two-level supervisory control enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.4(b)(3) and the five-level increase for repeat and dangerous sex offender against minors under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.5(b)(l) were properly applied in this case. Because Kirkpatrick\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. The district court considered the range, the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and the parties\u2019 potentially meritorious arguments and reasonably concluded a sentence at the high end of the range was appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
