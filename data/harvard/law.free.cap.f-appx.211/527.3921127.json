At sentencing, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>applied a four-level leader/organizer enhancement and increased the presentence report\u2019s recommended criminal history category, which resulted in a Guidelines imprisonment range of 360 months to life. The court then granted the government\u2019s substantial-assistance motions and \u2014 finding Stockwell eligible for a much greater departure than the 15% the government had requested \u2014 sentenced him to 190 months in prison (with an additional departure of 16 months for time served on a state-court conviction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.23) and 10 years of supervised release. Stockwell\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the role enhancement was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in applying the four-level role enhancement in this case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (enhancement is warranted if defendant was \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive\u201d); <em>United States v. Mickle, </em>464 F.3d 804, 807-08 (8th Cir.2006) (district court\u2019s finding regarding role in offense is reviewed for clear error); <em>United States v. Lashley, </em>251 F.3d 706, 712 (8th Cir.2001) (this court broadly interprets terms \u201corganizer\u201d and \u201cleader\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3B 1.1(a)). According to the undisputed sentencing-hearing testimony of four of Stock-well\u2019s co-conspirators, there were at least five people involved in the conspiracy. One co-conspirator, Wesley Erb, testified that Stockwell was the leader in their relationship and that he made the rules and the plans with respect to manufacturing the methamphetamine. Specifically, Stockwell determined when a \u201ccook\u201d was to occur, what ingredients they needed to obtain and where they would get them, and which ingredients Erb needed to procure for Stockwell. Stockwell also paid Erb in methamphetamine, the amount of which Stockwell determined, and Erb sold drugs for Stockwell. Other co-conspirators also gave testimony reflecting Stock-well\u2019s organization of and centrality to the conspiracy. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment. (n. 4) (factors to consider in determining whether defendant was leader or organizer); <em>United States v. Morin, </em>437 F.3d 777, 781 (8th Cir.2006) (for enhancement to apply, at least five people must have been involved in operation, but only one person involved needs to have been under defendant\u2019s direction); <em>see also United States v. Carpenter, </em>422 F.3d 738, 748 (8th Cir.2005) (defendant who did not directly control other conspirators may still receive leader/organizer enhancement; upholding \u00a7 3B 1.1(a) enhancement where evidence showed defendant directed \u201ccooks\u201d and directed others to get precursors or bury sludge in backyard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1115, 163 L.Ed.2d 923 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-16\">.
