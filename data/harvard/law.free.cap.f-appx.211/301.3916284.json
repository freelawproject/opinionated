Sublet claims that the district court committed plain error by failing, sua sponte, to suppress evidence discovered during a search of his apartment that was allegedly conducted in violation of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s knock-and-announce rule. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3109; <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006) (discussing the knock-and-announce requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">With respect to his guilty-plea convictions, Sublet has waived all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings before the district court by entering a valid, unconditional guilty plea. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>179 F.3d 184, 186 (5th Cir.1999). That waiver includes the right to appeal any Fourth Amendment claims. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>733 F.2d 371, 376 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1984). With respect to his bench-trial conviction, Sublet filed two motions to suppress in the district court, but neither motion raised any claim regarding the officers\u2019 failure to comply with the knock-and-announce procedure. <em>See </em>R. 2, 72-80; 184-92. Therefore, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. De Jesus-Batres, </em>410 F.3d 154, 158 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1022, 163 L.Ed.2d 865 (2006). Sublet has not shown that the officers violated the knock-and-announce rule or that the district court\u2019s failure to suppress the evidence obtained from the subsequent search sua sponte constituted clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir.2003); <em>U.S. v. </em>Gracia-<em>Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-17\">Sublet also claims that his attorney rendered ineffective assistance in failing to seek suppression of the evidence pursuant to the knock-and-announce rule. Generally, this court declines to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>406 F.3d 323, 335-36 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 207, 163 L.Ed.2d 278 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Gibson, </em>55 F.3d 173, 179 (5th Cir.1995). The Supreme Court has emphasized that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is the preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 503-04, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). Accordingly, this court has \u201cundertaken to resolve claims of inadequate representation on direct appeal only in rare cases where the record allowed [the court] to evaluate fairly the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 314 (5th Cir.1987). Sublet\u2019s is not one of those rare cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
