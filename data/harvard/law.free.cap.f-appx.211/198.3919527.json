We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Sullivan v. Smith, </em>No. 7:04-cv-00026-FL (E.D.N.C. Mar. 28, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
