For reversal, McGee contends the district court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence that was greater than necessary to meet the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">We reject McGee\u2019s argument. The court noted McGee\u2019s history of selling crack cocaine, and McGee\u2019s background and failure to avail himself of the opportunities he had been given to abide by the law; the court explained that, although the sentence was \u201cstiff,\u201d the court was concerned that McGee might re-offend and endanger the public. Further, the court stated that the sentence would avoid sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (nature and circumstances of offense and history and characteristics of defendant), (a)(2)(C) (protect public from further crimes of defendant), (a)(6) (avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct); <em>United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005) (relevant inquiry is whether court actually considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether appellate court\u2019s review of those factors leads it to conclude that they support finding of reasonableness); <em>United States v. Lamoreaux, </em>422 F.3d 750, 756 (8th Cir.2005) (nothing in \u00a7 3553(a) requires \u201crobotic incantations\u201d that each factor was considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">Significantly, the 262-month prison sentence was at the low end of the undisputed Guidelines range, and McGee has not rebutted \u2014 nor can we see a basis for rebutting \u2014 the resulting presumption of reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ableness. <em>See United States v. Tobacco, </em>428 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir.2005) (presumptively reasonable sentence can be unreasonable if district court (1) failed to consider relevant fact that should have received significant weight; (2) gave significant weight to improper or irrelevant factor; or (3) considered only appropriate factors, but in weighing those factors committed clear error of judgment); <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.) (sentence within Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable; defendant bears burden to rebut presumption of reasonableness), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 840, 163 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-21\">.
