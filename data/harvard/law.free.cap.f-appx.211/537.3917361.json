White, Jr., appeals the 24-month sentence imposed by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> upon revocation of his supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-21\">White was originally found guilty of witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) (a Class C felony), and was sen-fenced in August 1996 to 36 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) (10-year maximum prison term); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (offense classification). He began serving his supervised release in October 1997. In January 1998, the district court issued a warrant for White\u2019s arrest for violating a condition of his supervised release. At a November 2005 hearing, White admitted several violations of his conditions of supervised release, and the court imposed the statutory maximum of 24 months in prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2-year maximum revocation sentence if underlying offense was Class C felony).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking White\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>400 F.3d 591, 592 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (given defendant\u2019s admission that he had violated release conditions, there was no clear error in findings of fact supporting revocation and no abuse of discretion in decision to revoke). We further hold that the 24-month revocation sentence was not unreasonable and therefore not an abuse of discretion. Specifically, the sentence was within authorized limits and was based upon the district court\u2019s consideration of appropriate factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (revocation sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)); <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>397 F.3d 604, 606-07 (8th Cir.2005) (all that is required is evidence that court considered relevant matters, not that court made specific findings on each \u00a7 3553(a) factor; although Guidelines recommended 8-14 months, 24-month revocation sentence was not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of discretion where transcript showed court was aware of defendant\u2019s multiple violations of supervised-release conditions and of Guidelines range and statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-22\">. The Honorable Richard E. Dorr, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
