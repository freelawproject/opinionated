The district court sentenced Almonte to 121 months in prison, one month above the mandatory minimum sentence. Almonte timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Almonte\u2019s appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting two claims. First, counsel questions whether Almonte\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for permitting him to enter a plea agreement under which he waived his right to appeal his sentence. Such claims generally must be raised in the district court in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Because the record does not conclusively show that counsel was ineffective, we decline to address this claim at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Almonte\u2019s counsel also asserts that the mandatory minimum sentence required by 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2006) is unconstitutional. Although the Supreme Court has recognized criticism of mandatory minimum sentences, it has not found such sentences to be unconstitutional. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 568-69, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">We have reviewed the issues raised in Almonte\u2019s pro se supplemental briefs and find them to be meritless. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Almonte\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Almonte, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Almonte requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Almonte.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
