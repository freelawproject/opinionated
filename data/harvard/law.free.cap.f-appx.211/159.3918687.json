Because we find that she has stated claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-13\">On August 2, 2004, Green initiated this action by submitting her original complaint pro se and filing an application to proceed without prepayment of fees. The original complaint alleged a violation of Green\u2019s rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 by defendants Christopher Maroules, Christopher Caf\u00e9, Sheriff Allen Seymore, Sheriff W.E. Billy Smith, Sheriff Chris Jenkins, and Sheriff Henry Clayton Keel. Specifically, Green claimed that she was the target of racial profiling and a conspiracy to arrest her falsely, that she suffered from acute hypertension and diabetes, and that she was subjected to great physical and mental harm as a result of the defendants\u2019 misconduct. Green asked for compensatory and punitive damages, each in the amount of $150,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">On September 10, 2004, Green submitted a corrected complaint, which refined her claims somewhat and specified that she suffered from hypertension on July 21 and 23 (presumably the dates on which she was arrested). In the corrected complaint, Green alleged that the defendants \u201cmaliciously and willfully\u201d injured Green\u2019s civil liberties \u201cby arresting her without cause, and knowing they had no right to arrest her.\u201d As she had in her original complaint, Green identified herself as an African American and alleged that the defendants acted \u201cat all times under the State of North Carolina ... in their official capacity in violation of the civil rights [ ] of the plaintiff.\u201d Green asserted that the defendants were not entitled to any immunities and again prayed for a total of $300,000 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-15\">On October 6, 2004, a magistrate judge submitted a Memorandum and Recommendation to the district court recommending that Green\u2019s case be dismissed for failing to state a claim oh which relief could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>granted. The judge accepted the corrected complaint as an amended complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) but nevertheless considered Green\u2019s claims legally insufficient under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The magistrate judge construed Green\u2019s corrected complaint as alleging \u201can equal protection violation based upon an alleged conspiracy by the Lenoir County police to commit racial profiling.\u201d Because Green did not identify the race of the defendants; did not allege any pattern, practice, or custom by the county police of targeting African Americans for racial profiling; and did not allege any facts from which discriminatory intent could be found or inferred, the magistrate judge concluded that her \u201cracial profiling claim lack[ed] an arguable basis in law.\u201d The judge also concluded that Green failed to allege the facts necessary to sustain a claim of conspiracy to violate Green\u2019s civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 (2000). On November 5, 2004, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, dismissing Green\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We review the dismissal of Green\u2019s corrected complaint de novo. <em>See De\u2019Lonta v. Angelone, </em>330 F.3d 630, 633 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe standards for reviewing a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) are the same as those for reviewing a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Thus, we review a \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal de novo.\u201d (citation omitted)). We assume the truth of \u201call facts alleged in the complaint and the existence of any fact that can be proved, consistent with the complaint\u2019s allegations.\u201d <em>E. Shore Mkts. v. J.D. Assocs., </em>213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Green\u2019s corrected complaint stated that she came to the court \u201cseeking due process and equal justice under ... 42 USC 1983-85[sic]. US Constitutions 14th amendment equal process [sic].\u201d To state a claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must aver that a person acting under color of state law deprived him or her of a constitutional right or of a right conferred by a law of the United States. <em>See Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty, </em>145 F.3d 653, 658 (4th Cir.1998). In the instant case, Green\u2019s corrected complaint stated a \u00a7 1983 claim that her Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable government seizure was violated and that her rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had been infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment levies upon the state governments the same restrictions that the Fourth Amendment imposes upon the federal government. <em>See Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 654-55, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Because an arrest amounts to a Fourth Amendment seizure, <em>see Henderson v. Simms, </em>223 F.3d 267, 272 (4th Cir.2000), probable cause is necessary for an arrest to be lawful, <em>see, e.g., Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 310-11, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). A plaintiff, then, could allege a contravention of \u00a7 1983 by asserting that state agents arrested her without probable cause in violation of her Fourteenth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure by the state government. In this case, Green did just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">In her corrected complaint, Green alleged that the defendants infringed upon her Fourteenth Amendment rights and thus violated \u00a7 1983. She alleged that the defendants were officers of the state of North Carolina who acted in their official capacity. Green claimed the officers \u201cknowingly\u201d took her into \u201cillegal custody,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>arresting her \u201cwithout cause, and knowing they had no right to arrest her.\u201d Green\u2019s corrected complaint contained all the elements necessary to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983 for a violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights. We reverse the district court\u2019s judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Green also made out a \u00a7 1983 claim based on a violation of her rights under the Equal Protection Clause. To state an equal protection claim, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to \u201cdemonstrate that he has been treated differently from others with whom he is similarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the result of intentional or purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Williams v. Hansen, </em>326 F.3d 569, 576 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Morrison v. Garraghty, </em>239 F.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001)). Here, Green alleged that she was racially profiled and, consequently, falsely arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Because Green is a pro se plaintiff, we construe the allegations in her complaint liberally. <em>De\u2019Lonta, </em>330 F.3d at 633. A pro se complaint like Green\u2019s \u201cshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 10, 101 S.Ct. 173, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980); <em>see also Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147, 1151 (4th Cir.1978). Liberally construed, Green\u2019s corrected complaint made out an equal protection claim. She alleged differential treatment \u2014 a false arrest, through which others similarly situated presumably do not have to suffer \u2014 resulting from intentional discrimination in the form of racial profiling. Taken together, Green\u2019s allegations clearly pointed to the conclusion that she was falsely arrested because she is African American. Because it is not apparent \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that she cannot prove a set of facts in support of this claim that would entitle her to relief, her claim should not be dismissed at this stage of the litigation. <em>See Hughes, </em>449 U.S. at 10, 101 S.Ct. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Green also stated a \u00a7 1985 claim. To establish a cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3) (the subsection most relevant to Green\u2019s allegations), a plaintiff must allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">(1) a conspiracy of two or more persons, (2) who are motivated by a specific class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus to (3) deprive the plaintiff of the equal enjoyment of rights secured by the law to all, (4) and which results in injury to the plaintiff as (5) a consequence of an overt act committed by the defendants in connection with the conspiracy. Moreover, the law is well settled that to prove a section 1985 \u2018conspiracy,\u2019 a claimant must show an agreement or a \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 by defendants to violate the claimant\u2019s constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-12\"><em>Simmons v. Poe, </em>47 F.3d 1370, 1376-77 (4th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Green\u2019s complaint alleged that she was \u201cthe target of racial profiling and <em>subject to conspiracy </em>to falsely arrest and injured [sic] the civil rights of the Plaintiff\u2019 (emphasis added). Though this sentence does not specifically identify those who conspired against her, in the context of the entire complaint, which focused on the defendants\u2019 actions, we read it as alleging a conspiracy among the defendants. Similarly we understand Green\u2019s contention that she was profiled and targeted \u201cfor frivolous and racial hate reason[s]\u201d to allege that the defendants were motivated by a specific, invidiously discriminatory animus.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Green explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>averred that her civil liberties were injured, resulting in physical and mental harm, by acts of the defendants, who behaved consistently with their conspiracy to falsely arrest her. Read liberally, as it must be, Green\u2019s complaint contained all the elements of a proper \u00a7 1985 claim. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Green\u2019s \u00a7 1985 claim is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> Simply identifying herself as an African American and describing the defendants\u2019 conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>as \u201crace hate abuse\u201d would not be sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3), however. See <em>Gooden v. Howard, </em>954 F.2d 960, 970 (4th Cir. 1992) (holding that the mere statement that the plaintiff was black and the officers in question were white was insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
