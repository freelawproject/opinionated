The Government cross-appeals Gayekpar\u2019s non-Guidelines sentence as unreasonable. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-30\">Gayekpar attempted to defraud an acquaintance, Abdullah Abdullah, with a \u201cblack money\u201d scheme. He claimed to have $3 million worth of U.S. currency that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>had been covered with a black substance to get it out of Liberia and into the United States. Gayekpar promised to give Abdullah a portion of the cleaned money if Abdullah would help him obtain the $90,000 he allegedly needed to purchase a special chemical used to restore the currency to a useable form. Gayekpar demonstrated the process by purporting to clean some of the blackened money and offered to let Abdullah keep a cleaned $50 bill as a show of good faith. Abdullah was skeptical of Gayekpar and contacted local officials. He eventually worked with the Secret Service, who arrested Gayekpar when he arrived at Abdullah\u2019s business to collect $30,000 of baited money. Investigators determined that the \u201cblack money\u201d was actually black construction paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Gayekpar was charged and convicted by a jury of possessing altered U.S. currency with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472. At the time of Gayekpar\u2019s sentencing, he had been in custody for nearly eight months, and the district court sentenced him to \u201ctime served.\u201d Gayekpar appeals his conviction, and the Government cross-appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Gayekpar concedes that under Eighth Circuit precedent, his conduct is punishable under \u00a7 472. <em>See United States v. Idriss, </em>436 F.3d 946, 949 (8th Cir.2006) (holding that blackened currency in an identical scheme was \u201caltered\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 472). He claims, however, that application of the statute to altered genuine currency, as opposed to counterfeit currency, is beyond Congress\u2019s enumerated power to punish counterfeiting. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. Art. 1 \u00a7 8 cl.6 (authorizing Congress \u201c[t]o provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States\u201d). Congress\u2019s power over currency is not limited to clause 6, however. Article 1, section 8, clause 5 of the Constitution grants to Congress the power to \u201ccoin Money, [and] regulate the Value thereof,\u201d which the Supreme Court has interpreted to include \u201cthe correspondent and necessary power and obligation to protect and to preserve in its purity this constitutional currency for the benefit of the nation.\u201d <em>United States v. Marigold, </em>50 U.S. (9 How.) 560, 568, 13 L.Ed. 257 (1850) (relying on the broader clause 5 powers, coupled with the Necessary and Proper clause, to uphold a constitutional challenge to Congress\u2019s ability to criminalize the passing of counterfeit notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Gayekpar did not challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 472 in the district court. We therefore review his challenge for plain error, <em>United States v. Letts, </em>264 F.3d 787, 789 (8th Cir.2001) (\u2018We review Letts\u2019s constitutional challenges to \u00a7 922(g)(3) for plain error, because he did not make those claims in the district court.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 908, 122 S.Ct. 1211, 152 L.Ed.2d 148 (2002), and will reverse only if application of the statute to Gayekpar\u2019s conduct is \u201cso plainly unconstitutional that the failure of the trial court or this Court to hold it so can be regarded as a plain error or a culpable neglect of judicial duty,\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>890 F.2d 1033, 1034-35 (8th Cir.1989) (internal marks omitted). Congress\u2019s power to regulate the alteration of genuine U.S. currency is part of its broad power \u201cto protect and to preserve in its purity this constitutional currency for the benefit of the nation.\u201d <em>Marigold, </em>50 U.S. at 568; <em>see also United States v. Howell, </em>470 F.2d 1064, 1066 (9th Cir.1972) (relying on <em>Marigold </em>and Art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl.5 to uphold 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 473, which criminalizes the dealing in counterfeit or altered currency, against a constitutional challenge); <em>Barbee v. United States, </em>392 F.2d 532, 536 (5th Cir.) (upholding a challenge to altered genuine currency, noting that \u201cbecause attacks upon the physical integrity of currency in particular may endanger society by depleting the public trust in its economic standard, the government must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>establish sanctions to discourage such attacks\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>391 U.S. 935, 88 S.Ct. 1849, 20 L.Ed.2d 855 (1968). We uphold Gayekpar\u2019s conviction against his constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Gayekpar has not responded to the government\u2019s cross-appeal. At sentencing, the district court adopted the undisputed factual findings contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR), determined an intended loss of $90,000, and calculated his adjusted offense level at a level 15, based on a base offense level of 7, United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (USSG) \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(l), and an 8-level enhancement for an intended loss between $70,000 and $120,000, USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E). Coupled with a criminal history category of II, Gayekpar faced an advisory Guidelines range of 21 to 27 months of imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court said: \u201cThe sentence will incorporate the Supreme Court decisions of last year and will take into consideration paragraph 2 of Section 3553(a), which outlines the duties of the Court in imposing sentence.\u201d (Sentencing Tr. at 12.) The district court then sentenced Gayekpar to \u201ctime served,\u201d or approximately eight months.</p>\n<p id=\"AhX\">When the parties do not dispute the applicable advisory Guidelines range, the issue before this court is whether the district court imposed a reasonable sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>447 F.3d 1026, 1028 (8th Cir.2006). A sentence within the properly-calculated advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable, and a sentence outside of that range requires some explanation. Although a rote recitation of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not required, \u201cthe court should explain both the decision to vary and the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(remanding for resentencing where the only factor discussed by the district court did not justify a sentence significantly below the advisory Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">In its written statement of reasons filed after the sentencing hearing, the district court listed various statutory factors: \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(6), and (a)(7), without explaining their significance to Gayekpar\u2019s case. It is not clear whether the district court adopted any of Gayekpar\u2019s arguments at sentencing for a non-Guidelines sentence. Based on the record, however, none of the subsections cited by the district court justifies a sentence thirteen months below the advisory Guidelines range. Some of the subsections cited by the district court do not apply at all; for example, neither restitution under \u00a7 3553(a)(7) nor the need for training or medical care under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) is at issue in this case. Other cited subsections actually counsel toward a longer rather than a shorter sentence. For example, the lenient sentences (probation for one defendant and six months of imprisonment for the other) originally received by the defendants in <em>Idriss, </em>at least one of whom reportedly trained Gayekpar in perpetrating the same scheme, apparently failed to deter others, namely Gayekpar, from similar conduct. See \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B) (sentence imposed should afford adequate deterrence). In addition, Gayekpar engaged in the offense conduct less than one year after pleading guilty to committing financial transaction card fraud for stealing and using a VISA debit card and possessing his coworkers\u2019 blank checks, for which he spent nine days in jail. See \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (history and characteristics of the defendant); \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (sentence imposed should protect the public from the defendant). The original sentences received by the defendants in <em>Idriss </em>were reversed on appeal because the district court, acting after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not consider the amount of the loss. <em>See Idriss, </em>436 F.3d at 951. On remand, those defendants received sentences of six months and eighteen months of imprisonment. Considering Gayekpar\u2019s higher criminal history score of II, compared to the criminal history category of I faced by both of the <em>Idriss </em>defendants, a sentence below the advisory Guidelines range was not necessary to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On this record, an unexplained sentence of \u201ctime served,\u201d resulting in a sentence thirteen months below the 21-month bottom of the presumptively reasonable advisory Guidelines range, is unreasonable where nothing in the record supports it. <em>See United States v. McMannus, </em>436 F.3d 871, 875 (8th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We affirm the judgment of conviction, and we remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
