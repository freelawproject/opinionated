He was sentenced to twelve months of imprisonment and thirty-six months of supervised release. In February 2006, Strickland\u2019s probation officer filed a petition to revoke Strickland\u2019s supervised release because Strickland had tested positive for marijuana on a number of occasions. At his revocation hearing, Strickland did not contest the allegations. The district court found that Strickland committed the charged violations and revoked his supervised release. The court sentenced Strickland to twenty-four months in prison, the statutory maximum. On appeal, Strickland contends that the district court erred when it imposed a sentence outside the range recommended by the Chapter 7 advisory policy statement because, the court stated, a longer sentence would increase the likelihood that Strickland would be given the opportunity to enter the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 residential intensive drug treatment program. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">We recently held in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), that we review sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release to determine whether the sentence is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d In this case, Strickland\u2019s sentence was within the applicable statutory maximum, the court considered the Chapter 7 advisory guideline range of five to eleven months, and the court stated a proper basis for its decision to sentence Strickland to twenty-four months in prison. <em>See Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 440. Specifically, the court stated that it believed Strickland was addicted to marijuana and needed intensive drug treatment. The court imposed a sentence that was calculated to increase the likelihood that Strickland would receive such treatment. Because Strickland\u2019s sentence was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, we find that his sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Strickland\u2019s super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>vised release and imposing a twenty-four month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
