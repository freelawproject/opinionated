Wehmhoefer asserts that the defendants forged and stole annuity checks belonging to him and that despite efforts to obtain his money, he was denied access to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">The district court did not err in concluding that Wehmhoefer\u2019s claim for the intentional deprivation of personal property should be dismissed for failing to state a claim for which relief may be granted. <em>See Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Murphy v. Collins, </em>26 F.3d 541, 543-44 (5th Cir.1994). Texas has adequate post-deprivation remedies for the confiscation of prisoner property. <em>See Murphy, </em>26 F.3d at 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Wehmhoefer also fails to show that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint as frivolous and malicious based on a finding that his previous lawsuits were nearly identical. Although Wehmhoefer argues that the instant complaint was forged or altered, his argument on appeal is identical to the claim raised in the complaint filed in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZi\">Wehmhoefer\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous, and therefore dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). His motion for the appointment of counsel is also denied. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Wehmhoefer\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of the instant appeal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wehmhoefer has accumulated one other strike in <em>Wehmhoefer v. Kitckel, </em>No. 4:05\u2014CV-3140. Because Wehmhoefer has now accumulated three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
