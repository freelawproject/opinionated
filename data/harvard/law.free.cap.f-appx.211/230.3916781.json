Short appeals the district court\u2019s order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment. Short\u2019s attorney filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious issues on appeal, but raising two issues on Short\u2019s behalf. Short has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising several issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Counsel contends that the district court erred in using the preponderance of the evidence standard to determine whether a violation of supervised release occurred. Short adds to this argument, challenging the preponderance of the evidence standard and asserting that he should have been tried in state court first on the criminal charges underlying his supervised release violation. We reject these contentions, as the preponderance of the evidence standard was correctly applied and the supervised release violation hearing was completely separate and distinct from any state proceedings. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3583(e)(3), 3606 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">Counsel also asserts that the district court erred in sentencing Short to a twenty-four month term. Given that the term was within the applicable statutory maximum and the recommended guideline range, and because it was neither procedurally nor substantively unreasonable, we find that it was not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Short also sets forth a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Because our review of the record does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, this claim may not be raised on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Short next advances a vague challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, stating that he was not guilty. Our review discloses that the evidence was in fact sufficient to support the Grade A violation. Finally, we reject Short\u2019s assertion that he should have been granted bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order revoking Short\u2019s supervised release and imposing a twenty-four month sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
