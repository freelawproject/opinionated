He challenges the supervised release revocation in the first instance and asserts that the sentence imposed is plainly unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">Ayers first asserts that the district court erred by revoking his supervised release. At the revocation hearing, however, Ayers admitted that he had used cocaine. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release. <em>See United States v. Davis, 53 </em>F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">Ayers also asserts that the district court should have modified his term of supervised release to include drug treatment and that the court plainly erred by imposing an additional term of supervised release. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not err in imposing an additional term of supervised release. We also note that, although the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. -(U.S. Nov. 3, 2006) (No. 06-7631), to guide its imposition of Ayers\u2019 revocation sentence, we conclude that Ayers\u2019 sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-16\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
