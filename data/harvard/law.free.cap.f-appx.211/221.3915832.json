We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion. <em>See Obioha v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 400, 408 (4th Cir.2005) (setting forth standard of review). Whether Weldesenbet\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim rises to the level of a due process claim is reviewed de novo. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). We find the Board did not err in determining whether Weldesenbet was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (2006); <em>Savino v. Murray, </em>82 F.3d 593, 598 (4th Cir.1996). We further agree with the Board that Weldesenbet failed to establish prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In addition, we find the immigration judge used the proper analysis in determining whether Weldesenbet was entitled to withholding from removal and substantial evidence supports the finding that there was a fundamental change of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
