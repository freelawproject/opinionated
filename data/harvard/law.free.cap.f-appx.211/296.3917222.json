The district-court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order appealed from granted the District\u2019s motion in part, declaring unitary status in the areas of student body compositions, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities. It denied unitary status, however, and thereby retained oversight, regarding faculty and staff assignments. The court thus retained jurisdiction under the consent decree and reserved the option to reevaluate the District\u2019s position in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-26\">Based on our extensive review of the record on appeal and the parties\u2019 briefs, we perceive no reversible error of fact or law, and therefore affirm the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
