Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d), and his employer, Defendant Appellee Peerless Industries, Inc. (\u201cPeerless\u201d). From October 18, 2001 to May 2, 2003, Taylor worked as a district sales representative in the southern district of Peerless\u2019s professional sales department\u2019s area of coverage. On May 2nd, however, Peerless terminated Taylor\u2019s employment for his alleged ineffectiveness in the field.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-17\">Taylor, a black male, sued Peerless, charging that it discriminated against him on the basis of his race in violation of both United States Code, title 42, section 1981 and title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Slightly over a year into the lawsuit, Peerless filed a motion for summary judgement, contending that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. It argued that Taylor could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination, and that even if he could, Peerless would still be entitled to judgment as a matter of law based on its proffered legitimate, non-diseriminatory reason for Taylor\u2019s termination \u2014 his professional ineffectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-18\">After a hearing on the motion, the district court granted summary judgment to Peerless, concluding that Taylor could not establish that Peerless\u2019s articulated, legitimate reason for termination was pretextual under the burden-shifting oscillation established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Taylor timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard employed by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the mov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In reaching its decision, the district court applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>methodology to Taylor\u2019s claims. This constituted an error of law. Since the Supreme Court handed down <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we have applied a \u201cmodified\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>process in title VII cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Like the original <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>methodology, the modified procedure allows the use of circumstantial evidence of discrimination when there is no direct evidence: The plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination; the defendant then must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its decision to terminate the plaintiff; and, if the defendant meets its burden, the plaintiff must then offer sufficient evidence that the defendant\u2019s reason is not true, but is instead a pretext for discrimination. The modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>minuet comes into play in the so-called mixed motive cases, those in which the defendant\u2019s proffered reason, even if true, is but one of two or more reasons for its employment decision, another \u201cmotivating factor\u201d being the plaintiffs protected classification.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>process, the defendant-employer must demonstrate that it would have made the same adverse employment decision even in the absence of the employee\u2019s showing of a discriminatory animus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If tile employer cannot bear this burden, the plaintiff-employee prevails.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">By applying the original <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test, rather than the modified version, the district court failed to consider whether race was <em>a </em>motivating factor in Peerless\u2019s decision, even if it were not the sole factor. Based on the applicable law and our extensive review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we conclude that the district court failed properly to analyze Taylor\u2019s claim as a mixed motive case under the required modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>process. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s summary judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with <em>Costa, </em>our precedent, and this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Our decision today should not be construed as precluding the district court\u2019s reaching the same result under the modified <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>procedure that it reached under the original <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>methodology. We do not intend to send such a signal.</p>\n<p id=\"Asz\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
