(\u201cStarBand\u201d) on Smith\u2019s claims of racial discrimination pursuant to Title VII of the CM Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. We find no reversible error and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">Smith, an African-American male, applied for the position of Technical Support Supervisor at StarBand\u2019s Marietta, Georgia, facility in October 2003. After the initial screening process, Smith was selected as a finalist \u2014 along with Ron McNeely (\u201cMcNeely\u201d), a Caucasian male, and Ted Blizzard (\u201cBlizzard\u201d), an African-American male \u2014 by the final decisionmaker, Tim Kelly (\u201cKelly\u201d), and three other managers (collectively, the \u201cmanagers\u201d). Because the finalists\u2019 scores were very close, a fourth manager, Tim Southard (\u201cSouthard\u201d), was asked to assess the three candidates; he concluded that they were equally qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Kelly then requested input from the other Technical Support Supervisors (collectively, the \u201csupervisors\u201d). Two of the three supervisors ranked Smith last out of the three candidates. These supervisors also expressed concerns over Smith\u2019s communication and supervisory skills, specifically noting Smith\u2019s arrogance in dealing with the supervisors and referencing an incident between Smith and a former employee, Leah Kamau (\u201cKamau\u201d), that arose when Smith was temporarily supervising Kamau. The remaining team member, Smith\u2019s direct supervisor, ranked Smith second behind Blizzard. After discussing the supervisors\u2019 concerns with the other managers, Kelly chose to promote McNeely-</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Smith filed this Title VII and section 1981 suit, alleging that he was either \u201cqualified or more qualified for\u201d the supervisor position compared to McNeely and seeking backpay, compensatory and punitive damages, and litigation expenses. After discovery, StarBand moved for summary judgment, contending that race was no factor in its consideration of the candidates and arguing that its decision was based on a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason: namely, the input from the managers and supervisors on the import of Smith\u2019s negative rapport with the supervisors and the incident with Kamau. The magistrate judge determined that, although Smith had met his burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, he failed to show that StarBand\u2019s asserted reason was a mere pretext for a true discriminatory motive. After a <em>de novo </em>review of the record, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, granting summary judgment in favor of StarBand. Smith now appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">We review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts in the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Frederick v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>246 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2001). The moving party must show that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>To survive a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must introduce \u201csignificantly probative evidence\u201d showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party. <em>See Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162-63 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">We analyze claims of racial discrimination based on circumstantial evidence under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). If a plaintiff establishes <em>a prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the defendant then has the burden of producing a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824. The plaintiff must then persuade the court that the proffered reasons were pretexts for unlawful discrimination. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000). The plaintiff must show both that the \u201creason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>446 F.3d at 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered ... reasons ... that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir. 1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">On appeal, Smith argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>presented several triable issues of material fact about whether the legitimate reason offered by StarBand for the employment decision was pretextual. Smith contends that (1) inaccurate statements made by a former StarBand manager, Holly Hill (\u201cHill\u201d), in her affidavit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission support the inference that StarBand\u2019s stated reasons for not promoting Smith are contradictory and pretextual; (2) Kelly\u2019s prior performance appraisals of Smith and initial rating of Smith in the selection process\u2014 both of which indicate that Kelly thought Smith was qualified for the job and had superior teamwork and communication skills, despite the Kamau incident and Smith\u2019s problems with the supervisors\u2014 raise a triable issue of fact on whether Kelly sincerely believed McNeely was the better candidate; and (3) Smith\u2019s superior qualifications relative to McNeely\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> creates a triable issue of fact about pretext. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">First, the misstatements by Hill do not create a triable issue of material fact because they do not address Kelly\u2019s proffered reasons for choosing McNeely over Smith. Hill\u2019s affidavit incorrectly stated that the position was first offered to Blizzard, then to McNeely.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if this inaccuracy \u201cmisleadingly raises the inference that the Caucasian candidate (McNeely) was chosen after the leading African-American candidate (Blizzard) withdrew from the process,\u201d as Smith contends, it does not indicate that Kelly\u2019s decision was not influenced by the input of the supervisors and managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Second, that Kelly regarded Smith as qualified for the position and placed little emphasis on the Kamau incident and Smith\u2019s strained rapport with the supervisors <em>before </em>receiving input from the other managers and the supervisors does not indicate that Kelly did not sincerely believe the supervisors\u2019 reports or that he did not place greater emphasis on these incidents <em>after </em>receiving input from the managers and supervisors. StarBand does not dispute that Kelly thought Smith was qualified for the position; his selection as a finalist indicates as much. Kelly testified that he initially thought the incident with Kamau and the reports of Smith\u2019s problems with the supervisors were not \u201coverwhelming,\u201d but that his decision took into account that there were \u201cother parties at play in this business, and I\u2019m not making a decision in a vacuum.\u201d Smith evidenced nothing showing that Kelly did not honestly believe that the reported incidents occurred and that they affected the supervisors\u2019 and managers\u2019 perception of Smith. <em>See Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 730 (11th Cir.2004). More important, Smith produced no evidence refuting Kelly\u2019s statement that his decision was motivated by the input of the other managers and supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Third, Smith failed to show that the disparities between his qualifications and McNeely\u2019s were so severe that \u201cno reasonable person, in the exercise of judgment, could have chosen [McNeely over Smith].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732; <em>see also Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>546 U.S. 454, 126 S.Ct. 1195, 1197, 163 L.Ed.2d 1053 (2006) <em>(per </em>curiam) (approving this language from Cooper). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>record shows that McNeely and Smith were roughly equally qualified for the position. Their scores from the initial screening and interview process were very close. When Southard, a manager from another division, was asked to evaluate the final candidates, he could not distinguish one above the other. Kelly himself testified that both candidates were roughly equal in terms of qualifications \u2014 while Smith may have had the edge in experience, McNeely appeared to have superior education. The evidence does not support Smith\u2019s contention that the disparity between his and McNeely\u2019s qualifications shows that Star-Band\u2019s reasons for hiring McNeely, rather than Smith, were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Because Smith has failed to introduce evidence that the reason proffered by StarBand was a mere pretext for racial discrimination, the district court properly granted StarBand\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. Smith specifically asserts that he was the superior candidate because he had been with StarBand for three years when the supervisor position became available, while McNeely had only been with the company for nine months. Smith also contends that he had received prior promotions, had midlevel experience as a team leader, and had actual experience as a supervisor with StarBand, while McNeely did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b857-11\">. Kelly testified that he probably would have promoted Blizzard if he had not felt that Blizzard lacked real desire for the promotion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
