Donel was sentenced to a total term of 130 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Donel argues that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict on the count of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be \u2018confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984). A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). We do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Proof that a defendant aided and abetted a violation of \u00a7 924(c) requires the government to \u201cestablish that the defendant knew \u2018to a practical certainty that the principal would be [using] a gun.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Spinney, </em>65 F.3d 231, 237 (1st Cir.1995). This essentially requires proof of actual knowledge that a gun would be used. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to prove that Donel had actual knowledge that a firearm would be used in the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">We therefore affirm Donel\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
