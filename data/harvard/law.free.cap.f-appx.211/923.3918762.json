Carvajal-Castano contends neither the BIA nor the IJ placed sufficient weight on all of the encounters she had with FARC, which fell within the definition of past persecution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">To the extent the BIA\u2019s decision is based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). Factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the \u201chighly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [BIA\u2019s] decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005). Findings of fact may be reversed only when the record compels the opposite conclusion. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">A petitioner can establish asylum based on past persecution if she can demonstrate she was persecuted and the persecution resulted from a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>In establishing eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded' fear of future persecution, she must demonstrate both a \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of persecution,\u201d resulting from a protected ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Here, the BIA denied asylum because there was insufficient evidence Carvajal-Casta\u00f1o experienced persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution. The evidence does not compel a finding Carvajal-Casta\u00f1o was persecuted, as her testimony was that she had been threatened, mostly by telephone, and recounted no physical contact except being pushed against a wall. \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citation omitted). \u201c[M]enacing telephone calls and threats ... do not rise to the level of past persecution that would compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the incidents about which Carvajal-Castano testified do not rise to the level of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Additionally, in a case where the petitioner had been subject to menacing telephone calls and threats, we noted the petitioner\u2019s \u201cnotoriety\u201d would not outlast a four-year absence, making her fear of future persecution objectively unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 1232. Similarly here, there is no evidence the FARC would still be interested in Carvajal-Casta\u00f1o three years later. Thus, the evidence does not compel a finding Carvajal-Casta\u00f1o has a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">Withholding of removal may be granted if the alien can establish that, if returned to his country, his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). \u201c \u2018Where an applicant is unable to meet the \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, [she] is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u2019 \u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>at 1243. As Carvajal-Castano failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she also failed to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-16\">. Casta\u00f1o does not challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Thus, that issue is abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-7\">. Here, the BIA disagreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning and gave its own explanation for why relief should be denied. Accordingly, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision, and the IJ\u2019s findings regarding Castano\u2019s lack of a political opinion are irrelevant to this appeal. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (finding \"[w]e review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
