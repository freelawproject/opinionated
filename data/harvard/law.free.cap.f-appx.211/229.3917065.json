In No. 06-1066, Malik challenges the Board\u2019s order finding that the immigration judge did not err in denying his applications for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 212(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(1) (2000), and for adjustment of status. We lack jurisdiction to review any claim that the Board abused its discretion in affirming the denial of a \u00a7 212(1) waiver, <em>Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001), and the subsequent denial of adjustment of status. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) (West 2005). Under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (West 2005), we do have \u201ca narrowly circumscribed jurisdiction to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens seeking discretionary relief.\u201d <em>Higuit v. Gonzales, </em>433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2973, 165 L.Ed.2d 955 (2006). However, we find no merit in Malik\u2019s alleged deprivations of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">In No. 06-1562, Malik petitions for review of a decision of the Board denying his motion to reopen and reconsider the Board\u2019s initial order. To the extent Malik seeks review of the Board\u2019s reconsideration of its discretionary denial of relief under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I), we have no jurisdiction to review that denial \u201cdressed up as a motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006). As to the Board\u2019s application of its general precedent and regulations concerning motions to reopen and reconsider, we hold that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Malik\u2019s motion to reopen and reconsider. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petitions for review in part for lack of jurisdiction, and deny them in part. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">\n<em>PETITIONS DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
