Specifically, he contends that the disparity between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine, resulting in his receiving 10-year mandatory minimum sentences, is both unreasonable and unwarranted. In support of his argument, he cites two Supreme Court decisions that permit district courts to reject the disparity created by the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 100:1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio. <em>See Spears v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 840, 844, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009); <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He notes additionally that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy is to promote sentencing uniformity and that recent legislative proposals, including the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L.No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372 (2010), seek to eliminate the sentencing disparities created by the 100:1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">Normally, this court reviews the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, this case concerns the district court\u2019s authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum, thus subjecting the sentence to review <em>de novo. See United States v. Alexander, </em>609 F.3d 1250, 1253 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cWe consider <em>de novo ... </em>the application of law to sentencing issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">The government notes that appellant may have failed to sufficiently preserve his objection to the sentences he received, so we would review the sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1323 (11th Cir.2005). However, the analysis in this case remains the same under any standard of review because the district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in imposing sentences mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">At the time that appellant committed the crimes, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 provided that an individual who distributes or possesses with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine \u201cshall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b)(1)(A)(iii). \u201cIt is well-settled that a district court is not authorized to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum unless the government files a substantial assistance motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) or the defendant falls within the safety-valve of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u201d <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2008). A defendant qualifies for the safety-valve exception of \u00a7 3553(f) only if he \u201cdoes not have more than 1 criminal history point.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">The Sentencing Guidelines are to be applied in an advisory fashion. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 258-59, 125 S.Ct. 738, 764, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, <em>Booker </em>does not affect the mandatory nature of statutory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cEven after <em>Booker, </em>the district court is bound by the statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums.\u201d). In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Supreme Court held that district courts have authority to deviate from the 100:1 crack-to-powder ratio in fashioning an appropriate sentence under \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at 108, 128 S.Ct. at 574. The Court noted, however, that district courts remain \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums\u201d prescribed by Congress. <em>Id.; accord Spears, </em>129 S.Ct. at 844 (district court\u2019s determination that a mandatory minimum sentence was required \u201cmoot[ed] any further arguments for a reduced sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>Appellant references the FSA to support his argument that his 10-year mandatory minimum sentences, arising out of the flawed 100:1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio, is unfair and conflicts with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The FSA, signed into law on August 3, 2010, changes to the crack-to-powder ratio from 100:1 to about 18:1. <em>See </em>Pub.L.No 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. The Act amends the sentencing provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) by raising from 50 grams to 280 grams the amount of crack necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence, and raising the amount from 5 to 28 grams necessary to trigger the 5-year minimum. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2(a)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">Section 109 of Title 1 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANFO\">The repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty, forfeiture, or liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-5\">1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">Appellant fails to establish that the district court committed any error in sentencing him to the mandatory minimum. The government did not file a substantial assistance motion under \u00a7 3553(e), and he did not qualify for the safety-valve exception under \u00a7 3553(f). Aside from these two statutory exceptions, no relevant authority permits a district court to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum. In fact, the court would have committed reversible error if it had sentenced him to less than 120 months on the three counts of the indictment. <em>See Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362 (vacating a sentence less than the mandatory minimum). Moreover, because the FSA took effect in August 2010, after appellant committed his crimes, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 bars the Act from affecting his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1370-15\">. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1370-24\">. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1370-23\">.
