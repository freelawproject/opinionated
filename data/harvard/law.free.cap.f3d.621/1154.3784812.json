SMITH,</author>\n<p id=\"ARp\">with whom Chief Judge KOZINSKI and Judges PREGERSON and REINHARDT join, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-12\">Just one year ago, Chief Judge Kozinski presciently observed that we had on our hands \u201ca train wreck in the making.\u201d <em>United States v. Mayer, </em>560 F.3d 948, 951 (9th Cir.2009) (Kozinski, C.J., dissenting from the denial of. rehearing en banc). For years we had become accustomed to applying uniformly the <em>Taylor </em>categorical approach in our immigration and criminal sentencing jurisprudence. <em>Mayer </em>ended that practice. It developed a unique categorical approach for cases involving the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) and the Sentencing Guidelines career offender provision. It also expanded those provisions\u2019 \u201cresidual clause\u201d to cover nearly any crime. Chief Judge Kozinski warned of the growing number of casualties that would result in our circuit following our decision in <em>Mayer. See id. </em>at 954. Add Rayford Terrell as the next name on that list, and expect it to grow after the panel\u2019s decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-14\">In this case the panel holds that we can find a categorical match \u2014 and apply a substantial sentence enhancement \u2014 without reference to a single state case or other objective measure of whether the state offense falls within the definition of the generic federal offense that Congress intended to be the basis for enhancement. Apparently, a panel\u2019s gut instinct is all that matters. It also holds that a state offense that lacks one of the generic crime\u2019s key elements \u2014 key because it makes the generic offense inherently violent \u2014 is \u201calmost always\u201d the same offense as the corresponding generic crime. As a result, we have officially abandoned the categorical approach in \u201cresidual clause\u201d cases. Because I believe the panel\u2019s approach is contrary to the intent of Congress and Supreme Court case law, I respectfully dissent from the court\u2019s denial of rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-16\">Determining whether an offense falls within the ACCA\u2019s residual clause involves two distinct questions. First, we examine the degree of risk associated with the crime to determine whether the offense \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 203, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (\u201cask[ing] whether the risk posed by [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>offense at issue] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses \u2014 [burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes that involve the use of explosives]\u201d); <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (assuming that New Mexico\u2019s DUI statute involves conduct presenting such a risk). If we determine that the degree of risk posed by the offense is such that it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, we move on to the second question: whether the offense is \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to the enumerated offenses in that it \u201ctypically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The fatal flaw in the panel\u2019s analysis is that it ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated instructions that we answer these questions under the <em>categorical </em>approach first articulated in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See Begay, 553 </em>U.S. at 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (citing <em>Taylor </em>for \u201cadopting this \u2018categorical approach\u2019 \u201d and explaining that \u201c[i]n determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">The categorical approach focuses on \u201cthe elements of the crimes of which the defendant was previously convicted.\u201d <em>United States v. Selfa, </em>918 F.2d 749, 751 (9th Cir.1990); <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 202, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (\u201c[W]e consider whether the <em>elements of the offense </em>are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision, without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\u201d); <em>United States v. Riley, </em>183 F.3d 1155, 1158 (9th Cir.1999) (recognizing that under the categorical approach \u201cwe analyze only the elements of the crime charged\u201d). Under the residual clause, then, the elements of the offense must satisfy: (1) <em>James\u2019s </em>requirement that the degree of risk associated with the crime presents a serious potential risk of physical injury; and (2) <em>Begay\u2019s </em>requirement that the offense typically involves purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">As to the Arizona sexual assault offense at issue in <em>Terrell, </em>this means that we first ask whether \u201csexual intercourse or oral sexual contact ... without consent,\u201d Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1406(A), presents a serious risk of physical injury. I agree that our decision in <em>Riley, </em>183 F.3d at 1159, governs this part of the analysis, because we held in <em>Riley </em>that non-consensual sexual intercourse presents such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">At step two of the analysis, we must ask whether the elements of Arizona sexual assault typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct. They do not. Under Arizona law, sexual assault does not require the use of force, the threat of force, or any sexual penetration. <em>See </em>Ariz. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1401(5)(b)-(d). Because the statute\u2019s elements cover instances in which the offender acts neither violently nor aggressively, it does not categorically fall under <em>Begay. See United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 850 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\u201cWhere ... a state statute explicitly defines a crime more broadly than the generic definition, no \u2018legal imagination,\u2019 is required to hold that a realistic probability exists that the state will apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.\u201d (citing <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007), which was cited with approval in <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>The panel\u2019s opinion attempts to explain that Arizona sexual assault involves \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct because the Supreme Court told us in <em>Coker v. Georgia, </em>433 U.S. 584, 597-98, 97 S.Ct. 2861, 53 L.Ed.2d 982 (1977), that <em>Georgia\u2019s rape law </em>is a violent crime. <em>See United States v. Terrell, </em>593 F.3d 1084, 1090 (9th Cir. 2010). I concede that reasonable minds may disagree on how one should go about applying <em>Taylor</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>s categorical approach and what exactly the Supreme Court has in mind when it repeatedly tells us that we are not to consider \u201chow an individual offender might have committed [the offense] on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581. But surely, in examining a particular state offense before us under the categorical approach, no one thinks we may look to what the Supreme Court has said about <em>another state\u2019s </em>entirely <em>different offense. </em>Yet that is precisely what the <em>Terrell </em>panel does. Arizona\u2019s sexual assault law covers conduct very different from the Georgia rape statute in <em>Coker. </em>The Georgia statute defined rape as \u201chaving carnal knowledge of a female, <em>forcibly </em>and against her will. Carnal knowledge in rape occurs when there is any <em>penetration </em>of the female sex organ by the male sex organ.\u201d 433 U.S. at 586 n. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2861 (emphases added) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Arizona statute requires neither force nor sexual penetration. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-1401(3) (including \u201cmasturbatory contact\u201d within the definition of \u201csexual intercourse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-15\">Nevertheless, relying on <em>Coker </em>and citing no Arizona cases, the panel holds that while some cases prosecuted under the Arizona law do not necessarily involve violence, the \u201ctypical\u201d case does, which is enough to create a categorical match with <em>Begay. Terrell, </em>593 F.3d at 1090. One is unable to discern from the panel\u2019s opinion how future panels, and more importantly future criminal defendants and their counsel, are to determine when the \u201ctypical\u201d offense involves \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct in the absence of an element in the state offense requiring it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Mayer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>held that we determine the \u201ctypical\u201d case by looking at whether \u201c[m]ost of the cases\u201d applying the state statute involve such conduct. <em>See Mayer, </em>560 F.3d at 961-62. Chief Judge Kozinski argued that <em>Mayer\u2019s </em>\u201cmost of the time\u201d rule would prove difficult to administer. <em>See id. </em>at 952 (Kozinski, C.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). He was wrong in this case, but only because the panel does not even bother to consult whether \u201cmost of the cases\u201d applying Arizona\u2019s sexual assault offense involve \u201cviolent\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. It cites no Arizona cases whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">In any event, <em>Mayer\u2019s </em>\u201cmost of the time\u201d rule was not correct either. The Supreme Court has given us at least one approach for determining what type of conduct is involved in the \u201ctypical\u201d case that cannot be reconciled with either <em>Mayer </em>or <em>Terrell. </em>In <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 692, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), the government attempted to show that typically, failure to report to a penal institution involves violence and aggression by citing three cases clearly associating such violence and aggression with the offense. The Court rejected this flimsy evidence, relying instead on a Sentencing Commission report identifying <em>every federal case </em>over a period of two years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\"><em>Chambers </em>teaches that we should rely on empirical data when determining whether an offense \u201ctypically involve[s] purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Without such objective evidence we are left with nothing but a panel\u2019s gut instinct as to what constitutes a violent felony; or worse, comparison to inapposite statutes from other states. The law of our circuit, when it comes to the ACC A, will turn on the arbitrary composition of the panel hearing each case. This can\u2019t be what Congress intended when it passed a uniform sentencing scheme for armed career offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\"><em>Terrell\u2019s </em>license to ignore objective indicia as to whether the offense typically involves violent and aggressive conduct has now been officially sanctioned by our court. This will only lead to more decisions like it. Already, our court has held that a theft statute encompassing pickpocketing constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Alderman, </em>601 F.3d 949, 953-54 (9th Cir.2010); <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>97 Wash.App. 1055 (1999) (per curiam) (unpublished) (upholding a conviction under the theft statute at issue in <em>Alderman </em>where one teenager took twenty dollars from another teenager without his permission); <em>see also </em>Thomas W. Hutchison et al., Federal Sentencing Law and Practice 1409 (2010) (questioning whether offenses such as pickpocketing should be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the residual clause absent empirical evidence that the offense will result in physical injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-11\">The insidious nature of the panel\u2019s treatment of the residual clause is even clearer in the panel\u2019s treatment of burglary under Arizona and Missouri law. The panel recognized that burglary under Arizona and Missouri law is defined more broadly than generic burglary. Neither burglary statute limits itself to unmovable structures, which is what the generic definition requires. See <em>Grisel, </em>488 F.3d at 848-49. Arizona\u2019s statute does not even require unlawful entry. <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. Despite these categorical differences, the panel holds that a state burglary offense, no matter how much it may stray from the generic definition, is <em>categorically </em>\u201calmost always\u201d a violent felony. <em>See Terrell, </em>593 F.3d at 1095. Our refusal to rehear this case means that we are developing a \u201ccatch all categorical approach,\u201d one which renders superfluous the question whether the state offense meets the enumerated offense\u2019s generic definition. <em>See also United States v. Matthews, </em>374 F.3d 872, 876 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201c[E]ven though certain conduct (whether defined categorically or by a modified categorical approach) may present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, it may still be excluded under the [residual] clause if including it would render the inclusion of the [enumerated offense] surplusage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">If the state offense of conviction is missing critical elements of the enumerated offense\u2019s generic definition that make the offense inherently violent, the state offense clearly cannot \u201calmost always\u201d categorically involve the same purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct as the enumerated offense. When the Supreme Court held in <em>Begay </em>that the enumerated offenses all typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, it did so in light of those offenses\u2019 generic definitions. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 145, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (generieally defining burglary, arson, and extortion). In other words, a burglar who commits generic burglary, i.e., who enters a building unlawfully with intent to commit a crime, evinces \u201cpurposeful,\u201d \u201cviolent,\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d conduct. That\u2019s not necessarily true for a burglar who enters lawfully. Nobody would suggest that shoplifting is violent and aggressive, but the panel decision will likely send some felons to prison for 15 years because they got caught shoplifting in the past. <em>See State v. Belcher, </em>161 Ariz. 133, 776 P.2d 811, 812 (1989) (\u201cThe requisite intent to commit burglary may be formed after a person enters a store in all innocence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">The panel reasons that the distinction between lawful and unlawful entry is inconsequential, since the Court in <em>James </em>held that attempted burglary, which requires no entry at all, posed the same risks as generic burglary. <em>See Terrell, </em>593 F.3d at 1094-95. But the panel\u2019s cursory analysis ignores the fundamental role of this particular missing element. In <em>James, </em>the Court noted that \u201c[a]U burglaries begin as attempted burglaries,\u201d and explained that attempted burglaries \u2014 that is, attempts to enter a building <em>unlawfully </em>\u2014 where the offender is apprehended before he completes the burglary, may present an even greater risk than the typical completed burglary. <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 204, 127 S.Ct. 1586. For support, the Court relied on the fact that the Sentencing Guidelines include attempt crimes in its definition of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d a \u201cjudgment ... based on the Commission\u2019s review of empirical sentencing data and presumably reflecting] an assessment that attempt crimes often pose a similar risk of injury as completed offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 127 S.Ct. 1586.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the Court in <em>James </em>reasoned that attempting to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>unlawfully perhaps poses an even greater risk of injury than entering unlawfully and seeing the burglary through to its completion. It doesn\u2019t support the panel\u2019s theory, which we\u2019ve now endorsed by refusing to rehear this case. Unlike the Court in <em>James, </em>the panel here provides no \u201cempirical sentencing data\u201d to support its view that Arizona\u2019s burglary offense is \u201ceven more like generic burglary than the statute in <em>James.\u201d Terrell, </em>593 F.3d at 1095. All we have is the panel\u2019s gut instinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">The panel\u2019s decision does not just allow future panels to ignore the presence of the ACCA\u2019s enumerated offenses. It also does the same for those crimes the Sentencing Commission has listed as prototypical \u201ccrime[s] of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d nearly identically to the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), <em>with </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). As a result, we have always interpreted the two provisions \u201cin a parallel manner,\u201d <em>see, e.g., United States v. Jennings, </em>515 F.3d 980, 990 n. 11 (9th Cir.2008), and recently held that \u201cthe same analysis the Court applied in <em>Begay </em>\u201d controls whether an offense constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Guideline \u00a7 4B1.2, <em>United States v. Coronado, </em>603 F.3d 706, 710 (9th Cir.2010). Indeed, as discussed above, the Court has turned to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in the Sentencing Guidelines for support in determining what constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 206-07, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">In addition to the four enumerated crimes that appear at the beginning of the residual clause, the Application Notes to section 4B1.2 enumerate additional \u201ccrime[s] of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.l. The Guidelines provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AObr\">\u201cCrime of violence\u201d includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, <em>forcible sex offenses, </em>robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted involved use of explosives (including any explosive material or destructive device) or, by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n.l (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>ejusdem generis </em>analysis in <em>Begay, </em>we must read these offenses as \u201climiting the crimes that [the residual clause] covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The the list of enumerated offenses \u201cindicates that the statute covers only <em>similar </em>crimes, rather than <em>every </em>crime that \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142, 128 S.Ct. 1581.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-11\">In its list of offenses, the Sentencing Commission tells us that \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d are to be considered crimes of violence. In <em>United States v. Beltran-Munguia, </em>489 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir. 2007), we held that the term \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d in the Sentencing Guidelines requires the use of <em>force. </em>There, we examined a conviction for sexual abuse under Oregon law. We held that it was not a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because the Oregon offense, like the Arizona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>offense at issue in <em>Terrell, </em>required merely a lack of consent, which could be proven if the victim was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless. <em>Id. </em>at 1046. Although our court later held that \u201c[forcible sex offenses ... require more force than that inherent to penetration but need not require violent force,\u201d <em>United States v. Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>492 F.3d 1140, 1146 (9th Cir.2007), we still require a \u201cshowing that the defendant has used or attempted at least some level of force on the victim,\u201d <em>id. </em>Arizona requires neither force \u2014 violent or not \u2014 nor penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">The panel thus introduces a serious incongruity between our circuit law on the ACCA\u2019s residual clause and the Sentencing Guidelines: To qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d must -involve at least some level of force; yet as a result of the panel\u2019s opinion, sex offenses that do not require any force will somehow qualify as both \u201cviolent felonies\u201d and \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d because they \u201cotherwise involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). Such a result is both irrational, and irreconcilable with <em>Be-gay. </em>There the Court\u2019s majority \u201crejected the approach of the dissent, which would have analyzed the risk of harm posed by the behavior without regard for whether the defendant\u2019s crime involved \u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Christensen, </em>559 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">In contrast, the holdings of <em>Beltran-Munguia </em>and <em>Bolanos-Hemandez </em>are entirely consistent with <em>Begay </em>and <em>James. </em>For a sexual offense to constitute a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d it must include \u201cat least some level of force on the victim.\u201d <em>Bolanos-Hernandez, </em>492 F.3d at 1146. Such a requirement ensures that the offender engaged in \u201cpurposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct,\u201d and \u201ceffeetuate[s] Congress\u2019 purpose to punish only a particular subset of offender, namely career criminals.\u201d <em>Be-gay, </em>553 U.S. at 147, 128 S.Ct. 1581. And as the Court explained in <em>James </em>with respect to attempt crimes, the Commission\u2019s decision to include \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d as the type of sexual offense it considers to be a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d reflects its considered view that \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d involve the requisite degree of risk and accompanying violence. <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 206-07, 127 S.Ct. 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">While the residual clause covers crimes not enumerated in the statute, <em>Begay </em>makes clear that the list of enumerated offenses \u201cindicates that the statute covers only <em>similar </em>crimes.\u201d 553 U.S. at 142, 128 S.Ct. 1581. An offense that does not require force, the threat of force, or sexual penetration, is simply not similar to a \u201cforcible sex offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">The panel has effectively rendered the residual clause a catch <em>all </em>clause, potentially turning every recidivist into a violent, armed career criminal for sentencing purposes. The categorical approach we once used uniformly has been expanded beyond recognition, without regard to the offenses meant to limit its scope. The tail, according to the panel, now officially wags the dog. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">. Indeed, the panel\u2019s interpretation of the role of \u201ctypicality\u201d in this analysis draws the wrong lesson from <em>Begay. </em>\u201cTypical\u201d does not mean we can ignore the definition of the state offense. It relates to conduct covered by the <em>elements </em>of the state offense \"in the ordinary case,\u201d <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, rather than some hypothetical case \u201cin which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of physical injuiy,\u201d <em>id. </em>One would think that if the Supreme Court meant to depart in <em>Begay </em>from this longstanding understanding of <em>Taylors </em>categorical approach, it would stop relying on the same cases over and over again when explaining how to apply it. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 141, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (citing <em>Taylor), id. </em>(citing <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208-09, 127 S.Ct. 1586, for the proposition that an offense \"is a violent felony even if, on <em>some </em>occasions, it can be committed in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm\u201d); <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 207-09, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (explaining that <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>categorical approach does not \"requir[e] that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony\u201d and citing <em>DuenasAlvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815); <em>id. </em>at 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (\"[T]he proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the <em>elements of the offense, </em>in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815 (\u201c[T]o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute\u2019s language. It requires a realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime. To show that realistic probability, an offender, of course, may show that the statute was so applied in his own case. But he must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">. At the very least, we should be pointing to an illustrative list of cases, <em>from the jurisdiction in question, </em>to show that the state offense is the kind of serious felony Congress intended to merit sentencing enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">. The Court's reliance on empirical data provides further support for the notion that we should be employing such information in determining which crimes should be categorized as violent felonies. Indeed, relying on a 1992 opinion by then-Chief Judge Breyer, the <em>James </em>Court explained that \"the Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between a particular offense and the likelihood of accompanying violence.\u201d 550 U.S. at 206, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
