No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-17\">During a period of supervised release following his conviction for several federal drug offenses, Saingerard resided in an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement processing center. While there, he punched an officer and bit off a portion of the officer\u2019s little finger. Saingerard was indicted on one count of assaulting a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-18\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for a hearing on Saingerard\u2019s competency to stand trial. At the hearing, two experts presented conflicting evidence. Dr. Heather Holmes, testifying on behalf of Saingerard, asserted that he suffered from a delusional disorder with associated depression that could affect his ability to assist in his own defense. Dr. Rodolfo Buigas, testifying on behalf of the government, asserted that Saingerard suffered from a paranoid personality disorder but that this disorder did not affect his ability to understand the legal process and to assist in his defense. At the district court\u2019s request, both parties submitted memoranda and proposed orders on the issue of Saingerard\u2019s competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-19\">After considering the evidence and the parties\u2019 memoranda, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>determined that Saingerard was able to understand the legal process, relay information to his lawyer, and assist in decisionmaking. Thus, the court determined that he was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Saingerard later moved to renew his motion to be declared incompetent. The court responded by ordering additional psychological testing. At a second competency hearing, the court reviewed the results of the additional testing as well as the evidence presented at the first hearing and again determined that Saingerard was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">At trial, a jury convicted Saingerard of the charged offense. Saingerard has appealed, arguing the district court erred in crediting the testimony of the government\u2019s expert and that the court\u2019s own observations supported a finding that Saingerard lacked competency to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of \u201c \u2018competency to stand trial as a factfinding subject to reversal only for clear error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Izquierdo, </em>448 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1371 (11th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-8\">A person is incompetent to stand trial if \u201cthere is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a); <em>see also Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">Saingerard was given ample opportunity to demonstrate incompetence to stand trial. The district court did not commit clear error in considering the conflicting expert testimony and crediting one view over the other. \u201c \u2018Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u2019\u201d <em>Izquierdo, </em>448 F.3d at 1278 (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Because the district court did not clearly err in its determination that Saingerard was competent to stand trial, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
