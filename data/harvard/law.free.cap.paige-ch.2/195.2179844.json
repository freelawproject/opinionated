In 1825, Mr. Harison made and published his will, and thereby devised all his estate, real arid personal to his executors, T. L. Ogden, W. Johnson and B. Robinson, upon- the trusts therein mentioned. The first trust expressed in the. will was, that the executors and trustees, either personally or by attorney, should execute all proper deeds, and -take proper measures for, fulfilling all contracts entered into by the testator, or by themselves,,for the sale of any part, of the testator\u2019s-real estate. The will, after specifying other trusts, contained the following clause : \u201cAnd whereas, it may happen that one or more of my executors may die before me, or decline to execute the said trusts, I do hereby declare that, if only one of them should die, or decline the said trusts, that the remaining two shall and may nominate another person whom they may think-fit, to be the third executor and trustee. - But if two of \" my said trustees\" should die, or decline to execute the said trust's, that then my \u25a0 sons, or a majority of them, shall and may nominate one person, and my daughters, or a ma-. jority of them, another, who if approved of by the then executor, shall become executors and trustees under this my will. And if all the said before niimed executors shall die before me, or decline to execute the said trusts, then and in such case two other persons, may be-chosen by my sons and daughters respectively, as aforesaid, to be executors and', trustees under my1 will; and the said two persons may nominate 'and choose a third to be joined with them in the execution of'the said'trust's. And in every case the person or persons to be so nominated and chosen, as aforesaid, shall take, have arid possess all the estate, rights and powers, and be subject to all the duties which any of the trustees' named in this my will would have, or be entitled or subject to, as fully and \u00e9f-, fectually as if they, had been named.as trustee and executor, or trustees and executors, in and by my said will.\u201d In 1827, -and after the aforesaid contract was made with the defendant, the testator made and published a codicil to his. will, and in such codicil nominated and appointed his friend Clement C. Moore and his son William H. Haris\u00f3n executors of the will, and .trustees under it, with all the powers which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>been conferred upon his other executors ; and he thereby republished the original with the said codicil annexed. The testator died in December, 1829, seised of the land contracted to be sold to the defendant. Four of the executors and trustees in February last proved the will; and W* Johnson, the remaining executor and trustee, renounced in the manner prescribed by the revised statutes. The whole of the purchase money, which the defendant agreed to pay for the land, became due on the first of February last. The complainants tendered to the defendant a deed, executed by themselves and all the heirs at law of the testator, containing the usual covenants of warranty as to the title, and demanded from the defendant payment of the purchase money. The defendant refused to accept the deed, or to pay the purchase money, upon the ground that no person had been substituted as executor and trustee in the place of W. Johnson, either by the two other executors named in the original will, or by all the executors who had qualified; contending that the deed would not be valid, unless some person was thus substituted as executor and trustee, and joined in the conveyance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-8\"><em>W.

That he had either altered his mind as to the number of executors and trustees, or had intended to provide against the contingency of vacancies by increasing the num- &gt; ber of executors and trustees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b197-9\"><em>T. W. Ludlow, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b197-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ANS\">The true construction of this will and codicil, taken together, appears to be this: By the original will the te.stator intended that three executors should actually accept the trust; and if any of those named by him declined, provision was made to supply the vacancies.' In the codicil two others are added, without any new direction as to supplying vacancies if any of them should renounce the execution of the .will. The original intention of the testator will therefore be carried into effect by permitting any num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ber of the executors, not less than three, to qualify and execute the trust. If three or more of them had renounced, the number must* have been increased, so as to complete that number-in the manner specified in the original will. But as' four have qualified, there is no necessity of supplying the place of the fifth, who has renounced the trust. The\" learned commentator on American law, in the last volume of his valu able treatise which has just been- published, supposes that the provision authorizing the executors who prove the will to convey without the others has been repealed in the recent revision. (4 Kent\u2019s Commentaries, ,320.) And he very .properly declares such an alteration of the law to be injudicious. His opinion is founded upon the construction of the 106th and 112th sections of that title of the revised statutes which treats of the nature and qualities of estates in real property, and the alienation thereof. (1 R. S. 735.) But he has evidently over-, looked the fifty-fifth section of the subsequent title, relating to the powers and duties of executors, &amp;c. in which the provision of the statute of 21 Hen. 8, ch. 4, is re-enacted, almost in the same words as in the former statutes of\u2019this state. (2 R. S. 109, \u00a7 55.) The 15th and 16th- sections of the title, relative to the granting of-letters testamentary and of administration, (2 R. S. 71,) declare the executors\" who do not prove the will, and who are not named as such in the letters testamentary or of administration, to be superseded thereby, until they shall appear and qualify; and they are prohibited from disposing of any part of the estate. These provisions limit and control the 112th section of the article relative to powers contained in a preceding part of .the revision. The power in- that case is only vested in the executors who prove the will,\" and they must all join in the execution of the power. In this case the power to execute conveyances, given by, the will to the executors, was duly executed by those to whom letters testamentary -were granted since the revised statutes went into operation. Their deed conveyed a good and valid title to the purchaser, and he is bound to accept the same and to pay the balance due agreeably- to. \u00a1\u00a3he contract . \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
