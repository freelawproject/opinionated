At the detention hearing, the juvenile court ordered Jesusa to be placed with Paul B., the mother\u2019s husband and the father of her five other children.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Paul, who was married to the mother at the time Jesusa was bom and who had received the child into his home and had held her out as his own, promptly requested a declaration that he was Jesusa\u2019s presumed father. (Fam. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Code, \u00a7 7611, subds. (a), (d).) Nine days later, Heriberto also filed a request to be declared the presumed father. The juvenile court ordered the Los Angeles County Sheriff to produce Heriberto, who was incarcerated, for the hearing to identify the presumed father and to adjudicate the dependency petition. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625.) In the interim, however, Heriberto had been convicted of the rape and moved from the county jail to North Kern State Prison, rendering the court\u2019s transfer order ineffective. The hearing went forward in Heriberto\u2019s absence but in the presence of his attorney. At that hearing, the juvenile court declared that Paul was Jesusa\u2019s presumed father<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under Family Code section 7612 and found that Jesusa was a dependent of the court under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivisions (a) and (b). With the mother\u2019s consent, the court maintained Jesusa\u2019s placement with Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">This set of facts presents three principal issues: Did the juvenile court err in mating a declaration of presumed fatherhood at a hearing conducted in Heriberto\u2019s absence but in the presence of his attorney? If not, did the juvenile court err in declaring Paul\u2014instead of Heriberto, the biological father\u2014to be Jesusa\u2019s presumed father? And, in any event, did the juvenile court err in adjudicating the dependency petition while Heriberto was absent but his counsel was present? We find that the juvenile court erred only in adjudicating the dependency petition in Heriberto\u2019s absence, but that the error was harmless. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">On April 1, 2001, Jesusa V., who was not yet two years old, was taken into protective custody after her biological father, Heriberto C., raped and beat her mother. The mother, who was seven months pregnant with Heriberto\u2019s child, was hospitalized. The Long Beach police officers who arrested Heriberto reported that the motor home where the three were residing was filthy and unsuitable to live in.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) thereafter filed a dependency petition that, as modified, alleged that Heriberto had a long history of violent and aggressive behavior, that Heriberto had raped and beaten Jesusa\u2019s mother, that at that time and on other occasions Jesusa had been \u201cexposed to violent confrontations\u201d between her mother and Heriberto, and that her mother had failed to take action to protect the child. Jurisdiction was alleged under subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Heriberto was in jail at the time of the detention hearing on April 4, 2001, and did not appear. Jesusa\u2019s mother appeared at the hearing with her husband, Paul B. The couple had been married for nearly 18 years, although they had lived apart for the preceding three years. They had five children together. Paul, who was a sergeant in the United States Air Force in San Diego, promptly requested presumed father status under Family Code section 7611 and asked that Jesusa be placed with him and her five half siblings. The. mother supported both requests and declared in writing that Paul, as well as Heriberto, had held himself out as Jesusa\u2019s father and had accepted her into his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Paul testified that Jesusa had lived with him from time to time when her mother came to San Diego to visit her other children and that her most recent visit had been a month earlier. The juvenile court found a prima facie basis to detain Jesusa and released her to Paul\u2019s custody. The court also made a tentative finding, subject to later rebuttal, that Paul was Jesusa\u2019s presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">When Heriberto appeared in court about a week later, counsel was appointed to represent him. Heriberto denied the allegations in the petition and announced <em>his </em>intent to seek presumed father status. The juvenile court issued a removal order (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625) for Heriberto to attend a hearing on April 30, 2001, on presumed fatherhood. The court also advised counsel to brief the matter and to consider having Heriberto file a supporting declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">On April 30, the juvenile court continued the matter to July 17, 2001, and again issued a removal order for Heriberto.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">On May 21, 2001, in a separate criminal proceeding, Heriberto pleaded no contest to one count of raping Jesusa\u2019s mother on the night in question and was sentenced to three years in prison with an immigration hold. Because of an intervening transfer to North Kern State Prison, however, the juvenile court\u2019s removal order directed to the Los Angeles County Sheriff was ineffective. Heriberto therefore was not present when the parties reconvened on July 17. Counsel objected and asked for another continuance, asserting that proceeding in Heriberto\u2019s absence would violate due process. The court, after remarking that it had been under the impression the issue of paternity \u201cwould be fully decided on the briefs and argument on the briefs\u201d without taking testimony (and observing that Heriberto had indeed filed such a brief), inquired of counsel what testimony Heriberto could provide. Counsel\u2019s response described evidence that encompassed \u201cthe extent in which [Heriberto] held out paternity, publicly acknowledged paternity for Jesusa, and formal steps he [took] to identify [her as his daughter to] . . . government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>agencies\u201d as well as the truth or falsity of the allegations of domestic violence in the dependency petition. The court then explained that, to resolve the issue of presumed fatherhood, it would not be making a finding as to the truth of the allegations in the petition and would consider only the mother\u2019s statements that she had on occasion sought refuge with her husband, Paul. The court also credited the representations made by counsel\u2014i.e., that Heriberto was Jesusa\u2019s biological father, that he had held himself out as her father, and that he had received the child into his home. Accordingly, the court denied the request for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">After observing that either man\u2014Heriberto or Paul\u2014thus qualified as a presumed father, the juvenile court found the weightier interest favored Paul, who had been married to Jesusa\u2019s mother at the time Jesusa was conceived and bom; who was still married to Jesusa\u2019s mother; who had held himself out as Jesusa\u2019s father, had received her into his home, and had treated her as his own; who was the father of Jesusa\u2019s five half siblings, all of whom still lived with him and also had developed a bond with Jesusa; and who had lived with Jesusa for a significant period in her young life. \u201cIn other words, there is so much more to being a father than merely planting the biological seed. The man who provides the stability, nurturance, family ties, permanence, is more important to a child than the man who has mere biological ties. ... HD By finding [Paul] is the presumed father, this court is protecting and preserving a family unit, the integrity of a family unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The juvenile court then proceeded to adjudicate the dependency petition, again over counsel\u2019s objection that Heriberto was absent. Based on several DCFS reports, the arrest report, and the police follow-up report, the court sustained the dependency petition, maintained Jesusa in Paul\u2019s custody, permitted the mother to have unmonitored visits with her child and granted her reunification services, and ordered Heriberto to have no contact with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Heriberto appealed. The Court of Appeal affirmed in part and reversed in part in a published opinion. The appellate court affirmed the order identifying Paul as Jesusa\u2019s presumed father but reversed the order sustaining the dependency petition, reasoning that the lower court had lacked jurisdiction under Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d) to adjudicate the petition in Heriberto\u2019s absence. Because this construction of section 2625 created a conflict with two other published decisions, <em>In re Rikki D. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1624 [278 Cal.Rptr. 565] <em>(Rikki </em>D.) and <em>In re Axsana S. </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 262 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 701] <em>(Axsana S.), </em>and presented other important issues concerning presumed fatherhood, we granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Although Heriberto was represented by counsel at the presumed fatherhood hearing, he claims the trial court violated Penal Code section 2625 and due process by proceeding in his absence. The Court of Appeal, relying on the fact that Heriberto was represented at the hearing by counsel, correctly rejected this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Penal Code section 2625 requires a court to order a prisoner-parent\u2019s temporary removal and production before the court <em>only </em>\u201cwhere the proceeding seeks to terminate the parental rights of [the] prisoner\u201d under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26 or Family Code section 7800 et seq. or \u201cto adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subds. (b), (d); see <em>In re Barry W. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 358, 368-369 &amp; fn. 7 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 161].) A proceeding to identify the presumed father, which seeks merely to identify the man who has a legal entitlement to reunification services and/or custody <em>(In re Zacharia D. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 435, 439 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 862 P.2d 751]), is neither of these. Even after a presumed father is declared, the biological father retains \u201cparental rights that simply differ in degree [from] the parental rights conferred on a presumed father.\u201d <em>(Francisco G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 586, 596 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 679].) Hence, Heriberto\u2019s contention that the declaration of presumed fatherhood is tantamount to a termination of his parental rights is exaggerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">The hearing on presumed fatherhood was governed instead by Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (e): \u201cIn any <em>other </em>action or proceeding in which a prisoner\u2019s parental or marital rights are subject to adjudication, an order for the prisoner\u2019s temporary removal from the institution and for the prisoner\u2019s production before the court <em>may </em>be made by the superior court of the county in which the action or proceeding is pending . . . .\u201d (Italics added; see generally <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 908, 920 [132 Cal.Rptr. 405, 553 P.2d 565].) Because the trial court has discretion whether to order the prisoner\u2019s removal in this category of cases, \u201cit follows that such a case may proceed without attendance by the prisoner-parent.\u201d <em>(In re Barry W, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at p. 370.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The record demonstrates the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in proceeding without Heriberto\u2019s personal attendance at the presumed fatherhood hearing. <em>(In re Barry W., supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 370-371.) When asked what testimony Heriberto could have provided, counsel\u2019s offer encompassed only evidence that established Heriberto\u2019s threshold qualifications for presumed father status\u2014i.e., \u201cthe extent in which [Heriberto] held out paternity, publicly acknowledged paternity for Jesusa, and the formal steps he [took] to identify [her as his daughter to] . . . government agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, the court announced that it did not intend to determine \u201cwhat [Heriberto] has done with regard to filling out documents with public agencies or government agencies or whatever he has done to confirm that he holds himself out as to the father\u201d but would instead <em>assume </em>that Heriberto had held himself out as the father and did receive the child into his home. Since the court then declared that <em>\u201cboth </em>of these men or <em>either </em>of these men could be found to be presumed fathers,\u201d Heriberto\u2019s testimony became unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s approach was also consistent with the California Rules of Court, which permit a determination of paternity without an evidentiary hearing. \u201cThe court may make its determination of paternity or nonpaternity based on the testimony, declarations, or statements of the mother and alleged father.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413(e)(2).) In this case, for example, the court advised the parties to brief the issue of presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>fatherhood\u2014which Heriberto did\u2014and instructed Heriberto\u2019s counsel \u201cto consider having him file a declaration.\u201d That Heriberto failed to file a declaration\u2014and that he still has not identified any critical testimony he could have offered (see Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 388, subd. (a)) or explained why it could not have been offered by other witnesses or by documentary evidence\u2014does not create a statutory right for him to personally attend the hearing on his presumed father status.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Heriberto\u2019s constitutional claim fares no better. Although there is no dispute that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts <em>(Payne v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 914) and that \u201cabsent a countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given a meaningful opportunity to be heard\u201d <em>(Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1971) 401 U.S. 371, 377 [28 L.Ed.2d 113, 91 S.Ct. 780]), it does not follow that prisoners have a constitutional right to be <em>personally present </em>at every type of hearing. Due process guarantees \u201c \u2018notice and opportunity for hearing <em>appropriate to the nature of the case.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 378, italics added.) As we have observed, due process entitles a biological father a meaningful opportunity to qualify as a presumed father. <em>(Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 840, 843, 849, 4 Cal.Rptr2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216.) Yet, as with other due process rights, \u201c[h]ow that is to be achieved is to be determined by the exercise of discretion by the trial court.\u201d <em>(Payne, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In this case, Heriberto was appointed an attorney to represent him at the presumed fatherhood hearing\u2014an accommodation we have deemed sufficient for prisoners in other civil proceedings. <em>{Payne </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at pp. 923-925.) Through his attorney, Heriberto had the opportunity to call witnesses, to cross-examine adverse witnesses, and to present his own testimony in written form. Admittedly, he did not present any witnesses or submit such a declaration\u2014but Heriberto must also acknowledge that his rape conviction rendered it improbable the court would have ordered reunification services (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.5, subds. (b)(12), (c)) and his incarceration made successful reunification all but impossible. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 361.5, subds. (a)(2), (e)(1); see <em>In re Maria S. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1313 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 30].) In addition, Heriberto has not identified any facts that could have been presented only through his live testimony. (See, e.g., Fam. Code, \u00a7 7574, subd. (b)(1) [mother\u2019s signature is required for a voluntary declaration of paternity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Moreover, it appears that Heriberto was absent for only a portion of the presumed father hearing. Heriberto <em>was </em>present in court on April 13, when the court asked, \u201cDo you want to be heard on any paternity issues today?\u201d His attorney promptly responded that he \u201cdid discuss the matter\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Heriberto, who stated that he had lived with Jesusa\u2019s mother for three years, that he had held the child out as his own, and that he would be asking \u201cfor presumed [father] status.\u201d The court invited counsel to brief the issue, consider having Heriberto file a declaration, and \u201cbe prepared, then, to <em>argue </em>that matter on April 30th.\u201d On April 30, when Heriberto was again present, the court noted that it had recently received a brief from the minor in response to Heriberto\u2019s brief and was inclined to continue the matter. No party objected. On July 17, when the parties discovered that Heriberto\u2019s imprisonment had rendered the transfer order ineffective, the court made plain its understanding, based on the foregoing, \u201cthat the issue of paternity would be fully decided on the briefs and argument on the briefs. No testimony to be taken.\u201d Under the circumstances, we cannot say that Heriberto\u2019s involuntary physical absence from that final stage deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Our conclusion is consistent with the case law. In <em>Axsana S., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th 262, for example, the incarcerated father claimed a violation of due process when the juvenile court conducted a dispositional hearing on the dependency petition and denied him reunification services, while his attorney was present but he was absent. The Court of Appeal held that the father \u201creceived meaningful access to the courts through his appointed counsel. In dependency cases, as in other civil cases, personal appearance by a party is not essential; appearance by an attorney is sufficient and equally effective.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 269; see also <em>In re Dolly D. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 440, 445 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 691].) Heriberto, like the father in <em>Axsana S., </em>\u201chas cited no case law providing incarcerated parents a due process right to be present at dependency proceedings involving their children.\u201d <em>(Axsana S., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 270.) To the contrary, other state courts have \u201crepeatedly held that the due process rights of a prisoner who has been prohibited from participating in a custody hearing are not violated where the prisoner was represented by counsel at the hearing and was neither denied an opportunity to present testimony in some form on his behalf nor denied the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.\u201d <em>(Cook v. Boyd </em>(E.D.Pa. 1995) 881 ESupp. 171, 175; see also <em>In re T.N.T. </em>(2002) 258 Ga.App. 396 [574 S.E.2d 444, 446-447].)</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Accordingly, Heriberto was not denied any statutory or constitutional rights when the juvenile court proceeded to determine his presumed father status while his attorney was present but he was absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">As the juvenile court recognized, both Paul and Heriberto satisfied the qualifications for presumed fatherhood under Family Code section 7611,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the relevant provision of the Uniform Parentage Act (\u00a7\u00a7 7600-7730, hereafter UPA). Paul qualified under section 7611, subdivision (a), in that Jesusa was bom during his marriage to the mother, as well as subdivision (d), in that he had received the child into his home and openly held her out as his child. Heriberto qualified under subdivision (d) in that he too had received Jesusa into his home and openly held her out as his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Although more than one individual may fulfill the statutory criteria that give rise to a presumption of paternity, \u201cthere can be only one presumed father.\u201d <em>(In re Kiana A. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1115 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 669] <em>(Kiana A.); Brian C. v. Ginger K. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1223 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 294].) How those competing presumptions are to be reconciled is set forth in section 7612: \u201c(a) Except as provided in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 7540) and Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 7570) of Part 2 or in Section 20102, a presumption under Section 7611 is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence. [][] (b) If two or more presumptions arise under Section 7611 which conflict with each other, the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls. [f] (c) The presumption trader Section 7611 is rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Heriberto claims that his biological paternity constitutes clear and convincing evidence rebutting Paul\u2019s claim to presumed fatherhood under section 7612, subdivision (a). In the alternative, he claims that even if Paul\u2019s claim to presumed fatherhood is not rebutted, it is outweighed by Heriberto\u2019s claim under section 7612, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">In <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 56 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 146, 46 P.3d 932] <em>(Nicholas H.), </em>we considered whether a presumption of fatherhood arising under section 7611 is necessarily rebutted under section 7612, subdivision (a) when, as here, the presumed father admits that he is not the biological father of the child. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>at p. 58.) We held, in accordance with several Court of Appeal cases, \u201cthat a presumption arising under section 7611(d) is <em>not, </em>under section 7612(a), necessarily rebutted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>clear and convincing evidence that the presumed father is not the biological father of the child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Our holding was based on the text of section 7612. We observed first that subdivision (a) provides merely that a presumption under section 7611 \u201c <em>\u2018may </em>be rebutted <em>in an appropriate action </em>only by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 63.) Accordingly, the statute did not contemplate a reflexive rule that biological paternity would rebut the section 7611 presumption in all cases, without concern for whether rebuttal was \u201cappropriate\u201d in the particular circumstances. We found additional support in section 7612, subdivision (b), which directs the juvenile court confronted with conflicting presumptions to prefer the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic. \u201cAs a matter of statutory construction, if the Legislature had intended that a man who is not a biological father cannot be a presumed father under section 7611, it would not have provided for such weighing, for among two competing claims for presumed father status under section 7611, there can be only one biological father.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 63.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">V_As Heriberto points out, however, <em>Nicholas H. </em>involved-affliction in which no\" otfier man claimed parental rights to the^ehilS. The biological father, unlike Heriberto, had not come forwatdMtf'assert his parental rights and could not be locat\u00e9d: <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 61.) We therefore found it unnecessary td'consider whether, under section 7612, \u201cbiological paternity by,a-competing presumptive father necessarily defeats a nonbiological father\u2019s presumption of paternity.\u2019\u2019. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>at p. 70.).. <em>Nicholas H. </em>to this question, we now find that biological paternity by a competing presumed father does not necessarily defeat ani father\u2019s presumption of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">As we observed in <em>Nicholas H., </em>the text of section 7612, subdivision (a) does not articulate a categorical rule detailing when the section 7611 presumption of paternity is rebutted, but instead provides only that the presumption \u201c <em>\u2018may\u2019 \u201d </em>be rebutted \u201c <em>\u2018in an appropriate action.\u2019 \u201d (Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) This indicates that the Legislature did not envision an <em>automatic </em>preference for biological fathers, even if the biological father has come forward to assert his rights. Indeed, as noted above, \u201cif the Legislature had intended that a man who is not a biological father cannot be a presumed father under section 7611, it would not have provided for such weighing, for among two <em>competing </em>claims for presumed father status under section 7611, there can be only one biological father.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 63, italics added.) If, on the other hand, the Legislature had intended to restrict the weighing process under section 7612, subdivision (b) to disputes between competing <em>nonbiological </em>fathers, it could easily have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Our analysis in <em>Nicholas H. </em>also was informed by section 7575, subdivision (b), which \u201cpermits but does not require\u201d a court to rely on blood test evidence in deciding whether to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity signed on or before December 31, 1996. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 63.) We concluded: \u201cIt is unlikely the Legislature would\u2014without explicitly so stating\u2014adopt a contrary rule that blood test evidence . . . must defeat the claim of a person who claims presumed father status under section 7611(d).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64.) This analysis has equal application when the biological father has been identified and asserts a competing presumption of fatherhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Finally, <em>Nicholas H. </em>relied on case law from the Court of Appeal, which on balance supported the paternity presumption of the nonbiological father. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 64\u201470.) A review of the case law reveals that the weight of authority similarly supports the nonbiological father here.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In <em>Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 1109, as is the case here, two men qualified as presumed fathers under section 7611. The biological father contended the juvenile court should have ordered genetic testing \u201cbefore it commenced the weighing process of section 7612, subdivision (b), because one of the competing presumptions would have been rebutted based upon the results of the testing.\u201d <em>(Kiana A., supra, </em>at p. 1118.) The Court of Appeal rejected this contention not only on the ground that the biological father had failed to seek genetic testing in the juvenile court but also on the ground that even if he had preserved the issue, \u201cbiological paternity by a competing presumptive father does not necessarily defeat a nonbiological father\u2019s presumption of paternity.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>As support for its position (and in anticipation of our approach in <em>Nicholas H.), </em>the Court of Appeal focused on section 7612, subdivision (a), which \u201cstates a presumption of paternity <em>\u2018may </em>be rebutted <em>in an appropriate action only </em>by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 (Italics added.) Thus, although the results of genetic testing constitute clear and convincing evidence, it does not follow that such evidence will rebut the presumption in every case. Rather, the statute seeks to protect presumptions of paternity, once they have arisen, from being set aside except upon clear and convincing evidence and only in an appropriate case.\u201d <em>(Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1118-1119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\"><em>Kiana A. </em>also relied on <em>Steven W. v. Matthew S. </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1108 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 535], which upheld a finding of presumed fatherhood in favor of a man who had held out the child as his own, even though the competing presumed father was the child\u2019s biological father. \u201cThus, as between two men, both of whom qualify as presumptive fathers, biological paternity does not necessarily determine which presumption will prevail under section 7612.\u201d <em>(Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Heriberto cites only one case to the <em>contrary\u2014Brian C. v. Ginger K., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 1198\u2014but <em>Brian C. </em>does not go as far as he supposes. <em>Brian C. </em>involved a purported biological father who sought to challenge another man\u2019s \u201cconclusiveQ\u201d presumption of paternity (\u00a7 7540), which was based on his marital cohabitation with the mother during the child\u2019s conception. The <em>Brian C. </em>court found that because the purported biological father qualified as a presumed father, he had statutory standing to challenge the conclusive presumption. <em>(Brian C., supra, 11 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1220-1221.) In dictum (and as an aside), the court suggested that DNA tests on remand would \u201cprobably\u201d render \u201cmoot\u201d the .need to weigh competing presumptions under section 7612, subdivision (b). <em>(Brian C., supra, 11 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1222.) In the accompanying footnote, the court explained that \u201cDNA tests will certainly constitute clear and convincing evidence rebutting any of the presumptions that might favor either [presumed father], (Under subd. (a) of Fam. Code, \u00a7 7612, a presumption shown by \u00a7 7611 \u2018may be rebutted . . . only by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019)\u201d <em>(Brian C., supra, 11 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1222, fn. 20.) <em>Brian C., </em>which preceded our opinion in <em>Nicholas H., </em>did not quote\u2014and thus did not consider\u2014the critical language in section 7612, subdivision (a) that the paternity presumption may be rebutted only <em>in an appropriate case. </em>Moreover, its implicit suggestion that genetic tests might rebut the presumption in that particular case does not prove that biological paternity <em>always </em>rebuts the section 7611 presumption. (See also <em>Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1120 [distinguishing <em>Brian </em>C.].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we reject Heriberto\u2019s contention that biological paternity by a competing presumed father necessarily rebuts another man\u2019s presumption of paternity under section 7612, subdivision (a). A juvenile court confronted with such a claim must instead consider whether rebuttal of the presumption would be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. (Cf. <em>Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) This is a matter entrusted to the juvenile court\u2019s discretion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">No abuse of discretion occurred here. Paul has a substantial relationship with Jesusa. Not only is Paul married to Jesusa\u2019s mother, he also is the father of Jesusa\u2019s five half siblings, all of whom live with him and have themselves established a close relationship with Jesusa. Although Jesusa and her mother resided with Heriberto before his arrest and incarceration, they visited Paul at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>his house nearly every weekend. Paul also provided shelter to Jesusa and her mother during periods of conflict between the mother and Heriberto\u2014periods that sometimes lasted as long as a month. Inasmuch as Jesusa was less than two years old at the time Heriberto was arrested, Paul has plainly been involved in a substantial portion of the child\u2019s young life and considers Jesusa to be a part of his family. Moreover, the mother supported Paul\u2019s effort to be deemed the presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The sole facts offered to support Heriberto, on the other hand, were that he was Jesusa\u2019s biological father, that he had \u201creceived the child into his home and openly held himself out as [her] natural father,\u201d and that he had lived with Jesusa\u2019s mother prior to the conception and through her infancy. One must subtract, however, at least a three-month period in early 2000, when he was jailed in Colorado for assaulting the mother (and subsequently deported), as well as the period following his arrest and conviction for the current rape. During the remaining time, Jesusa\u2019s weekends\u2014as well as additional periods of refuge that lasted as long as a month\u2014were spent with Paul. Under the circumstances, the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion when it found this was not an appropriate action in which to rebut Paul\u2019s claim to presumed fatherhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Based on its finding that Heriberto and Paul each could claim a presumption of fatherhood, the juvenile court undertook to identify the presumption \u201cwhich on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b)) and determined that the scales favored Paul. We once again find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">At the outset, we reject the notion that the juvenile court was bound by section 7612, subdivision (b) to accord determinative weight to biology. This section, which derives from the UPA, nowhere states that biology is a <em>conclusive </em>consideration of policy and logic. <em>(Doe </em>v. <em>Doe </em>(2002) 99 Haw. 1 [52 P.3d 255, 262] [\u201cIf the genetic presumption \u2018controlled\u2019 as a matter of law, then [the statute] would plainly say so, and there would be no point in directing the court to consider which competing presumption \u2018on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic\u2019 \u201d].) Moreover, other states that have adopted the UPA have consistently declined to make biology determinative under their analogs to section 7612 when confronted by competing presumptions of paternity. In <em>N.A.H. </em>v. <em>S.L.S. </em>(Colo. 2000) 9 P.3d 354, for example, the Colorado Supreme Court found that \u201cneither the presumption of legitimacy nor the presumption based on biology is conclusive\u201d (i<em>d. </em>at p. 362) and held instead \u201cthat when presumptions of paternity arise in more than one potential father, trial courts must take the best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>of the child into account as part of policy and logic in resolving competing presumptions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 366.) In <em>Doe v. Doe, supra, </em>52 P.3d 255, the Hawai\u2019i Supreme Court similarly found that \u201cthe genetic testing presumption is not more important than the other presumptions; it is one of several that must be considered . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 262.) In <em>Witso v. Overby </em>(Minn. 2001) 627 N.W.2d 63, the Minnesota Supreme Court declared that even if genetic tests identified one man as the biological father, the court must nonetheless. \u201cweigh the conflicting presumptions, and \u2018the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 69; <em>Matter of Welfare of C.M.G. </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1994) 516 N.W.2d 555, 560 [\u201cWhere competing presumptions of paternity exists, the determination of paternity is no longer solely an issue of biological fact\u201d].) And, in <em>Love v. Love </em>(1998) 114 Nev. 572 [959 P.2d 523, 527], where only the husband\u2019s presumption was at issue and he sought to disclaim paternity on the ground he was not the biological father, the Nevada Supreme Court observed that \u201cwhere factors conflict, as they may here, the district court must use its discretion to apply considerations of policy and logic to the relevant evidence.\u201d In short, our construction\u2014which permits a court to consider <em>every </em>relevant consideration of policy and logic\u2014is in accord with every UPA state to have addressed the issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The juvenile court thus was obliged to weigh all relevant factors\u2014 including biology\u2014in determining which presumption was founded on weightier considerations of policy and logic. We conclude it did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The juvenile court found that Paul was married to Jesusa\u2019s mother; that they have five children together; that Jesusa had spent a \u201cconsiderable amount of time\u201d in Paul\u2019s home and had lived with him \u201cfor a significant amount of time during her young life\u201d; that Jesusa had established a bonding relationship with Paul as well as with her siblings, all of whom live with him; and that a family unit existed there to protect the child. The court also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>that Jesusa\u2019s mother often went to Paul\u2019s home to seek refuge from Heriberto\u2014a fact that tended to confirm which father \u201cprovides the safety and stability and welfare that this child is entitled to have, [f] [Paul] has assumed the parental rights and particularly assumed the parental responsibilities of this young child. He has lived with this child. He has treated her as his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The facts supporting Heriberto\u2019s presumption, on the other hand, were less weighty. The juvenile court found that Heriberto lived with the mother when the child was conceived and bom; that he was the biological father; and that he held himself out as Jesusa\u2019s father and received her into his home. Although the parties did not then have a copy of the judgment of conviction, the court did note the allegation of domestic violence the mother had lodged against Heriberto.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The juvenile court weighed the \u201ccompeting interests\u201d as follows: \u201c[T]he court must look to the state interests in rendering its decision. The state interests rest on the policy to preserve and protect developing parent/child relationships which give young children social and emotional strength and stability. This is more important than establishing biological ties, [f] In other words, there is so much more to being a father than merely planting the biological seed. The man who provides the stability, nurturance, family ties, permanence, is more important to a child than the man who has mere biological ties. [][] By finding [Paul] is the presumed father, this court is protecting and preserving a family unit, the integrity of the family unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Heriberto does not challenge the facts or the criteria on which the juvenile court relied. He claims instead that \u201cbecause Heriberto shares a biological connection to Jesusa <em>and </em>has at least an equal, if not greater, relationship with Jesusa than Paul ... the conflict between the paternity presumption[s] must be resolved based upon, biological paternity.\u201d As support, he relies on <em>Kiana </em>A., <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at page 1120, in which the Court of Appeal stated that \u201cwhere the weight of the interests of the competing presumptive fathers are in relatively equal balance, biological paternity might properly be relied upon to determine which presumption carried more weight.\u201d We find <em>Kiana A. </em>unhelpful to Heriberto for two reasons. First, <em>Kiana A. </em>stated only that biological paternity <em>might </em>be relied upon to determine paternity where the interests are otherwise in relatively equal balance, not (as Heriberto contends) that it <em>must </em>be so used. Second, the record here does not support Heriberto\u2019s characterization of his interests as equally balanced with Paul\u2019s. The juvenile court found Paul\u2019s interest to be the weightier one on the grounds that Jesusa had established a bond with Paul; that Paul was married to . Jesusa\u2019s mother, who continued to visit Paul regularly and to seek refuge with him as protection from Heriberto; and that Jesusa had established a bond with her five siblings, who also lived with Paul. (Cf. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 366.26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>subd. (c)(1)(E), 16002.) Heriberto, on the other hand, had a stormy relationship with Jesusa\u2019s mother and did not have custody of any of her other children. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine conduct more destructive of the parent-child relationship than Heriberto\u2019s violent rape of Jesusa\u2019s mother while Jesusa was present in the home. (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3020, subd. (a) [\u201cdomestic violence in a household where a child resides is detrimental to the child\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u25a0 That Heriberto had satisfied the minimum requirements to qualify as a presumed father under section 7611 did not compel a finding that his interests and Paul\u2019s were equally balanced under section 7612. Thus, even if the juvenile court <em>might </em>have relied on biological paternity to select between presumptions of equal value, such a rule would not have aided Heriberto.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Heriberto claims next that failing to accord determinative weight to his biological relationship to Jesusa violated his due process right to parent Jesusa. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Heriberto relies on <em>Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 816, in which we stated that a biological father\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process \u201cprohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 849.) What Heriberto fails to apprehend, though, is that the identification of another man as Jesusa\u2019s presumed father does not <em>terminate </em>Heriberto\u2019s parental relationship with the child. Indeed, neither Heriberto nor our dissenting colleagues cite anything to support their assertion that a declaration of Paul\u2019s presumed fatherhood has rendered Heriberto a legal stranger to the child. A declaration of presumed fatherhood entitles the presumed father to reunification services and custody of the child <em>(In re Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 439) but does not itself terminate the biological father\u2019s parental relationship with the child. <em>(Francisco G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th 586, 596.) Termination of parental rights requires further proceedings. (See Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7664, 7800 et seq.; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26; see generally <em>In re Malinda S. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 368, 383-384 [272 Cal.Rptr. 787, 795 P.2d 1244].) Hence, no showing of Heriberto\u2019s unfitness was required before Paul could be declared Jesusa\u2019s presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Moreover, it appears that Heriberto, who never executed a voluntary declaration of paternity or described any other steps to formalize his role before the dependency petition was filed, has not \u201c \u2018sufficiently and <em>timely </em>demonstrated a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2019 \u201d to merit constitutional protection. <em>(Adoption of Michael H. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1043, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>1055 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 898 P.2d 891].) Unlike the unwed biological father in <em>Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at page 822, who filed an action two days after the child\u2019s birth to establish his parental relationship with the child and was thwarted only because the court\u2019s order granting him custody was disobeyed, Heriberto was living with the child\u2019s mother and presumably could have obtained her cooperation with any legal steps to formalize his relationship to the child. (See \u00a7 7574, subd. (b)(1).) Yet the record does not reveal any steps he took to shoulder legal responsibility for the child until <em>after </em>he had raped the mother and the dependency petition was filed. <em>(Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849 [\u201cA court should also consider the father\u2019s . . . prompt legal action to seek custody of the child\u201d].) On this record, Heriberto has not demonstrated that he <em>\u201cpromptly </em>came forward and demonstrated as full a commitment to his parental responsibilities as the biological mother allowed and the circumstances permitted.\u201d <em>(Michael H., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1060, italics added; see also <em>Kelsey S., supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 838.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">To resolve Heriberto\u2019s alternate claim that denying him presumed father status unconstitutionally <em>interfered </em>with his right to parent Jesusa, we will first assume that Heriberto has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in maintaining his parent-child relationship with Jesusa. (Cf. <em>Dawn D. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 932, 942 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 871, 952 P.2d 1139] [distinguishing between \u201can unwed father\u2019s interest in maintaining and preserving an <em>existing </em>parent-child relationship\u201d and \u201can unwed father\u2019s biological connection alone to a child bom to a married woman\u201d].) Then, applying traditional substantive due process principles, we must balance the competing private and state interests\u2014i.e., Heriberto\u2019s largely abstract interest in being an absent presumed father while he remains in prison for raping Jesusa\u2019s mother, subject to deportation upon his release,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> against the substantial state interests in familial stability and the welfare of the child. <em>(Michelle W. </em>v. <em>Ronald W. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 354, 360-363 [216 Cal.Rptr. 748, 703 P.2d 88]; <em>Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1114-1115; see generally <em>In re Sade C, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 952, 989 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 771, 920 P.2d 716] [\u201cThe state has a <em>\u2018parens patriae </em>interest in preserving and promoting the welfare of the child\u2019 \u201d]; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 202 [purpose of dependency proceedings is to promote child\u2019s best interests].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">This inquiry resembles that already undertaken by the juvenile court in determining which paternity presumption was founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic. <em>(Kiana </em>A., <em>supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>p. 1121 [alleged father \u201chas been accorded due process through the statutory procedure which resulted in the juvenile court\u2019s determination his presumption was entitled to less weight\u201d]; see <em>Steven W. v. Matthew S., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1116.) Yet, Heriberto offers no reason why the result here should differ from that reached by the juvenile court. Indeed, Heriberto claims only that where both presumed fathers \u201chave an <em>equal </em>relationship with Jesusa,\u201d due process requires that biological paternity be determinative. We need not decide here the soundness of Heriberto\u2019s legal rule, inasmuch as we have already determined that Jesusa\u2019s relationship with him was not the equal of her relationship with Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The dissenting opinions, which rely on arguments and authorities neither mentioned nor discussed by any of the parties, merit separate analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">(a) Justice Chin asserts that our holding will place at risk the father-child relationship for untold thousands of biological fathers \u201cby a court\u2019s subjective and discretionary determination that some other man who qualifies as a presumed father would be a better father.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 676.) But our holding does not apply to biological fathers who are married to and cohabit with the mother and are therefore conclusively presumed to be the father. (\u00a7 7540.) Nor does it apply to unwed biological fathers who, unlike Heriberto, have sought to formalize their legal status by executing a voluntary declaration of paternity. (\u00a7\u00a7 7571, 7573.) And it does not apply to unwed biological fathers who, again unlike Heriberto, have successfully maintained a parent-child relationship such that no other man obtains the opportunity to qualify as a presumed father. (See \u00a7 7611.) In short, our holding applies only to that small subset of biological fathers who have neither married the mother of their child nor otherwise taken any steps to formalize their legal relationship with the child prior to the child\u2019s formation of a presumptive parent-child relationship with a competing man who is interested in asserting <em>his </em>legal rights as a father. If, in that category of cases, both men seek to be declared the presumed father, the court will have to determine, as the Legislature has provided, whether it is \u201cappropriate\u201d to rebut the nonbiological father\u2019s presumption and which of the two presumptions \u201con the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">(b) Justice Chin also asserts that the Legislature has \u201cclearly\u201d expressed its intent to make biology determinative as between competing presumed fathers. (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at pp. 636, 639.) Yet he concedes, as he must, that California\u2019s UPA \u201cdoes not expressly provide that one presumed father\u2019s established biological paternity necessarily rebuts the presumption of another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>presumed father under subdivision (a) of section 7611.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 638.) Indeed, the legislative history on which he relies notes merely that the UPA presumptions \u201c' <em>may </em>be rebutted ... by clear and convincing evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 650, italics added), not that they <em>must </em>be rebutted whenever such evidence is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Unlike our dissenting colleague, we find this omission significant. It is plain the Legislature knows how to craft a categorical rule for rebuttal of a presumption of fatherhood when it wants to. (Cf. <em>People v. Trevino </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 237, 241 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 567, 27 P.3d 283].) In section 7612, subdivision (c), for example, the Legislature has provided that a statutory presumption \u201cis rebutted by a judgment establishing paternity of the child by another man.\u201d But the Legislature did not use such unequivocal language in section 7612, subdivision (a), which states instead that the statutory presumption <em>\u201cmay </em>be rebutted <em>in an appropriate action only </em>by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) The significance of biology under <em>this </em>provision is far from clear\u2014especially when compared with statutes from other states, which have appended language to govern situations like the one here. In New Jersey, for example, the analog to section 7612, subdivision (c) provides: \u201c \u2018The presumption is rebutted by a court order terminating the presumed father\u2019s paternal rights <em>or by establishing that another man is the child\u2019s natural or adoptive father.\u2019 \u201d (N.M. v. J.G. </em>(1992) 255 NJ. Super. 423 [605 A.2d 709, 714], quoting NJ. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 9:17-43b, italics added.) Justice Chin in essence asks us to interpret our statute as though it included this explicit directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The omission of any mention of biological fatherhood in section 7612, subdivision (a) becomes even more significant when we consider the <em>exceptions </em>set forth in that provision: <em>\u201cExcept as provided </em>in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 7540) and Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 7570) of Part 2 or in Section 20102, a presumption under Section 7611 is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Italics added.) In section 7541, the Legislature provided that the conclusive presumption under section 7540 is rebutted by evidence of biological fatherhood. (\u00a7 7541, subd. (a).) Similarly, in section 7576, the Legislature provided that voluntary declarations of paternity signed on or before December 31, 1996, under section 7570 et seq. or former section 20102 would not override a presumption of paternity arising under section 7555, the genetic testing provision. (\u00a7 7576, subd. (e).) Had it wanted to specify the precise weight to be accorded biology for the remaining section 7611 presumptions, the Legislature could have crafted an analogous provision, or it could have referenced the testing provisions at section 7550 et seq. in the opening \u201cexcepting\u201d clause to section 7612, subdivision (a). Indeed, by expressly <em>excepting </em>the marital presumption and the voluntary declaration of paternity presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>from the operation of section 7612, subdivision (a) and making <em>separate </em>provision for the legal effect of biology in those circumstances, <em>the Legislature plainly believed that section 7612, subdivision (a) did not necessarily accord primacy to biology. </em>Justice Chin\u2019s proffered interpretation would render the \u201cexcepting\u201d clause meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Justice Chin\u2019s analysis also proceeds from a faulty premise. According to the dissent, if a husband\u2019s otherwise conclusive presumption under section 7540 \u201cis necessarily rebutted by proof he is not the biological father,\u201d the rebuttable UPA presumptions in subdivisions (a)-(e) of section 7611 \u201cmust also be necessarily rebutted by such proof; in establishing the limited exception to the conclusive presumption, the Legislature did not intend to make that presumption more rebuttable than the already rebuttable UPA presumptions.\u201d (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 644.) But the dissent is comparing apples and oranges. Unlike the presumptions enumerated in section 7611, the conclusive marital presumption in section 7540 is not really a presumption at all but is instead a \u201ca rule of substantive law.\u201d <em>(Estate of Cornelious </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 461, 464 [198 Cal.Rptr. 543, 674 P.2d 245]; <em>Kusior v. Silver </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 603, 619 [7 Cal.Rptr. 129, 354 P.2d 657].) The remaining section 7611 presumptions, on the other hand, <em>are </em>presumptions. In fact, they are presumptions \u201caffecting the burden of proof\u2019 (\u00a7 7612, subd. (a)) and thus were \u201c \u2018established to implement some public policy <em>other than </em>to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Fisher v. City of Berkeley </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 644, 695 [209 Cal.Rptr. 682, 693 P.2d 261], italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We note as well that the enumerated presumptions in section 7611\u2014unlike the section 7540 presumption\u2014may be rebutted \u201conly by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (a).) We therefore do not agree that the fact biology rebuts the section 7540 presumption necessarily dictates the role for biology in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">It therefore is not surprising that our dissenting colleague has been unable to cite a single case in support of his view. Indeed, although Justice Chin deems the implication \u201cunmistakable\u201d (dis. opn. of Chin, <em>J., post, at p. 636), </em>it has thus far eluded the justices in <em>Kiana A., supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th 1109, and <em>Steven W. v. Matthew S., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 1108, both of which support our holding, both of which Justice Chin would disapprove, and neither of which has provoked a corrective response by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The drafters of the revised UPA, who recently deleted provisions equivalent to subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 7612, also fail to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>dissent. According to the drafters, deletion of these provisions was appropriate because \u201c[njowadays the existence of modem genetic testing obviates this old approach to the problem of conflicting presumptions when a court is to determine paternity. Nowadays, genetic testing makes it possible in most cases to resolve competing claims to paternity.\u201d <em>(Amendments to the Uniform Parentage Act as Last Amended in 2002 with Prefatory Note and Comments </em>(2003) 37 Fam. L.Q. 5, 17.) This commentary implies that the \u201cold\u201d approach\u2014which is still the law in California\u2014may have relied on something other than genetic testing to resolve competing presumptions. (See <em>N.A.H. </em>v. <em>S.L.S., supra, 9 </em>P.3d at p. 361, fn. 5 [\u201cOther jurisdictions that have adopted the UPA have interpreted the presumption based on biology in the Act as rebuttable, rather than conclusive\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">(c) Our dissenting colleagues\u2019 proposed interpretation cannot be reconciled with <em>Nicholas H., </em>either. According to Justice Chin, the Legislature 50 years ago \u201cdirected courts to give <em>controlling </em>weight to evidence conclusively disproving the biological paternity of a particular man\u201d (dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 640), and \u201c[n]othing\u201d in the interim \u201csuggests that ... the Legislature intended to alter the determinative effect of biological paternity under California law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 650.) Thus, \u201cwhere tests conclusively show that a man is not a child\u2019s biological father, \u2018it seems intolerable for a court to permit an opposite result to be reached .... For a court to permit the establishment of paternity in cases where it is scientifically impossible to arrive at that result would seem to be a great travesty on justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 639-640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Yet we recently\u2014and unanimously\u2014affirmed a declaration of presumed fatherhood in favor of a man who could not possibly have been the biological father in <em>Nicholas H., </em>relying on section 7612, subdivision (a), which did not exist 50 years ago. (See <em>Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 64-70.) In accordance with that provision\u2014the same provision on which we rely today\u2014we found that \u201can action in which no other man claims parental rights to the child, an action in which rebuttal of the section 7611(d) presumption will render the child fatherless\u201d was not an appropriate action in which to rebut the presumption. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, we relied on the best interests of the child and public policy in declining to rebut the willing candidate\u2019s presumption. (See <em>In re Salvador M. </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1357-1358 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 705] [\u201cThe paternity presumptions are driven, not by biological paternity, but by the state\u2019s interest in the welfare of the child and the integrity of the family\u201d]; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>cf. <em>In re Marriage of Wendy M. </em>(1998) 92 Wn.App. 430 [962 P.2d 130, 133] [the \u201cbest interests of the child,\u201d including the fact that the child would be left fatherless, are an appropriate consideration in a proceeding to disestablish paternity].) Justice Chin fails to explain why the <em>same </em>provision\u2014i.e., section 7612, subdivision (a)\u2014allows us to consider the child\u2019s best interest and public policy in determining whether the presumption is rebutted in <em>Nicholas H. </em>but not in this case. Or why courts must ignore the child\u2019s best interests in a dependency proceeding, the very purpose of which is to protect the child. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">(d) Justice Chin\u2014and, to a lesser extent, Justice Kennard\u2014relies on the provisions of the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (\u00a7 7550 et seq.), a statutory scheme that the parties and amici curiae nowhere discuss or even cite. In this case, such reliance is inappropriate and unwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">First of all, no blood or genetic tests of any kind were requested, performed, or offered in these proceedings. These provisions therefore have no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Our dissenting colleagues suggest that the failure to obtain genetic tests can be excused because the parties stipulated to Heriberto\u2019s paternity, but they offer no authority for this proposition. To the contrary, case law has strictly construed these testing requirements. <em>(Rodney F. v. Karen M. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 233, 240 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 399] [\u201cit is irrelevant that the biological father can prove his paternity or even that all parties to the proceedings may concede that plaintiff is the biological father\u201d].) Moreover, given the extraordinary significance each would accord to biology, it seems unwise to allow a judgment that is demonstrably false to be entered solely because of an honest mistake as to a child\u2019s biological paternity. (See, e.g., <em>State, Div. of Child Support ex rel. NDB </em>(2001) 2001 WY 118 [35 P.3d 1224, 1226] [all parties were mistaken as to the identity of the biological father for nearly six years]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Santos </em>(1985) 104 Wn.2d 142 [702 P.2d 1179, 1183] [\u201cone study has estimated that 18 percent of a group of men who voluntarily admitted to paternity were not in fact the fathers of the children in question\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Second, the precise interplay between this statutory scheme and the UPA is not immediately apparent. As one commentator in this area has cautioned, \u201c[a]n outmoded and confusing system of presumption's plays a central role in the California statutory scheme.\u201d (Miller, <em>Baseline, Bright Line, Best Interests: A Pragmatic Approach for California to Provide Certainty in Determining Parentage </em>(2003) 34 McGeorge L.Rev. 637, 638-639 (Miller).) \u201c[T]he law in this area is exceedingly complex .... It is not always clear how these provisions are to be reconciled.\u201d (Anderlik, <em>Disestablishment Suits: What </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>. <em>Hath Science Wrought? </em>(2003) 4 J. Center for Fam., Children &amp; Cts. 3, 5, 6.) One thus has sound reason to doubt that the legislative intent is as clear as our dissenting colleagues insist it is\u2014or, whatever the level of clarity, that the Legislature intended biology to be conclusive. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 10 [\u201cThe \u2018biological imperative\u2019 position seems to show up most frequently in concurring or dissenting opinions, suggesting that it is somewhat idiosyncratic among judges\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 11 [California appears to have embraced \u201ca position of biological relevance: biology is not the whole story or even the most important part of the story\u201d]; Miller, supra, 34 McGeorge L.Rev. at p. 640 [\u201cWhile the California statutory scheme has gradually expanded the role of genetic testing, the legislative process has stopped short of making the genetic-biological relationship the baseline test for parentage\u201d].) In any event, we hesitate to definitively construe the scheme where, as here, its provisions are inapplicable and the parties have not invoked it or analyzed it. We therefore do not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">With that caveat in mind, however, we <em>can </em>point out certain logical flaws that appear in Justice Chin\u2019s analysis. For example, he asserts that biology is necessarily determinative within the first two years of life. Yet he admits that section 7541, the provision that provides for a two-year time limit, \u201cdo[es] not apply to the other section 7611 presumptions\u201d (such as Paul\u2019s) and that sections 7554 and 7555, the implications of which the dissent deems unmistakable, nowhere refer to the age of the child.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., post, at p. 646.) Neither can his construction of section 7554,-under which biology necessarily rebuts an enumerated section 7611 presumption, be reconciled with <em>Nicholas H.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The legislative history also fails to support Justice Chin\u2019s inteipretation. According to his dissent, the purpose of section 7555, which creates a rebuttable presumption of paternity if the paternity index is 100 or greater, was to standardize the weight accorded to genetic tests in determining <em>biological </em>paternity. The problem, one legislative analysis explained, was that jurors were failing to accord due weight to the tests and were instead relying on less probative markers of <em>biological </em>paternity, such as \u201c \u2018the appearance of the natural mother.\u2019 \u201d (Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 640; see Miller, <em>supra, </em>34 McGeorge L.Rev. at p. 693.) Nothing in this snippet of legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>suggests how a juvenile court should proceed when faced with a conflict between the rebuttable presumption of biological paternity (correctly determined under section 7555) and a rebuttable presumption of paternity under section 7611\u2014although the available case law once again rejects the approach endorsed in the dissents. (See <em>Steven W. v. Matthew S., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1116-1117 &amp; fn. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The legislative history to the predecessor to section 7541 likewise fails to support either dissenting opinion. According to these materials, the 1990 amendment to the predecessor to section 7541 was intended to provide unwed biological fathers, who were previously foreclosed from challenging the husband\u2019s conclusive presumption of paternity, \u201c \u2018the <em>opportunity </em>to establish paternity\u2019 \u201d (italics added) when they have demonstrated an interest in raising and providing for their children. (See dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 644.) A mere <em>opportunity </em>for the unwed biological father to establish paternity hardly supports the claim that biology is <em>necessarily </em>determinative. Indeed, in construing a statute similar to section 7541, the Colorado Supreme Court observed that the provision \u201cdoes not state that blood evidence is conclusive of fatherhood in <em>all </em>circumstances, or that it automatically eliminates <em>other </em>presumptions of fatherhood.\u201d <em>(N.A.H. v. S.L.S., supra, 9 </em>P.3d at p. 361, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">(e) Justice Chin accuses the court of repudiating the policy set forth in Johnson v. Calvert (1993) 5 Cal.4th 84, 93, footnote 10 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 494, 851 P.2d 776], where we declined to \u201c \u2018decide <em>parentage </em>based on the best interests of the child,\u2019 because doing so \u2018raises the repugnant specter of governmental interference in matters implicating our most fundamental notions of privacy, and confuses concepts of parentage and custody.\u2019 \u201d (See dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 633.) The dissent has once again confused apples and oranges. In this case, we are not selecting a policy to resolve competing claims when the statutory law is silent on the issue, but are instead giving effect to the language of the applicable statute. Because that <em>statute </em>directs us to consider whether rebuttal is appropriate and whether policy and logic favor one presumption over another, <em>Johnson </em>is not pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">In <em>Johnson v. Calvert, </em>we were charged with deciding which woman\u2014the egg donor or the birth mother\u2014was the child\u2019s \u201cnatural mother\u201d under California law. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Calvert, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 87.) We discovered that the presumptions set forth now in section 7611\u2014the statute at issue here\u2014\u201chave no application to this case\u201d but that both women had nonetheless \u201cadduced evidence of a mother and child relationship as contemplated by the [UPA].\u201d <em>(Johnson v. Calvert, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 92.) Unlike the situation here, the conflict was not resolved in the UPA itself. <em>(Johnson v. Calvert, supra, </em>at pp. 92-93 &amp; fn. 9; <em>id. </em>at pp. 112-113 (dis. opn. of Kennard, J.).) After a careful review of materials extrinsic to the UPA, we decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the parties\u2019 intent would be determinative. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Calvert, supra, </em>at pp. 93-97; see also <em>Dunkin v. Boskey </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 171, 190, fn. 10 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44] [\u201cthe court looked to the writings of several legal commentators\u201d]; <em>In re Marriage of Moschetta </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1218, 1231 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 893] [\u201conly when the operation of the [UPA] yielded an ambiguous result did the court resolve the matter by intent as expressed in the agreement\u201d].) Under that standard, the woman who intended to bring about the birth of a child that she intended to raise as her own \u201cis the natural mother.\u201d <em>(Johnson v. Calvert, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 93.) The passage from <em>Johnson v. Calvert </em>quoted by the dissent explained why, in selecting among possible criteria for decision, we did not rely on the best interests of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">This case is unlike <em>Johnson v. Calvert. </em>In this case, the section 7611 presumptions <em>do </em>apply. In this case, section 7612 <em>does </em>tell us how presumptions can be rebutted\u2014by clear and convincing evidence and only in an <em>appropriate </em>case\u2014and how conflicting presumptions are to be resolved\u2014by weighing considerations of <em>policy and logic. </em>Whatever <em>our </em>views as to whether the child\u2019s best interests should be considered in making parentage decisions, we cannot ignore the Legislature\u2019s directive.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In the course of afiBrming the juvenile court\u2019s determination that Paul qualified as Jesusa\u2019s presumed father, the Court of Appeal criticized the juvenile court for addressing the issue of presumed fatherhood prior to the jurisdictional hearing. In the appellate court\u2019s view, \u201cthe trial court proceeded backward in this case because if it found no jurisdiction over the minor the issue of presumed fatherhood would be moot.\u201d DCFS and amici curiae Northern California Association of Counsel for Children et al. ask us to disapprove this language and declare instead that a juvenile court has discretion to identify the presumed father once the dependency petition was filed\u2014and that the juvenile court here did not abuse its discretion in doing so. We agree with DCFS and its amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Where (as here) a child has been taken into temporary protective custody, the juvenile court is required to conduct a detention hearing as soon as possible and, in any event, no later than the next judicial day. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 315.) <em>\u201cAt the detention hearing, or as soon thereafter as practicable, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the court shall inquire of the mother and any other appropriate person as to the identity and address of all presumed or alleged fathers.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 316.2, subd. (a), italics added.) Indeed, under the California Rules of Court, the court should conduct this inquiry at the <em>beginning </em>of the <em>initial </em>hearing on the petition. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1441(a), (b).) If one or more men are identified as an alleged father, each shall be provided notice of the proceeding and informed that it could result in termination of his parental rights. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 316.2, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">There are two ways the juvenile court may proceed to determine the identity of a child\u2019s presumed father if no prior determination has been made. Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2, subdivision (d) and Family Code section 7630, the alleged father may bring an action to be declared the presumed father. The juvenile court where the dependency petition is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear that action from the time the petition is filed until the petition is dismissed, the dependency is terminated, or parental rights are terminated. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 316.2, subd. (e).) Alternatively, the juvenile court itself \u201cmay make such a determination\u201d even if no action is filed under Family Code section 7630. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413(e).) The court may order the parties to submit to blood tests <em>(id., </em>rule 1413(e)(1)) or \u201cmay make its determination of paternity or nonpaternity based on the testimony, declarations, or statements of the mother and alleged father\u201d (id., rule 1413(e)(2)). Any determination made by the juvenile court in either scenario shall be noted in the court minutes. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 316.2, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Nothing in these provisions requires the juvenile court to suspend its identification of the presumed father until <em>after </em>the dependency petition has been resolved. Indeed, subdivision (e) of Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2 endows the juvenile court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear the paternity action at <em>any </em>time while the petition is pending. Heriberto offers no reason for supposing a different rule applies when the juvenile court proceeds on its own to identify the presumed father. Moreover, inasmuch as a dependency action could eventually result in the termination of parental rights, a court needs first to know the identities of the parents. The legal parents must be identified so that they may receive notice of the hearing; be provided counsel, if necessary; and be accorded a meaningful opportunity to be heard. As DCFS points out, \u201cit would not make sense\u2014or be possible in many cases\u2014to adjudicate a dependency petition without first identifying which man is the child\u2019s father.\u201d Thus, this seems to be a situation in which \u201cthe law cannot be judicially applied without a determination of parentage when such question is placed in issue.\u201d <em>(In re Lisa R. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 636, 643 [119 Cal.Rptr. 475, 532 P.2d 123].)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Heriberto nonetheless contends that a juvenile court does not have jurisdiction to identify the presumed father until <em>after </em>the dependency petition has been sustained. Although evidence must be offered to prove the child comes within one or more subdivisions of Welfare and Institutions Code section 300 before the child may be declared a dependent of the court (e.g., <em>In re Janet T. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 377, 391 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 163]), the juvenile court nonetheless has jurisdiction prior to that time \u201cto make such determinations which are incidentally necessary to the performance of those functions demanded of it by the Legislature pursuant to the Juvenile Court Law.\u201d <em>(In re Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 643.) This responsibility is now articulated in Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2 and rule 1413 of the California Rules of Court. But even before those provisions were enacted, we held that \u201ca juvenile court is vested with jurisdiction to determine parentage of a minor when that finding is necessary to any ultimate determination with which it is charged.\u201d <em>(Lisa R., supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 644.)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We do agree with Heriberto on one point: the dependency scheme does not <em>require </em>the juvenile court to make a paternity determination prior to adjudicating the dependency petition. As in other types of cases (e.g., <em>Rutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 953, 967 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 941 P.2d 1203]; <em>People v. Arias </em>(1996) 13 CalAth 92, 147 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 913 P.2d 980]), we entrust the sequence of issues to the sound discretion of the trial court. Here, we find that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in identifying Jesusa\u2019s presumed father before making the ultimate determination that Jesusa should be declared a dependent of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Having exhausted Heriberto\u2019s challenges to the juvenile court\u2019s declaration of Paul\u2019s presumed fatherhood, we may now address his objections to the juvenile court\u2019s adjudication of the dependency petition. Once again, Heriberto claims he had a statutory and constitutional right to be present at this proceeding. The Court of Appeal rejected the constitutional claim but agreed with Heriberto that Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d) granted him an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to be present at the jurisdictional hearing. Holding that the juvenile court had acted \u201cin excess of its jurisdiction\u201d by proceeding in Heriberto\u2019s absence, the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">In reversing that part of the judgment, the Court of Appeal focused on the word \u201cor\u201d in Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d)\u2019s admonition that no dependency petition may be adjudicated without the physical presence of \u201c \u2018the prisoner <em>or </em>the prisoner\u2019s attorney\u2019 \u201d and determined that \u201cthe word \u2018or\u2019 in the sentence under consideration must be construed in the conjunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>sense to mean \u2018and.\u2019 \u201d Reading the word \u201cor\u201d in its conjunctive sense, the Court of Appeal concluded that <em>both </em>the prisoner <em>and </em>the prisoner\u2019s attorney must be present before the juvenile court may adjudicate a dependency petition. We agree with the Court of Appeal that the statute requires <em>both </em>the prisoner <em>and </em>the prisoner\u2019s attorney be present. We disagree, however, that the violation here deprived the juvenile court of jurisdiction to adjudicate the petition. We instead apply our familiar harmless-error analysis and find that Heriberto, who had already been convicted of the rape at the time of the hearing, was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">We begin with the text of the statute. Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d) states in relevant part: \u201cUpon receipt by the court of a statement from the prisoner or his or her attorney indicating the prisoner\u2019s desire to be present during the court\u2019s proceedings, the court shall issue an order for the temporary removal of the prisoner from the institution, and for the prisoner\u2019s production before the court. . . . [N]o petition to adjudge the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court pursuant to subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (i), or (j) of Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code may be adjudicated without the physical presence of the prisoner <em>or </em>the prisoner\u2019s attorney, unless the court has before it a knowing waiver of the right of physical presence signed by the prisoner or an affidavit signed by the warden, superintendent, or other person in charge of the institution, or his or her designated representative stating that the prisoner has, by express statement or action, indicated an intent not to appear at the proceeding.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">DCFS argues, with some force, that a conjunctive construction of the word \u201cor\u201d renders superfluous the words \u201cor the prisoner\u2019s attorney\u201d in the statute, since it goes without saying that a prisoner who is represented by counsel would have a right to have counsel in attendance at any legal proceeding. On the other hand, Heriberto argues, with equal force, that a disjunctive construction of the word \u201cor\u201d would make meaningless the statute\u2019s directive that a court order a prisoner\u2019s production once the prisoner has indicated a desire to attend. We therefore agree that the statute is ambiguous and turn to additional indicators of the legislative intent. <em>(Arnold v. Hopkins </em>(1928) 203 Cal. 553, 563 [265 P. 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">In construing statutes, we must rely on \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018the usual, ordinary import of the language employed in framing them.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Phelps v. Stostad </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 23, 32 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 360, 939 P.2d 760].) The \u201c \u2018ordinary and popular\u2019 \u201d meaning of the word \u201cor\u201d is well settled. <em>(Houge </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 706, 712 [285 P2d 257].) It has a disjunctive meaning: \u201cIn its ordinary sense, the function of the word \u2018or\u2019 is to mark an alternative such as \u2018either this or that.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We have <em>also </em>recognized <em>that the </em>word may have a conjunctive meaning. But, as we have long stated, \u201c[r]esort to such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>unnatural construction of the word \u2018or\u2019 is sanctioned only when such construction is found necessary to carry out the obvious intent of the Legislature in a statute or the obvious intent of the parties in a contract, when such intent may be gleaned from the context in which the word is used.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>That intent appears in the legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The language currently found in Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d) was added to the Penal Code in 1976. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1376, \u00a7 2, p. 6262.) According to one legislative analysis, \u201c[t]he purpose of\u2019 subdivision (d) is to ensure that prisoner-parents have the opportunity to be present at \u201cproceedings . . . where taking away custody [and] control of their child(ren), on a temporary or permanent basis, is being considered.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Background Information to Assem. Bill No. 4354 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.).) Another analysis explained that subdivision (d) \u201cprohibit[s] . . . proceedings\u201d in dependency cases \u201cwithout the presence of the prisoner-parent, a knowing waiver of appearance, or an affidavit from the superintendent or representative of the institution that the prisoner does not want to attend the hearing.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Criminal Justice, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4354 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) May 26, 1976.) Still another analysis explained that under subdivision (d), a dependency case \u201ccan not be disposed of unless the prisoner is either physically present in court, represented by counsel or unless he has waived his right to appear.\u201d (Assem! Com. on Criminal Justice, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4354 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 2, 1976, p. 1.) This last analysis also explained that \u201cthe termination of parental rights is a matter of utmost concern to all parties and that the . . . presence of all parties is desirable.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>These materials reveal a strong legislative interest in enabling the prisoner to attend the hearing, an interest that would be-undermined by interpreting the statute to make the attorney\u2019s presence sufficient in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">To interpret the statute to require only the presence of the attorney would also undermine the legislative goal of ensuring that prisoners actually receive notice of the proceeding. Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (b) requires the court to order notice of a qualifying dependency proceeding to be \u201ctransmitted to the prisoner.\u201d According to one legislative analysis, the Legislature added section 2625, subdivision (d)\u2019s. waiver requirement in 1976 to \u201c[e]nsure that adequate notice is [actually] given. [|] . . . [][] [Occasionally the notice required ... to adjudicate a child a ward of the court is not received by the inmate in time for that person to be present at the hearing. This bill would solve the problem since the hearing could not proceed without some acknowledgement from the prisoner-parent.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 4354 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 3, 1976, pp. 2-3.) Only by requiring the prisoner either to be present or to have executed a waiver of his or her appearance can the court ensure the prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>actually received the notice. The juvenile court thus erred in proceeding without Heriberto\u2019s presence or his waiver of that right.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We typically apply a harmless-error analysis when a statutory mandate is disobeyed, except in a narrow category of circumstances when we deem the error reversible per se. This practice derives from article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution, which provides: \u201cNo judgment shall be set aside, or new trial granted, in any cause ... for any error as to any matter of procedure, unless, after an examination of the entire cause, including the evidence, the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d The Court of Appeal reasoned that this statutory violation was reversible per se because, by proceeding in Heriberto\u2019s absence, the juvenile court acted in excess of jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">A court acts in excess of jurisdiction \u201cwhere, though the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties in the fundamental sense, it has no \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 (or power) to act except in a particular manner, or to give certain kinds of relief, or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.\u201d <em>(Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288 [109 P.2d 942] <em>(Abelleira).) </em>Whether an act is in excess of jurisdiction or is merely statutory error is defined by the Constitution, express statutory declaration, or rules developed by the courts and followed under the doctrine of stare decisis. <em>(Abelleira, supra, </em>at p. 291.) In this case, where Heriberto\u2019s presence was neither constitutionally required nor mandated by our rules, we must examine the statute to determine whether the Legislature intended it to be jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">At the outset, we observe that we have rarely\u2014if ever\u2014found a statutory mandate to be jurisdictional when, as here, the mandate itself provides that it may be waived. (Cf. <em>Abelleira, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at pp. 288-289; <em>Newman v. County of Sonoma </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 625, 627 [15 Cal.Rptr. 914, 364 P.2d 850].) Nothing in the text of the statute indicates the Legislature intended a different result here. Rather, it appears the Legislature intended merely to grant the prisoner a statutory right to attend the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">An examination of the statutes governing a defendant\u2019s appearance at a criminal trial is therefore instructive, since Heriberto\u2019s denial of his right to be present under Penal Code section 2625 can reasonably be analogized to the denial of a criminal defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial under Penal Code sections 977 and 1043, which similarly mandate the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>presence at trial unless a waiver is submitted. (See <em>People v. Gutierrez </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1196 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 63 P.3d 1000].) Despite the statutory mandate in sections 977 and 1043, we have regularly applied a harmless-error analysis when a defendant has been involuntarily absent from a criminal trial. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Riel </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1153, 1196 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969] [\u201cbecause this nonwaivable right is statutory and not constitutional, error is reversible only if it is reasonably probable the result would have been more favorable to defendant absent the error\u201d]; <em>People v. Ayala </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 268-269 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 532, 6 P.3d 193]; <em>People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 325 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].) We do not believe the Legislature intended a different result in the analogous circumstance here, when a prisoner is involuntarily absent from a dependency proceeding. (Cf. <em>Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 120-122 [101 Cal.Rptr. 745, 496 P.2d 817].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Our conclusion is bolstered by the strong countervailing interest, expressed by the Legislature itself, that dependency actions be resolved expeditiously. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 352, subd. (b); <em>In re Malinda S., supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 384 [the state has a \u201clegitimate interest in providing an expedited proceeding to resolve the child\u2019s status without further delay\u201d].) That goal would be thwarted if the proceeding had to be redone without any showing the new proceeding would have a different outcome. Indeed, the concern is acute in this case, inasmuch as Heriberto had been convicted of the rape at the time of the hearing and has never asserted that he was <em>actually </em>prejudiced by appearing at the hearing only through his attorney. We therefore conclude that the Legislature did not intend the prisoner\u2019s statutory right to personally attend the adjudication of a dependency petition to be jurisdictional. Applying our familiar harmless-error test, we find that Heriberto could not have been prejudiced. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>In re Melinda J. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1413, 1419 [286 Cal.Rptr. 239].)</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Independently of any statutory claim, Heriberto also contends that his absence from the jurisdictional and dispositional hearing denied him due process, but he offers no argument beyond that we have already rejected in part A., <em>ante. </em>The relevant issues involved in the dependency action had been explored in reports filed months before the hearing; the juvenile court had granted a lengthy continuance to permit Heriberto to respond to those points and conduct discovery; and the court had advised counsel to consider having Heriberto file a declaration. (Cf. <em>Axsana S., supra, </em>78 Cal.App.4th at p. 270.) Heriberto, however, chose not to submit such a declaration. His attorney made no offer of proof of the testimony Heriberto allegedly wanted to present. Nor did his attorney present the live testimony of <em>other </em>witnesses, such as those witnesses he had included on his witness list. In fact, Heriberto has <em>never </em>identified\u2014whether by way of a petition for modification (Welf. &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Inst. Code, \u00a7 388, subd. (a)) in the juvenile court or in this appeal\u2014the evidence he claims he would have offered had he been present. (Cf. <em>Ansley </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 477, 484-488 [229 Cal.Rptr. 771].) The omission is perhaps unsurprising, given the fact that he had raped the child\u2019s mother while the child was present in the motor home, and he was in prison at the time the petition was adjudicated. Accordingly, one can say with confidence that \u201c[n]o other result was possible\u201d even if he had been present. <em>(Rikki D., supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1632.)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We observe as well that no denial of due process has been found where the prisoner-parent is unable to attend because he or she is in the custody of another state or the federal government and is instead represented by counsel. (E.g., <em>In re Maria S., supra, </em>60 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1312-1313.) Heriberto offers no justification for a different result here. <em>(State ex rel. Jeanette H. </em>v. <em>Pancake </em>(2000) 207 W.Va. 154 [529 S.E.2d 865, 876] [\u201cwe conclude that the same due process analysis is applicable regardless of where a parent is confined\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed to the extent it reversed the order determining Jesusa V. to be a dependent child of the court.

This construction, however, fails to recognize that \u201cproceeding\u201d refers not to just any proceeding, but only \u201cwhere the proceeding <em>seeks to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>court.\u201d </em>(Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b), italics added.) In our view, the \u201cproceeding regarding the proceeding\u201d language is intended to encompass the jurisdictional hearing, which may precede the formal adjudication of the petition at the dispositional hearing, as well as the dispositional hearing. However, it cannot be read so broadly as to encompass a presumed fatherhood hearing, which usually arises <em>outside </em>of any \u201cproceeding ... to terminate the parental rights of any prisoner\u201d or \u201cto adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b); see, e.g., <em>Dawn D. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 932, 936 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 871, 952 P.2d 1139]; <em>Barkaloff </em>v. <em>Woodward </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 393, 396 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 167] [proceeding under the Domestic Violence Protection Act, Fam. Code, \u00a7 6200 et seq.].) A prisoner-parent\u2019s attendance at a presumed fatherhood hearing in these latter circumstances is unquestionably governed by subdivision (e) of Penal Code section 2625. We see no indication that the Legislature intended that subdivision (d) apply to an identical hearing merely because of the fortuity that a dependency petition is pending. Indeed, under the dissent\u2019s broad reading, subdivision (d) would apply even to scheduling hearings or other housekeeping matters in the course of a dependency proceeding. We decline to interpret the statute to reach such an absurd result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> Counsel conceded that this evidence was intended merely to rebut assertions in the minor\u2019s brief that Heriberto had offered insufficient evidence to support a threshold finding that he was the presumed father\u2014i.e., that he had presented \u201cno evidence that he openly and publicly acknowledged paternity of lesusa,\u201d had \u201cclaimed fatherhood of lesusa to friends, relatives or neighbors,\u201d or \u201ctook formal steps to identify her to governmental agencies as his daughter.\u201d As counsel for the minor pointed out at oral argument, Heriberto made no offer of proof concerning the nature and quality of his bond with the child to supplement his biological relationship with her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\"> All future statutory references are to the Family Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> We also said in <em>Nicholas H. </em>that the Legislature, by including the limiting phrase \u201c <em>\u2018in an appropriate action,\u2019 \u201d </em>\u201chad in mind an action in which another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section 7611(d) presumption in order to perfect his claim.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) This dictum described a common circumstance in which rebuttal might be appropriate, but did not declare that rebuttal was appropriate in <em>all </em>such cases.

Yet, if the Legislature had wanted to make a categorical exception for biology that did not rely \u201con the facts\u201d of a particular case (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b)), it could easily have said so.

Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s articulation of a rule of rebuttal for the section 7540 presumption that differs from that for the enumerated section 7611 presumptions (see \u00a7 7612, subd. (a)), and the imposition of a two-year limit in section 7541 without any corresponding limit on the presumptions at issue here, undermines her claim that biology <em>must </em>be deemed the weightier consideration in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\"> Heriberto thus effectively seeks the rights of fatherhood without any of its responsibilities.

The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services petitioned the juvenile court to declare Jesusa a dependent of the court. The court appointed counsel to represent Heriberto, who denied the allegations in the dependency petition and asserted that he, not Paul, qualified as Jesusa\u2019s legal father. The court scheduled a paternity hearing and ordered the deputies at the county jail, where Heriberto was incarcerated, to transport him to court for the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Heriberto, however, never made it to the paternity hearing. Although no evidence was presented as to the reason for his absence, it appears that Heriberto was not transported to court because he was no longer in county jail but was in state prison: This court has taken judicial notice of records showing that he had entered a plea of no contest to the rape. The juvenile court, over the objection of Heriberto\u2019s attorney, held the paternity hearing in Heriberto\u2019s absence 'and mled that Paul was Jesusa\u2019s legal father. A jurisdictional hearing on the dependency petition followed; Heriberto\u2019s attorney unsuccessfully asserted his incarcerated Ghent\u2019s right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">At the jurisdictional hearing, <em>none </em>of the parties was personally present: Jesusa\u2019s mother, distraught at the outcome of the paternity hearing, had walked out of the courtroom, followed by Paul. The court mled that because it had decided that Heriberto was not Jesusa\u2019s legal father but a \u201cmere biological father,\u201d he was \u201cnot even entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d Because the attorneys representing Paul and the mother did not challenge the allegations in the dependency petition, the court found them true. It then turned to the question of disposition. It ordered Jesusa placed with Paul, allowing the mother to have unmonitored visits, and it forbade Heriberto from having any contact with Jesusa.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Heriberto appealed. The Court of Appeal affirmed the juvenile court\u2019s order declaring Paul to be Jesusa\u2019s legal father, but it reversed the order sustaining the dependency petition, holding that the court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the dependency petition in Heriberto\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The majority here upholds the juvenile court\u2019s ruling declaring Paul to be Jesusa\u2019s legal father. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">I begin by briefly summarizing the pertinent parts of California\u2019s complex statutory scheme governing paternity adjudications. Paternity disputes are governed by a conglomeration of three sets of laws: The Uniform Parentage Act (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7600-7730, hereafter the UPA),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (\u00a7\u00a7 7550-7557), and other Family Code sections enacted by the Legislature (\u00a7\u00a7 7540-7541, 7570-7577). Under the UPA, a man is \u201cpresumed to be the natural father of a child\u201d if he meets certain conditions described in section 7611: He marries or attempts to marry the mother under circumstances specified in the statute; he and the child\u2019s mother sign a declaration stating that he is the father; he \u201creceives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child\u201d (\u00a77611, subd. (d)); or the child is bom in a country participating in an Orderly Departure Program, and the man acknowledges his paternity in a declaration filed under penalty of perjury. As to most of these conditions, the presumption is \u201ca rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof\u2019 (\u00a7 7612, subd. (a)), which may be refuted by clear and convincing evidence. This is not the case, however, as to the presumption described in section 7540. That section states that when a married woman living with her husband gives birth to a child, the husband is ordinarily conclusively presumed to be the child\u2019s father. But if blood tests taken in a paternity action before the child is two years old show \u201cthat the husband is not the father of the child, <em>the question of the paternity of the husband shall be resolved accordingly.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 7541, subd. (a), italics added; see also \u00a7 7554 [when blood tests have been taken in any proceeding in which paternity is a relevant fact, and \u201cthe conclusions of all the experts ... are that the alleged father is not the father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Here, Paul and Jesusa were married when Jesusa was born, but Paul did not qualify for the conclusive presumption of paternity (\u00a7 7540) because he and Jesusa\u2019s mother were not living together at the time of birth. Heriberto and Paul, however, both qualified as presumed fathers. (\u00a7 7611.) Heriberto qualified because he received Jesusa into his home and held her out as his natural child. Paul qualified because he was married to Jesusa\u2019s mother <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>When, at a paternity hearing, the court finds that two men are presumed fathers, the court must find paternity in favor of the father whose presumption \u201cis founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).) The juvenile court here construed that statutory phrase as permitting it to decide paternity based on the child\u2019s best interests. It explained: \u201cThe man who provides the stability, nurturance, family ties, permanence, is more important to a child than a man who has mere biological ties.\u201d Based on these considerations, the court adjudicated the question of Jesusa\u2019s paternity in favor of Paul, whom everyone agreed was not the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The juvenile court may well have been right that Paul rather than Heriberto was likely to be a better parent to Jesusa. That, however, is not dispositive under subdivision (b) of section 7612, as becomes clear when other sections of the Family Code are considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">As noted earlier, section 7541 provides that when a child is under the age of two, and a blood test has shown that a man who, like Paul here, is married to the child\u2019s mother is <em>not </em>the child\u2019s biological father, the trial court <em>must </em>resolve the question of paternity <em>against </em>that man. Similarly, section 7554 says that when blood tests are used to resolve a paternity dispute, those tests are dispositive. Thus, sections 7541 and 7554 reflect the Legislature\u2019s view that when a paternity dispute between two presumptive fathers involves a child less than two years old, biology is the \u201cweightier consideration[] of policy and logic\u201d under section 7612, subdivision (b). The biological father would not prevail if he was not a presumed father (see p. 596, <em>ante), </em>because section 7612 applies only to disputes between presumed fathers. But here, because Heriberto\u2014the biological father\u2014was also a presumed father and Jesusa was under two years of age, the juvenile court should have resolved the question of paternity in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The majority insists that sections 7541 and 7554 \u201chave no application here\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 616) because they merely describe who prevails when a <em>blood test </em>shows a husband\u2019s or an alleged father\u2019s lack of paternity. True, no blood tests were ordered here. But that was because such tests were unnecessary, as the parties agreed that Heriberto, not Paul, was Jesusa\u2019s biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">In any event, the majority acknowledges that dispositive here is what the Legislature meant when it said, in subdivision (b) of section 7612, that between two statutorily presumed fathers, paternity must be resolved in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>of the man whose presumption \u201cis founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u201d As discussed above, sections 7541 and 7554 show that as to children under the age of two years, the Legislature views biology as the \u201cweightier consideration.\u201d Thus, because Heriberto, one of the presumed fathers, was undisputedly Jesusa\u2019s biological father, the juvenile court should have adjudicated paternity in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In upholding the trial court\u2019s contrary ruling, the majority relies on <em>In re Nicholas H. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 56 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 146, 46 P.3d 932], That case is distinguishable, however. There, we held that when a presumed father admits that he is not the child\u2019s biological father, the trial court may still decide that he is the child\u2019s father under section 7612. But there, unlike here, <em>no one </em>stepped forward as the child\u2019s biological father. We stressed that our decision had no applicability to a case when, as here, \u201canother candidate is vying for parental rights\u201d <em>(In re Nicholas H., supra, </em>at p. 70), and adding that \u201cwe do not reach\u201d the question \u201cwhether . . . biological paternity by a competing presumptive father necessarily defeats a nonbiological father\u2019s presumption of paternity\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>Now, for the first time, this court must confront that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">In upholding the juvenile court\u2019s paternity ruling against Heriberto, Jesusa\u2019s biological father, the majority violates his due process rights as a biological father. In <em>Adoption of re Kelsey S. </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 816 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] <em>(Kelsey), </em>a unanimous opinion by the same justice who has authored today\u2019s majority opinion, this court held that when a biological father demonstrates \u201ca full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 849), the due process clause of the federal Constitution bars the state from terminating his parental rights \u201con nothing more than a showing of a child\u2019s best interest\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>the test used by the juvenile court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">The majority cites two grounds for rejecting Heriberto\u2019s due process claim. Neither is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">First, the majority cursorily asserts that the juvenile court did <em>not </em>terminate biological father Heriberto\u2019s parental rights when it resolved paternity in favor of Paul. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610.) To the contrary! A court\u2019s paternity decision is \u201cdeterminative for all purposes\u201d except in criminal prosecutions for failure to provide child support. (\u00a7 7636.) <em>Francisco G. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 586, 596 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 679], on which the majority relies, does not hold otherwise; it says nothing about a single parental right that a man retains after a court has resolved the question of paternity against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Second, the majority insists that Heriberto is not entitled to the due process protection articulated in <em>Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 816, because the record does not show that he took any \u201clegal steps to formalize his relationship to the child.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) As I explain below, this analysis is faulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Although the majority is right that Heriberto presented no evidence that he had tried to \u201cformalize his relationship\u201d with Jesusa, his biological daughter, that is only because the juvenile court denied him the opportunity to do so. Heriberto\u2019s lawyer asked the court to continue the paternity hearing so Heriberto could be present and testify about the \u201cformal steps\u201d he had taken to identify Jesusa as his daughter to \u201cgovernment agencies.\u201d Responding that such actions by Heriberto would have no bearing on the outcome of the paternity hearing, the court went ahead with the hearing. Because the trial court prevented Heriberto from testifying that he took such steps, he cannot be faulted for failing to present evidence that he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Moreover, even if Heriberto had taken <em>no </em>\u201clegal steps to formalize his relationship\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611) with Jesusa, there is nothing in <em>Kelsey </em>to suggest that he forfeited his due process rights because of such inaction. What <em>Kelsey </em>does say is this: \u201cIf an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014 emotional, financial, and otherwise\u2014his federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent.\u201d (Kelsey; <em>supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849.) Here, Heriberto publicly acknowledged Jesusa as his child; he took her into his home and raised her for almost two years; there is no evidence that he did not treat her in a loving manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Heriberto\u2019s rape of Jesusa\u2019s mother is powerful evidence of his unfitness as a parent. It was, therefore, entirely appropriate for the county agency to seek to remove Jesusa from his custody and to have her made a dependent of the juvenile court. But the juvenile court did not consider the rape when making its paternity determination. Nor did it base that determination on a finding that Heriberto was an unfit parent. Rather, the court decided that question based on Jesusa\u2019s best interests, a standard that violates our holding in <em>Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 816. There, as I noted above, we held that a court cannot terminate a biological father\u2019s parental rights absent a showing of the father\u2019s unfitness as a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Did the incarcerated Heriberto have a right to be transported to the paternity hearing? Yes, he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In \u201cany proceeding brought under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, where the proceeding seeks to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court ... the superior court . . . shall order notice of <em>any court proceeding regarding the proceeding </em>transmitted to the prisoner.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b), italics added.) If the court receives \u201ca statement from the prisoner or his or her attorney indicating the prisoner\u2019s desire to be present during the court\u2019s proceedings, the court shall issue an order ... for the prisoner\u2019s production before the court.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (d).) Also, \u201cno petition to adjudge the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court. . . may be adjudicated without the physical presence of the prisoner or the prisoner\u2019s attorney, unless the court has before it a knowing waiver of the right of physical presence signed by the prisoner or an affidavit [from the institution where the prisoner is incarcerated] stating that the prisoner has . . . indicated an intent not to appear . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Here, the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services petitioned the juvenile court to declare Heriberto\u2019s biological daughter Jesusa a dependent child of the court. The paternity hearing was a crucial part of the dependency proceedings, and Heriberto told the court that he wanted to be present at the hearing. By holding the hearing in Heriberto\u2019s absence, the court violated Penal Code section 2625, an error that the majority upholds.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">According to the majority, Penal Code section 2625 entitles a prisoner to be present only when the juvenile court decides the issues of jurisdiction and disposition, but not when it decides other matters that are part of the dependency proceedings, such as the paternity dispute here. Not so. Subdivision (b) of section 2625 says that a prisoner must be notified of <em>\u201cany </em>court proceeding regarding the [dependency] proceeding\u201d (italics added); and subdivision (d) of the same section says that when, as here, the prisoner asks to attend any such proceeding, the court must order the prisoner\u2019s transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Insisting that Heriberto did not have that right, the majority asserts that \u201csection 2625 requires a court to order a prisoner-parent\u2019s temporary removal and production before the court <em>only </em>\u2018where the proceeding seeks ... to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 599.) This adjudication was not made, the majority asserts, at the paternity hearing in this case. But the paternity hearing here was a crucial part of the entire dependency proceeding, a proceeding that <em>did </em>\u201cseek[] to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b).) As a result, Heriberto had a statutory right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">As explained above, the juvenile court erred when it ruled that Heriberto, Jesusa\u2019s undisputed biological father, had no right to be personally present at the paternity hearing, and when it decided at that hearing that Paul, who was married to Jesusa\u2019s mother when Jesusa was bom, rather than Heriberto, was Jesusa\u2019s legal father. The court\u2019s erroneous paternity determination also had the effect of wrongly denying Heriberto his right to appear, either in person or through counsel, at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings that immediately followed the paternity determination: Ruling that Heriberto was not Jesusa\u2019s legal father, the court stated he was \u201cnot even entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard\u201d at those proceedings. I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the matter to that court, with directions to reverse the juvenile court\u2019s judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b637-7\">CHIN, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AR9\">Only 10 years ago, in a nearly unanimous decision construing the same enactment at issue here\u2014California\u2019s Uniform Parentage Act (UPA) (Fam. Code, \u00a7 7600 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014we held that where biological parentage is established, courts faced with competing claims should <em>not </em>\u201cdecide <em>parentage </em>based on the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Calvert </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 84, 93, fn. 10 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 494, 851 P.2d 776] <em>(Johnson).) </em>We also cautioned that, under these circumstances, basing parentage decisions on a child\u2019s best interests \u201craises the repugnant specter of governmental interference in matters implicating our most fundamental notions of privacy, and confuses concepts of parentage and custody.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Today, a majority of this court reverses course and makes the very approach we rejected 10 years ago the mle in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to abandon our prior construction of the UPA. No statute compels the majority\u2019s conclusion. On the contrary, the majority\u2019s conclusion is inconsistent with California\u2019s statutory scheme, which <em>requires </em>courts to determine paternity in accordance with biological fact even where a man enjoys a so-called conclusive presumption of paternity. It is also inconsistent with compelling legislative history that clearly shows our Legislature\u2019s intent to have <em>parentage </em>determined by biology where possible. Through the statutory scheme and its legislative history, the Legislature has directed us to determine <em>parentage </em>in this case\u2014as opposed to custody\u2014in accordance with what everyone concedes is the biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>truth: that Heriberto C. is the father of Jesusa V. Finally, the majority\u2019s conclusion raises serious constitutional questions regarding the rights of biological fathers. For all of these reasons, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that Heriberto\u2019s status as a presumed father and his unquestioned biological paternity do not necessarily rebut or outweigh the presumption under section 7611 that Paul B. is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father,\u201d and that the determination of <em>paternity </em>depends instead on a trial court\u2019s subjective and discretionary assessment of the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">I also dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that when the juvenile court determined paternity in Heriberto\u2019s absence, it did not violate Heriberto\u2019s statutory right under Penal Code section 2625 to be personally present. The majority\u2019s cramped interpretation of this provision is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s plain language.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">On the particular facts of this case, the result of the majority\u2019s conclusion is unobjectionable: Jesusa will remain in Paul\u2019s care and Heriberto will have no legal access to her. However, as we have held, questions of parentage are legally separate from questions of custody. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 93, fn. 10.) Concerns that Heriberto is not an appropriate father for Jesusa can, and should, be addressed through our laws on custody and termination of parental rights, not through an initial paternity determination. Applying those laws, my construction will ultimately produce the same result in this case without distorting the statutes governing paternity determinations and rendering them unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s rule applies not just in this case, but in <em>all </em>cases involving competing paternity claims of men who qualify under section 7611 as presumed \u201cnatural father[s]\u201d of a child. Given the prevalence in today\u2019s world of fractured families and the relative ease of qualifying as a presumed \u201cnatural father\u201d\u2014especially under the majority\u2019s analysis in this case\u2014 thousands of biological fathers in California may now be at risk that, although they have a loving, healthy, and well-developed relationship with their children, some court may terminate their parental rights based on the conclusion that another man who qualifies as a presumed father would be a better father. Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusion has serious implications extending well beyond this case; it permits judges making <em>paternity </em>decisions to ignore biological fact because they believe someone else would make a better father, and it permits them to do so in the biological father\u2019s absence if the biological father is a prisoner. Because these results are not authorized by statute and were not intended by the Legislature, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>I. Heriberto\u2019s Biological Paternity Controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">As the majority explains, this case involves a clash of competing presumptions under section 7611 that a particular man is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father.\u201d The juvenile court found that, in addition to being Jesusa\u2019s \u201cbiological father,\u201d Heriberto qualified as a presumed father because he \u201cholds himself out as the father and has received [Jesusa] into his home.\u201d The latter finding qualified Heriberto for the presumption under subdivision (d) of section 7611, which applies where a man \u201creceives the child into his home and openly holds out the child as his natural child.\u201d The juvenile court found that Paul qualified as a presumed father because he \u201cwas married to [Jesusa\u2019s mother] at the time [Jesusa] was conceived and bom,\u201d even though Jesusa\u2019s mother \u201cwas living with\u201d Heriberto when Jesusa \u201cwas conceived and apparently when [she] was bom.\u201d These findings qualified Paul for the presumption under subdivision (a) of section 7611, which applies where a child is bom \u201cduring the marriage\u201d of a man \u201cand the child\u2019s natural mother.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The UPA provides that the presumptions for which Heriberto and Paul qualified are \u201crebuttable presumption[s]\u201d that \u201cmay be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (a).) The UPA also provides that \u201c[i]f two or more presumptions arise under Section 7611 which conflict with each other, the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).) These provisions give rise to two separate questions here: (1) whether Heriberto\u2019s unquestioned biological paternity constitutes clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>and convincing evidence that necessarily rebuts the presumption that Paul is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father\u201d (\u00a7 7611); and (2) if Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity does not necessarily rebut Paul\u2019s presumption, whether it nevertheless requires a finding that, \u201con the facts\u201d of this case (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b)), the presumption that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father\u201d (\u00a7.7611) is \u201cfounded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In answering these questions, we must construe the statutes not \u201cin isolation,\u201d but \u201c \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which [they are] part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420] <em>(Pieters).) </em>Moreover, if the statutory language permits, then we must adopt a construction that does not render the statutes \u201cunconstitutional in whole or in part, or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions.\u201d <em>(Miller v. Municipal Court </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 818, 828 [142 P.2d 297] <em>(Miller).) </em>Applying these principles, I conclude that Heriberto\u2019s undisputed biological paternity is controlling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A. <em>The Statutory Scheme and Legislative Intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The relevant statutes and legislative history, most of which the majority disregards, clearly demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent to make established biological paternity <em>determinative </em>as between competing presumed fathers. Under California\u2019s Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (\u00a7 7550 et seq.), \u201c[i]n a civil action or proceeding in which paternity is a relevant fact, the court may upon its own initiative or upon suggestion made by or on behalf of any person who is involved, and shall upon motion of any party to the action or proceeding made at a time so as not to delay the proceedings unduly, order the mother, child, and alleged father to submit to genetic tests.\u201d (\u00a7 7551.) \u201cIf the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the father of the child, the question of paternity <em>shall be resolved accordingly.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 7554, subd. (a), italics added.) \u201c[I]f the court finds that the paternity index, as calculated by the [qualified] experts . . . , is 100 or greater,\u201d then \u201c[t]here is a rebuttable presumption ... of paternity,\u201d which \u201caffect[s] the burden of proof\u2019 and \u201cmay be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (\u00a7 7555, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The implications of these provisions for the case now before us are unmistakable. Given the undisputed fact that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s biological father, genetic tests done pursuant to section 7551 would surely have shown that Paul \u201cis not the father of\u2019 Jesusa (\u00a7 7554, subd. (a)) and that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s father. Based on such results, section 7554, subdivision (a) would have <em>required </em>that \u201cthe question of [Paul\u2019s] paternity ... be <em>resolved </em>accordingly\u201d (italics added), that is, with a judicial determination that he is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Jesusa\u2019s father. Such a judicial determination would necessarily and conclusively have rebutted the presumption under section 7611 that Paul is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that point, only Heriberto would have still been a presumed father under section 7611. Moreover, based on the test results, Heriberto would also have enjoyed \u201ca rebuttable presumption ... of paternity\u201d under section 7555, subdivision (a), and there is no evidence in the record to rebut this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The paternity determination should be no different in this case simply because testing was not actually performed. At the very first hearing, Jesusa\u2019s mother stated that Heriberto is the biological father, and no one has ever contended otherwise. The juvenile court expressly \u201cmade a finding that [Heriberto] is the biological father.\u201d Where, as here, the parties all agree as to who the biological father is, we should not insist that they go through pointless and invasive test procedures that would involve considerable expense and would significantly delay resolution of dependency actions. As the majority notes, such delays would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s \u201cgoal\u201d that dependency actions \u201cbe resolved expeditiously.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 625; see <em>In re Malinda S. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 368, 384 [272 Cal.Rptr. 787, 795 P.2d 1244] [noting state\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in resolving child\u2019s status without unnecessary delay]; <em>Marlene M. v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1151 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 104] [\u201cintent of the Legislature, especially with regard to young children, is that the dependency process proceed with deliberate speed and without undue delay\u201d].) Moreover, where, as here, one of the presumed fathers is also the biological father, the legislative policy decision these statutes reflect\u2014that biological paternity is determinative\u2014should be of controlling weight in determining which presumption is, \u201con the facts . . . founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Although the UPA does not expressly provide that one presumed father\u2019s established biological paternity necessarily rebuts the presumption of another presumed father under subdivision (a) of section 7611, that conclusion is evident from the statutory framework as a whole. In addition to defining specific presumptions in subdivisions (a) through (d), section 7611 of the UPA incorporates by reference the presumptions set forth in sections 7540 and 7576. Section 7540 establishes a presumption that \u201cthe child of a wife cohabiting with her husband ... is ... a child of the marriage.\u201d Although the presumption purports to be \u201cconclusive!]\u201d (\u00a7 7540), it is not; \u201c[notwithstanding\u201d the presumption, \u201cif the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed by the evidence, based on blood tests performed pursuant to [section 7551], are that the husband is not the father of the child, the question of paternity of the husband <em>shall be resolved accord</em>ingly.\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subd. (a), italics added.) Parties with standing to request such testing must do so within \u201ctwo years from the child\u2019s date of birth.\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subds. (b), (c).) Section 7576, subdivision (a), establishes a \u201cpresumption,\u201d with \u201cthe same force and effect as the presumption under Section 7540,\u201d that the child of a man and woman executing a voluntary declaration of paternity before January 1, 1997, \u201cis ... the man\u2019s child.\u201d Although this presumption also purports to be \u201cconclusive!]\u201d (\u00a7 7576, subd. (a)), it The legiis not; \u201cany person\u201d may rebut it \u201cby requesting blood or genetic tests pursuant to\u201d section 7551 within three years from the date of the declaration\u2019s execution. (\u00a7 7576, subd. (d).) Thus, the Legislature has expressly provided that, as to young children, biological proof <em>necessarily </em>rebuts even the \u201cconclusive[]\u201d presumptions under sections 7540 and section 7576, subdivision (a). Logically, if the Legislature provided that proof of biological paternity necessarily rebuts these so-called conclusive presumptions, both of which are UPA presumptions, then surely the Legislature intended that such proof would rebut the conclusive UPA presumption under section 7611, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">These same provisions alternatively show that, in addition to rebutting paternity presumptions, biological paternity should be given controlling weight in determining which unrebutted presumption is, \u201con the facts . . . founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).) Section 7576, subdivision (e), provides that if the presumption based on a voluntary paternity declaration is not rebutted, it \u201coverride[s] all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>statutory presumptions of paternity <em>except </em>a presumption arising under Section 7540 <em>or </em>[Section] <em>7555.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) By implication, the hierarchy of presumptions established by this section affirmatively demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent that the presumption under section 7555 based on biological paternity would outweigh the presumptions under subdivisions (a) through (e) of section 7611. Logically, if the presumption based on a voluntary declaration necessarily overrides the 7611 presumptions (except the conclusive presumption under section 7540), but does not necessarily override section 7555\u2019s biologically based presumption, then section 7555\u2019s biologically based presumption must also necessarily override those section 7611 presumptions. Thus, the Legislature has expressed its policy decision that the presumption of a presumed father who is also the biological father is, \u201con the facts . . . founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The legislative history of these provisions clearly supports my conclusion. The legislative command that paternity questions \u201cshall be resolved\u201d in accordance with tests conclusively showing that \u201cthe alleged father is not the father of the child\u201d (\u00a7 7554, subd. (a)) first appeared in 1953 as part of the Code of Civil Procedure (Stats. 1953, ch. 1426, \u00a7 1, p. 3013). It derives from the identically worded section 4 of the 1952 Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (1952 Act). In a prefatory note, the drafters of the 1952 Act explained that where tests conclusively show that a man is not a child\u2019s biological father, \u201cit seems intolerable for a court to permit an opposite result to be reached .... For a court to permit the establishment of paternity in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>where it is scientifically impossible to arrive at that result would seem to be a great travesty on justice.\u201d (9 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (1957) Miscellaneous Acts, 1952 Act, comrs. note No. 1, p. 103.) Thus, 50 years ago, our Legislature directed courts to give <em>controlling </em>weight to evidence conclusively disproving the biological paternity of a particular man. My conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s undisputed biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s presumption is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s command. The majority\u2019s holding that Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity is simply a \u201cfactor[]\u201d that a juvenile court is \u201cobliged\u201d to consider in weighing the competing presumptions under section 7611 (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 608) overrides that command.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion also defeats the Legislature\u2019s intent in establishing the \u201crebuttable presumption ... of paternity\u201d based on biology that is currently found in section 7555, subdivision (a). In 1986, when it first enacted this presumption, the Legislature expressly declared in an uncodified section of the enacting legislation: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature to standardize the process by which paternity is established in order to achieve a greater degree of equity and consistency in paternity determinations. The Legislature finds that the science of genetic testing has advanced to the degree that paternity determinations resulting from such testing are so reliable that the burden of proof can be shifted to the putative father.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137 [enacting Evid. Code, former \u00a7 895.5].) A legislative analysis explained that the section was necessary because, \u201c \u2018under existing law, juries, regardless of the biological facts, tend to arrive at their decisions because of very subjective factors such as the appearance of the natural mother, and the ability of the expert witnesses to explain complex matters. The results of trials on these issues <em>do not always correspond to the biological realities, </em>regardless of how overwhelming such evidence may be. In fact, under [one appellate decision], the court is free to ignore blood test evidence. This bill should standardize paternity determinations and insure that blood test findings are given appropriate consideration.\u2019 \u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3326 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) May 28, 1986, pp. 2-3.) My conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s conceded biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s presumption is consistent with and implements the Legislature\u2019s stated desire to \u201cstandardize paternity determinations and insure that\u201d such determinations \u201ccorrespond to the biological realities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 3.) The majority\u2019s conclusion that a court need only consider biological paternity as one of several \u201crelevant factors\u201d in weighing competing presumptions (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 608) is directly contrary to and defeats the Legislature\u2019s clearly stated intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In rejecting my conclusion, the majority misstates the legislative history. The Legislature\u2019s expressly declared \u201cpurpose\u201d in enacting section 7555 was not, as the majority states, to standardize \u201cthe weight accorded to genetic tests in determining <em>biological </em>paternity\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 617), but was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>to standardize \u201cthe process by which <em>paternity </em>is established in order to achieve a greater degree of equity and consistency in <em>paternity determina</em>tions.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137, italics added.) \u201cThe problem\u201d the statute addressed was not, as the majority asserts, that jurors were \u201crelying on less probative markers of <em>biological </em>paternity\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 617), but that they were making decisions \u201cregardless of the biological facts\u201d and \u201cregardless of how overwhelming\u201d evidence of \u201cthe biological realities . . . may be.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3326 (1985-1986 Reg. Sess.) May 28, .1986, pp. 2-3.) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, this legislative history says a great deal about what a court should do \u201cwhen faced with a conflict between\u201d a presumption under section 7555 based on biology and a presumption under section 7611 that is not based on biology (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618); it tells us that, in order to implement the Legislature\u2019s expressly stated intent \u201cto standardize the process by which paternity is established\u201d and \u201cto achieve a greater degree of equity and consistency in paternity determinations\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137), the presumption under section 7555 controls.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">This conclusion is consistent with a critical fact that the majority\u2019s analysis ignores: whereas the section 7611 presumptions, none of which is based on biology, are all subject to the UPA weighing process under section 7612, the presumption based on biology under section 7555 is expressly <em>not </em>subject to that weighing process. By its terms, section 7612 requires the weighing of conflicting presumptions that \u201carise under Section 7611.\u201d As explained above, the presumptions that arise under section 7611 are those specified in subdivisions (a) through (e) of that section and those incorporated by reference from \u201cChapter 1 (commencing with Section 7540) and Chapter 3 (commencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>with Section 7570) of Part 2.\u201d All of these presumptions are based on factors <em>other than </em>biology: marriage (\u00a7\u00a7 7540, 7611, subd. (a)), attempted marriage (\u00a7 7611, subds. (b), (c)), a voluntary declaration of paternity (\u00a7\u00a7 7576, 7611, subd. (e)), or conduct towards the child (\u00a7 7611, subd. (d)). The presumption based on biology under section 7555 appears in chapter <em>2 </em>of part 2, <em>not </em>in chapter 1 or chapter 3. Because the presumption under section 7555 based on biology does not \u201carise under Section 7611,\u201d it is not subject to weighing under section 7612, subdivision (b); it \u201cmay be rebutted\u201d only \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d disproving the biological facts (\u00a7 7555) and it necessarily rebuts the presumptions that arise under subdivisions (a) through (d) of section 7611. Moreover, the Legislature\u2019s exclusion of the presumption based on biology was clearly intentional, not simply an oversight. Until 1994, the only presumption incorporated by reference into the UPA was the presumption in chapter 1 of part 2 based on marriage. (\u00a7 7540; see Stats. 1993, ch. 219, \u00a7 176, p. 1670.) In 1994, the Legislature amended section 7611 to incorporate the presumption in chapter 3 of part 2 based on a voluntary declaration of paternity. (\u00a7 7576; see Stats. 1994, ch. 1269, \u00a7 53, p. 8058.) Clearly, the Legislature made a conscious decision to exclude the presumption in chapter 2 based on biology (\u00a7 7554) from the UPA\u2019s balancing process under section 7612. This choice reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent that biological paternity would <em>control </em>paternity determinations, not that it would be, as the majority asserts, simply a factor that a court must weigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Nor does the majority explain how, under its analysis, a juvenile court that is \u201cobliged\u201d to consider biological paternity even <em>can </em>take this \u201cfactor[j\u201d into account (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 608) in cases where biological paternity is not admitted. Under the majority\u2019s view, how does the juvenile court determine biological paternity where it is not admitted? If through genetic tests performed pursuant to section 7551, then, as explained above, section 7554 expressly tells us the effect of results showing that the tested man \u201cis not the father of the child\u201d; we must \u201cresolveQ\u201d \u201cthe question of [his] paternity . . . accordingly.\u201d If not through such testing, then how? The majority does not tell us.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Also supporting my conclusion is the evolution and legislative history of the \u201cconclusive[]\u201d presumption under section 7540 that \u201cthe child of a wife cohabiting with her husband ... is ... a child of the marriage.\u201d This presumption originally appeared as Evidence Code former section 621. In 1980, when the Legislature first made the presumption rebuttable with tests showing that \u201cthe husband is not the father of the child,\u201d only \u201cthe husband\u201d was given standing to move for testing and only within \u201ctwo years from the date of birth of the child.\u201d (Stats. 1980, ch. 1310, \u00a7 1, p. 4433 [amending Evid. Code, former \u00a7 621, now Fam. Code, \u00a7 7541, subd. (b)].) In 1981, the Legislature extended standing to \u201cthe mother of the child,\u201d subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>same time limit and only \u201cif the child\u2019s biological father has filed an affidavit with the court acknowledging paternity of the child.\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 1180, \u00a7 1, p. 4761 [amending Evid. Code, former \u00a7 621, now Fam. Code, \u00a7 7541, subd. (c)].) In 1990, the Legislature extended standing to a \u201cpresumed father\u201d under section 7611 and to \u201cthe child,\u201d subject to the same time limit and only \u201cfor purposes of establishing [the presumed father\u2019s] paternity.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 543, \u00a7 2, p. 2855 [amending Evid. Code, former \u00a7 621, now Fam. Code, \u00a7 7541, subd. (b)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The legislative history regarding these amendments is revealing. Regarding the 1980 legislation that first madethe conclusive presumption rebuttable by the husband, one legislative analysis explained: \u201cUnder the Uniform Parentage Act [citation], a man is presumed to be the natural father of a child if he comes within the purview of Evidence Code [former] Section 621 or meets any of the other conditions specified in Civil Code [former] Section 7004 [now, Family Code section 7611]. Except for [Evidence Code former] Section 621, all these presumptions are rebuttable and may be met by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1981 (1979-1980 Reg. Sess.) June 11, 1980, p. 2.) Thus, \u201c[i]f the conclusive presumption is . . . eliminated by proof that the parties did not live together as husband and wife, the disputable presumption [that arises under the UPA] can then be met by any kind of competent evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 3.) The analysis also explained that \u201can exception to the conclusive presumption . . . is needed to prevent in some cases an injustice . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 2.) Similar statements appear in the legislative history of the 1981 amendment that extended standing to mothers if the biological father acknowledges paternity by affidavit. After stating that \u201call\u201d of the presumptions \u201c[ujnder the Uniform Parentage Act ... are rebuttable\u201d except the conclusive presumption under Evidence Code former section 621 one analysis explained that the 1981 amendment \u201cwould give the child\u2019s mother equal standing with the husband\u201d to request testing and to \u201cprevent the [husband\u2019s] conclusive presumption of paternity from operating especially <em>where the biological father wishes to establish paternity. . . </em>.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 207 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Feb. 11, 1981, p. 2, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">These statements demonstrate several important things. First, they show the Legislature\u2019s express recognition that the conclusive presumption now found in section 7540 is a <em>UPA </em>presumption and the Legislature\u2019s intent to make that <em>UPA </em>presumption <em>necessarily rebutted </em>by proof that the presumed father is not the biological father; the amended statute commands that \u201cthe question of paternity of the husband <em>shall be resolved </em>accordingly,\u201d that is, in accordance with the proof that \u201cthe husband is not the father of the child.\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subd. (a), italics added.) Second, they demonstrate that, in making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the conclusive presumption rebuttable by the husband, the Legislature intended to make that presumption more like the .other presumptions under the UPA, all of which were already rebuttable. Thus, if a husband\u2019s otherwise <em>conclusive </em>UPA presumption of paternity is necessarily rebutted by proof he is not the biological father, then the nonconclusive UPA presumptions must also be necessarily rebutted by such proof; in establishing the limited exception to the conclusive presumption, the Legislature did not intend to make that presumption <em>more </em>rebuttable than the already rebuttable UPA presumptions. Finally, as especially relevant here, they demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent that biological paternity would <em>necessarily </em>rebut even an otherwise conclusive UPA presumption <em>\u201cwhere the biological father wishes to establish paternity. . . </em>.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Assem. Bill No. 207 (1981-1982 Reg. Sess.) Feb. 11, 1981, p. 2, italics added.) That is precisely the situation here; Heriberto, the biological father, formally \u201crequested] that the court enter a judgment of [his] paternity.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The legislative history of the 1990 amendment extending standing to presumed fathers is perhaps even more significant. Regarding the \u201c[n]eed for\u201d this change, one legislative analysis explained: \u201c[T]his measure would rectify those situations where unwed biological fathers are foreclosed from establishing paternity and precluded from continuing a supportive relationship with a child who was bom while the mother was married and cohabiting with another man. [It] . . . allow [s] a father who has demonstrated an interest in raising and providing for his child in a familial relationship the opportunity to establish paternity under the above factual circumstances. [][]... With more children bom out of wedlock, to women who may be technically married, but no longer living with their husbands, . . . legislation must be adopted which addresses the problems of unwed fathers who want to become involved and be responsible for the welfare of their children.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 27, 1990, p. 3.) Another analysis explained that the amendment specifically targeted \u201cthose situations wherein a mother, a biological father, and child have lived together as a family, and thereupon, the mother departs to return to a husband or to live elsewhere and the biological father does not have access to the procedures that are otherwise available to a divorced father for determination of\u2019 custody or visitation.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 4, 1990, p. 3.) The amendment was meant to change the fact that, under then existing law, where a mother\u2019s husband qualified for the conclusive presumption under Evidence Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>former section 621, a biological father who also qualified as \u201ca presumed father [could] be refused visitation rights regardless of his established relationship with the child.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Report on Sen. Bill No. 2015 (Apr. 4, 1990) p. 3.) The Legislature passed the amendment despite the contention of opponents that it would \u201cseriously erode[]\u201d the \u201cpublic policy of promoting the integrity of an intact family unit, and providing certainty to the relationship of a child in such a family.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>p. 4.) These statements, and the 1990 amendment itself, demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent that where a man who is a presumed father under section 7611 seeks to establish his paternity within a child\u2019s first two years of life, proof of his biological paternity conclusively and necessarily rebuts any other man\u2019s UPA presumption, even the otherwise conclusive presumption of the mother\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The facts here closely match the factual scenario the Legislature specifically had in mind when it gave presumed fathers standing to rebut the otherwise conclusive UPA presumption of a husband\u2019s paternity under section 7540. Jesusa\u2019s mother left Paul, whom she said she \u201csees ... as a brother\u201d rather than a husband, and moved in with Heriberto three years before the dependency proceeding began on April 4, 2001. She lived with Heriberto when Jesusa was conceived and when she was bom (May 1999), and the three of them lived together until the dependency proceeding began, when Jesusa was less than 23 months old. Thus, during the relevant events, although Jesusa\u2019s mother was still technically married to Paul, she was living with Heriberto. Moreover, Jesusa\u2019s mother reported that Heriberto had \u201calways been very loving and gentle to\u201d Jesusa. Finally, on April 13, 2001, when Heriberto filed a formal request in the dependency action for a judgment declaring his paternity, Jesusa was still less than two years old. Thus, this is precisely the type of case where the Legislature intended that a UPA presumption\u2014which, by definition, is not based on biology\u2014would necessarily be rebutted by proof that another presumed father is the biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The majority\u2019s response on this point is erroneous. Isolating a single phrase from the legislative reports\u2014\u201c \u2018the <em>opportunity </em>to establish paternity\u2019 \u201d\u2014the majority asserts that \u201c[a] mere <em>opportunity </em>for the unwed biological father to establish paternity hardly supports\u201d the conclusion \u201cthat biology is <em>necessarily </em>determinative.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618.) However, as I have shown, a review of the entire legislative history, rather than a single phrase taken out of context, demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to make biology determinative where a biological father who also is a presumed father under section 7611 seeks to rebut another man\u2019s presumption. Moreover, the majority\u2019s response ignores the fact that section 7541, subdivision (a), <em>expressly </em>makes biology determinative, by providing that \u201cthe question of paternity\u201d of the tested presumed father \u201cshall be resolved according[]\u201d to results showing that he \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>not the father.\u201d In this regard, and contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, section 7541 is not at all \u201csimilar to\u201d the statute the Colorado Supreme Court construed in <em>N.A.H. v. S.L.S. </em>(Colo. 2000) 9 P.3d 354. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618.) The Colorado statute merely provided that a \u201cpresumption of legitimacy\u201d that is not based on biology \u201cis overcome\u201d by testing showing that the presumed father \u201cis not the parent of the child.\u201d <em>(N.A.H., supra, </em>at pp. 360-361.) Section 7541, subdivision (a), does not provide that such testing merely overcomes a presumption; it provides that \u201cpaternity . . . shall be resolved according!]\u201d to test results showing that the tested presumed father \u201cis not the father of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The majority is incorrect that my construction of these statutes renders part of section 7612, subdivision (a), \u201cmeaningless.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 613.) As the majority observes, section 7541 specifies that the section 7540 presumption \u201cis rebutted by evidence of biological fatherhood,\u201d and section 7576, subdivision (e), specifies that a presumption based on a voluntary paternity declaration \u201cwould not override a presumption of paternity arising under section 7555, the genetic testing provision.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 613.) The majority next correctly observes that subdivision (a) of section 7612 provides: \u201cExcept as provided in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 7540) and Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 7570) of Part 2 . . . , a presumption under Section 7611 is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 613.) However, the conclusion the majority reaches based on these provisions is incorrect. That the Legislature \u201cexpressly <em>except[ed\u00a1\u201d </em>the presumptions under section 7540 and section 7576 \u201cfrom the operation of section 7612, subdivision (a) and [made] <em>separate </em>provision for the legal effect of biology in those circumstances\u201d does not, as the majority asserts, show the Legislature\u2019s <em>\u201cbelie\\f\\ that section 7612, subdivision (a) [does] not necessarily accord primacy to </em>biology.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 613, 614.) Rather, it shows that the Legislature wanted to impose limits with respect to <em>these presumptions </em>that do not exist with respect to the <em>other </em>section 7611 presumptions. Specifically, as the majority recognizes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 608, fn. 6), through the \u201cexcepting\u201d clause of section 7612, subdivision (a), the Legislature imposed time limits for rebutting the presumptions under sections 7540 and 7576 that do not apply to the other section 7611 presumptions. (See \u00a7 7541, subds. (c), (d) [two-year time limit]; \u00a7 7576, subd. (d) [three-year time limit].) That is, the \u201cexcepting\u201d clause takes the section 7540 and 7576 presumptions out of the general rule that otherwise applies. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, my construction does not render \u201cmeaningless\u201d the \u201c \u2018excepting\u2019 clause\u201d in subdivision (a) of section 7612.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 614.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>On the other hand, the majority\u2019s construction renders meaningless all of subdivision (b) of section 7612. As I have explained, section 7612 gives rise to two separate questions: (1) under subdivision (a), whether a presumed father\u2019s presumption is rebutted; and (2) under subdivision (b), where there are competing <em>unrebutted </em>presumptions, which one \u201con the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s construction, these questions are exactly the same, and a court looks to the exact same factors to answer each. The majority holds that courts must \u201cconsider the child\u2019s best interest and public policy in determining\u201d under subdivision (a) of section 7612 \u201cwhether [a] presumption is rebutted.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 616.) Similarly, the majority holds that a court \u201c \u2018must take the best interests of the child into account as part of policy and logic in resolving competing presumptions\u2019 \u201d under subdivision (b) of section 7612. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 607-608.) Thus, although the term \u201cbest interests\u201d does <em>not </em>appear in either subdivision (a) or subdivision (b) of section 7612, the majority reads that term into both. In affirming the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Paul\u2019s presumption was not rebutted, the majority weighs Paul\u2019s \u201crelationship\u201d to Jesusa, her half siblings, and her mother against the fact that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s biological father and he lived with her through her infancy. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 607.) Likewise, in affirming the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Paul\u2019s presumption is weightier, the majority weighs the exact same factors, restated almost verbatim. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 607.) Under the majority\u2019s analysis and construction, subdivision (b) of section 7612 is entirely useless; it adds nothing that is not already contained in subdivision (a) of the same section. Thus, it is the majority\u2019s construction, not mine, that renders part of section 7612 meaningless. My construction gives effect to all parts of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The majority\u2019s construction also produces absurd results. As noted, the \u201cconclusive\u201d presumption under section 7540 is also a section 7611 UPA presumption, and the majority concedes that, under section 7541, subdivision (a), this \u201cconclusive presumption ... is rebutted by evidence of biological fatherhood.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 603.) However, under the majority\u2019s view, the nonconclusive presumptions under section 7611 are not necessarily rebutted by evidence of biological fatherhood. Thus, according to the majority, evidence of biological fatherhood necessarily rebuts the \u201cconclusive[j\u201d UPA presumption of a husband who is cohabiting with his wife at the time of conception (\u00a7 7540), but not the nonconclusive UPA presumption of a husband who is not cohabiting with his wife (\u00a7 7611, subd. (a)), or of a man who marries the mother after the child\u2019s birth (\u00a7 7611, subd. (c)), or of a man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>who incorrectly believed he had validly married the mother (\u00a77611, subd. (b)). Moreover, a test result showing that a husband is \u201cnot the father\u201d does not merely rebut the presumption under section 7540, it <em>requires </em>that the husband\u2019s \u201cpaternity be resolved accordingly,\u201d that is, with a judgment that he is not the father. (\u00a7 7541,. subd. (a).) Such a judgment necessarily precludes the husband from establishing his paternity claim under some other provision. Thus, under the majority\u2019s view, a husband is actually better off if he is not cohabiting with his wife at the time of conception and therefore does <em>not </em>qualify for the \u201cconclusive\u201d presumption under section 7540. Under these circumstances, he would qualify for only a nonconclusive presumption under section 7611 and, because section 7541 does not apply, he could still be declared the father despite another presumed father\u2019s established biological paternity. It is highly doubtful that the Legislature intended these absurd results.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The majority\u2019s attempt to explain these results simply demonstrates the absurdity of its construction. The majority asserts that it is incorrect to \u201ccompar[e]\u201d the \u201cpresumption in section 7540\u201d to the other section 7611 presumptions because the former, \u201c[u]nlike\u201d the latter, is \u201cnot really a presumption at all but is instead \u2018a rule of substantive law.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 614.) However, the characterization of the section 7540 presumption as a \u201csubstantive rule of law\u201d, is ours, not the Legislature\u2019s. <em>(.Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 619.) Section 7540 provides that the child of a wife cohabiting with her husband is \u201cpresumed\u201d to be the child of the marriage. Similarly, section 7611 expressly provides that a man \u201cis presumed\u201d to be a child\u2019s natural father \u201cif he meets the conditions provided in\u201d section 7540 \u201cor in\u201d subdivisions (a) through (e) of section 7611. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, section 7540, like subdivisions (a) through (e) of section 7611, creates a paternity presumption,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In any event, even if, as the majority asserts, section 7540 alone states a substantive rule of law, then the presumption it establishes should be <em>harder </em>to rebut than the other section 7611 presumptions, not <em>easier; </em>yet, under the majority\u2019s construction, evidence that necessarily rebuts the section 7540 presumption does not necessarily rebut the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>other section 7611 presumptions. The majority also errs in suggesting that the other section 7611 presumptions are unlike the section 7540 presumption in that they \u201cwere \u2018 \u201cestablished to implement some public policy <em>other than </em>to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 614.) As we have explained, the section 7540 presumption and the other section 7611 presumptions <em>all </em>serve <em>the same </em>public policy. <em>(In re Nicholas H. </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 56, 65 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 146, 46 R3d 932] <em>(Nicholas H.)\\ Estate of Cornelious </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 461, 465 [198 Cal.Rptr. 543, 674 P.2d 245] <em>(Cornelious).) </em>Finally, the majority\u2019s analysis is not aided by its observation that, \u201cunlike the section 7540 presumption,\u201d the other section 7611 presumptions \u201cmay be rebutted \u2018only by clear and convincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 614.) The standard of proof for rebutting the section 7540 presumption is actually higher; that presumption is overcome only if <em>\u201call </em>the experts\u201d agree that \u201cthe husband is not the father.\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subd. (a), italics added.) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the difference in the applicable standard of proof again demonstrates that the Legislature intended to make the section 7611 presumption <em>harder </em>to rebut than the other section 7611 presumptions, and that proof rebutting the section 7540 presumption therefore <em>necessarily </em>rebuts the other section 7611 presumptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">My conclusion that, under our current statutory scheme, one presumed father\u2019s biological paternity necessarily rebuts another man\u2019s presumption is consistent with the law as it existed before the Legislature adopted the UPA in 1975. In <em>Kusior, </em>we considered the rebuttable presumption under Civil Code former sections 194 and 195 in favor of a mother\u2019s husband where the child was bom within 10 months of the dissolution of marriage. <em>(Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 607.) Blood tests taken \u201cpursuant to\u201d the California Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity\u2014specifically, Code of Civil Procedure former section 1980.3, which was substantively identical to the first sentence of Family Code section 7551 (see Stats. 1953, ch. 1426, \u00a7 1, p. 3013)\u2014showed that the mother\u2019s husband \u201ccould not have been the father of the child . . . .\u201d <em>(Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 607.) We held that, in adopting California\u2019s Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity, the Legislature made \u201ca legislative determination . . . that blood test evidence is conclusive.\u201d <em>(Kusior, </em>at p. 619.) We relied for this conclusion on Code of Civil Procedure former section 1980.6, which, in language identical to Family Code section 7554, provided that \u201cif \u2018the conclusions of all the experts . . . are that the alleged father is not the father of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kusior, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d at p. 620, fn. omitted.) \u201c[U]nder th[is] language,\u201d we explained, \u201cwhere the tests so taken establish that the mother\u2019s husband could not be the father of the child the rebuttable presumptions of paternity <em>are conclusively </em>rebutted.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Indeed, under California law before the UPA\u2019s passage, evidence other than <em>tests\u2014including an admission of biological </em>paternity\u2014showing that a presumed father was not the biological father <em>conclusively </em>rebutted a presumption. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1859) 13 Cal. 87, 96 <em>(Baker), </em>the evidence showed that a woman had admitted to her brother that her husband was not her child\u2019s biological father. We first held that, absent evidence of collusion, the admission was admissible because \u201cthe public can have no interest in suppressing the truth.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 94.) We then held that the woman\u2019s admission \u201cplaced\u201d her child\u2019s paternity \u201cupon a stranger beyond a doubt\u201d and, thus, necessarily \u201coverc[a]me\u201d the husband\u2019s rebuttable presumption. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 101.) Here, of course, not only does Jesusa\u2019s mother concede Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity, but both Heriberto and Paul do so as well. Moreover, there is not even a hint of collusion in this case. Thus, under California law before passage of the UPA, Heriberto\u2019s conceded biological paternity would have conclusively and necessarily rebutted Paul\u2019s presumption. (See also <em>Anderson v. Anderson </em>(1931) 214 Cal. 414, 417 [5 P.2d 881] [because evidence established biological paternity by \u201ca stranger . . . beyond question,\u201d husband\u2019s presumption \u201cno longer obtains\u201d]; <em>Hughes v. Hughes </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 781, 784-787 [271 P.2d 172].)</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Nothing suggests that, in adopting the UPA, the Legislature intended to alter the determinative effect of biological paternity under California law in cases involving competing paternity claims. The UPA\u2019s purpose was not to enact fundamental changes regarding the role of biology in the law of paternity, but was simply to replace the concept of legitimacy with the concept of the parent and child relationship and to specify a procedure for establishing that relationship. (Legis. Counsel\u2019s Dig., Sen. Bill No. 347 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) 2 Stats. 1975, Summary Dig., p. 344; <em>Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 88-89.) According to one legislative analysis, \u201c[a]ll of the presumptions established by [the UPA] correspond[ed] <em>to current law.\u201d </em>(Sen. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 347 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) May 8, 1975, pp. 15-16, italics added.) For example, the rebuttable presumption at issue in <em>Kusior, </em>which we held was conclusively rebutted by tests showing that the presumed father was not the biological father, was the same rebuttable presumption now contained in section 7611, subdivision (a). The legislative history of the UPA also explained that the UPA presumptions \u201cmay be rebutted ... by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 347 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 7, 1975, p. 2.) Similarly, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which drafted the 1973 Uniform Parentage Act (1973 Act) from which California\u2019s UPA was derived <em>(Adoption of Michael H, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 1050), explained that the 1973 Act\u2019s presumptions are rebuttable \u201c[/]\u00ab <em>accordance with current law </em>in most states relating to the rebuttal of a presumption of \u2018legitimacy.\u2019 \u201d (9B West\u2019s U. Laws Ann. (2001) U. Parentage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Act (1973) com. to \u00a7 4, p. 394, italics added.) As explained above, when this comment was written, the law in California provided that rebuttable presumptions <em>were conclusively </em>rebutted by proof\u2014such as lack of intercourse, blood tests, the husband\u2019s sterility or impotency, <em>or admissions </em>by the mother\u2014that the presumed father was not the <em>biological </em>father.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The law in other states was the same. (See generally, Annot., Proof of Husband\u2019s Impotency or Sterility as Rebutting Presumption of Legitimacy (1978) 84 A.L.R.3d 495; Annot., Presumption of Legitimacy, or of Paternity, of Child Conceived or Bom Before Marriage (1958) 57 A.L.R.2d 729.) The majority\u2019s conclusion that, despite one presumed father\u2019s conceded biological paternity, a court may decline to find another man\u2019s presumption rebutted based on a weighing of policy considerations, constitutes a revolutionary change in terms of the law as it existed when California\u2019s UPA and the 1973 Act were drafted and approved. Nothing in the legislative history of the UPA indicates that our Legislature even considered, much less intended to make, this revolutionary change. On the contrary, as explained, the legislative history shows that the UPA was intended to <em>preserve </em>existing law regarding the determinative effect of biological paternity in cases involving competing paternity claims.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Indeed, the very language of the UPA demonstrates that the majority\u2019s constmction is inconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent. As noted above, the UPA specifies a procedure for establishing \u201c[t]he parent and child relationship\u201d (\u00a7 7610), which the UPA defines as \u201cthe legal relationship existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>between a child and the child\u2019s <em>natural </em>or adoptive parents . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7601, italics added.) The particular UPA procedure at issue here is that for establishing \u201c[t]he parent and child relationship . . . [b]etween a child and the <em>natural </em>father.\u201d (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b), italics added.) Under well-established principles of statutory construction, in construing these provisions, \u201c[w]e look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1172 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 464, 52 P.3d 648].) The usual and ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cnatural parent\u201d and \u201cnatural father\u201d is, respectively, the <em>biological </em>parent and the <em>biological </em>father. (See <em>Lehr v. Robertson </em>(1983) 463 U.S. 248, 262 [77 L.Ed.2d 614, 103 S.Ct. 2985] [\u201cthe <em>biological </em>connection . . . offers the <em>natural father </em>an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring\u201d].) As Black\u2019s Law Dictionary explains, the term \u201cnatural father\u201d is \u201c[a]lso termed <em>biological father\u201d </em>and means \u201c[t]he man who impregnated the child\u2019s natural mother.\u201d (Black\u2019s Law Dict. (7th ed. 1999) p. 623, col. 1.) For years, we have construed the term \u201cnatural\u201d parent, both in interpreting the UPA and. in other contexts, in accordance with its common and ordinary meaning, that is, as meaning \u201cbiological\u201d parent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Based on the common and ordinary meaning of the terms \u201cnatural parent\u201d (\u00a7 7601) and \u201cnatural father\u201d (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b)), the UPA\u2019s purpose is to specify a procedure for identifying a child\u2019s <em>biological </em>father and legally establishing his relationship to his child. Thus, under the statute\u2019s plain meaning, although Paul\u2019s marriage to Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural mother\u201d initially qualified him under section 7611, subdivision (a), for a presumption that he is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father,\u201d Heriberto\u2019s conceded biological paternity constitutes \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that necessarily rebuts the presumption. (\u00a7 7612, subd. (a); see <em>In re Zacharia D., supra, </em>6 Cal.4th at p. 450, fn. 18 [UPA presumption of one man \u201cwas rebutted by blood tests establishing that [another man] was the biological father\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Relevant legislative history confirms that the Legislature understood and used the term \u201cnatural father\u201d in the UPA in accordance with its ordinary meaning, that is, \u201cbiological father.\u201d As explained above, in 1980, the Legislature first made the \u201cconclusive[]\u201d presumption under section 7540 rebuttable by giving \u201cthe husband\u201d standing to obtain testing that would necessarily rebut the presumption. (Stats. 1980, ch. 1310, \u00a7 1, p. 4433 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>[amending Evid. Code, former \u00a7 621, now \u00a7 7541, subd. (b)].)

In these comments, the term \u201cnatural father\u201d was clearly being used to mean \u201cbiological father.\u201d Legislative analyses of the 1990 amendment that extended standing to \u201cpresumed father[s]\u201d under the UPA (\u00a7 7541, subd. (b)), similarly used the term \u201cnatural father\u201d to mean \u201cbiological father.\u201d Several of those analyses explained that, under then existing law, standing to rebut the otherwise conclusive presumption under section 7540 was limited to the mother\u2019s husband and the mother \u201cif the <em>natural </em>father has filed an affidavit acknowledging paternity.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 6, 1990, p. 2, italics added.) The statute these reports described actually provides standing to the mother \u201cif the child\u2019s <em>biological </em>father has filed an affidavit with the court acknowledging paternity . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subd. (c), italics added.) Another analysis explained that the amendment enables \u201ca presumed father\u201d under the UPA to obtain blood tests \u201cto establish himself to be the <em>biological </em>father.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Republican Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) July 7, 1990, italics added.) As already explained, the UPA sets forth a procedure for establishing a parent-child relationship \u201c[b]etween a child and the <em>natural </em>father . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b), italics added.) Still another analysis explained that the amendment addressed problems arising under the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D. </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 110 [105 L.Ed.2d 91, 109 S.Ct. 2333], where \u201c[t]he dissenting opinions argued that a <em>natural </em>father\u2019s <em>biological </em>link to his child combined with a substantial parent-child relationship maintained between them, guarantees the natural father a liberty interest in his relationship with child.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 4, 1990, p. 4, italics added.) By interchangeably using the terms \u201cbiological\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d in discussing one of the presumptions under the UPA (\u00a7 7611), these analyses clearly demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s understanding and intent that the term \u201cnatural father\u201d in the UPA (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b)) would be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning, that is, \u201cbiological father.\u201d The logical conclusion based on this ordinary meaning is that a presumed father\u2019s conceded biological paternity necessarily rebuts the presumption that another man is \u201cthe natural father\u201d of a child.(\u00a7 7611.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>This conclusion is consistent with our analysis in <em>Johnson. </em>There, we had to resolve the competing maternity claims of two women: one who gave birth to the child and another who had provided the egg that was implanted into the first. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 87.) We first reasoned that the UPA, which \u201capplies to <em>any </em>parentage determination,\u201d governed the issue. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 89.) We then reasoned that, because both women had a <em>biological </em>claim to maternity, \u201cthe [UPA] presumptions contained in [section 7611] <em>do not apply.\u201d (Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 91.) These presumptions, we explained, \u201cdescribe situations in which substantial evidence points to a particular man as the <em>natural father </em>of the child. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.) We then held that, because both women had established a biological basis for their claim, \u201cthere [was] no need to resort to an evidentiary presumption to ascertain the identity of the <em>natural </em>mother.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 91, italics added.) We next expressly <em>rejected </em>the very approach the majority adopts here: that courts <em>applying the UPA </em>should \u201cdecide <em>parentage </em>based on the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 93, fn. 10.) We explained that under our statutory framework, \u201cthe determination of parentage must precede, and should not be dictated by, eventual custody decisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We also explained that concerns about the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d should be addressed, not through <em>parentage </em>determinations, but through our \u201cdependency laws, which are designed to protect <em>all </em>children irrespective of the manner of birth or conception.\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>We ultimately held that, in resolving the competing maternity claims \u201cunder the [UPA],\u201d \u201cthe parties\u2019 intentions\u201d controlled, rather than the child\u2019s best interests. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 95.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Our analysis in <em>Johnson </em>confirms that <em>under the UPA, </em>in resolving <em>competing </em>claims of parentage\u2014as opposed to custody-\u2014-biological parentage <em>controls </em>over a mere presumption that is not based on biology, notwithstanding the child\u2019s best interests. Under that analysis, Paul\u2019s UPA presumption does not apply in this case because Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s undisputed biological father; if, as we held in <em>Johnson, </em>the UPA presumptions do not apply when <em>both </em>claimants establish <em>biological </em>parentage, then certainly the undisputed biological paternity of one presumed father necessarily rebuts the presumption of another presumed father. Concerns that Heriberto is not an appropriate father for Jesusa should be addressed, not through this paternity determination, but through our laws on custody and termination of parental rights. (See <em>In re Marriage of Moschetta, supra, </em>25 Cal.App.4th at p. 1226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>[\u00a77611 presumptions, which \u201cserve the function of settling questions of biological parenthood,\u201d are inapplicable where there is \u201cno question of <em>biological </em>parenthood\u201d because \u201c[a]ll parties know . . . who is genetically related to whom\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The majority\u2019s discussion of <em>Johnson </em>is erroneous. The majority asserts that <em>Johnson </em>is not pertinent here because section 7612 contains a \u201cdirective\u201d that \u201cthe child\u2019s best interests should be considered in making parentage decisions.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 619.) The majority is incorrect; section 7612 does not even mention the child\u2019s best interests. That gloss on section 7612 is solely a creation of the majority\u2019s; as explained above, the majority reads the phrase \u201cbest interests\u201d into <em>both </em>subdivision (a) and subdivision (b) of that section.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, in <em>Johnson, </em>when we held that parentage claims should not be based on the child\u2019s best interests, we were not merely \u201cselecting a policy\u201d; we were, as we are here, \u201cgiving effect to\u201d the UPA. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618.) The majority\u2019s holding \u201crepudiate^]\u201d that statutory construction. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618.) Finally, the majority\u2019s discussion ignores <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>conclusion that <em>because </em>the purpose of the UPA\u2019s presumptions is to identify \u201ca particular man as the <em>natural father </em>of the child,\u201d where the biological evidence establishes \u201cthe identity of the natural [parent],\u201d the presumptions \u201cdo not apply.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 91 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 494, 851 P.2d 776].) Under that conclusion, because Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s biological father, Paul\u2019s presumption does not apply.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">In rejecting my construction of section 7612, subdivision (a), the majority, contrary to governing principles, expressly declines to \u201cconstrue the [statutory] scheme\u201d of which section 7612 is a part. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 617.) The majority also fails to consider most of the legislative history I have discussed, and offers no legislative history supporting its own construction. Nor does the majority consider the common and ordinary meaning of the term \u201cnatural father\u201d or offer any alternative meaning of that phrase. Finally, the majority disregards <em>Johnson, </em>which specifically construed the UPA in the context of <em>competing </em>parentage claims. Instead, in construing section 7612, subdivision (a), the majority relies principally on a decision that did <em>not </em>involve competing parentage claims: <em>Nicholas H\u201e supra, </em>28 Cal.4th 56. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Purportedly \u201c[ajpplying\u201d <em>Nicholas H., </em>the majority concludes that one presumed father\u2019s conceded biological paternity \u201cdoes not necessarily defeat\u201d the competing presumption of another man who is not the biological father. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">qFor several reasons, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Nicholas H. </em>is misplaced. First and foremost, <em>Nicholas H. </em>actually <em>supports </em>my conclusion that, in this case of <em>competing </em>paternity claims, Heriberto\u2019s conceded biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s presumption. The \u201cquestion\u201d we faced in <em>Nicholas H. </em>was \u201cwhether a presumption arising under section 7611[] is, under section 7612[, subdivision (a),] <em>necessarily </em>rebutted when the presumed father . . . admits that he is not the biological father of the child.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 58, italics added.) We held that such an admission does not <em>necessarily </em>rebut a presumption where the \u201cpresumed father is providing a loving home for\u201d the child and the child\u2019s \u201cbiological father . . . has shown no interest in\u201d establishing his paternity or accepting \u201cthe privilege and responsibility of fathering\u201d the child. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 58-59.) \u201cRather,\u201d we explained, the kind of action \u201cthe Legislature had in mind\u201d where a section 7611 would be rebutted is one \u201cin which another candidate is vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut a section 7611Q presumption in order to perfect his claim . . . .\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) Of course, the case now before us is <em>precisely </em>the kind of case that, according to <em>Nicholas H., </em>\u201cthe Legislature had in mind\u201d as one in which a section 7611 presumption would be rebutted by another man\u2019s biological paternity; Heriberto, who is both the biological father <em>and </em>a presumed father in his own right, \u201cis vying for parental rights and seeks to rebut\u201d Paul\u2019s section 7611 presumption \u201cin order to perfect his claim.\u201d <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, <em>Nicholas H. supports </em>the conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s conceded biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s presumption.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Relevant legislative history confirms that the distinction we drew in <em>Nicholas </em>H.\u2014between cases where the biological father seeks to establish his paternity claim and cases where he does not\u2014correctly reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent. As explained above, when the Legislature extended standing to contest section 7540\u2019s conclusive presumption to a \u201cpresumed father\u201d under section 7611 and to \u201cthe child,\u201d it did so only \u201cfor purposes of establishing [the presumed father\u2019s] paternity.\u201d (Stats. 1990, ch. 543, \u00a7 2, p. 2855 [amending Evid. Code, former \u00a7 621, now Fam. Code, \u00a7 7541, subd. (b)].) According to the amendment\u2019s legislative history, the Legislature specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>included this limitation to \u201cclarify that the purpose for\u201d giving presumed fathers and the child standing was \u201cto establish the paternity of the presumed father\u201d and to prevent \u201ca presumed father (who may not be the biologic father) or the child [from] fil[ing] a motion to have the husband determined as not the biologic father, with no intent of obtaining a legal determination to establish paternity in someone else.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 4, 1990, p. 6.) At the same time the Legislature added this limitation, it rejected a proposed amendment that would have deleted the restriction barring a mother from contesting the husband\u2019s conclusive presumption unless \u201cthe child\u2019s biological father has filed an affidavit with the court acknowledging paternity of the child.\u201d (\u00a7 7541, subd. (c).) One legislative analysis explained that this proposed amendment could, \u201cif the mother establishes her husband\u2019s lack of paternity,\u201d leave the child <em>\u201clegally </em>without a father,\u201d which \u201cwould be contrary to public policy.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 2015 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 4, 1990, p. 6.) This legislative history supports our statement in <em>Nicholas H. </em>that the case now before us\u2014in which a biological father who is also a presumed father seeks \u201cto perfect his claim\u201d and to rebut the presumption of another man\u2014is precisely the kind of case \u201cthe Legislature had in mind\u201d as an \u201c <em>\u2018appropriate action </em>\u201d where the presumption would be rebutted. <em>(Nicholas K, supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Nicholas H. </em>supports my conclusion in another important respect. The child in <em>Nicholas H. </em>was more than four years old when the dependency petition was filed <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at pp. 59-60), and, in reaching our conclusion, we quoted the following statement from <em>Cornelious, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pages 465-466: \u201c \u2018[I]n the case of an older child [over two years of age] the familial relationship between the child and the man purporting to be the child\u2019s father is considerably more palpable than the biological relationship of actual paternity.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 CalAth at p. 65.) This quotation from <em>Cornelious </em>was taken from a discussion explaining why the Legislature, when it gave mothers and their husbands the right to contest the conclusive presumption under section 7540, required that the right be exercised within two years of the child\u2019s birth. <em>(Cornelious, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 465-A66.) Significantly, that discussion also explained that the Legislature\u2019s \u201cprobable rationale\u201d for this limitation was that \u201c \u2018[i]n the case of a young child\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, a child <em>under </em>two years of age\u2014\u201c \u2018the most palpable relation that anyone has to the child is a biological relationship/' (I<em>d. </em>at p. 465.) This discussion supports my conclusion that, at least when the child is less than two years old, the Legislature intended that biological paternity would be controlling. In the case now before us, Jesusa was less than two years old when the dependency petition was filed and when Heriberto formally asked the court to enter a judgment declaring his paternity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Thus, by quoting and relying on the discussion in <em>Cornelious, Nicholas H. </em>supports my conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s presumption.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Beyond summarizing <em>Nicholas H., </em>the majority\u2019s actual analysis under that decision is as unconvincing and conclusory as it is brief. After repeating <em>Nicholas H.\u2019s </em>observation that section 7612, subdivision (a), provides that a presumption \u201cmay be rebutted in an appropriate action,\u201d the majority asserts: \u201cThis indicates that the Legislature did not envision an <em>automatic </em>preference for biological fathers, even if the biological father has come forward to assert his rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604.) The majority\u2019s logic is faulty; the mere fact that section 7612, subdivision (a), makes the presumptions rebut-table \u201cin an appropriate action\u201d does <em>not </em>indicate a legislative intent not to make biology determinative where \u201cthe biological father has come forward to assert his rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604.) On the contrary, as I have explained, in <em>Nicholas H., </em>we stated that this is <em>precisely </em>the factual scenario that the Legislature envisioned as \u201c <em>'an appropriate </em>action\u2019 \u201d for rebutting the presumption. <em>(Nicholas H., supra, </em>28 Cal.4th at p. 70.) Moreover, as I have also explained, the overall statutory scheme and the relevant legislative history demonstrate the Legislature\u2019s intent to make biology <em>controlling </em>in paternity disputes between <em>competing </em>presumed fathers, at least with respect to young children like Jesusa.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The majority next asserts that \u201c \u2018if the Legislature had intended that a man who is not a biological father cannot be a presumed father under section 7611, it would not have provided for such weighing, for among two <em>competing </em>claims for presumed father status under section 7611, there can be only one biological father.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604, italics added.) Again, the majority\u2019s logic is faulty. The majority incorrectly assumes that in every case involving competing presumptions, one of the presumed fathers will be the biological father. However, because biological paternity is not a requirement of any of the UPA presumptions, in some cases, neither of the presumed fathers will be the biological father. In this circumstance, neither presumed father will be able to rebut the other\u2019s presumption (assuming the facts underlying the presumptions are otherwise established). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The majority\u2019s logic also overlooks the fact that, under specified circumstances, two of the UPA presumptions\u2014a husband\u2019s presumption under section 7540 and the presumption under section 7576 based on a voluntary paternity declaration\u2014are, by statute, not rebuttable. (\u00a7\u00a7 7541, subds. (b), (c), (e), 7576, subd. (d).) Thus, in some cases, a presumed father who is also the biological father may be precluded from rebutting another man\u2019s UPA presumption. Finally, the majority\u2019s logic overlooks the fact that it is possible\u2014for example, in the case of men who are identical twins\u2014for genetic tests to show that more than one man could be the biological father. In all of these scenarios, weighing will be necessary to determine which unrebutted presumption \u201ccontrols.\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b).) These possibilities demonstrate that a weighing provision is necessary even under my conclusion that one presumed father\u2019s biological paternity necessarily rebuts a <em>rebuttable </em>presumption of another man.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">For the same reason, the majority errs in asserting that if the Legislature \u201chad intended to restrict the weighing process under section 7612, subdivision (b) to disputes between competing <em>nonbiological </em>fathers, it could easily have said so.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604.) As I have just explained, under my conclusion, the weighing process under section 7612, subdivision (b), is <em>not </em>applicable <em>only </em>to disputes between nonbiological fathers. Moreover, even were the weighing process so limited, because, as I have demonstrated, the Legislature understood and intended that one presumed father\u2019s proven biological paternity would, under section 7612, subdivision (a), necessarily rebut the rebuttable presumption of another man, the Legislature had no need to specify that the weighing process under subdivision (b) of that section applies only to competing nonbiological fathers; that conclusion logically follows from the statutory scheme the Legislature put in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Nor is the majority correct that section 7575 supports its conclusion. According to the majority, section 7575, subdivision (b) \u201c \u2018permits but does not require\u2019 a court to rely on blood test evidence in deciding whether to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity signed on or before December 31, 1996.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 605.) \u201c \u2018It is unlikely,\u2019 \u201d the majority asserts, that \u201c \u2018the Legislature would\u2014without explicitly so stating\u2014adopt a contrary rule that blood test evidence . . . must defeat the claim of a person who claims presumed father status under section 7611(d).\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The majority\u2019s analysis is both unpersuasive and incorrect. It is unpersuasive because it ignores the fact that blood test evidence showing that the tested man is not the father <em>does necessarily </em>rebut the presumption of a husband who is \u201cconclusively presumed\u201d to be the father under section 7540. (\u00a7 7541, subd. (a).) To paraphrase the majority, \u201c \u2018[i]t is unlikely the Legislature would\u2014without explicitly so stating\u2014adopt a contrary rule\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that test results do not necessarily rebut the raonconclusive UPA presumptions. The majority\u2019s analysis is incorrect because it does not focus on the correct statute. In determining whether Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity necessarily rebuts Paul\u2019s <em>presumption </em>under section 7611, we should consider the Legislature\u2019s treatment of <em>presumptions </em>based on voluntary paternity declarations. That issue is governed by section 7576, not, as the majority asserts, by section 7575. As explained above, section 7576, subdivision (a), provides that a voluntary declaration of paternity completed before January 1, 1997, raises a \u201cpresumption\u201d that the child of the man executing the voluntary declaration \u201cis ... the man\u2019s child.\u201d As also explained above, section 7576, subdivision (d), provides that \u201cany person\u201d may rebut the \u201cpresumption\u201d raised by such a declaration by obtaining genetic tests pursuant to section 7551. This provision makes a <em>presumption </em>based on a voluntary declaration expressly subject to California\u2019s Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity (\u00a7 7550 et seq.), including the direction in section 7554 that the \u201cquestion of paternity shall be resolved\u201d in accordance with tests showing that the \u201calleged father is not the father.\u201d Thus, a <em>presumption </em>based on a voluntary declaration, like a section 7540 presumption, is necessarily rebutted by test results showing that the presumed father is not the father. That test results necessarily rebut the presumptions under <em>both </em>sections 7540 and 7576 follows not just from subdivision (d) of section 7576, but also from subdivision (a), which expressly declares that the \u201cpresumption\u201d based on a voluntary paternity declaration \u201chas the same force and effect as the presumption under Section 7540.\u201d (\u00a7 7575, subd. (a).) This fact supports my construction because, again to quote the majority, \u201c \u2018[i]t is unlikely the Legislature would\u2019 \u201d provide that the so-called <em>conclusive </em>UPA <em>presumptions </em>under both sections 7540 and 7576 are necessarily rebutted by such evidence and, \u201c \u2018without explicitly so stating,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018adopt a contrary rule\u2019 \u201d with respect to the ftoraconclusive UPA <em>presumptions.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 605.)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>The majority is also incorrect in asserting that not \u201ca single case\u201d supports my construction of section 7612, subdivision (a) (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 614), whereas its construction of that subdivision is consistent with the \u201cweight of authority\u201d in our Courts of Appeal. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 605.) <em>Brian C. v. Ginger K. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1198 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 294], supports my conclusion. There, in discussing resolution of competing claims of presumed fathers under the UPA, the court observed: (1) under section 7551, a court <em>\u201cmay </em>order blood tests at <em>any </em>time\u201d; (2) under section 7612, subdivision (a), a section 7611 presumption \u201c \u2018may be rebutted . . . only by clear and convincing evidence\u2019 and (3) \u201cDNA tests . . . certainly constitute clear and convincing evidence rebutting any of the presumptions that might favor either\u201d of the competing fathers. <em>(Brian C. v. Ginger K., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1222, fn. 20.) The majority offers no persuasive reason for discounting this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On the other hand, upon examination, the Court of Appeal decisions on which the majority relies turn out not to be \u201cweight[y]\u201d at all. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 604.) In <em>Steven W., </em>the court discussed <em>only </em>subdivision <em>(b) </em>of what it is now section 7612 in concluding that one man\u2019s presumption was controlling; it did not even consider whether, under subdivision <em>(a) </em>of section 7612, one presumed father\u2019s biological paternity necessarily rebuts the other man\u2019s presumption. <em>(Steven W., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1115-1117.) Thus, it provides no support for the majority\u2019s construction of the latter subdivision. In <em>In re Kiana A. </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 1109 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 669], the entire discussion of the significance of biological paternity was dicta; before opining on this issue, the court held that biological paternity had not been established in the juvenile court and that the man asserting his biological paternity could not raise his \u201cuntimely claim\u201d for the first time on appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1118.) Moreover, the court\u2019s dicta on this issue contained no analysis other than citing <em>Steven W. </em>and citing the language of section 7612, subdivision (a). <em>(Kiana, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1118-1119.) Finally, like <em>Nicholas H. </em>and unlike the case now before us, both <em>Steven W. </em>and <em>Kiana </em>involved a child who was more than two years old when the paternity issue arose. <em>(Kiana, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at p. 1109 [child over 12 years of age]; <em>Steven W, supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at p. 1108 [almost-three-year-old child].) In both cases, the courts relied heavily on this fact in reaching their conclusion. <em>(Kiana, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1119-1120; <em>Steven W., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1117-1118.) Thus, these cases provide no substantial support for the majority\u2019s construction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The majority\u2019s analysis is equally faulty with respect to its conclusion that a court need not give \u201cdeterminative weight\u201d to biology in determining under subdivision (b) of section 7612 which presumption \u201c \u2018on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 607.) The sum total of the majority\u2019s statutory analysis <em>under California law </em>is the following: Section 7612, subdivision (b) \u201cnowhere states that biology is a <em>conclusive </em>consideration of policy and logic.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 607.) Thus, the majority completely ignores the overall statutory scheme, which, as I have shown, demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent, at least with respect to children less than two years of age, to make biological paternity the <em>controlling </em>consideration of policy and logic in resolving the competing paternity claims of presumed fathers. In this regard, the majority\u2019s analysis again violates the principle that we construe statutes not \u201cin isolation,\u201d but \u201c \u2018with reference to the entire scheme of law of which [they are] part.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pieters, supra, </em>52 Cal.3d at p. 899.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Instead of analyzing <em>California\u2019s </em>statutory scheme, the majority relies on decisions from <em>other states. </em>Specifically, the majority cites decisions from Colorado, Hawai\u2019i, Minnesota, and Nevada in which courts purportedly \u201cdeclined to make biology determinative under their analogs to section 7612 when confronted by competing presumptions of paternity.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 607.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The non-California decisions on which the majority relies do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion because the statutes they construed are significantly different from California\u2019s UPA. As explained above, when our Legislature established a presumption based on test results, it excluded that presumption from the UPA\u2019s weighing process under section 7612 and specifically declared its \u201cintent ... to standardize the process by which paternity is established in order to achieve a greater degree of equity and consistency in paternity determinations.\u201d (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137.) It thus provided clear evidence of its intent to make established biological paternity <em>determinative </em>as to which competing UPA presumption is, <em>\u201con the facts . . . </em>founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7612, subd. (b), italics added.) By contrast, in Colorado, Hawai\u2019i, Minnesota, and Nevada, the presumption based on scientific tests is just one of several presumptions stated in their version of section 7611, that is, their version of section 4 of the 1973 Act. (Colo. Rev. Stats. \u00a7 19-4-105; Hawai\u2019i Rev. Stats. \u00a7 584-4(a); Minn. Stat. \u00a7 257.55, subd. (1); Nev. Rev. Stats. \u00a7 126.051(1).) Notably, in the decisions the majority cites, the courts relied on this fact, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>the fact that the <em>same </em>statute provided for the weighing of conflicting presumptions, in concluding that their state\u2019s presumption based on biology does not necessarily overcome the presumptions based on other factors.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For example, as one of the cited cases explained, \u201cthe original lodestar of [Minnesota\u2019s] parentage act\u201d was \u201cbiological\u201d paternity; thus, \u201c[w]hen the parentage act was first adopted in [Minnesota], ... the effort was to find the biological father and then to adjudicate that person the legal father.\u201d <em>(Matter of Welfare ofC.M.G. </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1994) 516 N.W.2d 555, 560, fn. 8, italics added.) However, \u201cwhen the [Minnesota] legislature added the presumption established under the genetic test presumption, [citation], it . . . treated [that presumption] simply as the sixth presumption [under the parentage act].\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This fact \u201cdemonstrate^]\u201d that, in Minnesota, \u201cother considerations ha[ve] since made the search something more than a search for a biological father.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This decision, and the others the majority cites, do not support the majority\u2019s conclusion precisely because their analyses depended on the fact that, unlike our Legislature, the legislatures in Colorado, Hawai\u2019i, Minnesota, and. Nevada expressly made their presumption based on biology subject to weighing by placing it in the weighing provision of their version of the 1973 Act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed, by recognizing that, absent this fact, the \u201clodestar of the parentage act\u201d is \u201cbiological\u201d paternity <em>(C.M.G., supra, </em>516 N.W.2d at p. 560, fn. 8), these decisions actually support my conclusion that biological paternity is <em>determinative </em>under California\u2019s statutory scheme, at least as to children no more than two years of age.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>B. <em>Constitutional Considerations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In addition to being inconsistent with the overall statutory scheme and the Legislature\u2019s intent, the majority\u2019s conclusion violates the principle that, in interpreting statutes, we should avoid constructions that \u201craise serious and doubtful constitutional questions.\u201d <em>(Miller, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d at p. 828.) Under this principle, \u201c[i]f a statute is susceptible of two constructions, one of which will render it constitutional and the other unconstitutional in whole or in part, or raise serious and doubtful constitutional questions, [we] will adopt the construction which, without doing violence to the reasonable meaning of the language used, will render it valid in its entirety, or free from doubt as to its constitutionality .... [Citations.] The basis of this rule is the presumption that the Legislature intended, not to violate the Constitution, but to enact a valid statute within the scope of its constitutional powers.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Contrary to this principle, the majority\u2019s conclusion renders our statutory scheme unconstitutional. In <em>Kelsey, </em>we held that, \u201cif an unwed father promptly comes forward and demonstrates a full commitment to his parental responsibilities\u2014emotional, financial, and otherwise\u2014his federal constitutional right to due process prohibits the termination of his parental relationship absent a showing of his unfitness as a parent\u201d; a showing that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests, which is a lower standard, is simply not <em>constitutionally </em>sufficient. <em>(Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849.) In violation of this constitutional principle, the majority sanctions the termination of Heriberto\u2019s parental rights without a finding of unfitness, based on the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Jesusa\u2019s best interests are served by having Paul declared to be her legal father.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The majority\u2019s attempt to refute this conclusion fails. Initially, the majority confuses and avoids the issue by insisting that the proceedings here merely determined who \u201cthe presumed father\u201d is, not who the father is: (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.) The majority states that a juvenile court may determine \u201cthe identity of a child\u2019s <em>presumed </em>father\u201d through an action brought under Family Code section 7630 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2, subdivision (d). (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 620, italics added.) However, as we have explained, section 7630 of the UPA sets forth \u201cthe means\u201d by which \u201c[a] man <em>can establish a father and child </em>relationship,\u201d not merely his status as a <em>presumed </em>father. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 90, italics added.) The plain language of section 7630 confirms this fact. It authorizes \u201ca man presumed to be the child\u2019s father\u201d under section 7611 to bring an action to \u201cdeclar[e]\u201d the actual \u201cexistence of the father and child relationship\u201d that is merely \u201cpresumed under . . . Section 7611.\u201d (\u00a7 7630, subd. (a)(1).) It also authorizes \u201c[a]n action to determine the existence of the father and child relationship with respect to a child <em>who has no presumed father </em>under Section 7611.\u201d (\u00a7 7630, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>subd. (c), italics added.) The UPA\u2019s legislative history also confirms this fact; it explains that the UPA \u201csets forth a procedure whereby a man can be judicially determined to be <em>the father </em>of the child,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll rights of . . . the parents with regard to th[e] child ... are based on the parent and child relationship\u201d established under the UPA\u2019s procedure. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, analysis of Sen. Bill No. 347 (1975-1976 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 8, 1975, p. 14, italics added.) Finally, the other statute the majority cites\u2014Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2, subdivision (d)\u2014also confirms this fact; it says <em>nothing </em>about identifying the <em>presumed </em>father, but provides that \u201c[i]f a man appears in the dependency action and files an action under Section 7630 or 7631 of the Family Code, the court <em>shall </em>determine if he is <em>the father.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement, nothing in either Family Code section 7630 or Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2, subdivision (d), authorizes a determination of the identity of the <em>presumed </em>father.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Nor is the majority correct in stating that a court may determine the identity of \u201ca child\u2019s <em>presumed </em>father\u201d\u2014as opposed to the child\u2019s father\u2014 under California Rules of Court, rule 1413. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 620, italics added.) Rule 1413, which is entitled \u201cPaternity,\u201d establishes a juvenile court\u2019s \u201cduty\u201d in a dependency proceeding \u201cto determine <em>the parentage </em>of\u2019 a child\u2014not the child\u2019s <em>presumed </em>father\u2014if \u201cparentage\u201d has \u201cnot otherwise [been] determined.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413(a), italics added.) It states that if \u201cthere has been no prior determination of <em>paternity </em>of the child, the juvenile court may make such a determination.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413(e), italics added.) As commonly understood, the terms \u201cparentage\u201d and \u201cpaternity\u201d refer to the identity of a child\u2019s actual father.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, like Family Code section 7630 and Welfare and Institutions Code section 316.2, subdivision (d), rule 1413, by its terms, establishes a court\u2019s <em>duty </em>to determine who the father is, not who the presumed father is. Under these statutes, the juvenile court\u2019s finding necessarily denied H\u00e9riberto\u2019s formal \u201crequest that the court enter a judgment of [his] paternity\u201d and necessarily established Paul\u2019s paternity, that is, it established Paul as Jesusa\u2019s father, not merely her presumed father. In so doing, it also necessarily terminated Heriberto\u2019s rights as a parent. Under section 7636, a \u201cjudgment or order of the court determining the existence or nonexistence of the parent and child relationship is determinative for all purposes except\u201d certain criminal prosecutions <footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The record fully supports this conclusion. At the hearing where Heriberto first appeared, the court advised that there would \u201cbe an issue on April 30th as to determining the paternity.\u201d On April 30, the court announced that it was continuing \u201cthe issue as to paternity\u201d to July 17. On July 17, when counsel objected to proceeding in Heriberto\u2019s absence, the court relayed its understanding \u201cthat the issue of paternity would be fully decided on the briefs and argument.\u201d DCFS then argued that the court should \u201cmake a finding of paternity or nonfinding of paternity\u201d based on what had already been submitted, and it \u201curge[d] the court to go ahead and make its finding as to paternity.\u201d Jesusa\u2019s counsel then set forth her understanding of the court\u2019s tentative ruling: that both Paul and Heriberto were \u201celigible for presumed status, but that issues of public policy and logic would determine that [Paul] should be <em>the father </em>that\u2019s chosen.\u201d (Italics added.) After the court\u2019s ruling, Jesusa\u2019s counsel argued: \u201c[I]n the court making a finding that [Paul] is the presumed father, that effectively states that [Heriberto] is not the father. [][] ... It\u2019s a finding that he is not the father of this child period, and that [Paul] . . . enjoys all the legal rights and responsibilities as a parent to [Jesusa] and not [Heriberto].\u201d The court immediately responded that, as a result of its finding, Heriberto \u201cdoes not have any legal rights to this child other than being noticed for\u201d a hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, \u201cshould this court ever get to the stage where\u201d it sets such a hearing. Thus, despite the language the court used in stating its finding\u2014that Paul is \u201cthe presumed father\u201d\u2014the juvenile court and the parties fully understood and intended the court\u2019s decision to be a paternity determination that stripped Heriberto of his parental rights.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Indeed, although the majority states that the statutes and rules on which it relies authorize actions to determine the identity of a child\u2019s presumed father, its actual discussion recognizes that the cited provisions pertain to determinations of \u201cpaternity\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d parenthood. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 600, 620.) Based on these statutes, the majority concludes that the juvenile court had discretion \u201cto hear [a] <em>paternity </em>action at <em>any </em>time\u201d after the dependency petition was filed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 620, first italics added.) More importantly, the majority justifies its conclusion on the ground that, in a dependency proceeding, \u201c[t]he <em>legal parents </em>must be identified\u201d if certain procedural requirements are to be observed, and that dependency petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>often cannot be adjudicated \u201c \u2018without first identifying which man is <em>the child\u2019s father.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 620, italics added.) \u201cThus,\u201d the majority concludes, \u201c \u2018the law cannot be judicially applied [here] without a determination of <em>parentage ....\u2019\u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 620, italics added.) This discussion demonstrates that even the majority recognizes the juvenile court here made a paternity determination identifying Paul as Jesusa\u2019s <em>legal </em>father. Also demonstrating this fact is the majority\u2019s failure to explain what additional proceedings are necessary to determine the identity of Jesusa\u2019s father\u2014as opposed to her presumed father\u2014what statute authorizes such proceedings, or how, in light of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling, Heriberto can still maintain a paternity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Despite Paul\u2019s status as the legal father under the juvenile court\u2019s order, the majority insists that Heriberto \u201cretains \u2018parental rights that simply differ in degree [from]\u2019 \u201d Paul\u2019s rights. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.) According to the majority, actual termination of Heriberto\u2019s \u201cparental rights requires further proceedings.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610.)</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The majority is incorrect. Although claiming that Heriberto retains parental rights, the majority identifies not a single right that he retains. Instead, to support its assertion, the majority simply cites <em>Francisco G. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 586, 596 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 679]. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 599, 610.) However, like the majority, although the court in <em>Francisco </em>made a general statement regarding the rights of a biological father, it did not identify a single right that a biological parent has. <em>{Francisco, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.4th at pp. 590-595.) Moreover, <em>Francisco </em>is completely inapposite; it did not consider whether a biological father <em>retains </em>parental rights <em>after </em>a juvenile court makes a paternity finding in favor of another presumed father. In <em>Francisco, </em>the court considered the statutory reunification rights in a dependency proceeding of a biological father who was never a presumed father; there was no paternity determination and no presumed father. <em>{Ibid.) </em>It was in this context that the court stated, by way of background, that a biological father has \u201cparental rights that simply differ in degree [from] the parental rights conferred on a presumed father.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 596.) In short, nothing supports the majority\u2019s assertion that, notwithstanding the juvenile court\u2019s decision, Heriberto \u201cretains \u2018parental rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.) Nor does the majority explain how, in light of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling\u2014which \u201cis determinative for all purposes\u201d (\u00a7 7636)\u2014it is possible that Heriberto can retain any <em>parental </em>rights after Paul has been declared to be Jesusa\u2019s legal father.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The majority\u2019s assertion that actual termination of Heriberto\u2019s \u201cparental rights requires further proceedings\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610) is also suspect. Again, as to this issue, the juvenile court\u2019s paternity finding here is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>by statute, \u201cdeterminative.\u201d (\u00a7 7636.) Moreover, section 7800 et seq., which the majority cites (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610), does not support the majority\u2019s claim. Section 7803 authorizes courts to declare children free \u201cfrom parental custody and control.\u201d However, in light of the juvenile court\u2019s order, this provision does not apply to Heriberto. Section 7802 provides that \u201c[a] proceeding may be brought under this part for the purpose of having a minor child declared free from the custody and control of <em>either or both </em>parents.\u201d (Italics added.) The language of this statute\u2014\u201ceither or both parents\u201d (\u00a7 7802)\u2014obviously contemplates that a child has only <em>two </em>parents. In this case, under the juvenile court\u2019s ruling, which is \u201cdeterminative for all purposes\u201d (\u00a7 7636), those two parents are Jesusa\u2019s mother and Paul. Because Heriberto no longer qualifies as a \u201cparent[]\u201d under section 7802, no declaration is either necessary or obtainable as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, which the majority also cites, (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610), is also inapplicable. It applies only \u201cto children who are adjudged dependent children of the juvenile court pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 360.\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (a).) Here, Jesusa was not adjudged a dependent under Welfare and Institutions Code section 360, subdivision (c)\u201e Moreover, Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, subdivision (b), provides for terminating \u201cthe rights of the parent or parents . . . .\u201d Given the juvenile court\u2019s paternity finding, Heriberto no longer appears to qualify as a parent. Finally, Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, subdivision (b), provides for terminating parental rights only in connection with adoption. The majority fails to explain how, in light of the finding in favor of Paul and Family Code section 7636, adoption proceedings will \u00bfver come about in this case. Like Family Code section 7800 et. seq., Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26 simply has no relevance to this case and does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s parental rights have not been terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Finally, section 7664, which the majority also cites, is also inapplicable for two reasons. First, like Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, Family Code section 7664 applies only in the context of adoption proceedings, which will never come about in light of the juvenile court\u2019s ruling. Second, Family Code section 7664 applies only to a \u201cnatural father.\u201d However, under the juvenile court\u2019s ruling, Heriberto cannot qualify as Jesusa\u2019s natural father. As explained above, a UPA proceeding establishes the \u201cparent and child relationship\u201d between \u201ca child and the natural father\u201d (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b)), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>juvenile court\u2019s ruling here, which \u201cis determinative for all [relevant] purposes\u201d (\u00a7 7636), establishes that Paul, not Heriberto, is Jesusa\u2019s \u201cnatural father.\u201d (\u00a7 7610, subd. (b).) Thus, the majority is incorrect in stating that actual termination of Heriberto\u2019s \u201cparental rights requires further proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Nor is the majority justified or correct in rejecting Heriberto\u2019s due process claim based on his purported failure to \u201cexecute[] a voluntary declaration of paternity or describe[]\u201d on the record \u201cany other steps\u201d he took \u201cto formalize\u201d his relationship to Jesusa. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 610.) In the juvenile court, counsel for Jesusa asserted in her brief that Heriberto had \u201csigned\u201d a \u201cvoluntary declaration of paternity.\u201d Regarding other steps that Heriberto may have taken to formalize his relationship, ironically, the lack of evidence in the record the majority cites stems directly from a ruling the majority now affirms: the juvenile court\u2019s refusal to continue the matter until Heriberto was present. Heriberto\u2019s counsel requested the continuance specifically so Heriberto could appear to present <em>precisely </em>the kind of evidence the majority says is lacking. As the majority notes (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600), when the juvenile court asked what testimony Heriberto wanted to provide, counsel responded: \u201cthe extent in which [he] held out paternity, publicly acknowledged paternity for Jesusa, and the formal steps he went to [to] identify\u201d Jesusa as \u201chis daughter\u201d to \u201cgovernment agencies.\u201d The juvenile court denied the continuance because it found it did \u201cnot need\u201d to know \u201cwhat [Heriberto] ha[d] done with regard to filling out documents with public agencies or government agencies.\u201d The majority affirms that ruling, reasoning that Heriberto\u2019s proposed testimony was \u201cunnecessary\u201d in light of the juvenile court\u2019s decision to assume that Heriberto qualified as a presumed father. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600.) Having affirmed the denial of the continuance Heriberto sought so he could present this evidence, the majority errs in now rejecting his constitutional claim based on the absence of that very evidence in the record.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In any event, the majority errs in holding that Heriberto has no constitutional protection absent such a showing. Contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>neither <em>Kelsey </em>nor <em>Michael H. </em>supports this conclusion or even suggests that the taking of steps to formalize the paternal role is an absolute prerequisite to constitutional protection. On the contrary, in <em>Kelsey, </em>we identified \u201cprompt legal action to seek custody\u201d as only one of many factors \u201c[a] court should consider.\u201d <em>(Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849.) We more broadly held that, in determining whether a biological father has made the showing necessary to trigger due process protections, a court should not look to any one factor, but \u201cshould consider all factors,\u201d including the biological father\u2019s \u201cconduct both <em>before and after </em>the child\u2019s birth.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The majority asserts that Heriberto did less than the father in <em>Kelsey, </em>who filed an action to establish his parental role only two days after the child\u2019s birth. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) However, in terms of demonstrating a timely and full commitment to parental responsibilities, Heriberto did far more than the father in <em>Kelsey. </em>The father in <em>Kelsey </em>never lived with or even visited his child. <em>(Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 822, 825.) By contrast, Heriberto lived with Jesusa\u2019s mother for a year before Jesusa\u2019s birth, lived with Jesusa and her mother as a family until his arrest almost two years after Jesusa\u2019s birth, and acted as Jesusa\u2019s father during those two years. Given these circumstances, and the fact that Paul has always conceded that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s father, Heriberto had no reason to take \u201clegal steps to formalize his relationship\u201d with Jesusa or \u201c \u2018seek custody of\u2019 \u201d her. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) Moreover, during this dependency proceeding, Heriberto continues to assert his paternity and acknowledges that, if a judgment is entered establishing his paternity, he \u201cwill have the obligation to support\u201d Jesusa until she is at least 18. Based on his conduct over the entire relevant period, Heriberto clearly qualifies for constitutional protection, even assuming, as the majority does, he did not take steps to formalize his paternal relationship. The majority errs in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">After rejecting Heriberto\u2019s claim that the juvenile court\u2019s decision unconstitutionally <em>terminated </em>his parental rights, the majority addresses his claim that the juvenile court\u2019s decision \u201cunconstitutionally <em>interfered </em>with\u201d those rights. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) Based on a purported \u201cbalance\u201d of the competing interests, the majority rejects Heriberto\u2019s \u201csubstantive due process\u201d claim. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The majority\u2019s analysis is incorrect, because it mischaracterizes and incorrectly weights the relevant interests to be balanced. On one side of the scale, the majority places Heriberto\u2019s \u201clargely abstract interest in being an absent presumed father while he remains in prison.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) However, Heriberto\u2019s interest is hardly abstract; it arises from the period he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>lived with Jesusa\u2019s mother during her pregnancy and from the actual parental relationship he developed with Jesusa during the almost two years he lived with her as her father. As previously noted, according to Jesusa\u2019s mother, Heriberto was \u201calways . . . very loving and gentle to\u201d Jesusa during this time. Moreover, the majority takes the short-term, myopic view in focusing only on Heriberto\u2019s \u201cinterest in being an <em>absent </em>presumed father <em>while he remains in prison.\u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611, italics added.) Heriberto will not be in prison forever; as the majority notes, he received \u201cthree years in prison\u201d for his rape conviction. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 597.) This three-year period will end in May 2004, only a few months from now (assuming Heriberto is not released even earlier based on custody credits). We must consider not only Heriberto\u2019s interest while he remains in prison, but also his interest in being a father after his impending release. The juvenile court\u2019s paternity determination will seriously interfere with\u2014indeed, it will terminate\u2014Heriberto\u2019s rights long after his release. On the other side of the scale, the majority places the \u201csubstantial state interests in familial stability and the welfare of the child.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 611.) In this case, the state\u2019s interest in familial stability is \u201crelatively weak[],\u201d given that Jesusa lived with Heriberto and her mother as a family until Heriberto\u2019s arrest almost two years after Jesusa\u2019s birth, and that Paul has never claimed he is actually Jesusa\u2019s father. <em>(Brian C. v. Ginger K., supra, </em>77 Cal.App.4th at p. 1217; see also <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 120, fn. 1 (plur. opn. of Scalia, J.) [\u201cwhere the husband and wife have not been cohabiting\u201d and husband \u201calready knows the child is not his, [it is] less likely that the paternity hearing will disrupt an otherwise harmonious and apparently exclusive marital relationship\u201d].) Moreover, the state\u2019s interest in the child\u2019s welfare is amply protected by the separate statutory scheme relating to custody issues and termination of parental rights. For all of these reasons, the majority\u2019s rejection of Heriberto\u2019s due process claim is erroneous.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion also raises serious and doubtful constitutional questions with respect to the equal protection clause. In <em>Kelsey, </em>we explained that when a biological father \u201chas come forward to grasp his parental responsibilities, his parental rights are entitled to equal protection as those of the mother.\u201d <em>(.Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849, fn. omitted.) Contrary to this principle, under the majority\u2019s conclusion, the parental rights of a biological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>father who has made the necessary commitment to his parental responsibilities do not receive the same protection as the parental rights of a biological mother. As explained above, we held in <em>Johnson </em>that, under the UPA, the parentage claim of a woman who has established her biological maternity and who \u201cfrom the outset intended to be the child\u2019s mother\u201d cannot be defeated based on the child\u2019s best interests, even by another woman who also establishes a biological basis for parentage. <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 93.) Here, the majority holds that a man in the same position\u2014who has established his biological paternity, who moved in with the mother a year before the child\u2019s birth and intended from the outset to be the child\u2019s father, and who lived with the child and acted as her father for almost two years after her birth\u2014does not enjoy the same protection; his parentage claim may be defeated if a court concludes that the child\u2019s best interests are served by recognizing the paternity claim of someone with no biological basis for his claim. Thus, in interpreting the UPA as establishing less protection for the rights of a biological father, the majority\u2019s holding renders our statutory scheme violative of the equal protection clause. As we explained in <em>Kelsey: </em>\u201cWe simply do not in our society take children away from their mothers\u2014 married or otherwise\u2014\u201d merely because a \u201cbest interest\u201d inquiry suggests that \u201ca \u2018better\u2019 . . . parent can be found. . . . [N]o valid reason [exists] why we should be less solicitous of a father\u2019s\u201d rights. <em>(Kelsey, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at p. 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>C. Policy Considerations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Finally, the majority can offer no persuasive policy basis for adopting a construction that fails to implement the Legislature\u2019s intent and renders our statutory scheme unconstitutional. As we explained in <em>Johnson, </em>the determination of who a child\u2019s father is under the UPA\u2014that is, \u201cthe determination of parentage\u201d\u2014is <em>separate </em>from the \u201ceventual custody decision[]\u201d; \u201c[l]ogically, the determination of parentage must precede, and should not be dictated by, eventual custody decisions.\u201d <em>{Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 93, fn. 10.) As we also explained, basing the parentage determination on \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d as the majority does, improperly \u201cconfuses concepts of parentage and custody.\u201d <em>{Ibid) </em>If we properly keep these concepts separate, then Heriberto should be found to be Jesusa\u2019s father under the statutes governing parentage determinations and questions of custody and termination of parental rights should be decided under the \u201cdependency laws\u201d that govern such matters. <em>{Ibid) </em>If those dependency laws are applied on the facts here, then a juvenile court would surely deny Heriberto custody of Jesusa and terminate his parental rights. (See Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1) [\u201cconviction] of a felony indicating parental unfitness . . . constitute^] a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights\u201d unless \u201ctermination would be detrimental to the child\u201d].) Thus, in this case, the majority\u2019s construction and my construction will produce the same outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>As this discussion demonstrates, the majority errs in asserting that, under my construction, \u201ccourts must ignore the child\u2019s best interests in a dependency proceeding.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 616.) Under my construction, and as we held in <em>Johnson, </em>courts must consider the child\u2019s best interests <em>in a dependency proceeding </em>in determining <em>termination and custody issues, </em>not in determining <em>parentage </em>under the UPA. Moreover, as the majority observes, paternity determinations occur in contexts other than dependency proceedings. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599, fn. 2.) To paraphrase the majority, our construction of the paternity statutes should not be driven by \u201cthe fortuity that a dependency petition is pending.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The majority is also incorrect regarding the effect of my construction where a child is <em>\u201cthe product of rape.\u201d </em>(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 619, fn. 11.) The majority asserts that under these circumstances, my construction requires a court \u201cto favor the biological father over any other presumed father.\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>However, this assertion overlooks the fact that under my construction, even though a biological father qualifies as a presumed father, his parental rights would surely be terminated where the child is the product of rape, and another presumed father would be able to obtain custody and parental rights through adoption. The majority\u2019s assertion also overlooks the fact that my approach is <em>precisely </em>the approach the Legislature, through its statutes, has dictated where a child is the product of rape and the rapist qualifies under section 7611 as a presumed father. (\u00a7\u00a7 7611.5 [prohibiting rapists from becoming presumed fathers <em>only if they do not qualify under \u00a7 7611]), </em>7825, subd. (b) [in action for order declaring child free from father\u2019s custody and control, that child is product of rape raises \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d that \u201cfather is unfit to have custody or control\u201d]; Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1) [\u201cconviction] of a felony indicating parental unfitness . . . constitute^] a sufficient basis for termination of parental rights\u201d unless \u201ctermination would be detrimental to the child\u201d].) The majority also errs in asserting that my construction gives a rapist \u201c \u2018 \u201ca right of reunification services . . . simply because [he] is the biological father of the child.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 619, fn. 11.) The majority\u2019s assertion overlooks the fact that, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s express intent, my construction applies not to <em>all </em>biological fathers, but only to those who otherwise qualify as presumed fathers under section 7611. (See \u00a7 7611.5.) More importantly, the majority\u2019s assertion overlooks the fact that, even where a rapist qualifies as a presumed father, our statutes <em>expressly </em>deprive him of any <em>right </em>to reunification services. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 361.5, subds. (b)(12), (c), (e)(1).) My construction has no effect on operation of these statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">So, one may ask, if my construction and the majority\u2019s would produce the same result here, then does any of this matter? Yes; because, as we held only 10 years ago, courts applying the UPA should <em>not </em>\u201cdecide <em>parentage </em>based on the best interests of the child,\u201d and should keep parentage and custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>decisions <em>separate (Johnson, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th 84 at p. 93, fn. 10); because, as we also cautioned 10 years ago, deciding parentage on the basis of the child\u2019s best interests \u201craises the repugnant specter of governmental interference in matters implicating our most fundamental notions of privacy\u201d <em>(ibid.)', </em>because we held in <em>Kelsey </em>that the \u201cfederal constitutional right[s]\u201d of biological fathers like Heriberto \u201cprohibit[]\u201d termination of their parental relationship absent a showing of their \u201cunfitness\u201d as parents <em>(Kelsey, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 849); and because the majority is announcing a mle that applies not only on the tragic facts of this case, but in <em>every </em>case where a biological father is confronted by a man who also qualifies as a presumed father.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The majority\u2019s claim that only a \u201csmall subset\u201d of biological fathers is at risk under its holding (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 612) is neither accurate nor reassuring. The majority errs in asserting that an unwed biological father can necessarily escape the effect of its conclusion simply \u201cby executing a voluntary declaration of paternity.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>A voluntary paternity declaration is not effective without the mother\u2019s signature. (\u00a7 7574, subd. (b)(1).) Even if the mother signs, she can rescind the voluntary declaration within 60 days of executing it. (\u00a7 7575, subd. (a).) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement, an unwed biological father cannot protect himself by unilaterally executing a paternity declaration. Moreover, many biological fathers will, no doubt, fail to recognize the need to formalize their legal status by filing a paternity declaration until it is too late. Here, for example, given that Jesusa lived with Heriberto throughout her life and Paul never claimed to be her father, Heriberto had no reason to know he needed to file a paternity declaration (even assuming, as the majority does, he did not actually do so). Thus, for a variety of reasons, in many cases, the protection a voluntary paternity declaration affords will be unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The majority also errs in asserting that unwed biological fathers can necessarily escape the effect of its conclusion by \u201csuccessfully maintaining] a parent-child relationship such that no other man obtains the opportunity to qualify as a presumed father.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 612.) Depending solely on the mother\u2019s actions, another man can qualify for a presumption regardless of how successfully the unwed biological father maintains the parent-child relationship. For example, another man may become a presumed father if the mother either marries him or allows him to take the child into his home. (\u00a7 7611, subds. (c), (d).) Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement, its conclusion may apply to an unwed biological father notwithstanding his successful efforts to maintain a parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s application of section 7611, subdivision (d), in this case amply demonstrates this fact. The majority finds that, although Paul has never claimed to be Jesusa\u2019s natural father, he qualifies as a presumed father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>under section 7611, subdivision (d), because Jesusa\u2019s mother took Jesusa to Paul\u2019s home on weekends to be with Jesusa\u2019s half siblings. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 597, 602.) Thus, under the majority\u2019s analysis, Heriberto could have prevented Paul from qualifying as a presumed father under section 7611, subdivision (d), only by limiting Jesusa\u2019s time with her mother and half siblings. Such behavior, which the majority\u2019s conclusion encourages, would have been contrary to Jesusa\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Given today\u2019s world, the substantial risk the majority\u2019s conclusion poses for unwed biological fathers is no small matter. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2002, there were 1,365,966 births to unmarried women in the United States\u2014more than one out of every three (34 percent)\u2014and these numbers are similar to those reported \u201csince 1995.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Recent statistics also show that 39 percent of children in the United States under the age of 18 live apart from their biological fathers. (Sparling, <em>All in the Family: Recognizing the Unifying Potential of Same-Sex Marriage </em>(2001) 10 Law &amp; Sexuality 187, 202, fn. 86.) Thus, literally thousands of unwed biological fathers are potentially at risk under the majority\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Indeed, contrary to the majority\u2019s claim, even biological fathers who \u201cmarried the mother of their child\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 612) are at risk under the majority\u2019s conclusion if they were not cohabiting with the mother at the time of conception or did not marry the mother until after the child\u2019s birth. (\u00a7\u00a7 7540, 7611, subds. (a), (c); see also <em>Dawn D., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 935.) Also at risk are biological fathers who thought they were validly married to the mother, but were not. (\u00a77611, subd. (b).) These biological fathers, like the unwed biological fathers discussed above, are subject to the majority\u2019s conclusion unless they both recognize the need to take formal action and get the mother\u2019s cooperation before a dispute arises.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Thus, the number of biological fathers\u2014both married and unmarried\u2014at risk under the majority\u2019s holding is far greater than the majority suggests. Under the majority\u2019s holding, all of these biological fathers\u2014no matter how law abiding, loving and competent and no matter how well developed their relationship with their children\u2014are at risk of having their parental rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>terminated by a court\u2019s subjective and discretionary determination that some other man who qualifies as a presumed father would be a better father. Because the majority\u2019s conclusion is not consistent with our statutes, the Legislature\u2019s intent, or constitutional requirements, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">II. Heriberto Had a Statutory Right to Be Personally Present.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Heriberto claims that under Penal Code section 2625, which sets forth certain statutory rights of prisoners with respect to actions involving their parental rights, the juvenile court erred in adjudicating the paternity issue and the dependency petition in his absence. Regarding adjudication of the petition, the majority agrees and holds that the court erred. I agree with that holding.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that the juvenile court did not err with respect to the paternity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Regarding the paternity determination, the majority asserts that Penal Code section 2625 <em>requires </em>a court to order a prisoner\u2019s production <em>\u201conly </em>\u2018where the proceeding seeks to terminate the parental rights of [the] prisoner\u2019 under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26 or Family Code section 7800 et seq. or \u2018to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.) Because a paternity determination \u201cis neither of these,\u201d the majority asserts, the statute did not <em>require </em>the juvenile court to order Heriberto\u2019s production. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Instead, the majority claims, the court had \u201cdiscretion\u201d to order his production under subdivision (e) of Penal Code section 2625, which provides that \u201c \u2018[i]n any other action or proceeding in which a prisoner\u2019s parental or marital rights are subject to adjudication,\u2019 \u201d the superior court \u201c <em>\u2018may\u2019 </em>\u201d order the prisoner\u2019s production in court. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The majority is incorrect, because it misconstrues the statutory language. As relevant here, section 2625 does not, as the majority states, require the court to issue a production order <em>only </em>when the actual adjudication of dependency occurs. Rather, it provides that a juvenile court must: (1) \u201c[i]n . . . any proceeding brought under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code ... to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court, . . . order notice of <em>any court proceeding regarding the proceeding </em>transmitted to the prisoner\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b), italics added); and (2) issue a production order \u201c[u]pon receipt . . . of a statement from the prisoner or his or her attorney indicating the prisoner\u2019s desire to be present during the court\u2019s proceedings\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (d)). The juvenile court\u2019s paternity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>determination here was unquestionably a \u201cproceeding regarding the [Welfare and Institutions Code section 300] proceeding\u201d involving Jesusa. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b).) As explained above, our statutes and court rules confirm this conclusion. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 316.2; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1413.) Indeed, the majority acknowledges that the dependency petition here could not be adjudicated \u201c \u2018without first identifying which man is the child\u2019s father.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 620.) Thus, under the statute\u2019s plain language, because the paternity determination was a \u201cproceeding regarding the [section 300] proceeding\u201d involving Jesusa (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b)), and because Heriberto asked to be present, the court was <em>required </em>to order Heriberto\u2019s production. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">As this discussion demonstrates, my analysis does not, as the majority asserts, \u201cfail[] to recognize\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599, fn. 2) that, as here relevant, Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (a) applies \u201c[i]n . . . any proceeding brought under Section 300 of the Welfare and Institutions Code ... to adjudicate the child of a prisoner a dependent child of the court.\u201d On the contrary, my analysis expressly acknowledges this fact but, unlike the majority\u2019s, it does not focus <em>only </em>on this isolated phrase. My construction gives effect to the <em>entire </em>provision, including the requirement that the court \u201corder notice of <em>any court proceeding regarding the proceeding </em>transmitted to the prisoner.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b), italics added.) Thus, the statutory language itself expressly provides the \u201cindication\u201d the majority demands that the Legislature intended the right to appear under Penal Code section 2625 to apply to a paternity hearing where \u201ca dependency petition is pending.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Indeed, despite its analysis, in a footnote the majority concedes that a prisoner\u2019s right to be present under Penal Code section 2625 is not confined only to the proceeding where the actual dependency adjudication occurs. In this regard, the majority states its \u201cview\u201d that, under subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 2625, the right also applies to any \u201cjurisdictional hearing\u201d that \u201cprecede[s]\u201d the formal adjudication of the petition. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.) I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">However, the majority fails to justify its conclusion that, under subdivision (b) of Penal Code section 2625, the right applies to such jurisdictional hearings, but \u201cnot to\u201d paternity determinations. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599, fn. 2.) In stating that the right also applies to jurisdictional hearings, the majority expressly concedes that the phrase \u201cany court proceeding regarding the [Welfare and Institutions Code section 300] proceeding\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>subd. (b)) \u201cencompass[es]\u201d more than just the adjudication hearing. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.) However, the majority does not explain why a jurisdictional hearing qualifies as \u201cany court proceeding regarding the proceeding\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b)), but a paternity determination, which the majority concedes <em>must </em>be made \u201c \u2018in many cases\u2019 \u201d <em>before </em>the petition is adjudicated (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 620), does not. The statutory language demonstrates that the majority is incorrect; if, as the majority asserts, the Legislature \u201cintended\u201d the statute to \u201cencompass\u201d <em>only </em>adjudication and disposition hearings (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2), then the Legislature would have said so and would not have broadly required notice in <em>\u201cany court proceeding regarding </em>[a Welfare and Institutions Code section 300] proceeding.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (b), italics added.) The majority cites no legislative history to support its narrow reading of this broad language. Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusory analysis is unconvincing.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Nor is the majority correct that my construction would produce an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.) The majority asserts that under my conclusion, a juvenile court \u201cmust\u201d give notice <em>and </em>order a prisoner\u2019s production for \u201cevery\u201d hearing in the course of the dependency proceeding. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599, fn. 2.) However, by the statute\u2019s express terms, even after giving notice, a court <em>must </em>order the prisoner\u2019s <em>production only </em>\u201c[u]pon receipt ... of a statement from the prisoner or his or her attorney indicating the prisoner\u2019s desire to be present during the court\u2019s proceedings . . . .\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (d).) We have no reason to believe that a prisoner would request to be present for mundane \u201chousekeeping matters,\u201d such as \u201cscheduling hearings.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 600, fn. 2.) Indeed, wise counsel would advise against such a course, so as not to irritate the judge who will be deciding the substantive issues. Moreover, even after asking to be present, a prisoner may waive his right. Again, wise counsel would advise a prisoner to follow this course. Finally, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, my construction does not even necessarily require that <em>notice </em>be given\u2014and the prisoner\u2019s option thus invoked\u2014with respect to all such mundane matters. In applying other statutes that mandate a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>defendant\u2019s presence at trial, we have held the presence requirement inapplicable to such matters. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 398, 435 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 324, 28 P.3d 78].) A similar limitation would be appropriate with respect to Penal Code section 2625. Of course, as I have explained, the paternity determination at issue here was anything but mundane; it determined Heriberto\u2019s parental rights and, as the majority concedes, had to be made <em>before </em>the petition could be adjudicated. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, my construction would not produce an anomalous result.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The majority\u2019s fallback position\u2014that Heriberto actually \u201cwas absent for <em>only </em>a portion of the presumed father hearing\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 601, italics added)\u2014is simply incorrect. In support of its assertion, the majority notes that Heriberto was present at hearings on April 13 and April 30, and was absent only for the July 17 hearing. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 602.) However, the April 13 hearing was Heriberto\u2019s first appearance in the case\u2014the date he was \u201carraigned\u201d\u2014and it was during this arraignment that he was first advised that Paul was making a paternity claim. This advisement hardly constituted adequate notice to qualify the hearing as part of the presumed father hearing. Moreover, neither Paul nor Jesusa\u2019s mother was present at the April 13' hearing; indeed, at a prior hearing, the court had directed that neither of them \u201cshould appear\u201d at Heriberto\u2019s arraignment. Like Heriberto, they were told to appear on April 30, when the court would be \u201cdetermining the paternity.\u201d Given these facts, the April 17 hearing cannot be considered to be part of the paternity hearing simply because the court asked Heriberto\u2019s counsel if he \u201cwant[ed] to be heard on any paternity issues today.\u201d The majority\u2019s reliance on the April 30 hearing is even more misplaced. At that hearing, the court, on its own initiative, \u201ccontinue[d] the issue as to paternity\u201d to July 17 without hearing any argument on the issue. Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the July 17-hearing was not merely \u201ca portion of the presumed father hearing\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 601); it constituted the entire paternity hearing and Heriberto was absent for all of it. For all of these reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that Heriberto had no statutory right under Penal Code section 2625 to be personally present on July 17 when the juvenile court determined paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Although I agree with the majority that Heriberto had such a statutory right with respect to adjudication of the petition, I have a comment about the majority\u2019s analysis; it further demonstrates the majority\u2019s attempt to obfuscate the fact that the juvenile court in this case made a paternity finding that terminates Heriberto\u2019s rights, not merely a finding as to who \u201cthe presumed father\u201d is. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 599.) As relevant here, Penal Code section 2625, subdivision (d), applies, by its terms, only where the dependency petition seeks \u201cto adjudge the <em>child of a prisoner </em>a dependent child of the court.\u201d (Italics added.) If, as I have demonstrated, the juvenile court ruled that Paul is Jesusa\u2019s legal father, then subdivision (d) is simply inapplicable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>subsequent dependency adjudication; under the court\u2019s ruling, Jesusa is not \u201cthe child of a prisoner.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 2625, subd. (d).) Indeed, in their briefs, both DCFS and Jesusa make precisely this argument. DCFS asserts that because \u201c[t]he law allows for only one legal father,\u201d once the court found in Paul\u2019s favor, Heriberto no longer qualified as \u201can incarcerated \u2018parent\u2019 \u201d for purposes of applying Penal Code section 2625 and \u201chad no standing\u201d with respect to the dependency adjudication. Similarly, the brief filed on Jesusa\u2019s behalf asserts that, \u201conce the court\u201d ruled in Paul\u2019s favor, Heriberto \u201cno longer maintained his legal status as Jesusa\u2019s parent\u201d and \u201cPenal Code section 2625 did not apply to him.\u201d The majority completely ignores these arguments; avoiding this threshold issue as to whether Penal Code section 2625 even applies to the dependency adjudication in light of the juvenile court\u2019s finding, the majority instead considers whether the presence of counsel satisfied the requirements of the statute and the due process clause. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 621-625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The majority\u2019s consideration of the due process issue while remaining silent on the threshold issue violates our long-standing rule that we \u201c \u2018 \u201cwill not decide constitutional questions where other grounds are available and dispositive of the issues of the case.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 220, 230 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207, 902 P.2d 225].) Under that principle, \u201c \u2018we do not reach constitutional questions unless absolutely required to do so to dispose of the matter before us.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Here, we need not reach the constitutional due process issue if Penal Code section 2625 does not apply in light of the juvenile court\u2019s paternity determination. Thus, rather than ignore this potentially dispositive threshold issue that the parties have specifically raised, the majority should decide the issue <em>before </em>discussing Heriberto\u2019s constitutional due process claim. (Cf. <em>Pearl v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 189, 196, fn. 3 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 26 P.3d 1044] [\u201c[because\u201d statute \u201cis inapplicable, we need not, and do not, decide\u201d claim that its application is unconstitutional]; <em>Dibb v.

In my view, the majority should take a stand on this question, because if, as I have explained, the juvenile court\u2019s ruling establishes that Heriberto is not Jesusa\u2019s father, then under <em>Kelsey, </em>the juvenile court has terminated his parental rights in violation of constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>III. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Like the tnajority, I am deeply concerned about the fate of Jesusa. However, unlike the majority, I conclude that because Heriberto is both the biological father and a presumed father under section 7611, the statutes require us to address Jesusa\u2019s fate through provisions governing custody and termination of parental rights, not through the paternity determination that occurred here. Unlike the majority, which construes section 7612 in virtual isolation as if no other statute or legislative history tells us anything about the Legislature\u2019s policy decisions regarding biological paternity, I base my conclusion on section 7612 viewed in the context of the overall statutory scheme and its legislative history. My conclusion also rests on constitutional considerations that apply in light of what actually happened here, but which the majority refuses to acknowledge: that the juvenile court\u2019s order terminated Heriberto\u2019s parental rights. Thus, although I share the majority\u2019s concern, I cannot subscribe to its methods. The result produced here under the majority\u2019s construction ultimately can, and probably would, be produced through custody and termination proceedings without distorting our statutes governing <em>parentage </em>determinations, ignoring the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent, and rendering our statutes unconstitutional. Finally, unlike the majority, I conclude that where a biological father who is a prisoner files a paternity claim in a dependency proceeding and asks to be present when the claim is decided, permitting a court to reject the claim\u2014and thereby terminate his parental rights\u2014in his involuntary absence is contrary to statute. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-10\"> The majority also holds that the biological father was entitled to be present at the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings where the juvenile court declared the child a dependent of the court, but that the court\u2019s violation of this right was harmless. Although I agree with this analysis, I also conclude, as explained in part IV, <em>post, </em>that the court\u2019s jurisdictional and dispositional findings should be reversed for other reasons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> Unless otherwise stated, all further statutory citations are to the Family Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\"> Both subdivision (a) of section 7541 and section 7554 are phrased negatively; that is, they state the result when a blood test shows that a man is <em>not </em>the father of the child.

(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 595-596, 603.) However, the record shows that the juvenile court based its finding regarding Paul <em>only </em>on subdivision (a) of section 7611, and that no one argued in the juvenile court that he qualified for the presumption under section 7611, subdivision (d). In this regard, citing section 7611, subdivision (a), the Court of Appeal stated that Paul \u201cqualifies as a presumed father because he and Jesusa\u2019s mother were married to each other at the time of Jesusa\u2019s birth.\u201d Nor does the record contain sufficient evidence to support the majority\u2019s independent finding that Paul met the requirements of section 7611, subdivision (d), specifically, that he \u201copenly [held] out [Jesusa] as his <em>natural </em>child.\u201d (Italics added.) The record indicates that Paul has never claimed to be Jesusa\u2019s natural father. (See <em>Adoption of Michael H. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1043, 1051 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 445, 898 P.2d 891] [presumption under \u00a77611, subd.

The majority notes that Jesusa\u2019s mother declared in writing that Paul had held himself out as Jesusa\u2019s father. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 597.) However, this hearsay document is contrary to all of the other evidence in the case and, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), was not \u201cgiven any legal weight\u201d in the juvenile court. My disagreement with the majority on this point does not affect my analysis or conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\"> The majority concedes that similar language in section 7541, subdivision (a), establishes that a presumption \u201cis rebutted by evidence of biological fatherhood.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 613.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\"> The majority asserts that these provisions do not apply here because no testing was requested or performed and \u201ccase law has strictly construed these testing requirements.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 616.) However, the case the majority cites for the latter proposition is completely inapposite; it declined to consider test results to rebut the conclusive presumption under section 7540 because the person offering the results had no statutory standing to challenge that presumption. <em>(Rodney F. </em>v. <em>Karen M. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 233, 238-240 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 399].) In any event, even were the majority correct, as I explain, the legislative policy reflected by these statutes and the legislative history support my conclusion that Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity is determinative despite the absence of testing. Given our duty to construe section 7612 in the context of the entire statutory scheme, rather than in isolation, the purported technical inapplicability of the testing provisions does not, as the majority asserts, justify its refusal \u201cto definitively construe the scheme.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 617.) Finally, the majority fails to explain why it is \u201cunwise\u201d (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 616) to apply this legislative policy given the trial court\u2019s express and uncontested finding that Heriberto is Jesusa\u2019s biological father. Indeed, the majority\u2019s assertion in this regard is inconsistent with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>own conclusion that the juvenile court here was \u201cobliged\u201d to consider Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity in weighing competing presumptions under section 7611. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 608.) If, as the majority holds, Heriberto\u2019s biological paternity was sufficiently established to <em>require </em>its consideration, then it should be considered as the Legislature has directed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The same analysis establishes that proof of biological paternity necessarily rebuts the other nonconclusive presumptions under section 7611, including the presumption under subdivision (d) of that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b643-6\"> These provisions show one additional thing: that the court in <em>In re Raphael P. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 716, 734 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 610], erred in stating that section 7551 \u201cdo[es] not authorize courts to order genetic testing of a man who meets the statutory test for presumed fatherhood.\u201d To support its statement, the court reasoned that section 7611 refers to testing of an \u201calleged father,\u201d not a \u201cpresumed father[].\u201d <em>(In re Raphael P, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 734.) However, as explained above, sections 7541 and 7576 provide that testing of a <em>presumed </em>father done \u201cpursuant to\u201d section 7551 rebuts their respective presumptions if it shows that the <em>presumed </em>father is not the biological father. (\u00a7\u00a7 7541, subd. (a), 7576, subd. (d).) Accordingly, the term \u201calleged father\u201d in section 7551 must include <em>presumed </em>fathers; otherwise, the testing of <em>presumed </em>fathers to which sections 7541 and 7576 refer could not be performed \u201cpursuant to\u201d section 7551.

Proc., former \u00a7 1980.3)].) Moreover, it is unlikely the Legislature would authorize testing of presumed fathers who qualify for the so-called <em>conclusive </em>presumptions, but not of presumed fathers who qualify only for a nonconclusive presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In any event, when Paul and Heriberto first appeared in this action and <em>alleged </em>that they qualified for a paternity presumption, they were merely \u201calleged father[s].\u201d (\u00a77551.)

Moreover, as I have explained, the hierarchy of presumptions stated in section 7576, subdivision (e), establishes that a presumption under section 7555 based on biological paternity outweighs the presumptions set forth in subdivisions (a) through (e) of section 7611.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, <em>Steven W. </em>v. <em>Matthew S. </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1108 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 535] <em>(Steven W.) </em>did not \u201creject[]\u201d my approach. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 618.) There, the <em>only </em>issue the court addressed was whether the \u201cpresumed father status\u201d of a man who qualifies for a presumption under two subdivisions <em>of section 7611 </em>necessarily \u201ccontrols\u201d over the \u201cpresumed father status\u201d of a man who qualifies for a presumption under only <em>subdivision (a) of section 7611.

I do not contend otherwise; when the 1973 Act was drafted, \u201cgenetic testing\u201d had not reached the point where it could definitively identify the father, although it could, in some cases, conclusively <em>exclude </em>certain men. As explained above, it was not until 1986 that, according to the Legislature, \u201cthe science of genetic testing ha[d] advanced to the degree that\u201d an affirmative presumption of paternity could be based on such testing. (Stats. 1986, ch. 629, \u00a7 1, pp. 2136-2137; cf. 9 West\u2019s U. Laws Ann., <em>supra, </em>Miscellaneous Acts, 1952 Act, comrs. note No. 1, p. 102.) Thus, in 1973, a weighing provision was necessary in light of scientific limitations on \u201cgenetic testing.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 615.) This does not change the fact that the focus of the 1973 Act was identifying a child\u2019s <em>biological </em>father through whatever means were available. Indeed, by emphasizing advances in genetic testing, the recent revisions to the 1973 Act confirm this fact.

Given the juvenile court\u2019s statement that it would not consider such evidence, it is unlikely the court would have allowed Heriberto to call other witnesses on the issue. Nor, in light of the juvenile court\u2019s statement, did Heriberto have any reason to offer such evidence. Finally, the other potential witnesses could only testify regarding their personal knowledge of Heriberto\u2019s action; they could not testify about any of his actions of which they were unaware.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\"> Under the majority\u2019s analysis, even a married man who lives with his wife and biological child for two years and fulfills all of his responsibilities as a father apparently does not qualify for constitutional protection unless he takes additional steps to formalize his paternal relationship.

However, the conclusion that Heriberto does not seek any of the responsibilities of fatherhood does <em>not </em>logically follow from his imprisonment. Moreover, the record affirmatively refutes the majority\u2019s statement; in his formal request that the court enter a judgment establishing his paternity, Heriberto acknowledged that if the judgment is entered, he \u201cwill have the obligation to support the child until the child reaches,\u201d at minimum, \u201cthe age of 18.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\"> See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr52/nvsr52_10.pdf (as of Mar. 1, 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> According to the majority\u2019s own analysis, only one class of biological fathers\u2014those \u201cwho are married to and cohabit with the mother\u201d at the time of the child\u2019s conception\u2014do not need the mother\u2019s cooperation after the child\u2019s birth to be protected. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 612.) Even this proposition is arguable. Section 7612, subdivision (b), without qualification, provides for the weighing of all presumptions that \u201carise under Section 7611,\u201d and section 7611 expressly incorporates the presumption under \u201c[s]ection 7540.\u201d Thus, where the husband is the biological father, even though his section 7540 presumption cannot be rebutted under subdivision (a) of section 7612, under subdivision (b) of that section, it is arguably subject to weighing against another man\u2019s presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\"> I also agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the juvenile court\u2019s error in this regard was harmless.
