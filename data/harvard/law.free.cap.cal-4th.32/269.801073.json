Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 189),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, based on the same attack, of assault by a person serving a life sentence, with force likely to produce great bodily injury which resulted in death (\u00a7 4500). In a separate proceeding, the jury found true the special circumstance allegations that defendant had been previously convicted of six first degree murders. (\u00a7\u00a7 190.1, subd. (b), 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) The jury set the punishment on both counts at death.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The case is before us on defendant\u2019s automatic appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a711, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7 1239, subd. (b).) For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">A. <em>Guilt </em>Phase<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">On August 23, 1990, defendant entered the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi serving a sentence of 156 years to life. On September 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>1990, at approximately 1:00 a.m., defendant attracted the attention of Correctional Officer Daniel Escobar, and told Escobar, \u201cI murdered my cellie.\u201d Defendant\u2019s cellmate was Walter Holt. Defendant also said that the murder had occurred approximately three hours earlier, and that \u201che had told the floor officer five minutes ago, but she didn\u2019t believe him.\u201d Officer Escobar notified Correctional Officer Kathleen Brown and Sergeant Courtois in the prison\u2019s central control. Officer Brown did not attempt to stop him from calling Sergeant Courtois. Officer Escobar wrote a report on the incident after twice being asked not to by Sergeant Avery because Officer Brown had discovered the incident first. Officer Escobar felt he should write a report because he was the one who actually \u201cphoned it in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Defendant subsequently made two statements early that same morning describing the killing. In his first statement, which one of the interrogating officers wrote down as defendant spoke, defendant said, \u201cThey put me in with this guy and I was just sitting there. [H]e went up to bed. I waited 3 [hours], I ripped off the thick part of the sheet [and] put it around his head and neck. [T]hen I pulled on the sheet with both hands. Then he went out for a second. [T]hen he said what the fuck. [H]is hands flew up in my face and neck. Then I kept squeezing. I felt his heart pulsating. I kept squeezing till it stopped then put a knot in the sheet. [T]hen I got down and got another piece of sheet. [W]ent back up to his bed put [it] around his neck and put it around my foot for a pulley and pulled it real tight and held for awhile. [T]hen I waited from 10:00 until the officer came by at I think at 12:30. [T]hen I told the officer I think I killed my cellie.\u201d After this statement was written down, defendant continued to talk with the officers for eight to 10 minutes. He told them that \u201che was on a mission from God to take and to kill these transients.\u201d He also made \u201ca statement to the effect that he was supposed to kill old people.\u201d Defendant felt he was God\u2019s own voice on earth. Defendant was excited, very eager to talk, and perspiring profusely.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In his second statement, which was tape-recorded, defendant stated that he had decided to kill his cellmate (he did not know Mr. Holt\u2019s name) as soon as he was put in Mr. Holt\u2019s cell between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. that evening. \u201cThe reason I did it, is because they charged me with six murders in the L.A. County Jail. They were all . . . trumped up charges, they were fake charges. I didn\u2019t kill anybody. I confessed to what I did. They insisted that they charge me with murder, so I sit in the cell. So finally, they screwed me around and gave me a stupid deal, instead of . . . giving me the death penalty. They gave me a dumb deal for six life sentences, consecutive. And I figured well, if I ever get a chance to kill somebody, I\u2019ll just kill them .... Just so they know that I really finally did kill somebody. Even if it was just an old man.\u201d Defendant felt \u201cnothing\u201d after the murder. When the topic of sharing a cell in the future came up, defendant said, \u201cI\u2019d like to be in a cell with somebody, it would give me somebody to talk to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Dr. John Holloway, who in 1990 worked for the Kern County Coroner\u2019s Office, performed an autopsy on Mr. Holt. The cause of death was \u201chypoxia leading to asphyxia due to ligature strangulation.\u201d Mr. Holt probably lost consciousness in less than a minute and died soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Documentary evidence was introduced that at the time of the capital crime defendant was serving a sentence of six consecutive terms of 25 years to life, plus one year, for a total term of 156 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">On September 21, 1990, Correctional Officer Kathleen Brown was employed at the Tehachapi correctional facility. At approximately 1:00 a.m., defendant told her, \u201cI killed my cellie.\u201d She told Correctional Officer Escobar to radio and get medical personnel, \u201cthe lieutenant and the sergeant to our building.\u201d She did not mention Officer Escobar in her report. She did mention the people he contacted, with a reference that she had notified them. Officer Brown did personally notify the control sergeant, but could not recall to whom she spoke, and did not mention the call in her report.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">B. <em>Special Circumstance Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The prosecution introduced documentary evidence defendant had six 1990 prior first degree murder convictions. The defense rested without presenting any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">C. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">1. <em>Prosecution Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The prosecution introduced evidence regarding some of the circumstances underlying defendant\u2019s six prior murder convictions, and one stabbing in which the victim survived. On January 20, 1987, defendant was arrested. At the time of his arrest, he dropped a newspaper containing a knife that appeared to have wet blood on it. He was interviewed that day by Detective Addison Arce regarding a series of stabbings that had occurred \u201cin approximately Koreatown of Los Angeles.\u201d Defendant described stabbing victims while they slept, dug through garbage, fought with others, or simply walked along. He did not know any of the people he stabbed. He indicated the incidents were not serious because the victims were \u201cbums\u201d or \u201ctransients.\u201d \u201cIt ain\u2019t nothing, man, three or four bums. I don\u2019t see what the big fucking deal is, what the big fucking deal is, man.\u201d Defendant did not believe anyone had died from his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>On November 19, 1989, defendant was a patient at Atascadero State Hospital. On that date, registered nurse Toni Christensen was approached by hospital patient Donald McCully. Mr. McCully had sustained numerous puncture wounds and was \u201ccovered in blood from his eyebrow down to his belt.\u201d In a statement to Sergeant Sue Murphy, security personnel for the hospital, defendant said he first tried to suffocate Mr. McCully. Mr. McCully was able to break free, at which point defendant stabbed him with a pencil. \u201cHe said he was trying to stab him in the heart, but the pencil broke, and at that point he began to stab him in the face area[.]\u201d He was trying to kill Mr. McCully, but when the pencil broke, he attempted to poke out his eyes. He \u201cseemed irritated because he did not kill Mr. McCully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">On November 12, 1991, Correctional Officer Granville Warren searched defendant\u2019s Tehachapi cell. He discovered an approximately five-inch-long sharp plastic stabbing weapon hidden in defendant\u2019s mattress.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">On January 23, 1992, Correctional Officer Albert Carter was conducting unclothed body searches on certain Tehachapi inmates, including defendant, before they were released to the exercise yard. He removed the handcuffs from defendant, who began to get undressed. Officer Carter then removed the handcuffs from inmate Renaldo Navarez, and he also began to get undressed. Defendant then stabbed Mr. Navarez with a piece of metal so that it protruded from his head about \u201can inch back just over ... the eye.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">On January 26, 1992, Correctional Officer James Lundy observed a large quantity of smoke billowing out of defendant\u2019s Tehachapi cell. Defendant was removed from the cell. He had set fire primarily to personal papers and newspapers.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On April 17, 1992, Correctional Officer Monte Gould searched defendant\u2019s Tehachapi cell. He found an approximately five-inch-long \u201cinmate-manufactured stabbing instrument that was produced from a wall outlet . . . and was cut in half and sharpened to a point.\u201d Defendant told Officer Gould he had concealed other weapons in the mattress. A subsequent search of the mattress revealed two more shanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">On May 12, 1992, Correctional Officer Daniel Price performed a random search of defendant\u2019s .Tehachapi cell. He discovered in the mattress a single-edge razor blade, an approximately three-inch-long copper wire, and an approximately six-inch-long sharp metal weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">On July 12, 1992, Correctional Officer David Goodman took coffee to defendant\u2019s Tehachapi cell. When the cup was half-full, defendant forcefully struck the cup with the back of his right hand; the spilled coffee slightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>burned Officer Goodman\u2019s leg. Defendant also yelled and struck Officer Goodman with his left hand. Defendant was subsequently moved to a cell where he would not have the opportunity to direct food items back at an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Documentary evidence was introduced that defendant had suffered two felony drug convictions in 1984 and 1985. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11360.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">2. <em>Defense Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Michael and Peter Whyte, two of defendant\u2019s older half brothers, testified. When defendant was bom in 1962, the Whyte family lived in a wealthy neighborhood in Bay City, Michigan. Defendant\u2019s mother, whose name at the time of trial was Karen Walls, was originally the family babysitter. She and defendant\u2019s biological father, Edward Whyte, were approximately 25 years apart in age.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Edward Whyte was a very intelligent man and the only son of a wealthy family. He had a significant drinking problem. He would have blackouts and not remember what happened for weeks at a time. Peter testified, \u201csometimes we were terrified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Defendant\u2019s mother also drank. Defendant was primarily cared for by an older half sister and the housekeeper, Dora Howard, and was well taken care of. Karen and defendant lived with the Whytes approximately one and a half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">When he was approximately 13, defendant came back to live with the Whytes for a couple of months. The Whytes now lived in a trailer on the Saginaw Bay. According to Peter, defendant \u201cwas pretty much a blank slate, clean slate, just a wide-eyed kid with a big grin on his face.\u201d Defendant became exposed to and participated in his half brothers\u2019 frequent drag use, which included marijuana, LSD, and PCP. Michael testified he had defendant \u201cdealing stuff for me at the school.\u201d Michael also taught defendant how to play the guitar. Defendant was on friendly terms with his father. Defendant moved out because Peter was concerned about defendant\u2019s welfare and that defendant would get in trouble with drugs at school and lead the police back to the Whyte family.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">In 1985 or 1986, defendant caused his half brother Michael to be evicted from his apartment because defendant was sleeping in the hall. Michael was subsequently evicted from a different apartment because defendant was illegally living next door in a vacant apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Defendant briefly visited Peter and Peter\u2019s wife and child in 1986. Defendant had on dirty clothes, was unbathed, and was carrying a steak knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Both Peter and Michael had been, at some point, incarcerated for drug dealing. Another of defendant\u2019s older half brothers, Earl, suffered from drug-induced schizophrenia and had not worked since the 1960\u2019s. Peter stopped all illegal drug activity in 1984 when he became a Jehovah\u2019s Witness. He had been employed at the same location for eight years and was married and had three children at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Dora Howard testified she went to work as the Whytes\u2019 housekeeper when defendant was about two weeks old. She left in 1968, but remained acquainted with Edward Whyte until he died. According to Dora, Edward and Karen drank frequently. Karen, at least twice, put defendant in a dresser drawer and shut it when she grew weary of his crying. Defendant\u2019s natural parents also gave him \u201cparagoric,\u201d which made him sleep for long periods of time. After Karen moved out of the Whyte home, Dora was called two or three times a month by Karen\u2019s neighbors because defendant had been left alone for a long time and was crying. Dora would go over to Karen\u2019s home and find defendant \u201cwet and dirty,\u201d and also find \u201cbottles with sour milk in them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Dora further testified that when defendant was about 14 and associating with the Whytes, Edward Whyte became concerned for defendant\u2019s welfare and apparently did not want him to be in that environment. Edward told defendant \u201che didn\u2019t want him around anymore, and he wasn\u2019t a son of his, and to get out and never call him or come back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Leroy Danks, defendant\u2019s adoptive father, testified. Leroy met defendant\u2019s mother Karen and defendant in 1965. Karen was 21, and defendant was approximately two and a half. At times Karen came home with other men and Leroy would leave. Leroy married Karen in 1966, and adopted defendant. \u201cI didn\u2019t adopt him just for his name. I adopted him because I felt I wanted to.\u201d Defendant \u201calways told [Leroy] he was real lucky, . . . luckier than most kids that he had two fathers.\u201d Karen left Leroy two or three times, taking defendant with her, to move back with the Whytes.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">At some point the family moved from Michigan to South Dakota. They had \u201ca nice house\u201d with three bedrooms, a playroom, and a fenced yard. After six or seven months, they moved to Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Leroy testified that defendant \u201cwas a good kid,\u201d and Leroy had no problem disciplining him; \u201cI usually didn\u2019t have to speak over the second time.\u201d Leroy\u2019s only problem with defendant was his propensity to stay up late. Defendant loved to go fishing, and was always asking Leroy, whom he called \u201cDad,\u201d to take him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>During the marriage, Karen and Leroy had two more boys. Leroy left Karen in December 1970 when defendant was about eight because of Karen\u2019s relationship with Gene Walls. Karen later married Walls. Leroy did not see defendant after 1971 until defendant was about 14 because Karen and defendant moved back to Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Leroy further testified that when defendant was 14, Karen told Leroy she could not handle defendant any more and asked if he could live with Leroy. Defendant lived with Leroy for about a year. He told Leroy that Walls beat him for minor infractions and verbally abused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In 1981, when defendant was about 19 years old, he visited Leroy. During the visit he inexplicably took all the covers off the electrical sockets and stacked them in a neat pile.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">In 1985, defendant joined Leroy on his trucking route. After the first day or so, defendant refused to go into cafes. Defendant told Leroy old people were chasing him, and he wanted Leroy to bring his food to the truck. Defendant also carried a steak knife for protection. Leroy purchased new clothes for defendant, and defendant was also given clothes by Leroy\u2019s friends. After approximately a couple of weeks together, defendant became angry in the truck for reasons unclear to Leroy, told Leroy he was not his \u201creal dad,\u201d got out of the truck, took off the new clothes in the rain, put on his old clothes, and left. Leroy did not see defendant again \u201cuntil I walked into this courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Karen Walls, defendant\u2019s mother, testified. Karen\u2019s mother died when she was three, her father when she was 14. She became romantically involved with Edward Whyte when she was 17. Edward had previously been a heroin addict. In addition to defendant, Karen had four other sons, one of whom had been put up for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Karen drank mildly during her pregnancy with defendant. Defendant was bom two months premature and weighed three pounds 15 ounces. He was in an incubator for four to six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Karen moved out of the Whyte home a few months after defendant was bom. She left for a variety of reasons, including the fact that she and Edward got into an argument and he broke her nose. Karen continued to see Edward, and would put defendant in a dresser drawer as a makeshift crib when she visited. She did not shut him inside the dresser.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Karen further testified that she married Leroy Danks in 1965, but he was unfaithful. She began her relationship with Gene Walls while she was still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>married to Leroy Danks, and married Walls in 1972. Defendant did not get along with Gene Walls. When defendant was 12, Karen told defendant that Edward Whyte was his natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In her testimony, Karen delineated aspects of her family\u2019s mental health history. Karen\u2019s grandmother suffered from schizophrenia, as did her grandmother\u2019s son. One of Karen\u2019s other sons suffered from a chemical imbalance.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Karen also described certain incidents, apparently to demonstrate defendant\u2019s mental health. Defendant fell off the bed when he was a month old, and was involved in two car accidents in 1977. In 1977, Karen was advised by a Dr. Franks that defendant was suffering from \u201csome sort of psychiatric disturbance.\u201d Beginning in 1979, when defendant was 16 years old, until 1982, defendant hitchhiked for extended periods of time. When he was 16, he was arrested in Mexico, and his release was negotiated by Edward Whyte. During the years 1979-1982, defendant also began to wash dishes he took out of the cupboard before he would use them, and once moved all of Karen\u2019s wall hangings from eye level to the ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In May 1982, defendant made unusual statements, such as \u201cRonald Reagan smokes 10,000 weeds a day,\u201d and accused his mother and aunt of printing counterfeit money. He also said that his grandparents, all of whom were deceased, had spoken to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">In October 1982, defendant walked into a New Jersey elementary school in shredded clothes. Upon his return to Michigan, defendant would go out in the backyard and start screaming at someone not visible to Karen to \u201cshut up.\u201d At some point, defendant asked Karen to take him to the road so he could leave. She did so, and then persuaded him to get back into the car. Defendant said, \u201cIt won\u2019t stop. I\u2019ve got to set myself on fire. I got to kill somebody so I can go to prison for the rest of my life.\u201d In October 1982 Karen had defendant involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital. After approximately two weeks he was given grounds access and left the facility. He was found in Florida and placed in a psychiatric institution there. As in Michigan, however, defendant walked away from the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In late 1983, defendant lived with Karen for a couple of months. According to Karen, he \u201cwas still bizarre\u201d and carried a knife for protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">After defendant\u2019s 1987 arrest for murder but before his transfer to Atascadero, Karen spoke with him. Defendant told Karen his attorney, Larry Rivetz, was a vice cop, and there was a conspiracy against him that went all the way from Daryl Gates, to the mayor, to President Reagan. \u201cRonald Reagan gave the order and this is why all of this happened to him.\u201d Following his arrival at Atascadero and his placement on medication, he did not make statements about Ronald Reagan.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Dr. Robert Jackson, a professor of microbiology and Executive Associate Dean of the Southern Illinois School of Medicine, testified. In approximately July 1982, Dr. Jackson was taking a motorcycle trip from Illinois to the western United States. He picked up defendant, who was dressed lightly in inclement weather. The two traveled together for the next two days. Defendant had no money or identification. When Dr. Jackson asked defendant if he wanted to join him for coffee, defendant expressed fear they were being watched through the restaurant security camera, \u201cglued himself . . . against the wall and the window,\u201d and \u201cslinkfed] along.\u201d Later, at dinner, defendant ordered a box of cereal and milk, after ascertaining the milk would come in a box. He said he had been incarcerated in Mexico, and \u201cknew that people put shit in the food, and because of that he was afraid to eat prepared food.\u201d Defendant remained reluctant to eat prepared food during the time the two traveled together.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">At the motel that night, defendant expressed concern Dr. Jackson and defendant were being watched through the television set. During their stay at a motel the following night, defendant became upset by a courtroom scene and kicked the television set. Dr. Jackson turned the television off, and commented to defendant that something was troubling him. The two then had a discussion regarding defendant\u2019s life. Defendant felt discomfort because he was \u201cbom a bastard,\u201d he had had at least two stepfathers, his mother had married several times, and he hated his current stepfather. He was angry with his mother for creating an \u201cinjurious\u201d environment, and because she did not come to defendant\u2019s aid. Defendant had self-inflicted round bum scars on his forearms. More than once during the trip he said \u201che particularly liked clean people and clean things and being with clean people. This was a theme.\u201d Dr. Jackson did not believe defendant was play acting or trying to act crazy. \u201cI took this to be a young boy who needed help.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Peggy Walkowiak, who in June 1986 was a probation officer for the State of Michigan, testified. Ms. Walkowiak was assigned defendant\u2019s case after he pled guilty to attempted possession of a short-barrel rifle. She interviewed defendant and noticed unusual behavior. Defendant did not drink coffee, milk, or juice at the jail \u201cbecause he believed that they might be trying to poison him.\u201d He washed his jail jumpsuit and refused to wear any others because he was afraid they were not clean. \u201cHe also talked about a motel room that he had shot up because it was too dirty, it wasn\u2019t clean enough. He was very concerned with his cleanliness and with other people out to get him.\u201d In her opinion defendant was paranoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Ms. Walkowiak initiated a mental health evaluation of defendant. She was dissatisfied with the psychiatric work-up. Ms. Walkowiak also interviewed defendant\u2019s mother, who relayed her belief defendant needed mental health</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>assistance. Defendant also had a long history of marijuana abuse. Ms. Walkowiak recommended the court incarcerate defendant in prison with substance abuse therapy and a psychiatric evaluation. In September 1986, the court placed defendant on probation, and he absconded within two weeks. Ms. Walkowiak had \u201cnever seen anyone with more mental health problems than [defendant] in the time that [she had] been doing this work.\u201d She did not feel he was \u201cputting [her] on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In 1987, Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Nick D\u2019Angelo worked at the men\u2019s central jail. He testified he had daily contact with defendant for a period of over 10 months. \u201cHe was always extremely paranoid. He would say the system is railroading him. He would say his attorneys are against him. . .. [T]he whole system was out to get him .... Then an hour later, he would admit to\u201d stabbing people, but say \u201cI didn\u2019t kill those guys.\u201d Defendant said his food was poisoned, \u201cthat somebody is in the kitchen excreting in his food. He would state Burt Reynolds, Johnny Carson is down there, I know they\u2019re excreting in my food, and I want to pick my own tray.\u201d \u201cIt was practically a daily thing.\u201d Defendant would clean his cell on his hands and knees with a toothbrush an average of six to 10 times a day. \u201cIt was the cleanest cell I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d He believed he was being brainwashed by the music broadcast in the jail. Defendant\u2019s demeanor did not change when different people were around him. In particular, when Deputy Sheriff D\u2019Angelo watched defendant through a one-way glass, he acted the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Daniel Grajeda, an inmate at Tehachapi, testified that prison deputies would tell defendant \u201cthey had put human sperm in his food. I seen the deputies come like antagonize him and mess with his mind.\u201d This was apparently why defendant threw his trays at the deputies. The deputies would also locate another \u201cweird strange character\u201d in a cell next to defendant, and the two would throw cups of urine, water, or human waste mixed with water at each other. The two would then be separated. When defendant thought he was hearing things or was possessed, Grajeda and others would \u201cmess with him a little bit and accuse the KGB of messing with him.\u201d Because of the threats about human sperm, defendant preferred to pick his own food tray, and would become upset if he was not permitted to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Defendant also introduced testimony apparently intended to demonstrate that Tehachapi officials should have been on notice regarding his violent character prior to September 21, 1990. In addition, defendant introduced expert witness testimony that if he were serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, at least initially he would be isolated from other prisoners given the nature of his \u201cbehavior.\u201d However, defendant would still have opportunity to come into contact with others, such as prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>personnel administering any involuntary medication. Moreover, there was no guarantee he would not ultimately be returned to the general prison population.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Dr. Eugene Kunzman, a psychiatrist at the Los Angeles County jail, evaluated defendant and reviewed certain records at an unspecified time. He formed the opinion defendant had paranoid schizophrenia, an antisocial personality disorder, and a history of polysubstance abuse. Dr. Kunzman testified, \u201cHe was a very sick, disabled psychiatric patient, inmate at that time.\u201d According to Dr. Kunzman, breaking the law and rules, and lying or a lack of truthfulness, are fairly characteristic in someone with an antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Dr. Robert Hill, a staff psychiatrist at Atascadero State Hospital, treated defendant when he was found incompetent to stand trial for the prior murder allegations in Los Angeles County. Defendant was at Atascadero from June 1989 to March 1990. Upon admission, defendant was diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia and an antisocial personality disorder. He also had a significant history of marijuana abuse. Defendant had a relatively low global assessment functioning score, which was even lower when he was discharged because of the staff\u2019s increased \u201cknowledge[] of the extraordinary destructiveness of the homicidal potential of the patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Dr. Hill testified that \u201c[h]allucinations and/or delusions are ordinarily present in most schizophrenic people,\u201d and that defendant was delusional. He explained that it is easier for schizophrenic delusions to control a person who also has an antisocial personality disorder because a person with such a disorder has fewer internal controls. Dr. Hill recalled one instance in which defendant \u201cwas becoming more delusional, and he loves that. He gets excited by it. It\u2019s a very happy state of being for him. . . . [Wjhen he gets into his sickness, he\u2019s a happy camper because he\u2019s full of exotic violent themes and the wishes to kill. And this stems from a delusional self-concept that occupies his mind which is that he is righteously performing murders or harming people[,] something that he also enjoys greatly.\u201d Defendant described himself as a \u201cbum buster.\u201d It \u201cwas his dedication to seek out and find bums and bust them, in his terms,\u201d and fellow Atascadero hospital patient McCully \u201cfit that mold.\u201d Defendant \u201chad a great desire in his delusional system to be able to follow disadvantaged people, ... to track them, to kill them, homeless type people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Dr. Hill further testified that when defendant was on Haldol, he became \u201cless attentive\u201d to the \u201cvery sick violent concepts that he had.\u201d There was \u201ca modest remission of the more distracting psychotic features.\u201d When defendant was taken off Haldol for a trial period, he attacked McCully. The medication was resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Defendant was referred to a neurologist because he was suspected of having a brain cyst. The \u201cconclusion was [that] no such organic problem with his brain existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Ultimately defendant was found to be competent to stand trial; to remain so, he needed to be on medication. He nonetheless was \u201ca serious and continuing homicidal threat.\u201d Dr. Hill \u201ctried to express in [his] discharge document that this was an extraordinarily dangerous individual regardless of whatever level of psychiatric improvement he may have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Dr. John Riley, a clinical psychologist at Atascadero State Hospital, ran tests on defendant approximately two months after he arrived at the hospital to determine his intellectual functioning, personality functioning, and his mental status. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale indicated defendant had an I.Q. of 106, which placed him in the average range of intelligence. This test took an hour and a half on two separate occasions. Defendant \u201cresponded appropriately, was cooperative, [and] participated meaningfully in the process.\u201d While defendant told Dr. Riley there was nothing wrong with him, he scored high on two portions of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. One high score suggested defendant did not follow the instructions, did not understand what was going on, responded randomly, or suffered from a severe thought disorder. The other high score was on the schizophrenic illness scale. The \u201cfirst impression of the computer printout\u201d of his Rorschach inkblot test results also indicated \u201ca distinct possibility he suffered from schizophrenia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Dr. Riley further testified that defendant \u201cswore he would never take[] medications at [the] Los Angeles County [jail], so we wanted to see if we could maintain the competent state off the medications.\u201d As noted earlier, defendant subsequently assaulted fellow patient McCully. Some of the psychological tests were administered when defendant was off medication, although Dr. Riley did not specify which ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">By January 1990, Dr. Riley was of the opinion defendant was competent, and his schizophrenic illness was in remission while defendant was on medication. Defendant needed to be on medication to maintain a state of trial competency. Dr. Riley also believed defendant had \u201csociopathic tendencies, would be prone to lie and manipulate and [was] given to criminal acts.\u201d While defendant stated he did not believe the people he was alleged to have killed had actually died, the consensus of Dr. Riley and the rest of the treatment team was this was not a \u201cpsychotic denial, but rather a convenient denial, a sort of isolated phenomenon that he has fabricated to deal with the enormity of the situation.\u201d It was not a delusion related to his schizophrenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Dr. William Wirshing, a physician who was board certified in psychiatry and neurology, with a subspecialty in the study and treatment of schizophrenia, and who also was an associate professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, testified generally about schizophrenia. In Dr. Wirshing\u2019s opinion, available treatments do not cure but do decrease the manifestations of the illness. While it is possible a paranoid schizophrenic with a history of homicidal violence could be managed in a prison setting, \u201c[t]here are schizophrenics who are beyond the reach of current medical technology.\u201d For 70 percent of paranoid schizophrenics, however, conventional \u201cmedications are helpful.\u201d Violence tends to decrease as a schizophrenic patient gets older.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Dr. Wirshing also reviewed some of defendant\u2019s medical records, but did not interview defendant. The records clearly indicated defendant\u2019s unwillingness in 1990 to .take medication in the Los Angeles County jail. His Atascadero records indicated he was \u201cat least partially treatment-responsive\u201d to conventional medication. Dr. Wirshing was aware, however, that at the time defendant was discharged from Atascadero, he was still characterized as an extremely dangerous individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Dr. Robert White, a forensic psychologist, was appointed by the Los Angeles County Superior Court in March 1989 to evaluate defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. He met with defendant and conducted a variety of tests. He also reviewed certain records and transcripts and consulted with defendant\u2019s attorney, Larry Rivetz, and Deputy Sheriff Nick D\u2019Angelo. Several test results were consistent with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and indicated that at the time of the testing defendant was suffering from a psychotic episode. Defendant maintained that he had wounded, not killed, a number of people, and \u201cthat if he could get a private attorney, then he would be able to get an investigator hired that could go to the hospital and determine that the victims had been released and, in fact, were not dead.\u201d Defendant felt Mr. Rivetz was part of a conspiracy to prosecute him for nonexistent homicides. Dr. White concluded defendant appeared to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and an antisocial personality disorder and was incompetent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Four or five doctors evaluated whether defendant was competent to stand trial. One of them, Dr. John Stahlberg, found him competent. Dr. White was aware of an incident in which defendant attacked Mr. Rivetz in the courtroom. Defendant told Dr. Stahlberg the only way to get a new attorney is to hurt your attorney by cutting him, and defendant did not think his attorney was doing a good enough job.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">In 1990, following defendant\u2019s stay at Atascadero, Dr. White again evaluated defendant in the Los Angeles County jail, conducting two interviews. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>learned defend\u00e1nt had very recently been taken off medication because of his adverse reaction. Dr. White testified that the types of medication plaintiff had been on can remain effective for some period of time after they are administered. During both interviews, defendant appeared to be under the effects of the medication. Defendant was very lethargic and did not manifest any delusional or psychotic thinking. Dr. White diagnosed defendant as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which was in remission due to medication. While defendant was competent at that time, there was a chance he could become incompetent again if appropriate medication was not administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Dr. Robert Bittle, a physician with a subspecialty in neuropsychiatry, evaluated defendant in January and March of 1992, and reviewed certain medical and social study reports. Dr. Bittle diagnosed defendant as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and a personality disorder. Defendant \u201cwas flouridly [sic] psychotic, out of control and dangerous.\u201d He was convinced his food was being poisoned, and that his attorneys were in \u201ccahoots\u201d with the district attorney and trial judge and were plotting against him. Defendant stated there had been no deaths in the cases in which he had previously been convicted of six murders, and that he was worth $6 million because he was going to secure judgments in that amount for the false accusations. During one interview, defendant was convinced he and Dr. Bittle were being watched. Defendant could not interpret any of the proverbs given him, such as \u201cyou can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make him drink,\u201d \u201cindicating that he has a serious thinking disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">According to Dr. Bittle, defendant \u201cis a sadist .... [W]hen I asked [defendant] to describe his feelings about the murders in Los Angeles, [he] became sexually excited. That is one of the motivations for Mr. Danks\u2019 behavior.\u201d In Dr. Bittle\u2019s opinion, even in a treated and improved condition, defendant \u201cis an extremely dangerous individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">A CAT scan administered to defendant in 1989 showed that defendant had a cyst on his brain. Dr. Bittle ordered a magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI), which was performed two months before his testimony. The cyst was half as large as it had been in. the CAT scan. The two sides of defendant\u2019s brain were not symmetrical. Dr. Bittle also ordered a brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) test. While it was \u201cnot very dramatic,\u201d this test indicated \u201cthere may, I emphasize may be some abnormalities, as far as the electrical activity in [defendant\u2019s] frontal region,\u201d and perhaps in defendant\u2019s left and right temporal regions. This test, \u201cin itself, is not going to give you a definitive diagnosis or answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Dr. Bittle concluded defendant was \u201cfunctioning abnormally, that he has organic brain dysfunction, as well as some mild damage to his brain.\u201d By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201corganic brain dysfunction,\u201d Dr. Bittle was referring to the possible electrical discharge abnormalities. By mild brain damage, he meant there was a documented cyst, \u201csome pressure or space occupying pressure on the brain,\u201d and some indication of abnormal electrical activity. By \u201cmild,\u201d he meant \u201cwe can\u2019t find, we can\u2019t identify a specific infarct or a specific tumor in certain parts of the brain, which we could then clearly translate into this is the brain damage, this is the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Dr. Bittle further stated that \u201cindividuals who have temporal lobe abnormalities can be seen as being impulsive, showing poor judgment. It\u2019s noted that they could be aggressive, and that they can be destructive, that they can have problems with memory concentration, and that they can have problems from the standpoint of . . . actual organic lesions that can cause schizophreniaform or clinical symptoms that mimic a classic schizophrenic disease.\u201d Factors such as genetics, low birth weight, head trauma, and drug abuse are important clinical data that one needs to have \u201cin terms of understanding a particular person\u2019s brain functioning and general behaviors.\u201d Persons who abuse drugs in significant amounts over significant periods of time can show brain damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Dr. Bittle conceded that people with schizophrenic relatives do not necessarily develop schizophrenia. Moreover, \u201c[i]t does not translate that all people with cysts are going to have problems.\u201d In addition, one can suffer brain dysfunction without brain damage. Simply because a person has brain damage or organic brain dysfunction, this does not necessarily mean they will be violent. In particular, the majority of people with frontal lobe dysfunction or temporal lobe damage are not violent. Likewise, the majority of people who have childhood head trauma, are born prematurely, or have low birth weight, do not become violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. Defense counsel made objections, but did not question defendant during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Defendant said, \u201cI would have pled guilty to this crime the very first day. I would have pled guilty.\u201d \u201cThere would have been no need for you and there would be no need for the money that was spent on this, because, obviously, it was an open and shut case. It is like I was caught red-handed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Defendant implied he would continue to be violent in a controlled setting. \u201c[Wjhat I\u2019m trying to say is, is that if you leave matches for a little kid to play with, he is going to play with them and bum himself, and I keep finding myself in these types of situations all of the time, and in jail. ...\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>to make it clear that if everything was just so hunky-dory and peachy-keen in prison, why am I being charged with Walter Holt and why did Mr. Dellostritto [defendant\u2019s counsel] get stabbed in his face . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cBut what I\u2019m saying is, this court seems to have picked up where God has abandoned us and saying, \u2018hey, man, we cannot allow someone to run wild out here,\u2019 and I did stab them bums in their back, in the back of their neck, in their side while they were laying down, while they were asleep, and I would do it to you too\u2014,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cLet me rephrase it. Just as I done it to Mr. Dellostritto, I would do it to Mr. Eyherabide [defendant\u2019s other counsel] if I had a chance.\u201d \u201c[T]hey sent me to the mental hospital after I practically slit Rodney\u2019s throat in the jail.\u201d \u201c[I]f you are man enough to get into it, be man enough to get out of it, and I guarantee if I spend every last day of my life in prison, it is of no consequence to me, man, either way, and that should be made clear. Because just like in L.A., it was of no consequence. I knew from the day that I got arrested, and it ain\u2019t stopped me yet, and I ain\u2019t never going to stop, so even if I was to be let out here right now, I ain\u2019t going to stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Defendant also stated, \u201cMr. Holt was an old man, and I wasn\u2019t in the habit of trying to kill, as you heard before, about killing old people, like all of these bums were old. I had no idea that these bums were old, because they were so filthy and dirty, you could not tell what was what, but somehow somebody has the impression that I was out to get an old man or somebody . . . that\u2019s not correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\u201cYou know, and I\u2019m not saying that you should feel sorry for me, because maybe this stuff warped my head when I was a kid . . . and because I was bom a bastard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying that you should feel sorry for me, because I was 11 years old and here I am turning into a dope fiend.\u201d \u201cBut I would not change a thing that I did in my life. That is riot to say I\u2019m proud. As far as going to school and graduating and getting a job and doing . . . what seems to be the normal thing in this world, I\u2019m the first one to admit that, in them respects, that I\u2019m a coward, I\u2019m the lowfest] of the\u2014I\u2019m a slime ball, a grease ball, a scum bag.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you today, that their not guilty by reason of insanity plea that saying you done it, you went out you stabbed this dude, and he supposedly died, and when you did it, you didn\u2019t know what you was doing, and it is like I\u2019m standing there but I\u2019m on Mars or something. I don\u2019t know how they can justify this and say you did it, but you don\u2019t know you did it. It is not like I was bio wed out on my mind with dope and PCP, but I was smoking dope and cigarettes, but it is not like I was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>drunk that I don\u2019t know how I got home. It wasn\u2019t like that at all and they are trying to tell you that I\u2019m absolutely crazy and I can\u2019t think and all of this. . . . I\u2019m trying to tell you that I have no problem thinking, functioning ... I have no trouble with my faculties. I can read. I can write. I can add, subtract, multiply. I can read my [prison rule handbook]. I can eat my food. I don\u2019t shit and piss in my pants, and I don\u2019t drool on myself, and it seems to me that they were trying to bring in the psychiatrist and tell you that I\u2019m just a fucking moron that can\u2019t do anything, and that is absolutely incorrect. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">3. <em>Rebuttal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Dr. Theodore Badgley, a psychiatrist and neurologist, was appointed in June 1992 to determine whether defendant was competent to stand trial. He met with defendant and reviewed voluminous medical records. After reading many of defendant\u2019s records, and before interviewing him, Dr. Badgley was \u201cpreconditioned to think\u201d defendant was \u201cmentally ill and off and on psychotic and not competent.\u201d However, while he diagnosed defendant as having an antisocial personality disorder, Dr. Badgley found no evidence of schizophrenia. Defendant did not \u201cappear psychotic in any way during [the] examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In Dr. Badgley\u2019s opinion, there were two explanations other than schizophrenia for defendant\u2019s apparent psychotic behavior in the past. First, when defendant was accused of being mentally ill or psychotic, \u201che got to the point where he was saying you are accusing me of it, I\u2019ll just be that way.\u201d Along these lines, Dr. Badgley saw defendant as \u201crather dramatic and attention-seeking, and in a bizarre way, you might say, playful, and I think he was getting the best of his captors, in a sense, and was able to con them into thinking that he was psychotic.\u201d \u201c[I]t gave him control of a situation and it gave him attention . . . .\u201d Second, while Dr. Badgley was doubtful this was the explanation for the psychotic elements perceived in the past by others, he noted defendant had a \u201cconsiderable history of drug usage, and a lot of the abusive substances are mind-altering and are associated with brief psychosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">While there was evidence from defendant\u2019s MRI that he had an \u201carachnoid\u201d cyst, such a cyst never affects a person\u2019s mental processes or thinking. It can in extremely rare cases cause a block in the cerebrospinal fluid system, so that pressure would build up and lead to paralysis and coma. \u201cBut the cyst, itself, does not disturb mental processes.\u201d The report on defendant\u2019s MRI stated there was \u201cno evidence of change in pressure or increased pressure\u201d on the cerebrospinal fluid system from the cyst. In the absence of pressure, \u201cthere is no way\u201d the cyst can affect the way a person is thinking or the operation of the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"Ade\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The report on defendant\u2019s BEAM test did not state the test revealed any abnormal electrical activity. In Dr. Badgley\u2019s opinion, after examining defendant and reviewing his medical records, MRI result, and BEAM test result, there was no evidence defendant suffered from any form of organic brain damage. It was conceivable very detailed microscopic neuropsychological testing might reveal some abnormality given defendant\u2019s history of drug abuse, but it \u201cwouldn\u2019t reflect very much in his functioning,\u201d that is, it would not mean he could not \u201creason or think or read and write.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">A. <em>Pretrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\"><em>Alleged </em>Faretta <em>Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Defendant contends his conviction and death sentence must be reversed because he was denied his right to represent himself, in violation of <em>Faretta v. California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]. We conclude defendant never invoked his right to self-representation because his references to such status were equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\n<em>1. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Three hearings are pertinent to this issue, although at the first hearing, defendant did not mention in propria persona status.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">On March 26, 1991, a hearing was held before Judge Wallace on a defense motion to continue the trial date. At the hearing, the trial court informed defendant he had a right to trial within 60 days of the time the indictment was filed, or on the currently scheduled trial date of April 8, 1991. The court stated, \u201cYour attorney has indicated a need for a significant amount of additional time to fully prepare your case for trial, and I\u2019m prepared to grant that continuance. It will require a time waiver on your part. Are you willing to waive your right to be tried within 60 days of the filing of the indictment against you, and agree to the continuance to October 15?\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d The court said, \u201cAll right. Do you understand that you do have a right to an attorney to represent you, and that, of course, means an attorney that is properly prepared to submit to the trier of fact all of the defenses that might be available to you, <em>and you cannot waive that right in this particular case, </em>and the right to an attorney means the right to a prepared attorney, and an attorney that can adequately represent you. And so it\u2019s important that you consider that in making your determination of whether or not you\u2019re willing to waive time. The Court would be inclined, even in [the] absence of a time waiver on your part, to consider a continuance, because of the Court\u2019s obligation to provide an attorney, which means prepared counsel, and based on . . . the declaration that\u2019s been filed in connection with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>motion, . . . certainly I think the continuance for an additional six months thereafter is well within the realm of reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Defendant made a number of statements in response, including expressing the view that the Los Angeles proceedings that led to his six prior murder convictions had been \u201ca fabric of lies.\u201d He also expressed the view that it was not \u201cright to be making me wait another six months .... Like I got my rights, but the way I look at my rights, they amount to about a pimple on the ass of life right now. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you allow this . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The trial court stated the validity of the six prior murder convictions was a \u201ckey element to this particular lawsuit,\u201d and hence counsel needed time to properly prepare. Defendant responded, \u201cWell the speedy trial act, the way I read about it, was a public rights bill, not a defendants\u2019 rights bill, has been amended to a defendants\u2019 rights bill, hasn\u2019t it, since the\u2014.\u201d The court reiterated that defendant had a right to be tried within 60 days of the filing of the indictment. \u201cYou also have another right. You have a constitutional right to be represented by counsel in this matter, <em>and in this particular case, it\u2019s not a right that you can waive. </em>Right to counsel doesn\u2019t mean the right to have some warm body standing next to you during the course of your trial, it\u2019s the right to have a qualified lawyer that is adequately prepared to present all available legal defenses on your behalf, and if it is not possible for the attorney to be prepared within the 60 days, then it becomes necessary for the Court to balance your right to a speedy trial with your right to have prepared counsel represent you in the course of the trial. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve suggested to you, in [the] absence of the time waiver, the Court is going to\u2014 undoubtedly at this point finds good cause to grant the continuance in any event. . . . [I]f you would prefer to go to trial on the 8th, with a warm body that doesn\u2019t have the ability to present all the defenses on your behalf and to get witnesses here to do that, that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Defendant replied, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I prefer, because it doesn\u2019t seem like you can do anything more to me. Unless you go back to the old days of swift justice and a PT bullet in the back of the head or some cyclone or whatever. But I just prefer to have this over and done with,\u201d describing some discomforts of prison. After further discussion between the court and defendant and the court and counsel, the continuance request was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">On September 23, 1991, another hearing was held before Judge Wallace on a defense request to continue the trial date from October 15, 1991, to February 18, 1992. The court inquired of defendant, \u201cAre you prepared to waive time so I can grant your attorneys\u2019 request for a continuance?\u201d After confirming Judge Wallace was the same judge who presided at the earlier hearing, defendant said, \u201cYou told me last time, over my objection, that my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>trial was starting . . . October 15.\u201d The court said, \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m just asking a very simple question, whether you\u2019re prepared to waive time.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared back then; what makes you think I\u2019m prepared right now?\u201d The court replied, \u201cI have no reason to know anything about what you\u2019re thinking, sir. And I\u2019ll take that to be a no answer, as far as a time waiver is concerned.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cIt\u2019s a no.\u201d The court said, \u201cI\u2019ll nevertheless find good cause, based on the materials in the motion, that have been submitted. I\u2019ll note that while Mr. Danks has a speedy trial right, and we\u2019ll do our best to protect that, he also has the right to counsel, which is a constitutional right, which is in this court\u2019s view, is . . . paramount ... to the speedy trial right, and preparatibn for trial is necessary to have counsel that is prepared. So I\u2019ll\u2014.\u201d Defendant asked, <em>\u201cWhat about going pro. per. ?\u201d </em>The court said, \u201cWell, then, we really have problems having counsel prepared.\u201d It then continued the trial, briefly discussed the timing of motion filing with counsel, and the proceeding adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">On February 11, 1992, a hearing was held on a defense discovery motion. At the start of the hearing, defense counsel informed the court defendant wanted to make a <em>Marsden </em>motion. <em>(People v. Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44].) The court elected to proceed first with defendant\u2019s discovery request. Once this was resolved, defense counsel moved defendant be examined pursuant to section 1368 to determine if he was competent to stand trial. Before addressing that issue, the court heard the <em>Marsden </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">At the 40-45 minute hearing on the <em>Marsden </em>motion, defendant complained about the number of continuances his attorneys had sought. He noted in particular the continuance of the preliminary examination had led to an indictment and loss of the opportunity for a preliminary hearing. He also expressed irritation that a trial date continuance had been granted over his objection. The court stated it takes some time for counsel to prepare a case like defendant\u2019s, and explained in particular how problems with discovery can cause delay. It then inquired, \u201cSo anything else that you are concerned about?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Defendant said the procedure seemed like a \u201crepeat of Los Angeles. . . . [I]t just seems like I am not going to get a trial here. You know, I come into this courtroom today and the first thing [defense counsel\u2019s] talking about is filing a [section] 13[68] on me and having me sent to the looney bin. I don\u2019t appreciate that, I don\u2019t like that, and I will not stand for that.\u201d After further exchange, defendant said, \u201cI want to ask you, Judge, what happens if I just flat out refuse to talk to any doctors, to take any psychological tests, period? What are you going to do? Are you going to resort to some kind of third degree gas at that point or torture tactics to force me to talk to a psychiatrist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>when I do not choose to talk to a psychiatrist? <em>I would like to defend myself in the first place. </em>Proposition 115,1 understand provision of that allows that a jury, you don\u2019t have to bring in a jury panel of four, five hundred people and question \u2019em all through the lawyers and the day questioning. I understand you can drop their names in the hat and the Judge can pick their names of 12 jurors and six alternates out of the, out of a hat. I understand that. Well, that\u2019s what I want. I don\u2019t feel like going through questioning all them people. <em>And if I was defending myself see, </em>I\u2019m the only one that knows what\u2019s going on inside my head and I am going to tell them doctors nothing. I might not even talk to the doctors, period. And what these people are doing, I don\u2019t understand what these people are doing, you know, they\u2019re going back, going to Michigan and visiting my family, you know. That\u2019s all fine and dandy, but you know, they ain\u2019t even beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s, of what\u2019s really happening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The court explained defendant\u2019s attorney had a duty to investigate and gather information to prepare for trial. After further exchange, defendant said that if he refused to see the doctors, his attorneys would claim he was refusing to cooperate. He then said he had been \u201crailroaded\u201d into a mental hospital during the earlier Los Angeles murder proceedings, and that even his current counsel felt he had been so \u201crailroaded.\u201d Defendant insisted, \u201cI understand what it means to be competent.... [I]f I was to . . . hire my own attorney, well, I would be expecting him to be working for me. I wouldn\u2019t be expecting him the first thing I do when I come into the courtroom is him telling the Judge that ... I belong in a looney bin and that I\u2019m nuts. I don\u2019t appreciate that. I don\u2019t like that. If, if a man was working for me, he would be off the case, ... he\u2019d be on his way.\u201d The trial judge assured defendant he would not grant counsel\u2019s section 1368 motion unless he thought it was appropriate, and stated that counsel seemed to be trying to get to know defendant\u2019s case as much as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Defendant then asked the court to explain \u201csomething\u201d about the charge against him. Before elaborating, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t like that either, he\u2019s telling the Court that I\u2019m killing elderly men. I had no idea them bums were old men. I had no idea whatsoever. I mean I didn\u2019t just go out and look for an old man. That kinda upset me there, too .... But anyway, . . . what exactly is the charge now . . . .\u201d Defendant stated in the absence of the prior murder convictions, there would be no special circumstances. The court said that was why defendant\u2019s attorneys were investigating his guilty plea, to see \u201cif there\u2019s some way to attack the legality.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cI understand all that. <em>I\u2019ve been working with them on that. You know, they think that I\u2019m not working with them on that, but I am working with them on that. They don\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve been working with \u2019em on that.\u201d </em>The court said, \u201cI\u2019m sure they do,\u201d and then explained prisons can place limitations on attorneys spending time with their clients. Defendant commented on the difficulty the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>prison placed on the attorneys\u2019 visits, and said he could not see \u201cthat the Department of Corrections has a right to do that. Especially when they\u2019ve been spending thousands . . . upon thousands upon thousands ... of dollars to fly out to Michigan . . . <em>and all the other things that I\u2019ve been working with \u2019em with. </em>See if\u2014I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve been explaining to this Court, <em>but I have been working with them, </em>and I have been . . . approaching them on certain things that is very important, and it\u2019s going to cost money. We\u2019re talking about subpoenas to bring down material witnesses and things like that. I guess they just don\u2019t realize <em>how much I\u2019ve been cooperating with \u2019em. </em>But\u2014.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, defense counsel then apparently indicated they wished to continue to represent defendant. The court agreed with defendant that the prison had logistical problems. Defendant then said, \u201c/ <em>will work with them. I will try to cooperate with \u2019em. </em>I just wanted to make clear for the record that if this were, if the law under that CAT test, if it were the truth, and I understand there\u2019s a case back when the San Quentin [S]ix trial was going on when one of the men there went pro. per. in that case and back then they had made a new law where a man has a right to choose, pick and choose his attorney. ... I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but according to [a book] in that trial. . . one of \u2019em was allowed to go pro. per. and one of \u2019em was allowed to pick and choose his own attorney. Now I don\u2019t know if he was forced to pay for that attorney or if it was a state appointed attorney, but according to that, he was allowed to do that. Now the way I figure it is if that, if the CAT, if that CAT law was true, then . . . these people would have an obligation to be fighting for my rights for a speedy trial. . . . I\u2019m still getting time continuances against my wishes. I want to make that clear for the record so that 20 or 30 years from now because . . . the death penalty law is nothing but a joke in the first place, so 20, 30 years from now when I get enough law books and come back and get these records I can come back and say hey, here\u2019s an attorney that ... is supposed to be, according to the law, a real attorney, just like you would go out on the streets and just hire [] any attorney and he is supposed to be fighting for your rights, but look what happened. I didn\u2019t get a trial for two or three or four years. <em>Anyway, I will work with these attorneys </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Defendant and the court then engaged in an extended colloquy regarding whether the section 4500 charge would independently support a death verdict even if the prior murder convictions were found invalid. After further colloquy on other matters, defendant said he did not want his defense attorneys \u201cmeddling in what happened in Los Angeles because I\u2019m just going to tell you right now bluntly they\u2019re incompetent to handle anything that happened in Los Angeles. . . . And I just don\u2019t feel it [is] right for them to meddle in my affairs in Los Angeles when the issue right here is Mr. Holt, and . . . I\u2019m not going to take a deal, but ... I would like to have a jury selected out of a hat and . . . that way I could sit up, wherever I\u2019m going to sit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>I don\u2019t know where you sit, and I could tell the jury personally exactly what happened. See I think, Judge, that you fail to realize just exactly what kind of terror Mr. Holt went through in that cell... I don\u2019t think anybody personally gives a shit what goes on in them prisons or them jails. . . . Nobody understands, I mean, what this victim has went through. The only thing they\u2019re concerned about is putting me in a looney bin, and I don\u2019t appreciate it one bit. I want a trial. <em>I want to defend myself and go pro. per. If I\u2019m not allowed to go pro. per., </em>I would at least like to be cocounsel to where I could sit there, maybe I could just take the stand and tell \u2019em, the jury exactly what happened on this incident.\u201d Defendant said defense counsel were not going to \u201clift a finger\u201d to help him seek a monetary remedy for what happened to him in Los Angeles. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I am objecting to everything they\u2019re trying to do about Los Angeles.\u201d Defendant then complained about correctional officer misconduct in prison. The court denied the <em>Marsden </em>motion and stated it had no doubt regarding defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">2. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">When \u201ca motion to proceed <em>pro se </em>is timely interposed, a trial court must permit a defendant to represent himself upon ascertaining that he has voluntarily and intelligently elected to do so, irrespective of how unwise such a choice might appear to be.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 128 [137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187].) Unlike the right to representation by counsel, the \u201c \u2018right of self-representation is waived unless defendants articulately and unmistakably demand to proceed <em>pro se.\u2019 \u201d (People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 20-21 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262] <em>(Marshall); id. </em>at p. 23 [\u201c[T]he court should draw every reasonable inference against waiver of the right to counsel\u201d]; see <em>Brewer v. Williams </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 387, 391, 404 [51 L.Ed.2d 424, 97 S.Ct. 1232] [\u201ccourts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of the postarraignment right to counsel].) \u201cIn determining on appeal whether the defendant invoked the right to self-representation, we examine the entire record de novo.\u201d <em>(People v. Dent </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 213, 218 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 527, 65 P.3d 1286].)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Faretta\u2019s emphasis \u201con the defendant\u2019s knowing, voluntary, unequivocal, and competent invocation of the right suggests that an insincere request or one made under the cloud of emotion may be denied.\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 21.) \u201c[A] motion made out of a temporary whim, or out of annoyance or frustration, is not unequivocal\u2014even if the defendant has said he or she seeks self-representation.\u201d <em>(Marshall, </em>at p. 21; <em>id. </em>at p. 23 [\u201cA motion for self-representation made in passing anger or frustration . . . may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>denied\u201d]; <em>Reese </em>v. <em>Nix </em>(8th Cir. 1991) 942 F.2d 1276, 1281 [the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want no counsel then,\u201d was not a clear and unequivocal invocation of his right to self-representation]; <em>Jackson v. Ylst </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 921 F.2d 882, 888-889 [the defendant\u2019s statement, \u201c T want to fight in pro per then. Relieve him and I do this myself,\u2019 \u201d was an \u201cimpulsive response to the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for substitute counsel,\u201d and \u201cdid not demonstrate unequivocally that he desired to represent himself\u2019]; <em>id. </em>at p. 888 [\u201ctrial court properly may deny a request for self-representation that is \u2018a momentary caprice or the result of thinking out loud\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Here, we conclude that defendant\u2019s references to self-representation were equivocal, bom primarily of frustration regarding the granting of counsel\u2019s requests for continuances and his desire to avoid further psychiatric examination. At the September 23, 1991, hearing, the entire proceeding focused on whether the trial court should grant a continuance, which the court did over defendant\u2019s objection. At the end of the hearing defendant said, \u201cWhat about going pro. per.?\u201d The court, which could observe defendant\u2019s demeanor, said, \u201cWell, then, we really have problems having counsel prepared.\u201d It then continued the trial and briefly discussed the timing of motion filing with counsel, and the proceeding adjourned. The court\u2019s response indicates it did not interpret defendant\u2019s remark as a serious request, and defendant made no effort to demonstrate it was such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Defendant concedes it \u201cmight be said\u201d that his question, \u201cWhat about going pro. per.?\u201d \u201cwas not an unequivocal invocation of his right to represent himself.\u201d He argues, however, \u201cthe only reason why [defendant\u2019s] request might be considered equivocal is because of the failure of \u201d the court to respond to this question, \u201cparticularly considering the fact that Judge Wallace had twice falsely told\u201d defendant at the March 26, 1991, hearing \u201cthat he was not permitted to waive counsel.\u201d Defendant asserts, \u201cA defendant\u2019s constitutional right to represent himself should not be sabotaged by misleading him and failing to take corrective action when he directly asks a question that goes to the misinformation he was given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Of course, at the March 26, 1991, hearing, defendant never mentioned self-representation. In addition, the court\u2019s remarks regarding waiver at that hearing were ambiguous and not elaborated on. Even assuming the trial court was saying defendant could not represent himself in this case, given defendant\u2019s reference to going in propria persona at two subsequent hearings, one of which was before the same trial judge who had presided at the March 26, 1991, hearing, defendant apparently did not understand the court\u2019s March 26, 1991, remarks as precluding such a possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Nor, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, were defendant\u2019s references to in propria persona status at the February 11, 1992, hearing \u201cclear and unequivocal.\u201d The focus of the 40-45 minute hearing was on whether counsel should be replaced because of defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with their efforts to continue the trial and to have him declared incompetent. Defendant made his dissatisfaction with counsel clear, but also repeatedly stated he had and would continue to cooperate with counsel. His fleeting statements about defending himself, embedded in diatribes regarding his opposition to further psychiatric examination and prison conditions, were insufficient to constitute an articulate and unmistakable invocation of the right to self-representation. (See <em>Marshall, supra, </em>15 Cal.4th at p. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">1. <em>Alleged Juror Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Defendant alleges prejudicial juror misconduct in violation of numerous rights under the federal and state Constitutions. (U.S. Const., 1st, 6th, 8th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 15, 16 &amp; 17.) Specifically, he contends the misconduct tended to diminish the jurors\u2019 sense of responsibility for their penalty decision; substituted a source of law, other than California law as instructed on by the trial judge, for their decision; and violated his right to a reliable penalty determination, the right to a trial by an impartial jury, his confrontation right, and his right to be free of an establishment of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">a. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">On February 9, 1993, at 3:20 p.m., the jury returned its penalty verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On March 15, 1993, defendant filed a motion for new trial alleging juror misconduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Defendant contended that during the penalty phase deliberations, two jurors, K.A. and B.P., had consulted outside persons for spiritual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>guidance, and that certain biblical passages were brought into the jury room. He attached the March 10, 1993, declaration of Juror K.A., which as relevant provided:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><em>\u201cAt some point during the trial I felt stress from being in court all day and attempting to go home at night and do all the home responsibilities in four hours that I normally did in eight hours. </em>My husband noticed that I was on edge and he told me at that time that it would be permissible to speak with our pastor, and that this was permissible because a pastor is of a higher authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u201cPenalty phase deliberations began on a Friday and the court recessed on Friday afternoon. <em>I was leaning toward the death penalty but I felt discomfort about imposing the death penalty. If I was going to vote for the death penalty I wanted to feel good about it. I needed to talk to someone out of a need for comfort. </em>Judge Oberholzer had told us we could not speak with persons about the case. <em>But because of the feelings I had, I felt the necessity of talking to my husband. </em>My husband advised that reading scripture from the Bible might be of benefit to me. He showed me the Book of Numbers, [c]hapter 35, [v]erses 16 through 25 and 30 through 31, which is at pages 306 and 307 from my \u2018The NIV Study Bible.\u2019[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201cOn Sunday evening, when we were at the [cjhurch [facility for Bible study, we met the pastor. That is where my husband made a copy of pages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>306 and 307 from our Bible containing the Book of Numbers verses. In a brief meeting with the pastor, who knew that I was a juror on the Danks case, my husband said to me that this might be a good time for me to discuss my feelings ab[o]ut the trial verdict. I told the pastor that I had read the scripture and it gave me comfort. The pastor said those were good scriptures and then jokingly said that he would impose the death penalty on Mr. Danks.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u201cOn Monday, I returned to court for deliberations. I took the copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers with me. I had highlighted certain portions of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u201cDuring deliberations, other jurors expressed feelings about the difficulty and responsibility of making a life or death decision. I told the other jurors about my copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers. I then shared it with the other jurors by passing it around to the other jurors. I recall one juror being offended that I had the scripture, because later in the day that juror said words to the effect that [G]od does not play a part in this decision, which I assumed was referring to our Christian beliefs being discussed during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u201cI no longer have that copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u201cJuror [B.P.] told me that she had talked to her pastor and he had referred her to the same chapter and verses in the Book of Numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">\u201cOn March 9, 1993, I was contacted by [defense investigator] Mrs. Pat McGregor and I told her how I had consulted the Bible. The next day, I met with Mrs. McGregor and [defense counsel] Mr. Eyherabide on the same subject. I took my Bible with me and Mr. Eyherabide copied pages . . . 306 and 307 and asked me to highlight those portions which I had highlighted on the copy passed in the jury room. I did highlight those portions in red and pink ink and Mr. Eyherabide indicated he would attach that copy to this statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">Defendant also attached the declaration of Mr. Eyherabide, which discussed defense efforts to obtain a declaration from Juror B.P., and attached unhighlighted copies of the Book of Numbers pages for purposes of legibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">The People opposed the motion for new trial. Defendant then filed two supplemental declarations. The first, a March 15, 1993, declaration by Juror E.M., stated in relevant part, \u201cDuring the penalty phase deliberations in the [Danks] case, [J]uror [B.P.] told me that she had talked to her pastor for guidance on the case.\u201d The second was a March 16, 1993, declaration by Juror B.P. As relevant it provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cDuring the penalty phase deliberations I spoke to my pastor. <em>By that time, I had already made my decision. However </em>I wanted to know what the Bible said about the death penalty. My pastor stated \u201c[B.], I think I know what case you are on. There is no place in the Bible that takes the law out of the Bible. If you are sitting on the case I\u2019m thinking you are sitting on, if I was in your shoes, I would not hesitate to give him the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>\u201cMy reasons for voting for the death penalty were these: based on the evidence of Mr. Danks\u2019 past life and what his future life in prison [would be], he didn\u2019t have much to live for; Mr. Danks wanted the death penalty; and because other persons could not be safe around Mr. Danks.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Mr. Eyherabide also filed a second declaration describing the circumstances under which the defense obtained Juror B.P.\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The People then filed a supplemental points and authorities in opposition to the motion for new trial. Attached to the opposition were second declarations by Jurors K.A. and B.P., both executed on March 30, 1993. Juror K.A.\u2019s second declaration, as relevant, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201cAfter the first day of penalty phase deliberations, which was a Friday, <em>I felt a great deal of stress and was upset, both due to the stress of making a decision in the case, and due to the difficulty of completing my normal home responsibilities in the evening after a full day in court. </em>My husband noticed that I was upset, and showed me a passage in the Bible <em>which gave me comfort. </em>I did not discuss the case or our deliberations with him, but simply the stress I felt in making the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">\u201cOn Sunday evening, I picked my husband up at church for Bible Study, and encountered our pastor. My husband at that time stated to me that at this time I might be able to talk with our pastor about the Bible verses that I had read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\u201cI said that I did not need to discuss anything. My pastor said he understood that I had read several scripture vers[e]s. I told him that I had read the scriptures and they gave me comfort. The pastor then stated in a joking manner that if he were a juror he would impose the death penalty on Mr. Danks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-11\">\u201cOn Monday, I returned to court for deliberations. I took the copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers with me. During the deliberations, other jurors expressed the feeling that it was difficult having the responsibility for making a life and death decision. I told the jurors about my copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers, and how that passage had given me comfort. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>then passed it around to the other jurors. At no time did I or anyone else argue or state that Mr. Danks should be put to death because of what that passage of the Bible said. I do recall one juror later stating that God does not play a part in our deliberations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Juror B.P.\u2019s second declaration, as relevant, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cOn the first day of penalty phase deliberations, which was a Friday, three votes were taken on the penalty. I voted the same way on all three occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\"><em>\u201cAt the end of the day, I had made up my mind as to what I personally thought was the appropriate penalty. However, I felt a great deal of emotional turmoil due to the seriousness of making a life or death decision. </em>After the first day of deliberations, I spoke with my pastor about the difficulty of making the decision. I told him, \u2018Pastor, Pm doing jury duty on a murder case. Is there anything in the Bible which speaks against the death penalty?\u2019 I also told him that I had made up my mind about the verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">\u201cIn response, my pastor told me, \u2018[B.], I think I know what case you are on. There is no place in the Bible that takes the law out of the Bible. If you are sitting on the case I\u2019m thinking you are sitting on, if I was in your shoes, I would not hesitate to give him the death penalty.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">\u201cOn Monday and Tuesday, when deliberations resumed, several additional votes were taken. On all occasions I voted for the same verdict as I had previously. At no time during the deliberations did I relate to the other jurors what my pastor had said to me, nor did I argue or state that the death penalty should be imposed because of anything said in the Bible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">The trial court denied the motion for new trial. Defendant never sought a <em>Hedgecock </em>hearing. <em>(People v. Hedgecock </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 395, 415 [272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260] <em>(Hedgecock).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">b. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">1) <em>What portions of the declarations are admissible?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">In order to determine whether there was juror misconduct and if so, prejudice, we first consider what portions of the declarations are admissible. Evidence Code section 1150, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cUpon an inquiry as to the validity of a verdict, any otherwise admissible evidence may be received as to statements made, or conduct, conditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, of such a character as is likely to have influenced the verdict improperly. No evidence is admissible to show the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>effect of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon a juror either in influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or concerning the mental processes by which it was determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u201cThis statute distinguishes \u2018between proof of overt acts, objectively ascertainable, and proof of the subjective reasoning processes of the individual juror, which can be neither corroborated nor disproved . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Steele </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1230, 1261 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 47 P.3d 225].) \u201c \u2018This limitation prevents one juror from upsetting a verdict of the whole jury by impugning his own or his fellow jurors\u2019 mental processes or reasons for assent or dissent. The only improper influences that may be proved under [Evidence Code] section 1150 to impeach a verdict, therefore, are those open to sight, hearing, and the other senses and thus subject to corroboration.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Steele, </em>at p. 1261.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Here, certain portions of the declarations, which have been italicized, relate solely to the mental processes and subjective reasoning of the declarant juror regarding the penalty deliberations, and hence cannot be considered. Other portions, which have also been italicized, involve mental processes or subjective reasoning that while not directly related to the penalty deliberations, are irrelevant to any issue we are considering. Thus, we may not consider why Juror K.A. was experiencing stress, or what verdict she was leaning toward. Nor may we consider the reasons Juror B.P. voted for the death penalty. (See <em>Hedgecock, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 419 [\u201cwhen a juror in the course of deliberations gives the reasons for his or her vote, the words are simply a verbal reflection of the juror\u2019s mental processes. Consideration of such a statement as evidence of those processes is barred by Evidence Code section 1150\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">2) <em>Applicable law for determining any misconduct and prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We first determine whether there was any misconduct.\u201cMisconduct by a juror, or a nonjuror\u2019s tampering contact or communication with a sitting juror, usually raises a rebuttable \u2018presumption\u2019 of prejudice. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Hamilton </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 273, 295 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 403, 975 P.2d 600].) However, \u201c[t]he introduction of much of what might strictly be labeled \u2018extraneous law\u2019 cannot be deemed misconduct.. The jury system is an institution that is legally fundamental but also fundamentally human. Jurors bring to their deliberations knowledge and beliefs about general matters of law and fact that find their source in everyday life and experience. That they do so is one of the strengths of the jury system. It is also one of its weaknesses; it has the potential to undermine determinations that should be made exclusively on the evidence introduced by the parties and the instructions given by the court. Such a weakness, however, must be tolerated. \u2018[I]t is an impossible standard to require . . . [the jury] to be a laboratory, completely sterilized and freed from any external factors.\u2019 <em>(Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 723, 733 [10 L.Ed.2d 663, 83 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>S.Ct. 1417] (dis. opn. of Clark, J.).) Moreover, under that \u2018standard\u2019 few verdicts would be proof against challenge.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 950 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676].) \u201cThe safeguards of juror impartiality ... are not infallible; it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence that might theoretically affect their vote.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 209, 217 [71 L.Ed.2d 78, 102 S.Ct. 940].)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">If we conclude there was misconduct, we then consider whether the misconduct was prejudicial. This standard is well established. \u201c[W]hen misconduct involves the receipt of information from extraneous sources, the effect of such receipt is judged by a review of the entire record, and may be found to be nonprejudicial. The verdict will be set aside only if there appears a substantial likelihood of juror bias. Such bias can appear in two different ways.\u201d <em>(In re Carpenter </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 634, 653 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 889 P.2d 985] <em>(Carpenter).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u201cFirst, we will find bias if the extraneous material, judged objectively, is inherently and substantially likely to have influenced the juror.\u201d <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 653.) \u201cUnder this standard, a finding of \u2018inherently\u2019 likely bias is required when, but only when, the extraneous information was so prejudicial in context that its erroneous introduction in the trial itself would have warranted reversal of the judgment. Application of this \u2018inherent prejudice\u2019 test obviously depends upon a review of the trial record to determine the prejudicial effect of the extraneous information.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Second, \u201ceven if the extraneous information was not so prejudicial, in and of itself, as to cause \u2018inherent\u2019 bias under the first test,\u201d the nature of the misconduct and the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the misconduct must still be examined to determine objectively whether a substantial likelihood of actual bias nonetheless arose.\u201d <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 653-654.) \u201cUnder this second, or \u2018circumstantial,\u2019 test, the trial record is not a dispositive consideration, but neither is it irrelevant. All pertinent portions of the entire record, including the trial record, must be considered. \u2018The presumption of prejudice may be rebutted, inter alia, by a reviewing court\u2019s determination, <em>upon examining the entire record, </em>that there is no substantial likelihood that the complaining party suffered actual\u2019 \u201d bias. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u201cThe judgment must be set aside if the court finds prejudice under either test.\u201d <em>{Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 653.) \u201cWhether prejudice arose from juror misconduct ... is a mixed question of law and fact subject to an appellate court\u2019s independent determination.\u201d <em>(People v. Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 582 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87] <em>(Nesler) </em>(lead opn. of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>George, C. J.).) However, \u201c[w]e accept the trial court\u2019s credibility determinations and findings on questions of historical fact if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cWe emphasize that before a unanimous verdict is set aside, the likelihood of bias under either test must be <em>substantial </em>.... [T]he criminal justice system must not be rendered impotent in quest of an ever-elusive perfection. The jury system is fundamentally human, which is both a strength and a weakness. <em>(People v. Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 950.) Jurors are not automatons. They are imbued with human frailties as well as virtues. If the system is to function at all, we must tolerate a certain amount of imperfection short of actual bias. To demand theoretical perfection from every juror during the course of a trial is unrealistic.\u201d <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 654-655.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">3) <em>Application of the law to these facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Disregarding the italicized portions of the juror declarations, we now consider whether any misconduct occurred, and if so, whether that misconduct was prejudicial. We conclude that the unsolicited comments from Juror K.A.\u2019s pastor, Juror B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor, and the introduction of the Bible passages to the jury room were misconduct, but that this misconduct was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">We begin with Juror K.A.\u2019s conversations with her husband and her reading the Bible. Juror K.A.\u2019s husband noticed she was on edge and told her it would be permissible for her to speak to her pastor because a pastor is a person of higher authority. Juror K.A. did not discuss the case or the deliberations with her husband, but only the stress she felt in making the decision. Her husband advised that reading scripture from the Bible might be of benefit to her, and showed her the Book of Numbers, chapter 35, verses 16 through 25 and 30 through 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">It is misconduct for a juror during the course of trial to discuss the case with a nonjuror. <em>(People v. Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 207 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 R2d 91].) Here, however, Juror K.A. did not discuss the case or deliberations with her husband, but only the stress she was feeling in making the decision. That is not misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">As for Juror K.A.\u2019s reading the Bible during deliberations, defendant concedes a juror may read Bible passages in the privacy of her home without committing misconduct. He notes, \u201cAn inquiry into whether a juror privately studied his/her Bible at home during the time when their jury was deliberating would involve a degree of intrusion that our society would deem beyond the permissible . . . .\u201d Even if Juror K.A.\u2019s reading of the Bible passages given to her by her husband was misconduct, we conclude it was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201c[A] finding of \u2018inherently\u2019 likely bias is required when, but only when, the extraneous information was so prejudicial in context that its erroneous introduction in the trial itself would have warranted reversal of the judgment.\u201d <em>(Carpenter, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 653.) Moreover, we do not reverse unanimous verdicts because there is <em>some </em>possibility the juror was improperly influenced. Rather, the likelihood of bias under the inherent prejudice test \u201cmust be <em>substantial.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 654.) \u201cApplication of this \u2018inherent prejudice\u2019 test obviously depends upon a review of the trial record to determine the prejudicial effect of the extraneous information.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Objectively considering the Book of Numbers passage in light of the compelling penalty phase evidence in this case, we conclude the passage was not inherently and substantially likely to influence, i.e., bias Juror K.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Defendant was convicted of the premeditated murder of his sleeping cellmate. In his statement to police, defendant implied that he had killed Mr. Holt in order to receive the death penalty. Defendant had suffered six prior first degree murder convictions. All of the victims were strangers to defendant, and he indicated to police the stabbings were unimportant because the victims were \u201cbums.\u201d While defendant was incarcerated, he committed two other stabbings, and expressed frustration he had failed to kill one of these victims. He also fashioned and concealed several sharp weapons. During his penalty phase testimony, defendant expressed no remorse for his crimes, stating, \u201cI would not change a thing that I did in my life.\u201d He also strongly implied he would continue to be violent in a controlled setting, and apparently threatened the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">While defendant introduced evidence he was schizophrenic, that evidence was not only disputed, but according to defendant\u2019s own medical experts, a significant aspect of this mental illness was that defendant derived great sadistic pleasure in attacking other people. Dr. Bittle testified that defendant \u201cis a sadist.... [W]hen I asked [defendant] to describe his feelings about the murders in Los Angeles, [he] became sexually excited. That is one of the motivations for Mr. Danks\u2019 behavior.\u201d Dr. Hill testified that defendant had \u201ca delusional self-concept that ... he is righteously performing murders or harming people[,] something that he also enjoys greatly.\u201d Moreover, even if defendant cooperated with his medication regimen, which he had on occasion refused to do in the past, he remained, as Dr. Hill testified, \u201can extraordinarily dangerous individual regardless of whatever level of psychiatric improvement he may have.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Bittle testified that even in a treated and improved condition, defendant \u201cis an extremely dangerous individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">In addition, there was no guarantee that defendant would not ultimately be returned to the general prison population if the jury imposed a sentence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Such a possibility posed a continuing threat to the safety of prison personnel and other inmates. Indeed, even if defendant spent the rest of his life in solitary confinement, he was still a threat to prison personnel who for any reason needed to come into contact with him, for example, medical personnel who might be required to involuntarily medicate him. Weighing this penalty phase evidence against the exposure of Juror K.A. to the Book of Numbers passage, it does not appear \u201cthe extraneous material, judged objectively, [was] inherently and substantially likely to have influenced\u201d or biased Juror K.A. <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 653.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Having concluded the Book of Numbers passage was not inherently prejudicial, we now consider \u201cthe nature of the misconduct and the surrounding circumstances\u201d to determine whether it is substantially likely Juror K.A. was nevertheless actually biased as a result of reading this passage. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 579.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As noted above, defendant concedes a juror may read the Bible in the privacy of her home without committing misconduct. Thus, he implicitly also concedes he suffered no actual bias as a result of Juror K.A.\u2019s reading the relevant passage. Moreover, while Juror K.A. later shared this Bible passage with her fellow jurors, \u201c[a]t no time did [she] or anyone else argue or state that Mr. Danks should be put to death because of what that passage of the Bible said.\u201d Finally, consideration of the significant penalty phase evidence further diminishes the possibility defendant suffered actual bias as a result \u00f3f Juror K.A.\u2019s reading the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">We next consider Juror K.A.\u2019s conversation with her pastor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At church on Sunday evening, she encountered her pastor. Her pastor knew she was a juror in defendant\u2019s case. Juror K.A.\u2019s husband said this might be a good time to talk to the pastor either about the Bible verses she had read or her feelings about the verdict. She said she did not need to discuss anything. The pastor said that he understood she had read several scripture verses. Juror K.A. said that she had read the scriptures and they gave her comfort. The pastor said those were good scriptures and jokingly said that if he were a juror, he would impose the death penalty on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>It is misconduct for a juror during the course of trial to discuss a case with a nonjuror. Here, Juror K.A. told her pastor she did not need to discuss anything with him, and mentioned that the scripture passages had given her comfort. While these statements may or may not be misconduct, more critically, her pastor responded thatthose were good scriptures and jokingly said that if he were a juror, he would impose the death penalty on defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We have previously held that \u201ca juror\u2019s inadvertent receipt of information that [has] not been presented in court falls within the general category of \u2018juror misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 579.) \u201cAlthough inadvertent exposure to out-of-court information is not blameworthy conduct, as might be suggested by the term \u2018misconduct,\u2019 it nevertheless gives rise to a presumption of prejudice, because it poses the risk that one or more jurors may be influenced by material that the defendant has had no opportunity to confront, cross-examine, or rebut.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Assuming Juror K.A.\u2019s conversation with her pastor, and in particular her pastor\u2019s response, was misconduct, we conclude it was not prejudicial. In light of the extraordinary penalty phase evidence, the conversation as a whole, and the pastor\u2019s gratuitous personal view of the appropriate penalty in particular, judged objectively, were not inherently and substantially likely to have influenced, i.e., biased, Juror K.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Nor is it substantially likely Juror K.A. was actually biased against defendant as a result of this conversation. We consider the nature of the misconduct, the surrounding circumstances, and the penalty phase record. <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at pp. 653-654.) Juror K.A. told her pastor she had nothing to talk to him about, and he nevertheless insisted on imparting his personal, unsolicited view regarding the appropriate penalty verdict. The conversation then apparently ended, at least on this subject. Thus, unlike <em>Nesler, </em>where the juror upon inadvertently hearing a diatribe about the defendant did not leave the area, but continued to listen for a half-hour, here the pastor stopped talking immediately and Juror K.A. did nothing to continue the conversation. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 572.) Moreover, again unlike <em>Nesler, </em>there is no evidence Juror K.A. repeated the pastor\u2019s comment in the jury room. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 573-574, 579.) Thus, the juror\u2019s conduct and the surrounding circumstances fail to demonstrate actual bias. Moreover, the significant penalty record in this case further diminishes the possibility Juror K.A. became actually biased against defendant because of her pastor\u2019s comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Defendant argues that Juror K.A. and her husband \u201cunderstood that her talking with her minister was in violation of the trial court\u2019s order not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>discuss the case, and that they justified what [Juror K.A.] was about to do by subordinating the law given by the trial court to what they perceived to be divine law.\u201d Of course, it was Juror K.A.\u2019s <em>husband </em>who said it \u201cwould be permissible to speak with [their] pastor, and that this was permissible because a pastor is of a higher authority.\u201d As noted above, Juror K.A. told her pastor she did not need to discuss anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We next consider Juror K.A.\u2019s conduct in bringing a copy of the Book of Numbers passage into the jury room, and passing it around to the other jurors. This was misconduct. <em>(People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 465-467 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388].) However, just as in Juror K.A.\u2019s private reading of the Book of Numbers, nothing in these verses, viewed objectively and in the context of the compelling penalty phase evidence, was inherently and substantially likely to influence, i.e., bias the jurors. Indeed here, one juror specifically commented that God played no role in the penalty decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Nor do we conclude Juror K.A.\u2019s misconduct in sharing the Bible passages with her fellow jurors demonstrated either the substantial likelihood of her actual bias, or that it is substantially likely it resulted in the actual bias of other jurors. We emphasize that unlike the juror in <em>Nesler, </em>Juror K.A. did not repeatedly refer to this extrajudicial information \u201cdespite admonitions from other jurors not to do so.\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 588; <em>id. </em>at p. 589 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87].) Juror K.A. \u201cmerely shared [her] personal view and did not purport to validate it as truth or impose [her] view on others.\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 391 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 272, 28 P.3d 34] <em>(Lewis).) </em>Indeed, there is no evidence that after the copy circulated the passages were even discussed, other than perhaps one juror\u2019s comment that God did not have a role in the jury\u2019s decision. While \u201cChristian beliefs\u201d were at some point discussed, we have no information as to what that conversation entailed. Moreover, we have previously observed that it is to be expected and is not misconduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cjurors . . . consider their religious beliefs during penalty deliberations.\u201d <em>(Lewis, </em>at p. 389.) Consideration of the significant penalty phase evidence further diminishes the possibility defendant suffered actual bias resulting from juror exposure to these passages.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We next consider Juror B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor during the penalty deliberations. Juror B.P. told her pastor she was a juror on a murder case, and asked, \u201cIs there anything in the Bible which speaks against the death penalty?\u201d She also told him she had made up her mind about the verdict. Her pastor stated, \u201c[B.], I think I know what case you are on. There is no place in the Bible that takes the law out of the Bible. If you are sitting on the case I\u2019m thinking you are sitting on, if I was in your shoes, I would not hesitate to give him the death penalty.\u201d When Juror B.P. returned to deliberations, on all occasions she voted for the same verdict as she had three times on Friday. At no time during the deliberations did she relate to the other jurors what her pastor had said, or argue or state that the death penalty should be imposed because of anything said in the Bible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As noted above, it is misconduct for a juror to discuss a case with a nonjuror. Here, Juror B.P. asked her pastor about the Bible\u2019s stand on the very issue she was deliberating. Thus, her misconduct was more egregious than that of Juror K.A. We nevertheless conclude this misconduct was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Viewed objectively in light of the compelling penalty phase evidence in this case, Juror B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor, and in particular, unsolicited information that Juror B.P.\u2019s pastor would vote for the death penalty in a case he thought Juror B.P. was sitting on, was not inherently and substantially likely to influence her.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Nor does the record demonstrate a substantial likelihood Juror B.P. was actually biased against defendant as a result of this conversation. Juror B.P. had already voted three times for the death penalty on Friday, and made up her mind, presumably after an impartial consideration of the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>application of the law before her, as to the appropriate penalty in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Her general inquiry to her pastor was to determine not whether her vote was correct, but whether it violated a religious proscription. Moreover, her pastor\u2019s personal view of the appropriate penalty in the case he thought Juror B.P. was sitting on was unsolicited. As in the case of Juror K.A., and unlike the situation in <em>Nesler, </em>Juror B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor apparently ended at this point, at least on this subject. Also, like Juror K.A., and again unlike the situation in <em>Nesler, </em>Juror B.P. did not discuss the content of her conversation in the jury room. Thus, the juror\u2019s conduct and the surrounding circumstances fail to demonstrate a substantial likelihood of actual bias. Finally, the penalty record in this case further diminishes the possibility defendant suffered actual bias as a result of Juror B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Thus, with respect to each individual matter, and viewing these matters collectively, we conclude the presumption of prejudice arising from the misconduct was rebutted, and there was no prejudicial misconduct. Having found no prejudicial juror misconduct, we conclude defendant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to an impartial jury and reliable penalty verdict were not violated. Nor under the circumstances of this case do we conclude that defendant\u2019s right to confrontation, or to the extent it is even implicated, his right to be free of an establishment of religion, were violated. We further reject defendant\u2019s other arguments on this issue, and in particular his argument that the jurors\u2019 sense of responsibility for their penalty decision was diminished, and that they substituted a source of law, other than California law as instructed by the trial judge, for the determination of the penalty. After exhaustive appellate review, we have concluded there is no substantial likelihood either that the Bible passages or the conversations with the pastors were inherently prejudicial or that they resulted in any juror\u2019s actual bias. In particular, no objective evidence in the record demonstrates a substantial likelihood any juror felt he or she had less of a weighty responsibility of making a penalty determination after these events occurred. While this case involves religious beliefs, an intensely private area, we are unwilling to ascribe to any perceived stereotype that jurors who receive advice from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Christian spiritual leaders, or are exposed to Biblical passages, per se suffer a diminished sense of responsibility for their penalty verdict, and are automatically rendered incapable of fairly evaluating the evidence and law before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Moreover, although we have found misconduct, albeit nonprejudicial, in certain instances above, we reiterate that nothing in our opinion is intended to convey that a juror\u2019s consideration of personal religious, philosophical, or secular normative values is improper during penalty deliberations. (See <em>Lewis, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 389-390.) As we have repeatedly stated, the task of jurors at the penalty phase is qualitatively different from that at the guilt phase. At the penalty phase, jurors are asked to make a normative determination\u2014one which necessarily includes moral and ethical considerations\u2014designed to reflect community values. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Prieto </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 263, 275 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 66 P.3d 1123]; <em>People v. Hawthorne </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 43, 79 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 133, 841 P.2d 118].) \u201c \u2018The court in no way means to suggest that jurors cannot rely on their personal faith and deeply-held beliefs when facing the awesome decision of whether to impose the sentence of death on a fellow citizen.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lewis, </em>at pp. 389-390; <em>cf. People v. Sandoval </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 155, 194 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 342, 841 P.2d 862] [\u201cWe do not mean to rule out all reference to religion or religious figures so long as the reference does not purport to be a religious law or commandment\u201d].) As one author has noted, \u201cthe discretion given to a jury to extend or withhold mercy . . . will never produce \u2018a wholly rational, calculated, and logical process\u2019 .... [Determinations of the appropriate punishment involve factors which are not only \u2018too intangible to write into a statute\u2019 but are also too abstract for a jury to rely on independent of their personal values.\u201d (Note, <em>Thou Shalt Not Quote the Bible: Determining the Propriety of Attorney Use of Religious Philosophy and Themes in Oral Arguments </em>(1998-1999) 33 Ga. L.Rev. 1113, 1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In concluding Jurors K.A. and B.R were actually biased, Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion is unable to marshal objective evidence demonstrating a substantial likelihood of such bias, but instead relies on misstatements of the record and speculation to reach its conclusion. In particular, there is no evidence Jurors K.A. and B.R \u201ctook the extraordinary step of discussing their possible death verdict with their pastors.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 323.) Rather, Juror K.A. states she told her pastor she \u201cdid not need to discuss anything.\u201d Juror B.R told her pastor she \u201chad made up [her] mind about the verdict,\u201d and simply wanted to know if there was \u201canything in the Bible which speaks against the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Nor does Juror K.A.\u2019s declaration include any evidence, even inadmissible evidence, she \u201cdiscussed the case first with her husband.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 327; <em>id. </em>at p. 328 [Juror K.A. \u201c \u2018felt the necessity\u2019 of talking to her husband about the case\u201d].) Rather, Juror K.A. states, \u201cI did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>discuss the case or our deliberations with [my husband], but simply the stress I felt in mating the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that \u201cB.P. candidly acknowledged that she spoke with her pastor about \u2018the difficulty of mating the decision.\u2019 Her pastor then told her that he \u2018would not hesitate\u2019 to give defendant the death penalty. The damage was done. Juror E.M. stated that, after this meeting, and \u2018[d]uring the penalty phase deliberations in the [Danks] case, [B.P.] told me that she had talked to her pastor for guidance on the case.\u2019 Simply stated, if B.P. had been certain of her verdict, she would not have asked her pastor for guidance in mating this difficult decision.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., post, at p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Juror E.M.\u2019s single-sentence statement fails to place the reported conversation into any meaningful context. Nevertheless, we know from Juror B.P.\u2019s declaration what she meant by \u201cguidance.\u201d When that declaration is read as a whole, it is apparent that while Juror B.P. acknowledged the difficulty of mating the penalty decision, she told her pastor she had already done so. What she sought \u201cguidance\u201d regarding was whether anything in the Bible spoke against the death penalty. Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion conveniently omits this portion of Juror B.P.\u2019s declaration, and conflates the sentences to make it improperly appear that the pastor\u2019s comment was not unsolicited, which it was, but was in response to an inquiry by Juror B.P. about which penalty decision she should make. Moreover, contrary to the manner in which the conversation is portrayed by both concurring and dissenting opinions, the pastor further stated he was not certain what case B.P. was serving as a juror on. (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 319; cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion notes, in concluding Juror B.P. was actually biased, that while Juror B.P. did not discuss the content of her conversation with her pastor with fellow jurors, she did, as noted above, reportedly tell Juror E.M. that \u201cshe had asked her pastor for guidance.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 329, fn. 5.) From this, Justice Moreno concludes, \u201cThus, even if B.P. did not relate to other jurors the specifics of that conversation, she apparently did not hesitate to make the jury aware that such a conversation took place.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Justice Moreno later states, \u201cB.P. also informed other jurors during deliberations that her pastor offered her guidance on this difficult decision.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 332.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Contrary to Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion\u2019s assertion, there is no evidence \u201cB.P. . . . informed other jurors during deliberations that her pastor offered her guidance on [the penalty] decision.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 332.) Rather, as noted above, we know from Juror B.P.\u2019s declaration what \u201cguidance\u201d she is referring to, i.e., whether the death penalty violated a religious proscription. That inquiry does not demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>actual bias. Nor could her mention of the fact of this conversation in the jury room, without more, demonstrate her actual bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion relies on the fact that Christian beliefs \u201cwere discussed during . . . deliberations.\u201d (Cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Moreno, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 333; <em>id. </em>at p. 335.) We are not given any information as to what this discussion entailed, and there appears to be no basis to conclude the discussion was improper. <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 657 [\u201cWe will not presume greater misconduct than the evidence shows\u201d].) Indeed, Juror K.A. specifically stated that \u201c[a]t no time did I or anyone else argue or state that Mr. Danks should be put to death because of what that passage of the Bible said,\u201d and Juror B.P. stated, \u201cAt no time during the deliberations . . . did I argue or state that the death penalty should be imposed because of anything said in the Bible.\u201d Most important, as set forth at length above, and contrary to the strong implication of Justice Moreno\u2019s concurring and dissenting opinion, there is nothing improper with a penalty jury\u2019s discussing normative beliefs in reaching a penalty decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">2. <em>Alleged </em>Miranda <em>Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Defendant contends his judgment of death must be reversed because the trial court erroneously admitted his 1987 statement to police concerning the earlier murders. He contends the police violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights in obtaining this statement by ignoring his invocation of the right to counsel. Defendant does not attack the validity of his six prior murder convictions. Rather, he contends that without this statement, \u201cnone of the evidence concerning the stabbing of derelicts in Los Angeles would have been admissible, since none of it would have connected [defendant] with the stabbings.\u201d However, defendant apparently concedes some such evidence would have been admissible, since he also contends that absent his statement, the jury in this case would have only received a minute order \u201cstat[ing] the bare fact of the\u201d six prior murder convictions, \u201cwith no description of the underlying facts and not even anything to connect the conviction[s] with the stabbings of derelicts described by witnesses. The jury may not even have realized that the evidence of the stabbings referred to by witnesses pertained to the same murders as the 1990 conviction.\u201d Defendant also contends that absent his statement, the jury would not have heard his \u201ccallous\u201d remark, \u201cIt ain\u2019t nothing, man, three or four bums. I don\u2019t see what the big fucking deal is, what the big fucking deal is, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Assuming defendant can at this point attack his 1987 statement in an unrelated crime that is being used in this case solely for penalty phase evidence purposes, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 1005, 1037 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 225, 929 P.2d 544] <em>(Bradford).) </em>Significantly, defendant does not challenge the validity of his six prior murder convictions, and at the penalty phase the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>was entitled to delineate the circumstances underlying those convictions. <em>(People v. Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 818 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481] [this court has repeatedly rejected the contention that only the fact of the prior conviction is admissible, not the details of the offense]; <em>People v. Karis </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 612, 640 [250 Cal.Rptr. 659, 758 P.2d 1189].) Moreover, during his penalty phase testimony, defendant stated, \u201cI did stab them- bums in their back, in the back of their neck, in their side while they were laying down, while they were asleep . . . .\u201d In addition, the witnesses describing the stabbings, and documentary evidence such as death certificates, indicated all but one of the victims were dead, and defendant\u2019s own witnesses noted defendant called himself a \u201cbum buster\u201d and repeatedly maintained the people he had stabbed and allegedly killed were not dead. Thus, even without defendant\u2019s 1987 statement, the jury could not have failed to link defendant\u2019s prior murder convictions to the stabbings described by witnesses. Furthermore, while defendant was callous in his remark that stabbing \u201cbums\u201d was not serious, defendant\u2019s planning and execution of Mr. Holt\u2019s murder also evidenced extreme callousness, as did his expression of apparent irritation in failing to kill fellow patient Mr. McCully during that attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">3. <em>Alleged Error Regarding Number of Special Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Defendant contends the trial court erroneously submitted six, rather than one, prior murder conviction special-circumstance allegations to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The indictment filed against defendant included two counts. Count 1 alleged assault by a person serving a life sentence with force likely to produce great bodily injury which resulted in death (\u00a7 4500), and count 2 alleged premeditated murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)). Count 2, but not count 1, also included six allegations of prior first degree murder convictions. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2); hereafter section 190.2(a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Section 190.2(a)(2), added by initiative in 1978, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe penalty for a defendant who is found guilty of murder in the first degree is death or imprisonment in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole if one or more of the following special circumstances has been found under Section 190.4 to be true: [][] ...[][].. . The defendant was convicted previously of murder in the first or second degree.\u201d Thus, to find the allegation true, a jury simply must find a defendant has suffered a prior first or second degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">When a defendant has <em>more </em>than one prior first or second degree murder conviction, the most reasonable reading of the language of section 190.2(a)(2) is that a defendant is subject to a prior murder special circumstance for each of these convictions. Section 190.2(a)(2) does not say that only <em>one </em>such prior conviction may be used, or that all such convictions must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>be combined into a single special circumstance. The electorate could reasonably conclude a defendant who previously murdered six people, and suffered six prior murder convictions as a result, is more culpable than a defendant who previously murdered only one person, and sustained only one prior murder conviction. It seems unlikely that section 190.2(a)(2) was intended to impose only one special circumstance for both individuals despite their disparate records.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In contrast to section 190.2(a)(2), section 190.2, subdivision (a)(3) provides as a special circumstance that \u201c[t]he defendant, in this proceeding, has been convicted of more than one offense of murder in the first or second degree.\u201d Section 190.2, subdivision (a)(3) does not permit a separate multiple-murder special circumstance to be attached to each murder conviction sustained in the capital case because such duplicative use of multiple-murder special circumstances \u201cartificially inflates the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d (Pe<em>ople v. Jones </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 1115, 1148 [282 Cal.Rptr. 465, 811 P.2d 757].) However, no such duplication or artificial inflation arises when a special circumstance is charged for each earlier murder of which the defendant was previously convicted. Moreover here, the special circumstance allegations attached only to count 2, not to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Indeed, while we do not appear to have previously decided the question, our cases have assumed a defendant is subject to a prior murder special circumstance for each prior first or second degree murder conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 313, 325 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 914 P.2d 846] [noting jury found true two special circumstance allegations under \u00a7 190.2(a)(2) for the defendant\u2019s two prior murder convictions]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nicolaus </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 551, 561 [286 Cal.Rptr. 628, 817 P.2d 893] [the \u201cdefendant admitted the truth of the three alleged prior-murder special circumstances, having been previously convicted of the murders of his three children\u201d]; <em>id. </em>at p. 567; <em>People v. Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 588-589, 595-596 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350] [upholding under \u00a7 190.2(a)(2) two prior murder conviction special circumstances imposed for two prior murder convictions; rejecting challenge that special circumstances were invalid because murders in prior convictions occurred after the capital crimes].) The cases defendant cites are inapposite, since in both cases the defendant had suffered only <em>one </em>prior murder conviction. <em>(People v. Andrews </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 206, 221, 224 [260 Cal.Rptr. 583, 776 P.2d 285] [striking two of three prior murder special circumstances when the defendant had one prior murder conviction, and three current murder convictions]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1244, 1246, 1274 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>4. <em>Alleged Instructional Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Defendant makes numerous claims of instructional error. We find none meritorious. In particular, the trial court did not err in failing to require the jury to make unanimous separate findings of the truth of specific aggravating evidence, or to render a statement of reasons for its verdict in the event it imposed death. <em>(Prieto, </em>supra, 30 Cal.4th at pp. 263, 275; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 694, 782 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 165, 906 P.2d 2].) Nothing in <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 584 [153 L.Ed.2d 556, 122 S.Ct. 2428], <em>or Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348], affects our conclusions in this regard. (Prieto, at pp. 263, 275.)  Nor did the trial court violate defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights when it failed to instruct the jury it did not have to unanimously agree on mitigation. The penalty phase instructions \u201cconveyed unmistakably that jurors were to undergo an individualized process of weighing aggravating and mitigating factors. . . . [T]here was little likelihood of the jury\u2019s reading into the instructions a requirement that they agree unanimously on any circumstance or evidence as mitigating.\u201d <em>(People v. Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 769 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754].) Nor should the jury have been instructed that the reasonable doubt standard governed its penalty determination, i.e., that to impose a sentence of death they had to be persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances were so substantial in comparison with the mitigating circumstances that they warranted death, and that death was the justified and appropriate sentence in view of all the evidence. (Medina, at p. 782; <em>Bradford, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 1059.) Nothing in <em>Ring v. Arizona, supra, </em>536 U.S. 584, or <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, supra, </em>530 U.S. 466, mandates a different conclusion. <em>(Prieto, </em>at pp. 263, 275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., and Chin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-16\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-17\"> The guilt phase was preceded by a September 1992 competency trial in which defendant was found competent to stand trial.

Because jurors instructed not to speak to anyone about the case except a fellow juror during deliberations (CALJIC Nos. 0.50, 1.03) may assume such an instruction does not apply to confidential relationships, we recommend the jury be expressly instructed that they may not speak to anyone about the case, except a fellow juror during deliberations, and that this includes, but is not limited to, spouses, spiritual leaders or advisers, or therapists. Moreover, the jurors should also be instructed that if anyone, other than a fellow juror during deliberations, tells a juror his or her view of the evidence in the case, the juror should report that conversation immediately to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Defendant argues the following statements from Juror K.A.\u2019s second declaration violate Evidence Code section 1150 and cannot be considered because they are not evidence of misconduct, citing <em>People v.

I do recall one juror later stating that God does not play a part in our deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Defendant is correct that these statements do not demonstrate misconduct. However, Juror K.A.\u2019s conduct in bringing Bible passages into the jury room was misconduct. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pp. 465^167.) In that situation, we have evaluated the comments of the juror in question and other jurors to determine whether there is evidence of actual bias. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 588 [The juror \u201cduring deliberations made reference to extrajudicial evidence despite admonitions from other jurors not to do so\u201d].)

Nor did the trial court allude to this statement in its ruling. (See <em>Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 582.) Moreover, we have no idea when this conversation occurred. The reference in Juror K.A.\u2019s first declaration appears after she had already finished talking about the introduction of the Bible passages into the jury room, and before she mentioned that on March 9, 1993, <em>a month after the penalty verdict was returned, </em>she was contacted by a defense investigator. Indeed, Juror B.P. specifically stated, \u201cAt no time during the deliberations did I relate to the other jurors what my pastor had said to me.\u201d There is no indication in the jurors\u2019 declarations that they were anything but forthcoming.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\"> Defendant contends we may not consider Juror B.P.\u2019s statements that she consistently had the same penalty vote, and that she told her pastor she had made up her mind about the verdict.

Juror B.P.\u2019s vote and statement to her pastor were objective acts subject to corroboration. (See <em>Hutchinson, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 350.) While defendant is correct that we cannot consider the fact that Juror B.P. voted for the death penalty after her conversation with her pastor as evidence the misconduct had no effect on her, we may, as we did in <em>Nesler, </em>consider the objective acts and statements of the subject juror, such as her three votes before the conversation with her pastor, the statement to her pastor she had already made up her mind, and the other circumstances delineated above regarding this conversation and Juror B.P.\u2019s subsequent conduct, to determine whether there is a substantial likelihood she was actually biased as a result of the conversation. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 588.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b318-9\">KENNARD, J., Concurring and dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"AIo\">I join the majority in upholding defendant\u2019s convictions for murder (Pen.

Because neither party had asked for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court based its ruling entirely on declarations submitted by the parties, most important of which were declarations from B.P. and K.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Juror B.P. mentioned that she had voted for death in three straw votes on the first day of deliberations (a Friday). She then described a conversation with her pastor that weekend: \u201cI spoke with my pastor about the difficulty of making the decision. I told him, \u2018Pastor, I\u2019m doing jury duty on a murder case. Is there anything in the Bible which speaks against the death penalty?\u2019 I also told him that I had made up my mind about the verdict. [][] In response, my pastor told me, \u2018[B.], I think I know what case you are on. There is no place in the Bible that takes the law out of the Bible. If you are sitting on the case I\u2019m thinking you are sitting on, if I was in your shoes, <em>I would not hesitate to give him the death </em>penalty.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">With respect to Juror K.A., she said that after the first day of deliberations she told her husband of \u201cthe stress [she] felt in making the decision.\u201d He urged her to discuss the matter with her pastor and showed her this passage from the Bible: \u201cIf a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death. Or if anyone has a wooden object in his hand that could kill, and he hits someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death. If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at him intentionally so that he dies or if in hostility he hits him with his fist so that he dies, that person shall be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death ....[!] But if without hostility someone suddenly shoves another or throws something at him unintentionally or, without seeing him, drops a stone on him . . . and he dies, then since ... he did not intend to harm him, the assembly must. . . protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood .... Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness. Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. He must surely be put to death.\u201d (Numbers 35:16-35:25, 35:30-35:31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">On Sunday, Juror K.A. and her husband attended Bible study at their church. There her husband made copies of the Bible verses quoted above. The pastor, who knew K.A. was a juror in defendant\u2019s capital murder case, told K.A. he understood (apparently from talking to K.A.\u2019s husband) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>K.A. had read several Bible verses. K.A. replied that the verses had given her comfort. The pastor described the verses as \u201cgood scriptures\u201d and said \u201cin a joking manner that <em>if he were a juror he would impose the death penalty </em>. . . . \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The next Monday, Juror K.A. highlighted certain passages on the copies of the Bible verses and brought them to court. When, during deliberations, some jurors mentioned the difficulty in \u201cmaking a life and death decision,\u201d K.A. showed them the highlighted Bible passages. Juror B.P. told K.A. that she too had spoken to her pastor, who had given her the same Bible verses that K.A. had brought to court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">No matter how inadvertent, a juror\u2019s receipt of information not presented in court is juror misconduct. \u201cAlthough inadvertent exposure to out-of-court information is not blameworthy conduct, as might be suggested by the term \u2018misconduct,\u2019 it nevertheless gives rise to a presumption of prejudice . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 579 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87] (lead opn. of George, C. J.) <em>(Nesler).) </em>In the words of the United States Supreme Court: \u201cIn a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering, directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial .... The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish . . . that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant.\u201d <em>(Remmer v.

K.A.\u2019s husband implied a similar view when, before K.A.\u2019s talk with her pastor, he showed her Bible verses expressing the view that all intentional killers should be put to death. The two jurors\u2019 receipt of those communications amounted to jury misconduct. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 579; see also <em>Stockton v. Com. of Va., supra, </em>852 F.2d 740 [jury bias occurred when, at a meal during penalty deliberations, restaurant owner told jurors they should impose the death sentence].)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Was the misconduct prejudicial to defendant? \u201cWhen juror misconduct involves the receipt of information about a party or the case from <em>extraneous </em>sources, the verdict will be set aside only if there appears a substantial likelihood of juror bias. [Citation.] Such bias may appear in either of two ways: (1) if the extraneous material, judged objectively, is so prejudicial in and of itself that it is <em>inherently and substantially likely </em>to have influenced a juror; or (2) even if the information is not \u2018inherently\u2019 prejudicial, if, from the nature of the misconduct and the surrounding circumstances, the court determines that it is <em>substantially likely </em>a juror was <em>\u2018actually </em>biased\u2019 against the defendant.\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 578-579, italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Here, the material Juror K.A. received from sources outside of the court\u2014 the views of her husband and her pastor on the propriety of a death sentence in defendant\u2019s case\u2014was \u201cinherently and substantially likely\u201d to have influenced her vote. Normally a spouse and a spiritual advisor would have a great influence on a juror having to decide a matter of life and death. Here, not just one, but <em>both </em>of these highly influential people in essence told K.A. they thought defendant should be sentenced to death. These views were reinforced when Juror B.P. later told K.A. that B.P.\u2019s pastor too had given her the same Bible verses K.A. had shared with the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Even if the receipt of this outside information was not \u201cinherently and substantially likely\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 579) to have influenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Juror K.A., it is \u201csubstantially likely\u201d that she \u201cwas \u2018actually biased\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>against defendant. Her bias is demonstrated by her decision to show the other jurors her highlighted passages from the Bible verses on the appropriateness of killing a killer. As this court has recognized, \u201c[a] juror\u2019s disclosure of extraneous information to other jurors tends to demonstrate that the juror intended the forbidden information to influence the verdict and strengthens the likelihood of bias\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 587), whereas an unbiased juror will realize that the jury may not consider the information and therefore is unlikely to mention it <em>(In re Carpenter </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 634, 657 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 889 P.2d 985]): In handing out to the other jurors the Bible verses that her husband had showed her and her pastor had commended as \u201cgood scriptures,\u201d Juror K.A. demonstrated that she had been affected by their comments and therefore that she was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">With regard to Juror B.P., the question of prejudice is closer, for she had talked only to her pastor, whereas Juror K.A. had talked to both her spiritual advisor and her husband, both of whom indicated their approval of executing defendant. Nevertheless, in my view B.P. was substantially likely to harbor a bias against defendant. As in this case, <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Com. of Va., supra, </em>852 F.2d 740, involved an unsolicited communication to jurors. There, a restaurant owner approached a group of four jurors while they were taking a lunch break in the middle of their deliberations in a capital case. He spoke to them for about five minutes, asking whether they had reached a verdict yet and telling them \u201c \u2018they ought to fry the son of a bitch.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 742.) After lunch the jury returned a verdict of death. The federal circuit court reversed, explaining that the comment, which came in the middle of deliberations, \u201cposed a potential for prejudice that was too serious to ignore.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 745.) Here, the likelihood of prejudice was far greater than in <em>Stockton, </em>because B.P. conversed not with a restaurateur but with her pastor. For advice and comfort in difficult matters of life and death, many people turn to their pastor, whose views are likely to carry far more weight than those of a stranger encountered in a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The majority acknowledges there was misconduct by Jurors K.A. and B.P. but concludes it was harmless. As I shall explain, the majority\u2019s reasons are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">Juror K.A. was exposed to three separate acts of misconduct; (1) receiving from her husband Bible verses approving of putting to death anyone who had intentionally killed; (2) hearing her pastor\u2019s approval of the Bible verses, which he described as \u201cgood scripture,\u201d accompanied by his comment that he would vote to execute defendant; and (3) learning from Juror B.P. that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>own pastor had referred her to the very same Bible verses. Reversal is required if there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that K.A. was influenced by the <em>combined effect </em>of these three acts. Instead, the majority looks at the acts separate from each other. After stating that K.A. was not affected by her husband\u2019s conduct (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 304), it likewise concludes that she was not influenced by her pastor\u2019s conduct <em>(id. </em>at p. 307). Only in a footnote does it mention B.P.\u2019s comment that her pastor had expressed views similar to those of K.A.\u2019s husband and pastor <em>(id. </em>at p. 309, fn. 13), and it dismisses the possibility that these three acts were collectively prejudicial in a sentence, without analysis <em>(id. </em>at p. 310). But the views of these three persons reinforced each other, with a combined effect that was likely to be far greater than the impact that any one of them would have had in isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In finding the misconduct of Juror B.P. harmless, the majority stresses that before consulting her pastor she had voted for the death penalty on three ballots taken by the jurors during their deliberations. But jurors frequently change their minds during deliberations; indeed, that is the whole point of deliberating. Moreover, B.P.\u2019s decision to bring up the matter with her pastor after those votes suggests that she remained uncertain. B.P.\u2019s conversation with her pastor may well have strengthened her resolve to vote in favor of the death penalty, leaving her far less susceptible to the arguments of those jurors who were urging a sentence of life without possibility of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The majority also relies on the strength of the aggravating evidence at the penalty phase: defendant\u2019s six prior convictions for murdering homeless men, his own testimony that \u201cI would not change a thing I did in my life,\u201d and the concession by psychiatrists who testified for the defense that defendant was an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d sadist who derived sexual excitement from killing. Given this evidence, the majority concludes, the extrajudicial communications of Jurors K.A. and B.P. were unlikely to have affected their votes to sentence defendant to death. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 305, 309.)</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Granted, the aggravating evidence was strong. But the majority ignores the strong <em>mitigating </em>evidence presented to the jury. Five defense experts (three psychiatrists and two psychologists) described defendant, who was 30 years old at the time of trial, as severely ill mentally, suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He complained that certain well-known entertainers were \u201cin the kitchen excreting in his food.\u201d He was convinced that the Mayor of Los Angeles, the Governor of California, and the President of the United States all conspired against him. He thought people watched him through the television set. He talked of conversations with his dead grandparents, and said his mother printed counterfeit money in her basement. He insisted that the homeless men he had killed were not really dead, and he felt compelled to clean his jail cell with a toothbrush six to 10 times a day. In short, the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>presented compelling evidence that defendant, although not legally insane at the time of the offenses (see \u00a7 25, subd. (b) [a defendant is insane only if \u201che or she was incapable of knowing or understanding the nature and quality of his or her act and of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the commission of the offense\u201d]), suffered from a mental illness that destroyed his capacity for rational thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">If defendant\u2019s doctors are right, defendant\u2019s mental deficiencies are comparable in severity to mental retardation. In <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002) 536 U.S. 304 [153 L.Ed.2d 335, 122 S.Ct. 2242], the United States Supreme Court held that to execute the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, reasoning that retarded persons \u201chave diminished capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of others.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 318.) The same mental capacities are impaired in a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and the impairment may be equally grave. Although mental illness does \u201cnot warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>California law recognizes it as a mitigating factor that weighs against capital punishment. (\u00a7 190.3, factor (d).) Surely a reasonable juror could have concluded that defendant\u2019s mental illness diminished his personal culpability to such an extent as to render death an inappropriate penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">For the reasons given above, I would affirm defendant\u2019s convictions for murder and for assault by a prisoner serving a life sentence resulting in great bodily injury or death, as well as the special circumstance findings, but I would reverse the judgment of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">George, C. J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b324-7\">MORENO, J., Concurring and dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"At\">The majority is correct that the crimes committed by defendant Joseph Martin Danks were horrific and his lack of remorse shocking. Already serving a term of 156 years to life for the murders of six transients in Los Angeles County, defendant choked his 67-year-old cellmate to death because he believed that killing old people was \u201cthe Lord\u2019s work.\u201d He choked and stabbed another inmate in 1989, and stabbed his lawyer in the face during the penalty phase of this trial. He stated to law enforcement officers, after his latest murder, that he wanted the death penalty. He told jurors during his penalty phase testimony that he stabbed the transients while they slept and, directly addressing the jurors, stated, \u201cI would do it to you too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">But the jury also heard that defendant was paranoid, delusional, and mentally ill. Doctors confirmed this diagnosis. Defendant believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>entertainers Burt Reynolds and Johnny Carson excreted into his food. He cleaned his cell with a toothbrush six to 10 times a day. He thought people watched him through the television. He thought he was being brainwashed by music piped into his jail cell. Witnesses recounted incident after incident, dating back to his teen years, of defendant\u2019s bizarre and disturbed behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Against this backdrop, and in direct violation of the court\u2019s order not to discuss trial matters with nonjurors, two jurors took the extraordinary step of discussing their possible death verdict with their pastors. Astoundingly, in separate incidents, both pastors assured the two jurors that the death penalty was the appropriate punishment for defendant. Yet the majority finds this egregious juror misconduct nonprejudicial. While I concur in the majority\u2019s affirmance of defendant\u2019s murder conviction and the special circumstance findings, I dissent from the affirmance of the death judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Penalty phase deliberations began Friday afternoon, February 5, 1993. Juror K.A. stated in her declaration that the judge \u201chad told us we could not speak with persons about the case. But because of the feelings I had, I felt the necessity of talking to my husband.\u201d K.A.\u2019s husband noticed she was \u201con edge\u201d and advised her that reading scripture from the Bible might be of benefit. He showed her verses from the Book of Numbers that stated, in no uncertain terms, that murderers shall be put to death,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and told her that it was permissible to discuss the case with their pastor \u201cbecause a pastor is of a higher authority.\u201d Sunday evening, February 7, 1993, during Bible study at their church facility, K.A. and her husband met with their pastor. K.A. stated, \u201c[tjhat is where my husband made a copy . . . from our Bible containing the Book of Numbers verses,\u201d which was shown to the pastor. The pastor, knowing K.A. to be a juror on defendant\u2019s case, said \u201cthose were good scriptures,\u201d and then \u201cjokingly\u201d said that <em>he </em>\u201cwould impose the death penalty on Mr. Danks.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> K.A. returned to court for deliberations the following day. She stated, \u201cI took the copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers with me. <em>I had highlighted certain portions of </em>that.\u201d (Italics added.) She added, \u201cDuring deliberations, other jurors expressed feelings about the difficulty and responsibility of making a life or death decision. I told the other jurors about my copy of the pages from the Book of Numbers. I then shared [my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>highlighted copy] with the other jurors by passing it around to the other jurors.\u201d K.A. admitted that \u201cour Christian beliefs [were] being discussed during deliberations,\u201d causing one juror to take offense \u201clater in the day\u201d and stating words to the effect that \u201cGod does not play a part in this decision.\u201d The jury returned a death verdict the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">A second juror, B.P., also sought guidance from her pastor during the penalty phase deliberations. A third juror, E.M., declared that \u201cDuring the penalty phase deliberations in the [Danks] case, [B.P.] told me that she had talked to her pastor for guidance on the case.\u201d B.P. acknowledged in her declaration that \u201cDuring the penalty phase deliberations I spoke to my pastor.\u201d She stated, \u201cAfter the first day of deliberations, I spoke with my pastor about the difficulty of making the decision.\u201d B.P. added, \u201cI wanted to know what the Bible said about the death penalty.\u201d Her pastor told her, \u201c[B.], I think I know what case you are on,\u201d and stated, \u201cif I was in your shoes, I would not hesitate to give him the death penalty.\u201d K.A. added that \u201cB.P. told me that she had talked to her pastor and he had referred her to the same chapter and verses in the Book of Numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Based on these declarations, the majority remarkably finds no prejudicial juror misconduct. It reaches this erroneous conclusion by misapplying the test for determining prejudicial juror misconduct based on the receipt of extraneous information, set forth in a trilogy of <em>cases\u2014People v. Nesler </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 561, 580 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 454, 941 P.2d 87] (lead opn. of George, C. J.) <em>(Nesler), In re Carpenter </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 634 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 665, 889 P.2d 985] <em>(Carpenter), and People v. Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676] <em>(Marshall).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Specifically, in its examination of \u201cactual bias,\u201d the majority fails to acknowledge that, in juror misconduct cases based on the receipt of extraneous information, there arises a presumption of prejudice that must be rebutted by the prosecution <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 949), and that determining \u201c[w]hat constitutes \u2018actual bias\u2019 of a juror varies according to the circumstances of the case\u201d and involves an inquiry into whether a juror was \u201cactually being influenced by extraneous information about a party.\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 580, 581; and see <em>Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 950-951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Equally troubling is the fact that the majority analyzes the multiple incidents of juror misconduct here in piecemeal fashion, thereby sidestepping the requirement set forth in <em>Carpenter </em>that juror misconduct based on the receipt of extraneous information be analyzed in toto. As we stated in <em>Carpenter, </em>\u201cthe totality of circumstances surrounding the misconduct must still be examined to determine objectively whether a substantial likelihood of actual bias nonetheless arose.\u201d <em>(Carpenter, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>In addition, the majority ignores the line of cases that have found prejudicial misconduct where a jury receives information that diminishes its sense of responsibility for its verdict (e.g., <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 105 S.Ct. 2633] <em>(Caldwell)), </em>and makes short shrift of those cases that have found misconduct where the Bible is interjected into the proceedings. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432] <em>(Hughes) </em>and <em>People v. Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388] <em>(Mincey).) </em>Finally, the majority fails to appreciate that this deplorable juror misconduct undermines the integrity of California\u2019s death penalty process.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In <em>Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 561, we reversed a jury verdict because a juror received extraneous information about the defendant and shared it with other jurors. The lead opinion, which was written by Chief Justice George and joined by Justices Kennard and Werdegar, summarized the law in this area as follows: \u201cA defendant accused of a crime has a constitutional right to a trial by unbiased, impartial jurors. [Citations.] A defendant \u2018is entitled to be tried by 12, not 11, impartial and unprejudiced jurors. \u201cBecause a defendant charged with a crime has a right to a unanimous verdict of 12 impartial jurors [citation], it is settled that a conviction cannot stand if even a single juror has been improperly influenced.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] [f] Juror misconduct, such as the receipt of information about a party or the case that was not part of the evidence received at trial, leads to a presumption that the defendant was prejudiced thereby and may establish juror bias. [Citations.] \u2018The requirement that a jury\u2019s verdict \u201cmust be based upon the evidence developed at the trial\u201d goes to the fundamental integrity of all that is embraced in the constitutional concept of trial by jury. ... [1] In the constitutional sense, trial by jury in a criminal case necessarily implies at the very least that the \u201cevidence developed\u201d against a defendant shall come from the witness stand in a public courtroom where there is full judicial protection of the defendant\u2019 s right of confrontation, of cross-examination, and of counsel.\u2019 [Citation.] As the United States Supreme Court has explained: \u2018Due process means a jury <em>capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it... I </em>[Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">As such, \u201cA judgment adverse to a defendant in a criminal case must be reversed or vacated \u2018whenever ... the court finds a substantial likelihood that the vote of one or more jurors was influenced by exposure to prejudicial matter relating to the defendant or to the case itself that was not part of the trial record on which the case was submitted to the jury.\u2019 [Citations.] This rule \u2018has significant support in the case law\u2019 [citation], both within California [citation] and without [citation], [Citations.] [][] \u2018The ultimate issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>influence on the juror is resolved by reference to the substantial likelihood test, an objective standard.\u2019 . . . [][] Such \u2018prejudice analysis\u2019 is different from, and indeed less tolerant than, \u2018harmless-error analysis\u2019 for ordinary error at trial. The reason is as follows. Any deficiency that undermines the integrity of a trial\u2014which requires a proceeding at which the defendant, represented by counsel, may present evidence and argument before an impartial judge and jury\u2014introduces the taint of fundamental' unfairness and calls for reversal without consideration of actual prejudice. [Citation.] Such a deficiency is threatened by jury misconduct. When the misconduct in question supports a finding that there is a substantial likelihood that at least one juror was impermissibly influenced to the defendant\u2019s detriment, we are compelled to conclude that the integrity of the trial was undermined: under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that the jury was impartial. By contrast, when the misconduct does not support such a finding, we must hold it nonprejudicial.\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 950-951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In <em>Nesler, </em>a juror received unflattering information about the defendant from a woman in a bar during the sanity phase of the defendant\u2019s manslaughter trial. The woman claimed she had been a babysitter for the defendant. During deliberations, however, the juror stated she \u201cknew\u201d the defendant\u2019s babysitter, and remarked that the defendant would leave her children for long periods of time, was not a good mother, and used illicit drugs. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 574.) She argued to jurors that \u201cif [they] knew what she knew\u201d they would find the defendant sane. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 571.) The jury ultimately found that the defendant was sane.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The lead opinion in <em>Nesler </em>found that the People had not rebutted the presumption of prejudice arising from this juror\u2019s misconduct because there was a substantial likelihood that the extraneous information impermissibly influenced her decision: \u201cAlthough [the juror] knew she should not discuss matters that were not part of the evidence presented at trial, she intentionally interjected this outside information into the deliberations .... In our view, [the juror\u2019s] repeated references to and use of the outside information during deliberations establish a substantial likelihood that her extraneous knowledge concerning defendant caused her to prejudge issues that arose during deliberations and to render a verdict that was not based solely upon the evidence presented in court. As defendant points out, if [the juror] had not been influenced by what she had learned, she would not have used the information to attempt to convince other jurors that defendant truly was a bad mother-and more involved with drugs than the evidence showed.\u201d <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Justice Mosk, who concurred in the judgment in <em>Nesler, </em>agreed that the \u201cfacts compelled]\u201d the conclusion that the juror committed misconduct, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the \u201claw compel[led]\u201d the conclusion that these facts gave rise to a presumption of prejudice. <em>(Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 592 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.).) Unlike the lead opinion, however, Justice Mosk stated he could not determine whether there was, in fact, a substantial likelihood of the juror\u2019s actual bias: \u201cOne can reasonably conclude <em>either </em>that [the juror] was \u2018actually\u2019 biased by what she heard <em>or </em>that she was not, depending on whether one infers <em>either </em>that she was herself influenced <em>or </em>that she was simply attempting to influence others. With matters thus in equipoise, the presumption of prejudice stands unrebutted.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 592-593.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">A majority of the court in <em>Nesler </em>thus concluded that the presumption of prejudice that arises in juror misconduct cases involving the receipt of extraneous information had not been rebutted. Fairly read, the lead opinion concluded that the presumption of prejudice is not rebutted where there is a substantial likelihood that the juror herself was improperly influenced by the extraneous material. Justice Mosk concluded that the presumption of prejudice is not rebutted where there is proof either that the juror herself was improperly influenced or that she was simply attempting to improperly influence others. As such, a majority of this court has held that the presumption of prejudice arising in juror misconduct cases involving the receipt of extraneous information is not rebutted where the juror herself was improperly influenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The majority here acknowledges that K.A. and B.P. committed juror misconduct in this case by speaking to their pastors (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 307, 309), and finds it \u201ctroubling that during deliberations not one but two jurors had conversations with their pastors that ultimately addressed the issue being resolved at the penalty phase in this case.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 306, fit. 11.) More troubling is the fact that the majority finds K.A.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s juror misconduct nonprejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Based on K.A.\u2019s juror declaration, there is, at a minimum, a substantial likelihood that K.A. was improperly influenced by her pastor\u2019s assurance that the death penalty was the appropriate punishment for defendant. K.A.\u2019s declaration contains the following information, which <em>Carpenter </em>teaches we must view in its totality: (1) K.A. knew she could not speak to nonjurors about the case; (2) nonetheless, because of her uncertainty in imposing a death verdict, she discussed the case first with her husband;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) then, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Sunday night, while at their church facility, and hours before deliberations were to be resumed the following morning, she and her husband met with their pastor, who knew she was a juror on defendant\u2019s case; (4) at this time, K.A.\u2019s husband made a copy of the Book of Numbers verses to show to the pastor; (5) the pastor, a person assertedly \u201cof a higher authority,\u201d said those were \u201cgood scriptures,\u201d and (6) added that he would impose the death penalty on defendant; (7) thereafter, K.A. herself, not her husband, highlighted certain portions of the \u201cgood scriptures\u201d supporting the death penalty, and (8) took them to court the following morning; (9) during deliberations, she told the other jurors about her highlighted copy of Book of Numbers verses; (10) shared this highlighted copy with the other jurors who had expressed feelings about the difficulty and responsibility of imposing a death verdict; and (11) she admitted that the jury discussed their \u201cChristian beliefs\u201d during deliberations to the extent that, later in the day, a juror became offended because \u201cGod does not play a part in this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Based on the above facts, it is clear that K.A. had not yet made her death penalty decision after deliberations had concluded on Friday. This is evident from the facts that she was \u201con edge,\u201d \u201cfelt the necessity\u201d of talking to her husband about the case, and met with her pastor to talk about the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But after receiving her pastor\u2019s assurance that the Book of Numbers verses were \u201cgood scriptures\u201d and that he would impose the death penalty on defendant\u2014 extraneous information outside the deliberative process that the majority concedes was improperly received\u2014K.A. arrived at her decision to impose the death penalty on defendant. That this information was critical to her decision is evident from the facts that she highlighted her copy of the Book of Numbers scripture after the meeting and brought it to deliberations the following morning, that she told other jurors about these particular Bible verses, and that she shared this scripture with undecided jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The language in <em>Nesler </em>applies with particular force here: \u201cAlthough [K.A.] knew she should not discuss matters that were not part of the evidence presented at trial, she intentionally interjected this outside information into the deliberations .... In our view, [K.A.\u2019s] repeated references to and use of the outside information during deliberations establish a substantial likelihood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>that her extraneous knowledge concerning defendant caused her to prejudge issues that arose during deliberations and to render a verdict that was not based solely upon the evidence presented in court. As defendant points out, if [K.A.] had not been influenced by what she had learned, she would not have used the information to attempt to convince other jurors\u201d struggling with their death penalty verdict. (Nesler, <em>supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">There is also a substantial likelihood that B.P. was impermissibly influenced by her own misconduct. Despite her claim that she voted the \u201csame way\u201d before and after talking to her pastor during deliberations, an objective view of the evidence suggests that her earlier votes were tentative. B.P. candidly acknowledged that she spoke with her pastor about \u201cthe difficulty of making the decision.\u201d Her pastor then told her that he \u201cwould not hesitate\u201d to give defendant the death penalty. The damage was done. Juror E.M. stated that, after this meeting, and \u201c[d]uring the penalty phase deliberations in the [Danks] case, [B.P.] told me that she had talked to her pastor for guidance on the case.\u201d Simply stated, if B.P. had been certain of her verdict, she would not have asked her pastor for guidance in making this difficult decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In addition, K.A. added that \u201cB.P. told me that she had talked to her pastor and he had referred her to the same chapter and verses in the Book of Numbers.\u201d Thus, during the deliberation period, K.A. and B.P. each received <em>confirmation </em>that the other\u2019s pastor approved imposing the death penalty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Given the high regard the two jurors had for their pastors, this mutual reinforcement of a reliance on biblical and pastoral authority further heightened the resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In light of the majority\u2019s emphasis on the \u201cstrength\u201d of the evidence against defendant in finding these multiple acts of juror misconduct nonprejudicial (maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 305-306), the test articulated in <em>Marshall </em>bears repeating: \u201c \u2018The ultimate issue of influence on the juror is resolved by reference to the substantial likelihood test, an objective standard. . . .\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>[Citation.] [f] Such \u2018prejudice analysis\u2019 is different from, and indeed less tolerant than, \u2018harmless-error analysis\u2019 for ordinary error at trial. The reason is as follows. Any deficiency that undermines the integrity of a trial . . . introduces the taint of fundamental unfairness and calls for reversal without consideration of actual prejudice.\u201d <em>(.Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 951.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">An examination of K.A.\u2019s behavior before and after the Sunday night meeting with her pastor leads to the inescapable conclusion that she was actually and improperly influenced by her pastor\u2019s assurance that the death penalty was the proper punishment for defendant (see <em>Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 583), and it is substantially likely that B.P., despite her remarks to the contrary, was also improperly influenced by her pastor\u2019s assurance on this very topic. \u201cWhen the [juror] misconduct in question supports a finding that there is a substantial likelihood that <em>at least one juror </em>was impermissibly influenced to the defendant\u2019s detriment, we are compelled to conclude that the integrity of the trial was undermined: under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that the jury was impartial.\u201d <em>(Marshall, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 951, italics added.) Moreover, \u201cunder the Eighth Amendment \u2018the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Caldwell, supra, 472 </em>U.S. at p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Reversal under these facts is mandated. The flagrant juror misconduct here violates the test set we forth in both <em>Marshall </em>and <em>Nesler. </em>Not one, but two jurors were impermissibly influenced by extraneous information they <em>solicited </em>outside the deliberative process. The integrity of this trial was undermined, these two jurors were not impartial, and this verdict should not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Grounds for reversal similarly exist when a juror receives information that improperly influences her verdict in the sense that it diminishes her sense of responsibility for her verdict. <em>(Caldwell, supra, All </em>U.S. 320.) In <em>Caldwell, </em>the high court set aside a judgment of death because the prosecutor told the jurors in closing argument that the state supreme court would automatically review their decision that death was the appropriate penalty. The high court stated; \u201c[I]t is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere. This Court has repeatedly said that under the Eighth Amendment \u2018the qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 328-329.) The high court therefore reasoned that such information \u201cpresents an intolerable danger that the jury will in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>choose to minimize the importance of its role.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333.) It concluded, \u201cThis Court has always premised its capital punishment decisions on the assumption that a capital sentencing jury recognizes the gravity of its task and proceeds with the appropriate awareness of its \u2018truly awesome responsibility.\u2019 In this case, the State sought to minimize the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of death. Because we cannot say that this effort had no effect on the sentencing decision, that decision does not meet the standard of reliability that the Eighth Amendment requires. The sentence of death must therefore be vacated.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 341.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We applied the <em>Caldwell </em>rule in <em>People v. Farmer </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 888 [254 Cal.Rptr. 508, 765 P.2d 940], a case in which the prosecutor told the jury: \u201cWhether or not [the defendant] should live or die was decided by the voters of this state when they passed [the death penalty law], when they set the criteria. They decided who lives and who dies. You decide, does aggravating outweigh mitigating. That is your job. That is all you decide. The law does the rest. It is not you.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 929, italics omitted.) In essence, \u201cthe prosecutor informed the jury that \u2018the law\u2019 decided whether <em>this </em>defendant would live or die, and that it was not the jury\u2019s responsibility and obligation to decide the propriety of death as a penalty in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 930.) As such, \u201cthe jury was misled as to its discretion and responsibility in fixing the appropriate penalty, and hence ... the judgment of death must be set aside under Caldwell. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 931.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Despite the fact that the misconduct in <em>Caldwell </em>was perpetrated by a state actor, the general reasoning of <em>Caldwell </em>is instructive here. As stated by the high court, \u201cthe uncorrected suggestion that the responsibility for any ultimate decision of death will rest with others presents an intolerable danger that the jury will, in fact, minimize the importance of its role.\u201d <em>(Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. at p. 333.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Here, after seeking guidance in violation of a court order not to discuss the case with nonjurors, two jurors were told by their personal spiritual leaders that death was the appropriate penalty for this defendant. Such advice would likely have a greater impact upon a juror than receiving similar unsolicited information from the prosecutor, and the fact that this advice was received out of court gave defendant no opportunity to object or to rebut the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">As we said in <em>Hughes, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at page 389, in reference to a claim of prosecutorial misconduct in invoking the Bible: \u201c \u2018[T]he primary vice in referring to the Bible and other religious authority is that such argument may \u201cdiminish the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for its verdict and . . . imply that another, higher law should be applied in capital cases, displacing the law in the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d But the misconduct here is far more egregious than the misconduct that occurs when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>prosecutor exhorts the jury to impose the death penalty by referencing the Bible. When the prosecutor invokes the Bible, the effect on the jury is speculative, and we have found such misconduct harmless by pointing to the prosecutor\u2019s legitimate reasons in support of a death penalty verdict. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Slaughter </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1187, 1208-1209 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 477, 47 P.3d 262]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 761-762 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Roybal </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 481, 519-521 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 966 P.2d 521].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Here, however, not one, but two jurors sought guidance from their personal spiritual leaders. Not only were they referred to verses in the Bible that supported the death penalty, they were assured that it was proper to impose the death penalty on defendant. The effect of the pastors\u2019 assurances was palpable. K.A. highlighted a copy of the Bible verses in support of the death penalty and shared that copy with undecided jurors. B.P. also informed other jurors during deliberations that her pastor offered her guidance on this difficult decision, and had referred her to the same biblical passages.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">K.A.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s misconduct is prejudicial because it not only diminished their personal responsibility in imposing a death verdict, but the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility as a whole. Given that the \u201c \u2018qualitative difference of death from all other punishments requires a correspondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capital sentencing determination\u2019 \u201d <em>(Caldwell, supra, </em>472 U.S. at p. 329), and given the \u201cintolerable danger\u201d that this jury chose to minimize the importance of its role <em>(id. </em>at p. 333), defendant\u2019s death sentence should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The juror misconduct here is far more prejudicial than the juror misconduct that occurred in <em>Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at pages 465-466, a case in which a juror brought the Bible into deliberations and several jurors read the same passages at issue here. We stated the test for juror misconduct in this situation as follows: \u201cIt is misconduct for a juror to consider material [citation] extraneous to the record. [Citations.] Such conduct creates a presumption of prejudice that may be rebutted by a showing that no prejudice actually occurred. [Citation.] In criminal cases, the presumption of prejudice is rebutted when there is no substantial likelihood that the vote of one or more of the jurors was influenced by exposure to the improper material.\u201d <em>(Mincey, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 467.) We held the juror misconduct in <em>Mincey </em>was nonprejudicial because (1) the Bible verses were read after deliberations concluded for the day, (2) the jurors did not discuss the verses, (3) the jurors were questioned by the trial court the very next day and stated that reading the Bible verses had not influenced their deliberations, and (4) the trial court admonished the jurors to decide the case solely on the evidence. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>But none of the above factors, which militate against a finding of prejudice, are present here. K.A.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s juror misconduct was discovered after trial, so the trial court had no opportunity to undo the harm. Moreover, not only were the Bible verses read during deliberations, K.A. stated in her declaration they were read to jurors who had \u201cexpressed feelings about the difficulty and responsibility of making a life or death decision.\u201d In addition, unlike in <em>Mincey, </em>where the Bible verses were not discussed during deliberations, K.A. admitted not only that she told the other jurors about the scripture, but that the jurors\u2019 \u201cChristian beliefs\u201d were discussed during that Monday\u2019s deliberations,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prompting another juror to take offense later in the day. Juror E.M. corroborated the fact that such misconduct took place because she stated that during deliberations B.P. admitted that she sought her pastor\u2019s guidance. This was \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d because the pastors\u2019 assurances, K.A.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s knowledge of the same, and the jury\u2019s improper discussion of biblical passages during deliberations \u201csuggested that under divine law the proper penalty for defendant\u2019s crimes is death, always and automatically, regardless of the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\u201d <em>(People v. Slaughter, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1226 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Kennard, J.); see also <em>Jones v. Kemp </em>(N.D.Ga. 1989) 706 F.Supp. 1534, 1558-1560 [constitutional error for trial court to grant jurors\u2019 request in death penalty case to bring Bible into deliberation room as \u201cthe confidence in the reliability of the jury\u2019s decision . . . may be undermined\u201d].) The fact that the jury returned a verdict the following day is further evidence of the impact of the jurors\u2019 misconduct. The presumption of prejudice recognized in juror misconduct cases has not been rebutted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Finally, the juror misconduct here undermines the integrity of the death penalty process. In <em>NeCamp v. Commonwealth </em>(1949) 311 Ky. 676 [225 S.W.2d 109], a case directly on point, the jury returned a death verdict. In the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, an affidavit was introduced by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in support of the verdict that provided that, during the course of deliberations, a juror told other jurors that \u201cshe had confided in her priest and he had advised her it was all right\u201d to impose the death penalty because \u201cit would not be any sin.\u201d <em>(NeCamp, supra, </em>225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>S.W.2d at p. 111.) In reversing the death judgment, the court stated: \u201cIn the present case, ... we have an affidavit filed by the Commonwealth [that] . . . does in fact reveal misconduct as measured by the law. It is a disclosure made by the Commonwealth itself that the juror during the trial had conferred with another and carried the advice into the jury room. Perhaps this interpretation of the affidavit as being in support of and not to impeach the verdict is not the perfection of logic. But with the life of a man at stake, and that fife to be taken by processes of the law, the reality and the actuality of the situation ought, under such circumstances, to be recognized. . . . The appellant, NeCamp, is shown to be a confirmed criminal, an enemy of society. But society cannot ignore its legitimate concept of justice even for such an insubordinate member. As stated by [Justice Frankfurter of] the Supreme Court of the United States not long ago in regard to a heinous crime: \u2018A shocking crime puts law to its severest test. Law triumphs over natural impulses aroused by such a crime only if guilt be ascertained by due regard for those indispensable safeguards which our civilization has evolved for the ascertainment of guilt. It is not enough that a trial goes through the forms of law. ... Of course society must protect itself. But surely it is not self-protection for society to take life without the most careful observance of its own safeguards against the misuse of capital punishment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(NeCamp, supra, </em>225 S.W.2d at p. 112, quoting <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 463, 477 [90 L.Ed. 1382, 66 S.Ct. 1318] (dis. opn. of Frankfurter, J.); accord, <em>Ex parte Troha </em>(Ala. 1984) 462 So.2d 953, 954 [reversing rape conviction based on juror misconduct where juror stated in his declaration that he \u201cfelt compelled\u201d during trial to ask his brother, a minister, \u201cfor guidance and scripture references so as to enable [him] to make a proper and just decision\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">As in <em>NeCamp, </em>there is no denying the enormity of defendant\u2019s crimes. However, there is substantial evidence in the record that defendant\u2019s killings were not the acts of a cold, calculating, rational killer, but the acts of a highly disturbed, delusional, and mentally ill human being. It is therefore not surprising that the jurors struggled over their decision to impose the death penalty on this defendant. Indeed, the fact that two jurors actively sought advice on this very topic from their pastors is tangible evidence that defendant\u2019s fate was no foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">But K.A.\u2019s and B.P.\u2019s misconduct went far beyond the simple request for spiritual guidance found prejudicial in <em>NeCamp </em>and <em>Troha. </em>The two jurors received their pastors\u2019 assurances that the death penalty was the proper punishment for defendant. They carried these assurances into the jury room, further infecting the deliberative process. K.A. highlighted and shared with undecided jurors improper biblical material that advocated death for murderers without consideration of any mitigating circumstances that might have inured to defendant\u2019s benefit. B.P. discussed the fact that her pastor offered her guidance on this case. The jury\u2019s deliberative process was so permeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>with improper religious discussion, one juror was finally prompted to remind the group that such considerations were not supposed to be part of their decision. But the bell could not be unrung. The jury returned a death verdict the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The degree of the juror misconduct here, in its totality, leads to the conclusion that K.A. and B.P. were improperly influenced by the events of the preceding weekend, tainting the jurors, the jury\u2019s deliberations, and the verdict itself. The fact that two jurors received approval from their spiritual leaders to impose a death sentence on defendant only serves to highlight the nature and degree of misconduct. While the majority seemingly contents itself by emphasizing the \u201cstrength\u201d of the evidence against defendant, it is error to minimize the totality of the arrant juror misconduct here. \u201cFrom the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking the life of one of its citizens . . . differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action. It is of vital importance ... to the community that any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion.\u201d <em>(Gardner v. Florida </em>(1977) 430 U.S. 349, 357-358 [51 L.Ed.2d 393, 97 S.Ct. 1197].) The tainted penalty phase verdict falls far short of this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">I concur in the majority\u2019s affirmance of defendant\u2019s murder conviction and the special circumstance findings, but I would reverse the judgment of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">George, C.

(Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 309, fn. 13.) But another juror, E.M., declared that <em>during deliberations </em>B.P. mentioned that she had spoken to her pastor. It is reasonable to infer that the declarations of K.A. and E.M. both refer to the same statement by B.P., in which case E.M.\u2019s declaration demonstrates that it was said during deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b320-10\"> In the wake of two more recent decisions by the United States Supreme Court <em>(United States v. Olano </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 725 [123 L.Ed.2d 508, 113 S.Ct. 1770]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 209 [71 L.Ed.2d 78, 102 S.Ct. 940]), there is doubt as to the continuing validity of the presumption of prejudice articulated in <em>Remmer v. United States, supra, </em>347 U.S. 227. (See, e.g., <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Dutkel </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 192 F.3d 893, 894-896 [presumption applies to cases of jury tampering]; <em>U.S. v. Sylvester </em>(5th Cir. 1998) 143 F.3d 923, 934 [\u201cthe <em>Remmer </em>presumption of prejudice cannot survive <em>Phillips </em>and <em>Olano,\u201d </em>and remains applicable \u201conly when the court determines that prejudice is likely\u201d]; <em>U.S. v. Williams-Davis </em>(D.C. Cir. 1996) 319 U.S. App. D.C. 267 [90 F.3d 490, 496] [presumption exists but is \u201cnot . . . particularly forceful\u201d]; <em>U.S. v. Zelinka </em>(6th Cir. 1988) 862 F.2d 92, 95 <em>[\u201cSmith v. Phillips </em>reinterpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Remmer </em>to shift the burden of showing bias to the defendant rather than placing a heavy burden on the government to show that an unauthorized contact was harmless\u201d]; <em>Stockton v. Com. of Va. </em>(4th Cir. 1988) 852 F.2d 740, 744 [presumption still applies to third party communications with jurors].) I see no need to address this question here, because I find the jury misconduct here to be prejudicial by applying the standards enunciated by California decisions applying state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-10\"> Although the Chief Justice\u2019s opinion in <em>Nesler, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 561 reflected the view of only three justices, Justice Baxter\u2019s dissenting opinion (signed by Justices Chin and Brown) did not disagree with this standard; rather, it disagreed with the Chief Justice\u2019s conclusion that application of the standard required reversal of the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 593-599 (dis. opn. of Baxter, J.).)

The pastor\u2019s comments were evidently designed to further put K.A. at ease and make her more comfortable with a decision to impose a capital sentence on defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> The majority states that K.A.\u2019s statement in her declaration, \u201cBut because of the feelings I had, I felt the necessity of talking to my husband,\u201d is excludable under Evidence Code section 1150. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 301-302.) I disagree. The statement explains K.A.\u2019s conduct in talking to a nonjuror and does not delve into the subjective reasoning process of her verdict. Thus, this statement is \u201cadmissible evidence ... as to statements made, or conduct, conditions, or events occurring ... of such a character as is likely to have influenced the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>improperly.\u201d (Evid.

Specifically, Juror E.M. stated in her declaration that during deliberations B.P. stated she had asked her pastor for guidance. Thus, even if B.P. did not relate to other jurors the specifics of that conversation, she apparently did not hesitate to make the jury aware that such a conversation took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">The majority also makes the implausible suggestion that \u201cwe have no idea\u201d when B.P. told K.A. \u201c \u2018she had talked to her pastor and he had referred her to . . . the Book of Numbers.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 309, fn. 13.) Given Juror E.M.\u2019s declaration that during deliberations B.P. told the jurors she had asked her pastor for guidance, and given the fact that the purpose of the jurors\u2019 declarations was to determine whether prejudicial juror misconduct occurred <em>during deliberations, </em>the only reasonable conclusion is that B.P. mentioned her pastor\u2019s conversation to K.A. during deliberations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\"> The majority claims, based on this record, that \u201c[w]e are not given any information as to what this discussion entailed.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 313.) Not so. K.A. declared that she discussed and shared her highlighted copy of biblical passages from the Book of Numbers with undecided jurors; B.P. told jurors during deliberations that she asked her pastor for guidance as to the ultimate decision in this case; and this improper religious discussion was of such magnitude that a fellow juror finally took offense later in the day, stating that \u201cGod does not play a part in this decision.\u201d Simply stated, there is sufficient evidence in the record to determine the content of a portion of the jury\u2019s improper religious discussion.
