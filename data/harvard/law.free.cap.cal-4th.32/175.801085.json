The conviction was based upon (1) evidence that defendant possessed sufficient quantities of red phosphorus and iodine to manufacture hydriodic acid, and (2) the court\u2019s instruction, pursuant to former section 11383, subdivision (f) (section 11383(f); see fn. 17, <em>post), </em>that possession. of red phosphorus and iodine, with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, shall be deemed to be possession of hydriodic acid with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The Court of Appeal reversed the resulting judgment. It stated that the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language of section 11383(f) allowed the prosecution to obtain a conviction under section 11383(c)(2) simply by proving the basic fact of possession of red phosphorus and iodine. Thus, said the court, section 11383(f) created an improper mandatory presumption because it relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving the ultimate fact of possession of hydriodic acid. We granted the Attorney General\u2019s petition for review to determine whether the Court of Appeal correctly characterized section 11383(f). We hold that the language in question creates no presumption at all, but is simply a valid exercise of the Legislature\u2019s power to create substantive law and define crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>I. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">A. <em>Underlying Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">During a search of defendant\u2019s cabin, sheriff\u2019s deputies recovered, among other items, boxes of ephedrine tablets; sinus medication containing pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus, and iodine crystals, as well as the type of equipment used to manufacture methamphetamine. By-products of the ephedrine/hydriodic method of methamphetamine manufacture were found,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but no hydriodic acid was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Defendant was arrested and charged, in count 3, with possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, a violation of sections 11383(c)(2) and 11383(f). Section 11383(c)(2) provides, \u201cAny person who, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine . . . possesses hydriodic acid ... is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two, four, or six years.\u201d Section 11383(f) provided that \u201cpossession of immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of . . . hydriodic acid . . . shall be deemed to be possession of the derivative substance. Additionally, possession of essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, shall be deemed to be possession of hydriodic acid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">B. <em>The Jury Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">At trial, the People\u2019s first expert witness, Kevin Larson, a special agent with the California Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, explained that the ephedrine/hydriodic acid method of methamphetamine manufacture was the prevalent method of manufacture in Northern California. In this method, methamphetamine manufacturers extract pseudoephedrine from cold tablets and add hydriodic acid. He added that hydriodic acid is itself a controlled substance that is difficult to purchase, so manufacturers typically manufacture their own by heating red phosphorus and iodine in water, which causes the iodine to turn into hydriodic acid. The pseudoephedrine and hydriodic acid are then combined to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Barry Miller, a criminalist with the California Department of Justice, added that ephedrine can also be extracted from cold tablets and combined with hydriodic acid to manufacture methamphetamine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified that ephedrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>is the immediate precursor of methamphetamine and that iodine is the immediate precursor of hydriodic acid. He offered the opinion that defendant\u2019s cabin contained a laboratory to manufacture methamphetamine using the ephedrine/hydriodic acid method, and that the cabin also contained a sufficient quantity of pseudoephedrine, red phosphorus, and iodine to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The court instructed the jury that \u201cEvery person who, with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine or . . . hydriodic acid, . . . possesses at the same time . . . red phosphorus and iodine, is guilty of a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11383(c)(1) <em>[sic: </em>(c)(2)], a crime. [f] In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved: [f] A person possessed at the same time . . . red phosphorous and iodine; and [f] That person had the specific intent to manufacture methamphetamine ....[][] And further, for the purpose of this section, possession of immediate precursors . . . sufficient for the manufacture of hydriodic acid with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine, shall be deemed to be in possession of hydriodic acid.\u201d The verdict form reflects that defendant was thereafter convicted of a violation of \u201cSection 11383(c)(2)/11383(f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">C. <em>The Court of Appeal Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Court of Appeal stated that the court\u2019s instructions effectively told the jury that \u201cit must find defendant possessed hydriodic acid if it found she possessed the precursors of hydriodic acid, namely, red phosphorus and iodine.\u201d The Court of Appeal held that the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language of section 11383(f) created the type of mandatory presumption found unconstitutional in <em>Ulster County Court </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1979) 442 U.S. 140 [60 L.Ed.2d 777, 99 S.Ct. 2213] <em>(Ulster County) </em>because the jury was not free to reject the inference of the ultimate fact of possession of hydriodic acid once it found the basic fact of possession of red phosphorus and iodine.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">While the Court of Appeal acknowledged that a mandatory presumption may be constitutional if proof of the basic fact or facts supports the inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it held that such proof was lacking here: \u201cwhile there is a rational basis to conclude that red phosphoms and iodine are the essential chemicals of hydriodic acid, there is no basis to conclude that those two essential chemicals constitute hydriodic acid [because hydriodic acid] is a different substance which does not come into existence until it is synthesized from its essential components under a process of heat.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">A. <em>Presumptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">1. <em>Mandatory and Permissible Rebuttable Presumptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u201c[Presumptions are a staple of our adversary system of factfinding. It is often necessary for the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime\u2014that is, an \u2018ultimate\u2019 or \u2018elemental\u2019 fact\u2014from the existence of one or more \u2018evidentiary\u2019 or \u2018basic\u2019 facts.\u201d <em>(Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 156.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">The term \u201cpresumption\u201d is defined in section 600, subdivision (a) of the Evidence Code: \u201cA presumption is an assumption of [an ultimate or elemental] fact that, the law requires to be made from [an evidentiary or basic] fact or group of [such] facts found or otherwise established in the action. A presumption is not evidence.\u201d Put differently, presumptions \u201care conclusions that the law requires to be drawn (in the absence of a sufficient contrary showing) when some other fact is proved or otherwise established in the action.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Assem. Bill No. 333 (1965 Reg. Sess.) [enacting Evid. Code] reprinted at 29B pt. 2, West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foll. \u00a7 600, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">This statutory definition of a \u201cpresumption\u201d is incomplete, however, because the law also recognizes the permissive presumption, \u201cwhich allows\u2014 <em>but does not </em>require\u2014the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one and which places no burden of any kind on the defendant.\u201d <em>(Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 157, italics added.) Thus, Evidence Code section 600, subdivision (a) defines a <em>mandatory </em>presumption, which \u201ctells the trier that he or they <em>must </em>find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact, at least unless the defendant has come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumed connection between the two facts.\u201d <em>(Ulster County, </em>at p. 157.)</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Evidence Code section 600, subdivision (b) defines the term \u201cinference\u201d and provides: \u201cAn inference is a deduction of fact that may logically and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>reasonably be drawn from another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established in the action.\u201d Like a presumption, \u201can inference is not itself evidence; it is the result of reasoning from evidence.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Assem. Bill No. 333 (1965 Reg. Sess.) [enacting Evid. Code] reprinted at 29B pt. 2, West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 600, p. 4.) There is no substantive difference between the \u201cinference\u201d defined in Evidence Code section 600, subdivision (b) and the \u201cpermissive presumption\u201d defined by the high court in <em>Ulster County.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In addition, the mandatory and permissive presumptions contemplated by Evidence Code section 600 are rebuttable. As provided in Evidence Code section 601, \u201cA presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable. Every [mandatory or permissible] rebuttable presumption is either (a) a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence or (b) a presumption affecting the burden of proof.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In other words, whether the fact finder may find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact (a permissive presumption) or must find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact (a mandatory presumption), the defendant has the opportunity to rebut the presumed connection between the basic and ultimate facts. (See <em>Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 157.) In deciding whether a rebuttable presumption in a criminal case is mandatory or permissive, \u201cthe jury instructions generally will be controlling, although their interpretation may require recourse to the statute involved and the cases decided under it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Because a mandatory rebuttable presumption \u201ctells the trier of fact that he or they <em>must </em>find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact, at least until the defendant has come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumed connection between the two facts,\u201d it is a \u201ctroublesome\u201d evidentiary device in a criminal case since the prosecution bears the burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 157.) The prosecution \u201cmay not rest its case entirely on a [mandatory rebuttable] presumption unless the fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 167.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Roder </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 491 [189 Cal.Rptr. 501, 658 P.2d 1302] <em>(Roder), </em>we construed the mandatory rebuttable presumption contained in Penal Code section 496, which informed the jury that if it found that the defendant was a dealer in secondhand merchandise who bought or received stolen property under circumstances that should have caused him to make a reasonable inquiry of the seller\u2019s legal right to sell the same, it shall presume the defendant bought or received such property knowing it to be stolen, unless from all the evidence it had a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the property was stolen. <em>(Roder, </em>at pp. 495-496.) We stated that this was \u201ca classic example\u201d of a mandatory rebuttable presumption, \u201cfor it \u2018tells the trier [of fact] that he or they <em>must </em>find the elemental fact upon proof of the basic fact, at least unless the defendant has come forward with some evidence to rebut the presumed connection between the.two facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 501, quoting <em>Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at p. 157.) Echoing the high court in <em>Ulster County, </em>we held that a mandatory rebuttable presumption is \u201creconcilable with the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof . . . only if the basic fact proved <em>compels </em>the inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Roder, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 498, fn. <em>7.)</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>2. Conclusive Presumptions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">As noted, Evidence Code section 601 classifies presumptions as \u201ceither conclusive or rebuttable.\u201d Evidence Code section 620 provides that all \u201cpresumptions established by this article and all other presumptions declared by law to be conclusive, are conclusive presumptions.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, Evidence Code section 622 provides that \u201c[t]he facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto . . . but this rule does not apply to the recital of a consideration.\u201d Elections Code section 2026 provides that \u201c[t]he domicile of a Member of the Legislature or a Representative in the Congress of the United States shall be conclusively presumed to be at the residence address indicated on that person\u2019s currently filed affidavit of registration.\u201d In fact, there are over 150 California civil statutes that utilize the term \u201cconclusively presumed\u201d within the statutory definition.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>Unlike mandatory rebuttable presumptions and permissive rebuttable presumptions, the conclusive presumptions contemplated by Evidence Code section 620 are irrebuttable by definition, prompting Witkin to say: \u201c[A] conclusive or indisputable presumption is entirely different from the ordinary rebuttable presumption: [N]o evidence may be received to contradict it. Hence, it is more accurately described as a rule of substantive law rather than of evidence. [Citations.]\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (4th ed. 2000) Burden of Proof and Presumptions, \u00a7 160, p. 301.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">Wigmore took a dim view of the term \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d: \u201cIn strictness there cannot be such a thing as a \u2018conclusive presumption.\u2019 Wherever from one fact another is said to be conclusively presumed, in the sense the opponent is absolutely precluded from showing by any evidence that the second fact does not exist, the rule is really providing that where the first fact is shown to exist, the second fact\u2019s existence is wholly immaterial for the purpose of the proponent\u2019s case; and to provide this is to make a rule of substantive law and not a rule apportioning the burden of persuading as to certain propositions or varying the duty of coming forward with evidence.\u201d (9 Wigmore, Evid. (Chadboum rev. ed. 1981), \u00a7 2492, pp. 307-308, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Our court has adopted the Wigmore view. (See <em>People v. Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 474 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697] <em>(Dillon).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Moreover, our court has repeatedly rejected defendants\u2019 attempts to invoke the term conclusive presumption as a means to challenge the constitutionality of criminal law statutes. For example, in <em>Dillon, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 441, a case decided after <em>Ulster County, </em>the defendant argued the felony-murder rule created an unconstitutional \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d by relieving the People of its burden to prove malice upon proof of the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the underlying felony. <em>(Dillon, </em>at p. 472.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We disagreed and stated: \u201cWe are led astray if we treat the \u2018conclusive presumption of malice\u2019 as a true [rebuttable] presumption; to do so begs the question whether malice is an element of felony murder. And to answer that question, we must look beyond labels to the underlying reality of this so-called \u2018presumption.\u2019 [f] Although the drafters of the Evidence Code chose to perpetuate the traditional distinction between rebuttable and \u2018conclusive\u2019 presumptions <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 601, 620), they apparently did so in order to emphasize that the code provisions on the topic were largely continuations of prior law. But they were not misled by their own terminology: in their accompanying note the drafters frankly acknowledged that \u2018Conclusive presumptions are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>evidentiary rules so much as they are rules of substantive law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dillon, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 474.) We concluded: \u201c \u2018Attempts to explain the [felony-murder] statute to the jury in terms of nonexistent \u201cconclusive presumptions\u201d tend more to confuse than to enlighten a jury unfamiliar with the inaccurate practice of stating rules of substantive law in terms of rules of evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 475.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Despite the fact that we have maintained that a statute that employs the phrase \u201cshall be conclusively presumed\u201d is simply stating a rule of substantive law (see <em>Dillon, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 474), there is much confusion regarding the term \u201cconclusive presumption\u201d because it has been incorrectly utilized to describe mandatory rebuttable presumptions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">For example, in <em>Carella </em>v. <em>California </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 263 [105 L.Ed.2d 218, 109 S.Ct. 2419] <em>(per curiam) (Carella), </em>the high court found unconstitutional two California mandatory rebuttable presumptions: (1) the Vehicle Code section 10855 presumption that a person who intentionally fails to return a rented vehicle within five days after the rental agreement expires \u201cshall be presumed to have embezzled the vehicle\u201d; and (2) the Penal Code section 484, subdivision (b) presumption that \u201c[i]ntent to commit fraud is presumed\u201d if a person fails to return, within 20 days after a written demand, personal property rented pursuant to a written contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The <em>Carella </em>trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, because they contained no rebutting language, erroneously implied that these presumptions were conclusive as to the defendant. Perhaps for this reason, Justice Scalia\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Carella </em>refers to the two presumptions as \u201cmandatory conclusive presumptions\u201d <em>(Carella, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 268) and as \u201cconclusive presumptionfs]\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 269). But under California law, these two mandatory presumptions are actually rebuttable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While Justice Scalia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>characterization is correct insofar as the presumptions were <em>understood </em>by the jury, i.e., conclusive in that particular trial, his characterization has created confusion in subsequent cases<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> because a mandatory rebuttable presumption that, due to instructional error, is presumed by the jury to be conclusive in a particular trial is analytically distinct from an Evidence Code section 620 conclusive presumption\u2014the former is unconstitutional under <em>Ulster County </em>as an improper mandatory presumption,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the latter simply describes a legislative enactment of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">B. <em>The Proper Characterization of Section 11383(f)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">It is against this backdrop that we analyze defendant\u2019s contentions on appeal. Defendant argues that, while the possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine is a crime under section 11383(c)(2), the possession of the essential chemicals of hydriodic acid (red phosphorus and iodine) with intent to manufacture methamphetamine is not a crime under section 11383(c)(2). Therefore, insofar as section 11383(f) deemed the possession of red phosphorus and iodine to be the possession of hydriodic acid, it mandatorily presumed an element of the crime (possession of hydriodic acid) from a noncriminal act (possession of red phosphorus and iodine), and impermissibly lessened the prosecutor\u2019s burden of proving all the elements of section 11383(c)(2). Defendant suggests that the only way to avoid this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>constitutional infirmity is for the Legislature to enact the separate substantive crime of possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We disagree. Section 11383(f), contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, was not phrased in the manner of a mandatory rebuttable presumption: there was no ultimate fact to be presumed from one or more basic facts. Instead, the statute provided that the possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine <em>shall be deemed </em>to be possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. The phrase \u201cshall be deemed,\u201d as utilized in section 11383(f), simply created a rule of substantive law; to wit, the possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine was the <em>legal equivalent </em>of possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Like the term \u201cshall be conclusively presumed,\u201d the term \u201cshall be deemed\u201d simply created substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">As the Fifth Circuit stated in <em>City of New Port Richey v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md. </em>(5th Cir. 1939) 105 F.2d 348, 351: \u201cWe recognize that the legislature cannot make certain [ultimate] facts conclusive proof of another ultimate fact when there is no logical connection or probability in experience to connect them. But the real legislative intent may not be to make a rule of evidence, but a rule of substantive law, and if the legislature may constitutionally do the latter, the form of words used will not defeat the intent. Statutes often say that certain acts \u2018shall be deemed,\u2019 or \u2018shall be held to be,\u2019 or \u2018shall be conclusively presumed to be\u2019 something else which is enjoined or forbidden, when the real purpose and effect is to enjoin or forbid those acts, and not to stultify the courts into really \u2018deeming\u2019 or \u2018presuming\u2019 one thing to be another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Indeed, the definitional phrase \u201cshall be deemed\u201d is a legislative staple that appears in thousands of California statutes. In the Penal Code alone, the phrase \u201cshall be deemed\u201d appears in over 125 provisions, and is often used, as in section 11383(f), to define one thing in terms of another. For example, Penal Code section 12001, subdivision (j), provides that \u201cFor purposes of [Penal Code] Section 12023 [\u201cEvery person who carries a loaded firearm with the intent to commit a felony is guilty of armed criminal action\u201d], a firearm shall be deemed to be \u2018loaded\u2019 whenever both the firearm and the unexpended ammunition capable of being discharged from the firearm are in the immediate possession of the same person.\u201d In essence, the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language of Penal Code section 12001, subdivision (j) expands the definition of \u201cloaded\u201d for purposes of Penal Code section 12023.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Penal Code section 627.1 provides that \u201cas used in this chapter\u201d (Access to School Premises), an \u201coutsider\u201d is any person other than a student of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>school, \u201cexcept that a student who is currently suspended from school shall be deemed an outsider.\u201d The \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language here expands the definition of \u201coutsider\u201d to encompass suspended students.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Section 11054, subdivision (a) provides: \u201cThe controlled substances listed in this section are included in Schedule I.\u201d Methaqualone is <em>not </em>one of the substances listed. Section 11150.6 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding . . . subdivision (a) of Section 11054, methaqualone, its . . . isomers, and salts of its isomers shall be deemed to be classified in Schedule I for the purposes of this chapter.\u201d The \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language in this instance expands the list of substances included in Schedule I to include methaqualone.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Here, section 11383(f) provided that <em>\u201cFor purposes of this </em>section,\u201d the \u201cpossession of essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, <em>shall be deemed </em>to be possession of hydriodic acid.\u201d (Italics added.) The \u201cFor purposes of this section\u201d language of section 11383(f) referred to section 11383(c)(2), which criminalizes the possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. Section 11383(f), therefore, simply expanded the scope of section 11383(c)(2) to prohibit possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">As such, section 11383(f) contained no presumption at all. Instead, section 11383(f) was nothing more than a definitional section that specified the conduct \u201cdeemed\u201d criminal \u201c[f]or purposes of\u2019 section 11383(c)(2). Section 11383(f) told us that \u201cpossession of hydriodic acid,\u201d the conduct made criminal by section 11383(c)(2), did not, for purposes of that subdivision, merely carry its lay meaning, but was a term of art that <em>included </em>the possession of hydriodic acid\u2019s essential chemicals. Substantive due process allows lawmakers broad power to select the elements of crimes, and to define one thing in terms of another. (See <em>Reno v. Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 292, 305 [123 L.Ed.2d 1, 113 S.Ct. 1439] [due process requires \u201cno more than a \u2018reasonable fit\u2019\u201d between legislative ends and means]; <em>Tracy v. Municipal Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 760, 765 [150 Cal.Rptr. 785, 587 P.2d 227] Legislature has broad power to define crimes.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The legislative history of section 11383(f) supports the view that the Legislature intended to criminalize the possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>In 1972, the Legislature enacted the California Uniform Controlled Substances Act (the Act). (Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3, p. 2987 et seq.) Section 11383, as added by the Act, provided that \u201c[a]ny person who possesses both methylamine and phenyl-2-propanone (phenylacetone) at the same time with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine is guilty of a felony . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1972, ch. 1407, \u00a7 3, p. 3024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In 1977, section 11383 was redesignated as section 11383, subdivision (a). Its substantive language remained unchanged. Section 11383, subdivision (c), the predecessor of section 11383(f), was enacted. It provided: \u201cFor purposes of this section, possession of the immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of methylamine and phenyl-2-propanone (phenylacetone) . . . shall be deemed to be possession of such derivative substance.\u201d (Stats. 1977, ch. 165, \u00a7 3.6, p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In 1995, section 11383 was expanded to its form at the time of the current offense. (Stats. 1995, ch. 571, \u00a7 1, p. 4418.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Section 11383, subdivision (c) was redesignated as subdivision (c)(1), and section 11383(c)(2) was added. The following language was added to section 11383(f), which had provided that \u201cpossession of immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of . . . hydriodic acid . . . shall be deemed to be possession of the derivative substance\u201d: \u201cAdditionally, possession of the essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, shall be deemed to be possession of hydriodic acid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting section 11383(c)(2) and amending section 11383(f) was clearly stated in a report of the Assembly Committee on Public Safety: \u201cHydriodic Acid (HI) was a substance sought after by operators of illegal melhamphetamine labs and has been the main reducing agent. Legislation in 1993 added HI as a controlled substance. The criminals have found a loophole with an HI substitute by purchasing large amounts of iodine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>and iodine crystals. <em>This bill would close that loophole by making it a felony to possess such substitutes with intent to manufacture </em>methamphetamine.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 419 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 28, 1995, p. 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The manner of closing this loophole was also described in the report of the Senate Committee on Criminal Procedure: \u201cThis provision would make possession of iodine, for instance, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine, <em>as culpable as possession of the finished </em>product.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Criminal Procedure, Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 419 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 21, 1995, p. 6, italics added.) The report also stated: \u201cThis bill would provide that possession of any essential chemicals . . . sufficient to manufacture . . . methamphetamine are deemed to be possession of the precursor itself. Thus, possession of iodine, which is used to make hydriodic acid, <em>would be legally equivalent </em>to possession of hydriodic acid.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">HI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The Legislature, by extending the prohibition on possessing hydriodic acid to include its essential chemicals, clearly intended to criminalize the possession of red phosphorus and iodine where these two chemicals are found in sufficient quantity to manufacture hydriodic acid and are possessed with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that section 11383(f) creates an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption. Instead, the \u201cshall be deemed\u201d language of section 11383(f) simply expands the section 11383(c)(2) definition of hydriodic acid to encompass its essential chemicals and thus defines, in precise terms, the substantive crime of possession of the essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid, in this case, red phosphorus and iodine, with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>IV.

Thus, Criminalist Barry Miller testified that ephedrine is the immediate precursor of methamphetamine and that hydriodic acid is not a precursor of methamphetamine, but is the essential chemical that enables ephedrine to transform into methamphetamine. He also testified that red phosphorus and iodine are not precursors of methamphetamine. He stated that iodine, however, is a precursor of hydriodic acid because in making hydriodic acid from red phosphorus and iodine, the red phosphorus is not itself converted in any way, but instead is the essential chemical that enables the iodine to transform into hydriodic acid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> See <em>Ulster County, supra, </em>442 U.S. at page 157: \u201cThe most common evidentiary device is the entirely <em>permissive inference or presumption, </em>which allows\u2014but does not require\u2014the trier of fact to infer the elemental fact from proof by the prosecutor of the basic one . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)
