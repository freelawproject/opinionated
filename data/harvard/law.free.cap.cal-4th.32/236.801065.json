(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) The issue here is whether retrial of a strike allegation is permissible where a trier of fact finds the allegation to be true, but an appellate court reverses that finding for insufficient evidence. Defendant Antonio J. Barragan argues that retrial is barred by the constitutional requirement of fundamental fairness, equitable principles of res judicata and law of the case, and relevant statutory provisions. We conclude that retrial is permissible. We reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment insofar as it bars retrial of a strike allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">An information charged defendant with several crimes, including being a felon in possession of a firearm, and alleged that he had one prior strike: a juvenile adjudication on June 8, 1995, for assault with a deadly weapon and with personal infliction of great bodily injury. To prove the alleged prior juvenile adjudication, the prosecution introduced into evidence copies of the juvenile court petition alleging the assault, and a minute order showing the juvenile court\u2019s finding that defendant committed the assault. While testifying at trial, defendant admitted that he had sustained a \u201ctrue finding\u201d in juvenile court in 1995 for striking someone with a baseball bat. During closing argument, defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201c[Defendant] has been very candid . . . about [his] priors. You\u2019ve heard about them. There\u2019s not an issue. . . . [Defendant] has been very candid . . . about his testimony and his prior convictions as an adult and the true finding as a juvenile.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury that if it found defendant guilty, then it had to \u201cdetermine whether the allegation of the prior \u2018serious felony\u2019 conviction is true.\u201d The court also instructed the jury that \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d assault with a deadly weapon and with infliction of great bodily injury \u201cis a \u2018serious felony\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>offense\u201d under the Three Strikes law, and that \u201ca \u2018conviction\u2019 occurs by a \u2018true finding\u2019 in Juvenile Court after trial, or upon an admission by the accused without trial.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm, found him not guilty of the remaining charges, and found true \u201cthe allegation that [he] . . . suffered a true finding of a serious felony offense in Juvenile Court, within the meaning of [the Three Strikes law], to wit: on or about June 8, 1995, . . . defendant was convicted of Assault with a Deadly Weapon With Personal Infliction of Great Bodily Injury . . . .\u201d The trial court imposed a four-year prison term, which it calculated by taking the two-year middle term ordinarily applicable to a \u201cfelon in possession\u201d conviction and doubling it under the Three Strikes law for defendant\u2019s prior strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The Court of Appeal affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction, but found insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s true finding on the strike allegation. Regarding the latter issue, the court first reasoned that in order to prove the strike allegation, the prosecution had to prove that defendant\u2019s prior juvenile court adjudication \u201cresulted in a declaration of wardship.\u201d The court then found that the prosecution failed to meet this burden, explaining: \u201cThe prosecution did no more than prove that true findings were made on the petition and the matter was set for a dispositional hearing. While it is possible to speculate that the true finding on the petition resulted in a declaration of wardship, we conclude on this record it is not possible to so infer. The evidence supporting the finding of a strike based on [defendant\u2019s] prior juvenile adjudication was insufficient.\u201d Turning to remedy, the court noted a split of authority regarding whether retrial of a strike allegation is permissible after a reversal for insufficient evidence. \u201c[S]tand[ing] by\u201d its prior decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 132 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 401] <em>(Mitchell), </em>the court held that retrial is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Defendant filed a petition for review, challenging the affirmance of his conviction. The People also filed a petition for review, challenging only the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that retrial of the strike allegation is impermissible. We granted the People\u2019s petition and denied defendant\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">As the Court of Appeal noted, California appellate courts have disagreed on whether retrial of a strike allegation is proper after an appellate court reverses a true finding for insufficient evidence. <em>Mitchell, </em>which was decided by the same appellate court that decided the case now before us, held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>retrial is impermissible \u201cwhere the government has had a full and fair opportunity to present its case unhampered by evidentiary error or other impediment . . . .\u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 136.) Courts of Appeal that have subsequently considered the issue have consistently rejected <em>Mitchell </em>and held that retrial of an alleged prior conviction is both permissible and proper. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Sotello </em>(2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1349 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 118]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Franz </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1426 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 773]; <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 1296 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 131]; <em>People v. Scott </em>(2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 905 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 622].)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In resolving this conflict, we begin with a related principle that the United States Supreme Court has recently established: in the noncapital sentencing context, retrial of a prior conviction allegation does not violate the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution. <em>(Monge </em>v. <em>California </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 721, 734 [141 L.Ed.2d 615, 118 S.Ct. 2246] <em>(Monge II).) </em>In reaching this conclusion, the high court acknowledged that a finding on appeal that the evidence at trial was insufficient to sustain a \u201cconviction\u201d on a substantive offense \u201cis comparable to an acquittal, and the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes a second trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 729.) However, the court explained, \u201c[w]here a similar failure of proof occurs in a sentencing proceeding, ... the analogy is inapt.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[T]he determinations at issue [in noncapital sentencing proceedings] do not place a defendant in jeopardy for an \u2018offense,\u2019 [citation].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 728.) \u201cAn enhanced sentence imposed on a persistent offender\u201d does not constitute \u201c \u2018either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes\u2019 but [is simply] \u2018a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe pronouncement of sentence simply does not \u2018have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 729.) Thus, a \u201c[sentencing decision[] favorable to the defendant . . . cannot generally be analogized to an acquittal.\u201d <em>(Ibid) </em>This rule applies even in states that, as \u201ca matter of legislative grace,\u201d have enacted \u201cprocedural safeguards to protect defendants who may face dramatic increases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The high court\u2019s decision in <em>Monge II </em>reviewed and affirmed our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] <em>(Monge I), </em>which held that retrial of a prior conviction allegation does not violate the double jeopardy protections of either the federal Constitution or the California Constitution. Like the high court, the lead opinion in <em>Monge I </em>rejected the analogy between a \u201cfailure of proof\u2019 on a prior conviction allegation and \u201can acquittal at the guilt phase of a criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).) The lead opinion reasoned that a trial of such an allegation \u201cis simple and straightforward as compared to the guilt phase of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>a criminal trial,\u201d and \u201c[o]ften . . . involves only the presentation of a certified copy of the prior conviction along with the defendant\u2019s photograph and fingerprints. In many cases, defendants offer no evidence at all, and the outcome is relatively predictable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 838.) Moreover, such a trial \u201cis merely a determination, for purposes of punishment, of the defendant\u2019s <em>status, </em>which, like age or gender, is readily determinable from the public record.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cLike a trial in which the defendant\u2019s age or gender is at issue, the prior conviction trial merely determines a question of the defendant\u2019s continuing status, irrespective of the present offense, and the prosecution may reallege and retry that status in as many successive cases as it is relevant [citations], even if a prior jury has rejected the allegation [citation]. If a jury rejects the allegation, it has not acquitted the defendant of his prior conviction status. [Citation.] \u2018A defendant cannot be \u201cacquitted\u201d of that status any more than he can be \u201cacquitted\u201d of being a certain age or sex or any other inherent fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 839.)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Foreshadowing defendant\u2019s contentions here, the lead opinion in <em>Monge I </em>noted that the inapplicability of double jeopardy protections \u201craises numerous secondary issues. For example, [a] Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the evidence [at trial] was insufficient to prove [a] defendant\u2019s prior conviction was of a serious felony is, at the very least, the law of th[e] case. Thus, the prosecution would have to present additional evidence at a retrial of the prior conviction allegation in order to obtain a different result. What limitations might apply to this additional evidence ... we do not decide, because the Court of Appeal did not address that issue. For the same reason, we express no opinion about whether [Penal Code] section 1025[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] (or some other applicable provision) might in some cases bar retrial of the prior conviction allegation as a statutory matter irrespective of constitutional constraints. Finally, we express no opinion about whether due process protections preclude the prosecution from retrying the prior conviction allegation.\u201d <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 845 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Before addressing defendant\u2019s contentions, we also note that 50 years ago, in <em>People v. Morton </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 536, 541 [261 P.2d 523] <em>(Morton), </em>we considered \u201cthe order that should ... be made\u201d by an appellate court if it concludes that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support a finding that a defendant sustained an alleged prior conviction. In <em>Morton, </em>the trial court had found that the defendant was \u201can habitual criminal\u201d under former section 644 based on two prior convictions for felonies listed in that section. <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at p. 538.) On review, we found insufficient evidence to support the finding because, as to one of the prior convictions, the evidence at trial failed to show the nature of the offense and, thus, that it was one of the listed offenses. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 540-541.) We next explained that, in similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>circumstances, \u201cconflicting\u201d precedents offered the following remedial options; (1) \u201creversing] the entire judgment and remand[ing] the cause for a new trial on all issues, including the charge of the primary offenses\u201d; (2) \u201csetting] aside the finding that the defendant suffered the challenged prior conviction\u201d and either \u201cmodifying]\u201d the judgment \u201cby vacating\u201d the habitual-criminal finding or \u201cremand[ing] for resentencing on the basis of the primary offenses . . . and any unchallenged prior convictions\u201d; and (3) \u201csetting] aside the finding that the defendant suffered the challenged prior conviction\u201d and \u201cremandfing] ... for a new trial on the issue of the challenged prior conviction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 541-542.) We held that where \u201cthe defects in the proof of the prior convictions [are] capable of correction on a retrial,\u201d the \u201cproper\u201d procedure is the last option, i.e., setting the finding aside and remanding for a new trial only on the challenged prior conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 544.) \u201cThis procedure,\u201d we explained, \u201ccarries out the policy of the statutes imposing \u2018more severe punishment, proportionate to their persistence in crime, of those who have proved immune to lesser punishment\u2019 [citation], and prevents defendants from escaping the penalties imposed by those statutes through technical defects in . . . proof. It affords the defendant a fair hearing on the charge, and if it cannot be proved he will not have to suffer the more severe punishment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 544-545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Although cognizant of <em>Morton's </em>holding, we agree with defendant that <em>Morton </em>is not dispositive. Defendant correctly notes that <em>Morton </em>\u201cdid not address whether retrial of the prior conviction was barred by the doctrines of collateral estoppel, res judicata, law of the case, or fundamental fairness.\u201d Nor did any of the cases <em>Morton </em>discussed. \u201c[C]ases are not authority for propositions not considered. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alvarez </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1161, 1176 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 46 P.3d 372].) With this background in mind, we now turn to defendant\u2019s specific contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">I. FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Defendant argues that \u201c[t]he doctrine of fundamental fairness, as incorporated in the due process clause of the federal and state Constitutions, suggests that it is unfair to give the prosecution a second opportunity to prove an allegation [where] it failed to carry its burden of proof during the first trial.\u201d He asserts that a state may not regulate its own judicial procedures in a manner that \u201c \u2018offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d He also asserts that \u201c[t]he due process clause may be invoked \u2018to insure that [a] state created right is not arbitrarily abrogated.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d According to defendant, California accords him a \u201cstatutory right to a trial on the truth of\u2019 his alleged prior conviction, and allowing a \u201cretrial of the truth of that allegation after an appellate court reversal for insufficient evidence would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>abrogate [his] right to be discharged from the penalties associated with a not true finding to that allegation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In considering defendant\u2019s due process argument, we find instructive the high court\u2019s rejection of a similar argument in <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1990) 493 U.S. 342 [107 L.Ed.2d 708, 110 S.Ct. 668] <em>(Dowling). </em>There, the defendant argued that both the double jeopardy and due process clauses of the United States Constitution barred the prosecution from introducing at his criminal trial evidence of his alleged commission of another crime of which he had previously been acquitted. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 343-344.) The high court first held that the double jeopardy clause did not bar admission of the evidence, because \u201cthe prior acquittal did not determine an ultimate issue in the [subsequent] case\u201d and the evidence\u2019s admissibility in the subsequent prosecution was \u201cgoverned by a lower standard of proof\u2019 than the standard that governed during the prior proceeding. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 349.) The court next held that admission of the evidence did not \u201cfail[] the due process test of \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 \u201d or \u201cviolate[] \u2018fundamental conceptions of justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 352.) Regarding this issue, the defendant argued in part that admission of the evidence \u201ccontravene[d] a tradition that the government may not force a person acquitted in one trial to defend against the same accusation in a subsequent proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 354.) The court replied: \u201cWe acknowledge the tradition, but find it amply protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause. We decline to use the Due Process Clause as a device for extending the double jeopardy protection to cases where it otherwise would not extend.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s due process argument because it essentially asks us to do what the high court in <em>Dowling </em>said we could not do: \u201cuse the Due Process Clause as a device for extending the double jeopardy protection to cases where it otherwise would not extend.\u201d <em>(Dowling, supra, </em>493 U.S. at p. 354.) Defendant, who cannot, after <em>Monge I </em>and <em>Monge II, </em>invoke the protection of the double jeopardy clause to bar retrial, invites us to achieve the same end via the due process clause. We decline his invitation because, as the high court told us in <em>Dowling: </em>\u201cBeyond the specific guarantees enumerated in the Bill of Rights, the Due Process Clause has limited operation. . . . \u2018Judges are not free, in defining \u201cdue process,\u201d to impose on law enforcement officials [their] \u201cpersonal and private notions\u201d of fairness and to \u201cdisregard the limits that bind judges in their judicial function.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 352-353.)</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Our rejection of defendant\u2019s due process argument is also consistent with the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Caspari </em>v. <em>Bohlen </em>(1994) 510 U.S. 383 [127 L.Ed.2d 236, 114 S.Ct. 948] <em>(Caspari). </em>There, a lower court granted a habeas corpus petition after ruling that where trial-like procedures apply in determining persistent oflender status, the federal double jeopardy clause prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>retrial after an appellate court reverses such a determination for insufficient evidence. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 386-388.) The high court held that the habeas corpus petition should not have been granted, because the lower court\u2019s conclusion constituted \u201ca new rule\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 395) and a court generally may not grant habeas corpus relief \u201cbased on a rule announced after [the defendant\u2019s] conviction and sentence became final. [Citation.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Caspari, supra, </em>at p. 389.) In reaching this conclusion, the high court rejected the argument that the defendant was entitled to relief because the new rule constituted a \u201c \u2018 \u201cwatershed rule[] of criminal procedure\u201d <em>implicating the fundamental fairness </em>and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 396, italics added.) The high court found that \u201c[a]pplying the Double Jeopardy Clause to successive noncapital sentencing is not such a groundbreaking occurrence. Persistent-offender status is a fact objectively ascertainable on the basis of readily available evidence. Either a defendant has the requisite number of prior convictions, or he does not. <em>Subjecting him to a second proceeding at which the State has the opportunity to show those convictions is not unfair </em>and will enhance the accuracy of the proceeding by ensuring that the determination is made on the basis of competent evidence.\u201d (Ibid., italics added.) <em>Caspari </em>lends additional support to our conclusion that permitting retrial under the circumstances now before us does not violate defendant\u2019s due process right to fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The high court\u2019s discussion in <em>Caspari </em>mirrors our earlier discussion in <em>Morton. </em>As previously noted, there, in holding that retrial is \u201cproper\u201d where \u201cthe defects in the proof of the prior convictions [are] capable of correction on a retrial,\u201d we explained: \u201cThis procedure . . . carries out the policy of the statutes imposing \u2018more severe punishment, proportionate to their persistence in crime, of those who have proved immune to lesser punishment\u2019 [citation], and prevents defendants from escaping the penalties imposed by those statutes through technical defects in . . . proof. It affords the defendant a fair hearing on the charge, and if it cannot be proved he will not have to suffer the more severe punishment.\u201d <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544-545.) In light of <em>Dowling, Caspari, </em>and <em>Morton, </em>we reject defendant\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">II. THE LAW OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">As previously noted, in <em>Monge I, </em>after concluding that double jeopardy protections did not bar retrial of a prior conviction allegation, the lead opinion noted: \u201cOf course, this conclusion raises numerous secondary issues. For example, the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the evidence [at trial] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>was insufficient to prove [the] defendant\u2019s prior conviction was of a serious felony is, at the very least, the law of this case. Thus, the prosecution would have to present additional evidence at a retrial of the prior conviction allegation in order to obtain a different result.\u201d <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal. 4th at p. 845 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).) Defendant argues that \u201cretrial should be barred under the doctrine of the law of the case unless the prosecution can establish that it has discovered new evidence which could not have been presented at the first trial through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Under the law of the case doctrine, when an appellate court \u201c \u2018states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout [the case\u2019s] subsequent progress, both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Kowis v. Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888, 893 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250].) Absent an applicable exception, the doctrine \u201crequires] both trial and appellate courts to follow the rules laid down upon a former appeal whether such rules are right or wrong.\u201d <em>(Estate of Baird </em>(1924) 193 Cal. 225, 234 [223 R 974].) As its name suggests, the doctrine applies only to an appellate court\u2019s decision on a question of law; it does not apply to questions of fact. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 234-239.) Nevertheless, it is potentially relevant here because an appellate court\u2019s determination \u201cthat the evidence is insufficient to justify a finding or a judgment is necessarily a decision upon a question of law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238.) Such a determination \u201cestablished] as the law of the case that all the evidence adduced at the previous trial was insufficient as a matter of law to establish\u201d the finding or judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 234; see also <em>People v. Shuey </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 835, 842 [120 Cal.Rptr. 83, 533 P.2d 211] [doctrine applies to finding of evidence\u2019s \u201clegal sufficiency\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">As here relevant, the law of the case doctrine is subject to an important limitation: it \u201capplie[s] only to <em>the principles of law </em>laid down by the court as applicable to a retrial of fact,\u201d and \u201cdoes not embrace the facts themselves ____\u201d <em>(Moore v. Trott </em>(1912) 162 Cal. 268, 273 [122 P. 462], italics added.) In other words, although an appellate court\u2019s legal determination constitutes the law of the case, \u201cupon a retrial . . . that law must be applied by the trial court to the evidence presented upon the second trial.\u201d <em>(Erlin v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 547, 549 [61 P.2d 756] <em>(Erlin).) </em>Thus, during subsequent proceedings in the same case, an appellate court\u2019s binding legal determination \u201ccontrols the outcome only if the evidence on retrial or rehearing of an issue is substantially the same as that upon which the appellate ruling was based. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Mattson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 826, 850 [268 Cal.Rptr. 802, 789 P.2d 983] <em>(Mattson).) </em>Where, on remand, \u201cthere is a substantial difference in the evidence to which the [announced] principle of law is applied, ... the [doctrine] may not be invoked.\u201d <em>(Hoffman v.

Even where the appellate court reverses based on \u201cthe \u2018sufficiency of the evidence\u2019, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>the rale of the law of the case may not be extended to be an estoppel when new material facts, or evidence, or explanation of previous evidence appears in the subsequent trial. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Weaver v. Shell Company </em>(1939) 34 Cal.App.2d 713, 717 [94 P.2d 364].) These well-established principles explain the lead opinion\u2019s statement in <em>Monge I </em>that, under the law of the case doctrine, \u201cthe prosecution would have to present additional evidence at a retrial of the prior conviction allegation in order to\u201d overcome the appellate court\u2019s determination that the evidence at the first trial was legally insufficient to prove the allegation. <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 845 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Our decisions make clear that, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, nothing in the law of the case doctrine itself limits the additional evidence that a party may introduce on retrial to that which \u201ccould not have been presented at the first trial through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d Perhaps the most relevant case in this regard is <em>Mattson. </em>During a prior appeal in that matter, we reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions after concluding from \u201cthe record of the first trial\u201d that police had illegally obtained his confessions and that the trial court had erred in' denying his suppression motion. <em>(Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 848.) During retrial, which again resulted in conviction, the trial court allowed the prosecution \u201cto relitigate' the admissibility of the confessions\u201d and to \u201cintroduce[] evidence\u201d on the issue that \u201chad not been presented at the first trial . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 849.) On review after retrial, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that various principles, including the law of the case, \u201cpreclude[d] relitigation\u201d of the issue \u201cbased on facts that [were] inconsistent and irreconcilable with facts established in the initial [suppression] hearing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling in <em>Mattson, </em>we first found the defendant\u2019s attempt to limit the evidence on retrial to be contrary to statute. We explained: \u201cA reversal of a judgment without directions is an order for a new trial. (\u00a7 1262.) \u2018An unqualified reversal remands the cause for new trial and places the parties in the trial court in the same position as if the cause had never been tried.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had. ...\u2019(\u00a7 1180.) [][] That status even permits amendment of the accusatory pleading [citation], as well as renewal and reconsideration of pretrial motions and objections to the admission of evidence. [Citation.] Absent a statutory provision precluding relitigation, a stipulation by the parties, or an order by the court that prior rulings made in the prior trial will be binding at the new trial, objections must be made to the admission of evidence (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353), and the court must consider the admissibility of that evidence at the time it is offered. [Citations.]\u201d (Mat<em>tson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 849-850, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>In <em>Mattson, </em>we next rejected the defendant\u2019s reliance on the law of the case doctrine, explaining: \u201cThe law-of-the-case doctrine binds the trial court as to the law but controls the outcome <em>only if the evidence on retrial or rehearing of an issue is substantially the same as that upon which the appellate ruling was based. </em>[Citations.] The law-of-the-case doctrine applied to this court\u2019s prior ruling only insofar as we held that California law governed the admissibility of the confessions. The trial court did not depart from that ruling in its determination, <em>based on new evidence, </em>that the confessions were admissible.\u201d <em>(Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 850, italics added.) \u201cSince there was no [statutory or constitutional] bar to a new hearing on the admissibility of the confessions, <em>and additional evidence on the question of who initiated the interviews was heard, </em>the law-of-the-case doctrine did not compel the trial court to exclude [the] defendant\u2019s confessions. Except where insufficiency of the evidence to sustain <em>a judgment of conviction </em>was the basis for reversal, in which case <em>double jeopardy considerations </em>preclude relitigation [citations], the law-of-the-case doctrine <em>is inapplicable </em>to the determination of questions of fact [citation] decided on the basis of <em>new or different evidence in a new trial following reversal on appeal. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 852-853, fn. omitted, italics added.) Notably, in rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, we did not condition the prosecution\u2019s right to introduce \u201cnew or different evidence\u201d at retrial <em>(id. </em>at p. 853) on a showing that the evidence could not have been presented at the first trial through the exercise of due diligence. Thus, <em>Mattson </em>establishes that nothing in the law of the case doctrine itself imposes this limitation on the introduction of new evidence; any such limitation must come from some other statutory, constitutional, or equitable source.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In this regard, <em>Mattson </em>is consistent with a long line of California decisions. For example, in <em>Chandler v. People\u2019s Sav. Bank </em>(1884) 65 Cal. 498, 499-500 [4 P. 502], we held that after an appellate reversal of a judgment for the plaintiff for insufficient evidence and a remand for further proceedings according to the views stated in the appellate opinion, the plaintiff \u201cwas at liberty in a new trial\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 499) to introduce additional evidence on the unproven issue, and the trial court had erred in precluding introduction of additional evidence at trial. In <em>Mitchell v. Davis </em>(1863) 23 Cal. 381, 383-384, we held that an appellate court\u2019s finding of insufficient evidence is law of the case but \u201cdoes not operate as a bar or estoppel upon the plaintiff from showing the true facts of the case,\u201d and that after a remand for a new trial, \u201cthe plaintiff had a clear right to introduce any evidence relevant to the issues to be tried.\u201d Finally, in <em>Weightman v. Hadley </em>(1956) 138 Cal.App.2d 831 [292 P.2d 909], the court held that at a retrial after an unqualified appellate reversal for insufficient evidence, the plaintiff had \u201cthe right to introduce . . . any additional and new evidence\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 840) on issues as to which proof at the first trial was insufficient, and that because the law of the case doctrine \u201cdoes not apply to new and additional evidence,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>\u201cthere can be no application of the doctrine until the facts have been elicited on a retrial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 841.) Like <em>Mattson, </em>these decisions demonstrate that nothing in the law of the case doctrine itself limits a party\u2019s ability to introduce additional evidence at retrial after a reversal for insufficient evidence. (See also <em>Erlin, supra, </em>7 Cal.2d at p. 549 [after \u201cunqualified\u201d appellate reversal of judgment for plaintiff for insufficient evidence, law of the case established by the appellate court must \u201cbe applied ... to the evidence presented upon the second trial,\u201d and plaintiff is \u201centitled\u201d at a second trial \u201cto . . . the opportunity to present evidence in support of\u2019 his allegations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In arguing for a \u201cdue diligence\u201d standard, defendant relies on statutes governing motions for new trial, for reconsideration, and for relief from default. He notes that under section 1181, subdivision 8, a criminal defendant cannot obtain a new trial based on \u201cnew evidence\u201d without showing that \u201che could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced\u201d the evidence \u201cat trial.\u201d He notes that a civil litigant relying on new evidence must make a similar showing to obtain either a new trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 657, subdivision 4, or reconsideration under Code of Civil Procedure section 1008, as the latter provision has been judicially construed. (See <em>Blue Mountain Development Co. v. Carville </em>(1982) 132 Cal.App.3d 1005, 1013 [183 Cal.Rptr. 594].) He also asserts that \u201cignorance of the law\u201d does not establish \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d for purposes of obtaining relief from judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 473. He argues that we should extend the rule of these statutes to the factual context now before us, and hold that retrial after an appellate reversal for insufficient evidence is \u201cbarred under the doctrine of the law of the case unless the prosecution can establish that it has discovered new evidence which could not have been presented at the first trial through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument as being inconsistent with the separate scheme that has long governed retrials after appellate reversals for insufficient evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As previously noted, section 1262 provides that a reversal of a judgment against the defendant \u201cshall be deemed an order for a new trial, unless the appellate court shall otherwise direct.\u201d As we explained over 80 years ago, an appellate court\u2019s power to direct otherwise\u2014i.e., to direct a trial court to enter judgment on an issue in the appellant\u2019s favor\u2014\u201cshould be exercised only when, upon a full consideration of the record, the party against whom the judgment is [to be] entered in the trial court could not successfully meet the contentions of his adversary upon a retrial or reconsideration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>case in the trial court.\u201d <em>(Tupman v. Haberkern </em>(1929) 208 Cal. 256, 269 [280 P. 970].) Before an appellate court may exercise this power, \u201c \u2018it must appear from the record . . . that on no theory grounded in reason and justice could the party defeated on appeal make a further substantial showing in the trial court in support of his cause.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Boyle v. Hawkins </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 229, 232, fn. 3 [78 Cal.Rptr. 161, 455 P.2d 97] <em>(Boyle).) </em>Thus, where an appellate court finds that \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to support the verdict,\u201d the \u201cnormal rule\u201d is that the losing party on appeal is \u201centitled to a retrial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 232-233, fn. 3.) Under section 1180, \u201c[t]he granting of a new trial places the parties in the same position as if no trial had been had\u201d and \u201c[a]ll the testimony must be produced anew.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">These well-established principles were at work in <em>Mattson. </em>As previously discussed, we held in <em>Mattson </em>that, after our reversal for insufficient evidence at trial to establish the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s confession, sections 1180 and 1262 authorized the prosecution at retrial to relitigate this issue using evidence it failed to present at the first trial, and the law of the case doctrine did not require exclusion because the prosecution had, in fact, introduced additional evidence at retrial. <em>(Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at pp. 849-853.) As we have shown, <em>Mattson </em>is consistent with a long line of cases applying the law of the case doctrine after reversals for insufficient evidence, none of which imposed or even mentioned a \u201cdue diligence\u201d limitation on the introduction of new evidence at retrial. We therefore reject defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In arguing for a \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement, defendant also relies on <em>Mitchell. </em>There, the court held that because \u201cthe government ha[d] had a full and fair opportunity to present its case unhampered by evidentiary error or other impediment, fundamental fairness require[d] application of equitable principles of res judicata (direct estoppel) and law of the case to preclude relitigation\u201d of an alleged prior conviction after the court\u2019s prior reversal of an earlier true finding for insuficient evidence. <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 136.) The court reasoned that \u201cwhen the People on remand did not show there was newly discovered evidence which they, in due diligence, could not have presented at the first trial on the truth of the priors, that decision and its necessary resolution of the legal sufficiency of the evidence for the prior allegations became the law of the case as between these parties. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 155.) Defendant cites this decision in arguing that the law of the case doctrine bars retrial unless the prosecution makes a \u201cdue diligence\u201d showing as to new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We conclude that <em>Mitchell </em>erred in applying the law of the case doctrine based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to show \u201cdue diligence.\u201d In imposing this requirement, <em>Mitchell </em>failed to cite or discuss the statutes and cases that authorize introduction of new evidence, without limitation, on retrial after an appellate reversal for insufficient evidence. Instead, <em>Mitchell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>cited the lead opinion in <em>Monge I </em>and two civil decisions from the First District Court of Appeal, <em>Bank of America </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 613 [269 Cal.Rptr. 596] <em>(Bank of America) </em>and <em>McCoy v. Hearst Corp. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1657 [278 Cal.Rptr. 596] <em>(McCoy). (Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 155.) Regarding <em>Monge I, </em>the lead opinion there stated only that, in light of the law of the case doctrine, \u201cthe prosecution would have to present additional evidence at a retrial of the prior conviction allegation in order to\u201d overcome the appellate court\u2019s determination that the evidence at the first trial was legally insufficient to prove the allegation. <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 845 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).) It said nothing about a \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement and thus does not support <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>imposition of this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>Bank of America </em>also does not support <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>\u201cdue diligence\u201d gloss on the law of the case doctrine. There, the court held that where a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) is \u201cmade and denied by the trial court, and the appellate court reverses the judgment for insufficiency of the evidence,\u201d retrial is improper even where the reversal is \u201cunqualified.\u201d <em>(Bank of America, supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 626.) In reaching this conclusion, the court specifically relied on Code of Civil Procedure section 629, which <em>mandates </em>entry of judgment in a civil case, rather than a new trial, when an appellate court finds that the trial court erred in denying a JNOV motion. <em>(Bank of America, supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 624\u2014626.) <em>Bank of America </em>is inapposite because Code of Civil Procedure section 629 is inapplicable to a criminal sentencing proceeding, and neither <em>Mitchell </em>nor defendant here identifies a similar statute that governs retrial of the prior juvenile adjudication allegation at issue in this criminal case. Moreover, <em>Mitchell </em>incorrectly reasoned that \u201c[i]n granting the relief requested, the court in <em>Bank of America\u201d </em>relied in part on the \u201claw of the case.\u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 150.) On the contrary, the court in <em>Bank of America </em>expressly noted that, given its conclusion based on Code of Civil Procedure section 629, it did not need \u201cto determine whether [the plaintiffs\u2019] claims would be barred by law of the case if the action were retried . . . .\u201d <em>(Bank of America, supra, 220 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 627.) Thus, although noting that the law of the case doctrine does not apply where the \u201cevidence . . . produced at a subsequent trial ... is \u2018materially,\u2019 \u2018essentially,\u2019 or \u2018substantially\u2019 different from that passed upon in the first appeal,\u201d the court declined to decide whether the new evidence the plaintiffs \u201cproffered . . . would be sufficient to overcome the law of the case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 621, fn. 3.) Furthermore, <em>Bank of America\u2019s </em>holding <em>absolutely precludes </em>retrial; it does not allow for an exception based on new evidence that could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. Finally, the court in <em>Bank of America </em>could find \u201cno compelling policy reason\u201d for giving a civil litigant \u201canother day in court\u201d simply because an appellate court, after finding that JNOV should have been entered, fails to follow a statute requiring entry of judgment under these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 626.) In the criminal sentencing proceeding now before us, the public policy considerations are decidedly different. As we explained in <em>Morton </em>many years ago, retrial of a prior conviction allegation \u201ccarries out the policy of the statutes imposing \u2018more severe punishment, proportionate to their persistence in crime, of those who have proved immune to lesser punishment\u2019 [citation], and prevents defendants from escaping the penalties imposed by those statutes through technical defects in . . . proof.\u201d <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544-545.) California \u201chas a strong interest in protecting its. citizenry from individuals who, by their repeated criminal conduct, demonstrate an incapacity to reform.\u201d <em>(People v. Levin </em>(1993) 157 Ill.2d 138 [623 N.E.2d 317, 327, 191 Ill.Dec. 72].) For all of these reasons, Mitchell\u2019s reliance on <em>Bank of America </em>is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><em>McCoy, </em>the other First District decision <em>Mitchell </em>cited, is factually similar to <em>Bank of America </em>and is similarly inapposite. In <em>McCoy, </em>the defendants, whose JNOV motion had been denied, moved for entry of judgment in the trial court on remand after our \u201cunqualified reversal\u201d of judgments against the defendants \u201cfor insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>(McCoy, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.2d at pp. 1658-1659.) The trial court granted the motion and entered judgments for the defendants. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1658-1659.) The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgments for the defendants, following <em>Bank of America </em>and holding that, where JNOV motions are improperly denied, Code of Civil Procedure section 629 modifies the general rule that an unqualified reversal for insufficient evidence remands the case for a new trial. <em>(McCoy, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d at p. 1662.) Because <em>McCoy </em>simply followed <em>Bank of America </em>and applied Code of Civil Procedure section 629, <em>Mitchell\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>McCoy, </em>like its reliance on <em>Bank of America, </em>is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">For all of the reasons discussed above, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that \u201cretrial should be barred under the doctrine of the law of the case unless the prosecution can establish that it has discovered new evidence which could not have been presented at the first trial through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">m. RES JUDICATA/COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">As generally understood, \u201c[t]he doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>gives certain <em>conclusive effect </em>to a <em>former judgment </em>in subsequent litigation involving the same controversy.\u201d (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Judgment, \u00a7 280, p. 820.) The doctrine \u201chas a double aspect.\u201d <em>(Todhunter v. Smith </em>(1934) 219 Cal. 690, 695 [28 P.2d 916].) \u201cIn its primary aspect,\u201d commonly known as claim preclusion, it \u201coperates as a bar to the maintenance of a second suit between the same parties on the same cause of action. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Lesher </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 874, 880 [299 P.2d 865].) \u201cIn its secondary aspect,\u201d commonly known as collateral estoppel, \u201c[t]he prior judgment. . . \u2018operates\u2019 \u201d in \u201ca second suit. . . based on a different cause of action ... \u2018as an estoppel or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>conclusive adjudication as to such issues in the second action as were actually litigated and determined in the first action.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe prerequisite elements for applying the doctrine to either an entire cause of action or one or more issues are the same: (1) A claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding; (2) the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brinton v. Bankers Pension Services, Inc. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 550, 556 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 469].) Defendant asserts that both aspects of the doctrine bar retrial of his alleged prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim raises a threshold issue that we have not yet decided: whether either aspect of the res judicata doctrine \u201ceven applies to further proceedings in the same litigation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 821 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305].) As the court observed in <em>Mitchell, </em>\u201c[t]he traditional application of such doctrines [is] to \u2018successive prosecutions\u2019 [citation] or rulings from a former action [citation].\u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 147-148.) For example, as we have explained, appellate court judgments establish the law that \u201c \u2018must be applied in the subsequent stages of the cause\u2019 \u201d\u2014i.e., the law of the case\u2014\u201c \u2018and they are <em>res adjudicata </em>in <em>other </em>cases as to every matter adjudicated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dept, of Water &amp; Power </em>v. <em>Inyo Chem. Co. </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 744, 750 [108 P.2d 410], italics added.) Relying principally on <em>U.S. v. Bailin </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 977 F.2d 270 <em>(Bailin), </em>defendant asserts that \u201c[flederal courts and courts from other states have routinely applied collateral estoppel, or direct estoppel, to bar further proceedings in the same action.\u201d However, as defendant correctly notes, we specifically questioned Bailin'\u2019s holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Santamar\u00eda </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 915, footnote 5 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81], There, after reviewing relevant high court authority, \u201cwe questioned] whether collateral estoppel applies to [retrial in] the <em>same </em>proceeding where the government <em>won </em>by securing a conviction of the substantive count\u201d and the conviction was reversed on appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 913; see also <em>People v. Memro, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 821 [\u201c[i]t is questionable whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel even applies to further proceedings in the same litigation\u201d].) Ultimately, we did not decide the question in <em>Santamar\u00eda </em>because we found that the collateral estoppel claim in that case failed \u201con the merits\u201d for other reasons. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Santamar\u00eda, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 916.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Similarly, in this case, we need not resolve this threshold question because defendant\u2019s res judicata claim fails for other reasons. Initially, we agree with the People that neither aspect of res judicata applies because an appellate reversal, for insufficient evidence, of a true finding regarding an alleged prior conviction or juvenile adjudication does not generally constitute a final decision on the merits regarding the truth of the alleged prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>conviction or juvenile adjudication.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As previously discussed, where an appellate court finds that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the verdict, the \u201cnormal rule\u201d is that the losing party on appeal is \u201centitled to a retrial\u201d unless the record shows \u201c \u2018that on no theory grounded in reason and justice could the party defeated on appeal make a further substantial showing in the trial court in support of his cause.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Boyle, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at pp. 232-233, fn. 3.) Here, nothing in the record suggests that, at a retrial, the People would be unable to make the necessary showing regarding the declaration of wardship, and defendant has never contended otherwise.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Monge I </em>and <em>Monge II </em>established that such retrials are not precluded by double jeopardy principles, and we found earlier in this opinion that such retrials are not precluded by due process principles or the law of the case doctrine. Thus, \u201cthe Court of Appeal should not have departed from the normal rule that [the People were] entitled to a retrial\u201d on defendant\u2019s alleged prior juvenile adjudication. <em>(Boyle, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 233, fn. 3.) Given that the Court of Appeal should have ordered a new trial of the alleged prior juvenile adjudication, its reversal of the true finding for insufficient evidence lacks the requisite finality for purposes of applying res judicata or collateral estoppel. (See <em>Pillsbury </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1937) 8 Cal.2d 469, 472 [66 P.2d 149] [appellate order reversing for further proceedings \u201cis not an adjudication in the same sense as a final judgment\u201d for purposes of applying res judicata]; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Fowler </em>(1861) 19 Cal. 11, 26 [appellate decision reversing judgment and remanding is not a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d that would bar subsequent action].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Our conclusion is fully consistent with the high court\u2019s decision in <em>Monge II. </em>As previously explained, there the high court held that where an appellate court finds insufficient evidence to support a true finding regarding an alleged prior conviction, the order reversing the finding lacks the \u201c \u2018constitutional finality\u2019 \u201d to trigger double jeopardy protections and, therefore, does not preclude retrial. <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729.) The purposes of the double jeopardy and res judicata doctrines substantially overlap. We have explained that the purposes of the res judicata doctrine include \u201cpreventing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>inconsistent judgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial system\u201d and \u201cpreventing a person from being harassed by vexatious litigation. [Citation.]\u201d (Pe<em>ople </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 686, 695 [117 Cal.Rptr. 70, 527 P.2d 622].) Similarly, the high court has explained that the purposes of the double jeopardy clause include preserving \u201cthe integrity of a final judgment\u201d <em>{United States </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 82, 92 [57 L.Ed.2d 65, 98 S.Ct. 2187]) and protecting individuals \u201cfrom the harassment and vexation of unbounded litigation.\u201d <em>(Arizona v. Manypenny </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 232, 246 [68 L.Ed.2d 58, 101 S.Ct. 1657].) The high court has also observed that \u201c[a] primary purpose served\u201d by the double jeopardy clause\u2014preserving the finality of judgments\u2014\u201cis akin to that served by the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>(Crist v. Bretz </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 28, 33 [57 L.Ed.2d 24, 98 S.Ct. 2156].) Defendant offers no reason for ignoring these overlapping purposes and refusing to apply, in the res judicata context, <em>Monge II\u2019s </em>holding that an appellate reversal, for insufficient evidence, of a true finding on a prior conviction allegation lacks the requisite finality for purposes of the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The conclusion that res judicata does not apply here is also consistent with our prior decision in <em>Mattson. </em>As previously explained, <em>Mattson </em>held that after an appellate court reverses a conviction because the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish the admissibility of confessions, the prosecution on remand may \u201crelitigate\u201d that issue and \u201cintroduce[] evidence [that] had not been presented at the first trial. . . .\u201d <em>(Mattson, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 849.) In rejecting the defendant\u2019s many arguments against this conclusion, we held that \u201c[njeither constitutional nor \u2018equitable\u2019 double jeopardy <em>nor collateral estoppel considerations </em>bar relitigation of the admissibility of defendant\u2019s confessions in this case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 853, fh. 16, italics added.) Although we did not explain the basis for this conclusion, our holding in <em>Mattson </em>is, nevertheless, inconsistent with defendant\u2019s assertion of collateral estoppel in this case. In short, because defendant cannot establish one of the threshold requirements for application of res judicata\u2014finality of the prior decision\u2014 his attempt to invoke either aspect of that doctrine necessarily fails.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Moreover, we find that even if defendant could satisfy the technical, threshold requirements of the res judicata doctrine, application of the doctrine would be inappropriate here. Whether res judicata applies in a given context is not simply a matter of satisfying the doctrine\u2019s technical requirements. As we have explained, \u201c \u2018the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a nineteenth century pleading book, but with realism and rationality.\u2019 [Citations.] Accordingly, the public policies underlying collateral estoppel\u2014preservation of the integrity of the judicial system, promotion of judicial economy, and protection of litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation\u2014strongly influence whether its application in a particular circumstance would be fair to the parties and constitutes sound judicial policy. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lucido </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 343 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223] <em>(Lucido).) </em>Thus, \u201c[w]e have repeatedly looked to the public policies underlying the doctrine before concluding that collateral estoppel should be applied in a particular setting. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 342-343.) We have also recognized that public policy considerations may warrant an exception to the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata, at least where the issue is a question of law rather than of fact. <em>(Kopp v. Fair Pol. Practices Com. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 607, 620-622 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 108, 905 P.2d 1248]; <em>Greenfield </em>v. <em>Mather </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 23, 35 [194 P.2d 1]; <em>Guardianship of Di Carlo </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 225, 235 [44 P.2d 562].) As previously noted, an appellate court\u2019s determination \u201cthat the evidence is insufficient to justify a finding or a judgment is necessarily a decision upon a question of law.\u201d <em>(Estate of Baird, supra, </em>193 Cal. at p. 238; see also <em>Sharon v. Sharon </em>(1889) 79 Cal. 633, 672 [22 P. 26].)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Looking at the relevant policy considerations, we conclude that application of the res judicata doctrine is inappropriate here, even if defendant could otherwise satisfy the doctrine\u2019s technical requirements. Regarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, declining to apply res judicata principles after appellate reversal of a fact finder\u2019s true finding on a prior conviction allegation does not create a risk of \u201cinconsistent verdicts.\u201d <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 347.) On the other hand, applying such principles under these circumstances would \u201cundermine public confidence in the judicial system\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>because the public has a substantial interest in the implementation of statutes imposing more severe punishment on \u201c \u2018persisten[t]\u2019 \u201d offenders who \u201c \u2018have proved immune to lesser punishment,\u2019 \u201d and in \u201cpreventing]\u201d such offenders \u201cfrom escaping the penalties imposed by those statutes through technical defects in . . . proof.\u201d <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544-545.) As the high court has explained, where \u201ca State adopts the policy of imposing heavier punishment for repeated offending, there is manifest propriety in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>guarding against the escape from this penalty those whose previous conviction was not suitably made known to the court at the time of their trial.\u201d <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>West Virginia </em>(1912) 224 U.S. 616, 626 [56 L.Ed. 917, 32 S.Ct. 583].) \u201cEither a defendant has the requisite number of prior convictions, or he does not,\u201d and \u201c[subjecting him to a second proceeding at which the State has the opportunity to show those convictions is not unfair and will enhance the accuracy of the proceeding by ensuring that the determination is made on the basis of competent evidence.\u201d <em>(Caspari, </em>supra, 510 U.S. at p. 396.) Moreover, applying res judicata principles here \u201cmight create disincentives that would\u201d prompt the Legislature to cut back on the \u201ctrial-like protections\u201d it has, as \u201ca matter of legislative grace,\u201d accorded defendants who \u201cface dramatic increases in their sentences as a result of recidivism enhancements.\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 734.) Thus, the goal of preserving the integrity of the justice system weighs against applying the res judicata doctrine in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We disagree with defendant that application of res judicata principles is necessary to \u201cprevent [him] from being harassed by multiple trials on the same allegation.\u201d Although defendant\u2019s approach \u201cwould eliminate repetitive litigation,\u201d \u201c[t]he essence of vexatiousness ... is not mere repetition. Rather, it is harassment through baseless or unjustified litigation. [Citation.] [Defendant] does not assert that the criminal proceedings in this case are intended to harass.\u201d <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 351.) As just explained, the public has a legitimate expectation that persons with prior convictions who are convicted of new offenses will not, \u201cthrough technical defects in . . . proof,\u201d \u201cescap[e]\u201d the increased punishment statutorily proscribed to reflect \u201c \u2018their persistence in crime ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544\u2014545.) \u201cFor this reason, it is neither vexatious nor unfair\u201d <em>(Lucido, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 351) to permit retrial of prior conviction allegations where a defendant is properly convicted of a new crime and an appellate court reverses the true finding on the prior convictions for insufficient evidence, at least where evidence exists to correct the defects in proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Finally, considerations of judicial economy do not justify application of res judicata principles in this context. Because most failures of proof like the one at issue here are inadvertent, rather than strategic or otherwise intentional, the number of retrials our conclusion permits would, no doubt, be fairly small. Moreover, a trial of a prior conviction allegation \u201cis simple and straightforward,\u201d and \u201c[o]ften . . . involves only the presentation of a certified copy of the prior conviction along with the defendant\u2019s photograph and fingerprints. In many cases, defendants offer no evidence at all, and the outcome is relatively predictable.\u201d <em>(Monge I, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 838 (lead opn. of Chin, J.).) Thus, the judicial resources saved by precluding retrials of prior conviction allegations would be minimal. Any concern about judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>economy is insufficient to overcome California\u2019s \u201cstrong interest\u201d in protecting its citizens from recidivists. <em>(People v. Levin, supra, </em>623 N.E.2d at p. 327.) Thus, the balance of policy interests justifies our refusal to apply either aspect of the res judicata doctrine in the present context.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">IV. LEGISLATIVE INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Defendant argues that retrial of the prior juvenile adjudication allegation \u201cshould be barred because the statutes which grant[ed] [him] a right to an adversarial hearing on the truth of [the] allegation suggest that the Legislature did not want the prosecution to have a remedy from a not true finding.\u201d In support of his argument, he cites statutes requiring the prosecution to plead and prove each prior conviction that qualifies as a strike, and requiring the jury (or the court if a jury is waived) to try the alleged prior conviction and make a finding on the allegation. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (f)(1), 1025, subd. (b), 1158.) He also asserts that no statute authorizes the People to \u201cappeal. . . from a not true finding to a prior conviction allegation\u201d or \u201cto seek a second trial\u201d on such an allegation \u201cbased on the discovery of new evidence.\u201d This statutory framework, defendant contends, \u201csuggests that the prosecution should not be allowed to proceed with a second trial on\u201d a prior conviction allegation after an appellate reversal of a true finding \u201cfor insufficient evidence.\u201d \u201cIf the trier of fact had properly performed [its] duty, a not true finding would have been entered at the first trial and the matter would have concluded at that time. [A] defendant should not be worse off because he was required to appeal to obtain an accurate result.\u201d Moreover, permitting a retrial after an appellate reversal for insufficient evidence \u201cwould, in effect, provide the prosecution with a remedy that has been denied it by the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">(5) For several reasons, we find defendant\u2019s legislative intent argument unpersuasive. First, the issue of whether the People have a statutory right to appeal a not true finding on a prior conviction allegation is unsettled and is currently pending before this court. <em>{People v. Samples, </em>review granted Feb. 25, 2003, S112201.) Thus, defendant\u2019s argument depends on an assumption that may prove incorrect. Second, we find nothing in the pleading and proof requirement of the cited statutes that suggests a legislative intent to preclude retrial after an appellate court reverses, for insufficient evidence, a fact finder\u2019s true finding on a prior conviction allegation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Third, were we to construe the cited</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>statutes to preclude retrial, \u201cwe might create disincentives\u201d that would cause the Legislature to \u201cdiminish the[] important procedural protections\u201d it has statutorily provided as \u201ca matter of legislative grace, not constitutional command.\u201d <em>(Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 734.) Finally, as defendant explains, his statutory argument rests on the alleged \u201cunfairness of allowing retrial\u201d after an appellate reversal for insufficient evidence while prohibiting retrial after a trier of fact\u2019s not true finding. However, for the reasons set forth earlier in this opinion, permitting retrial of a prior conviction allegation after an appellate reversal is not fundamentally unfair.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the People may not retry defendant\u2019s alleged prior juvenile adjudication. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal insofar as it prohibits retrial of the alleged prior juvenile adjudication. We otherwise affirm the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">George, C. J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., Werdegar, J., Brown, J., and Moreno, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"> In neither their petition nor their briefs have the People challenged the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the evidence at trial was insufficient to establish a strike based on defendant\u2019s alleged prior juvenile adjudication.

As previously explained, the high court later announced a contrary rule in <em>Monge II, supra, </em>524 U.S. at page 734.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b251-7\"> We also note that a criminal defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a new trial based on new evidence is not as limited as defendant suggests.

Because the People did not raise this argument in either the Court of Appeal or their opening brief in this court, we decline to address it. (See <em>Varjabedian </em>v. <em>City of Madera </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295, fn. 11 [142 Cal.Rptr. 429, 572 P.2d 43].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\"> As previously noted, defendant admitted at trial that he had sustained a \u201ctrue finding\u201d in juvenile court in 1995 for striking someone with a baseball bat, and his counsel told the jury during closing argument that \u201cffihere\u2019s not an issue\u201d regarding defendant\u2019s \u201cpriors.\u201d Moreover, the probation department\u2019s sentencing report in this case states that defendant was committed to a juvenile ranch facility as a result of the true finding in the 1995 juvenile court proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\"> The cases defendant cites do not require a different conclusion. They address the estoppel effect of <em>a jury\u2019s final </em>verdict <em>acquitting </em>a defendant of one count in a multicount complaint, during retrial on a <em>separate </em>count in the complaint after a mistrial or appellate reversal as to that <em>separate </em>count. <em>(U.S. v. Romeo </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 114 F.3d 141, 144; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Shenberg </em>(11th Cir. 1996) 89 F.3d 1461, 1478; <em>Bailin, supra, </em>977 F.2d at pp. 275-276; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Seley </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 957 F.2d 717, 720-723; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Corley </em>(11th Cir. 1987) 824 F.2d 931, 935-937; <em>U.S. v. Shenberg </em>(S.D.Fla. 1993) 828 F.Supp. 968, 970.) They are consistent with our long-standing rule that \u201cwhere a defendant is tried on multiple counts of a single information, <em>each count being considered as a separate and distinct offense, </em>the doctrine of res judicata operates to preclude the relitigation of issues <em>finally determined </em>upon retrial of only one count.

Like defendant, the court in <em>Mitchell </em>assumed that \u201cthe People do not have the right to appeal\u201d <em>(Mitchell, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 154) a not true finding and emphasized that \u201cCalifornia statutorily provides [a] defendant the hallmarks of a trial on guilt or innocence on the truth of prior conviction allegations, including the mandate that a true or not true finding be made . . ..\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 155, fn. omitted.)
