As a condition of probation, he successfully completed a domestic violence \u201cdiversion\u201d program in Arizona, which resulted in a judgment of dismissal. He argues that the Arizona judgment of dismissal effectively negated his earlier guilty plea under Arizona law, precluding its use as a prior conviction in the current proceeding. He also argues that the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 1) precludes our court from deciding, under California law, whether his Arizona guilty plea constitutes a \u201cstrike\u201d under California\u2019s three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">We granted review to resolve the following issues: (1) whether California must give full faith and credit to the Arizona judgment of dismissal and thus decide, under Arizona law, whether defendant suffered a prior conviction for purposes of California\u2019s three strikes law; and (2) assuming California law applies, whether the Arizona guilty plea, followed by a dismissal upon the completion of probation, constitutes a prior conviction under the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">We hold that the full faith and credit clause does not bar our courts from deciding this issue under California law. We further hold that under California law, defendant suffered a prior conviction by reason of his guilty plea in Arizona.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>I. Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">A. <em>The California Crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">On September 11, 2000, the People filed a two-count information charging defendant with grand theft of personal property from an elder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 368, subd. (d))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (a)). The information also alleged that defendant suffered a prior conviction in 1992 in Arizona for aggravated assault with a handgun against his wife. Defendant pleaded not guilty and denied the strike allegation. At the preliminary hearing, the People adduced evidence that defendant lived with his 95-year-old grandmother and, without her permission, obtained her Wells Fargo ATM card. Thereafter, between March 11, 2000 and April 9, 2000, he accessed her bank account on 31 separate occasions and withdrew a total of $5,319.53. On October 31, 2000, pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pleaded guilty to grand theft from an elder (\u00a7 368, subd. (d)); the grand theft count (\u00a7 487, subd. (a)) was dismissed. The parties agreed to put over sentencing and conduct a bench trial on the validity of the Arizona guilty plea for three strikes purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">B. <em>The Arizona Prior Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">On December 21, 2000, the bench trial commenced. The evidence showed that, on October 6, 1992, defendant was charged in Arizona with aggravated assault, to wit, assaulting his wife with a handgun, a class 3 felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 9, 1992, defendant, pursuant to a written plea agreement, entered a plea of guilty to the charge, and the court followed the procedures outlined in Arizona Revised Statutes, section 13-3601, former subdivision (H).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court questioned defendant concerning the factual basis of his plea and the minute order provided: \u201cIT IS THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT that there is a factual basis for the plea. The plea is accepted. Entry of judgment of guilt is deferred.\u201d The court further ordered that \u201csentencing [take place] on January 21, 1993.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number><em>On </em>January 21, 1993, the court prepared a document entitled \u201cSENTENCE OF PROBATION\u2014DEFERRAL OF ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OF GUILT.\u201d The document memorialized that defendant waived his right to a court or jury trial and \u201chas entered a plea of guilty.\u201d The document also noted that \u201c[pjursuant to [Arizona Revised Statutes, former] [s]ection 13-3601 [, subdivision] (H), without entering a judgment of guilt and with the concurrence of the prosecutor and consent of the defendant, the Court defers further proceed-, ings and places the defendant on probation\u201d for aggravated assault with a handgun.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The document further provided: \u201cAs punishment for this/these crime(s) [][] IT IS ORDERED suspending imposition of sentence and placing the Defendant on Probation for a period of three (3) YEARS, commencing this date, under the supervision of the Adult Probation Department of this Court, in accordance with the formal Conditions of Probation signed by the Court.\u201d The document also provided: \u201cIT IS ORDERED that the defendant comply with all 16 standard conditions of probation\u201d and that he \u201cparticipate in the Pima County Adult Diversion Domestic Violence program and that he complete said program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Nearly three months later, on April 12, 1993, the court conducted a probation violation hearing. Defendant was present and out of custody. The hearing resulted in an amendment to defendant\u2019s \u201cConditions of Probation previously imposed,\u201d adding the condition that \u201cdefendant have no contact with [his wife] or her residence except for purposes of exercising visitation granted in [his] domestic relations case . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">On May 24, 1993, defendant was released from custody upon posting $2,000 bail. The record before us does not reveal why defendant was in custody, but a minute entry for June 15, 1993 states that the \u201cCourt having found defendant violated the terms and conditions of probation, [][] It Is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>Ordered imposition of sentence is suspended and defendant reinstated on probation on the same terms and conditions as previously imposed; the Court is reinstating the defendant because the probation officer indicates to the court that defendant has not been a problem. It Is Ordered defendant stay away from his wife.\u201d The minute entry further noted: \u201cFiled In Court: Notice of Rights of Review After Conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On March 2, 1994, defendant moved to terminate his probation. The motion was not opposed by the probation department but was opposed by the People. The court ordered that supervised probation be terminated and that the term of probation be modified to two years from the date of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">On April 21, 1995, a document entitled \u201cPETITION AND ORDER OF DISCHARGE FROM PROBATION,\u201d noted that, on January 21, 1993, \u201cdefendant was placed on probation for Aggravated Assault With a Deadly Weapon or Dangerous Instrument, to wit: a Handgun/Domestic Violence, a Class 3 Felony . . . .\u201d The document further noted that \u201cdefendant has completed the period of probation.\u201d The court therefore ordered that \u201cdefendant is hereby discharged from probation in this case\u201d and \u201c[according to [Arizona Revised Statutes section 13-3601, former subdivision (H)], the proceedings against the defendant are dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">C. <em>Trial Court Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The trial court below cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Castello </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1253-1255 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 314] <em>(Castello), </em>for the proposition that California law applies in determining whether the Arizona guilty plea was a strike under the three strikes law. The trial court ruled that a dismissal under the Arizona statute was more akin to a dismissal under the drug offender deferred entry of judgment program (\u00a7\u00a7 1000.1-1000.8),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> than to an expungement under section 1203.4, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It therefore found that the prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>allegation had not been proved because a guilty plea under the drug-offender deferred entry of judgment program cannot be used as a prior conviction if the defendant has successfully completed the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">D. <em>Court of Appeal Ruling</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The Court of Appeal reversed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> relying on its decision in <em>Castello, supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th 1242. In <em>Castello, </em>the same Court of Appeal held that a Florida guilty plea constituted a strike under California law, despite the fact that the Florida court, after the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, withheld the adjudication of guilt until after the defendant completed probation. <em>Castello </em>reasoned that for purposes of the three strikes law, a conviction occurs at the time of the guilty plea. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1245, 1252-1253.) <em>Castello </em>noted that it was \u201ca matter of academic interest only\u201d that Florida courts might not consider the defendant\u2019s guilty plea a conviction in Florida because California law controlled. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1255.) <em>Castello, </em>however, did not discuss the full faith and credit clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Under <em>Castello, </em>the Court of Appeal held that defendant was convicted at the time he entered his guilty plea to the Arizona offense. The Court of Appeal added: \u201cThe fact of his completion of probation, and the subsequent dismissal of the charges, does not affect this central, and dispositive, fact. . . . [Fjor purposes of the three strikes law, nothing in the subsequent history of the case in Arizona may now be interposed to require a contrary conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Relying on <em>People v. Shear </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 278, 284-289 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 707] <em>(Shear), </em>the Court of Appeal addressed defendant\u2019s full faith and credit argument. In <em>Shear, </em>the defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm (\u00a7 12021, subd. (a)), based on an Arizona prior felony conviction. Because Arizona law had restored his right to possess a firearm upon completion of probation, the defendant argued that the full faith and credit clause prohibited California from using that conviction to support a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The <em>Shear </em>court disagreed. \u201cAlthough state statutes arguably fall within the literal terms of the [full faith and credit] clause, the United States Supreme Court . . . has significantly limited the clause\u2019s application to statutes.\u201d <em>(Shear, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 284.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The <em>Shear </em>court relied extensively on <em>Alaska Packers Assn. v. I.A.C. </em>(1935) 294 U.S. 532 [79 L.Ed. 1044, 55 S.Ct. 518], in which the high court stated: \u201cIt has often been recognized by this Court that there are some limitations upon the extent to which a state will be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of another state, in contravention of its own statutes or policy. [Citations.] [][] In the case of statutes, the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed, where the policy of one state statute comes into conflict with that of another, the necessity of some accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states is still more apparent. A rigid and literal enforcement of the full faith and credit clause, without regard to the statute of the forum, would lead to the absurd result that, wherever the conflict arises, the statutes of each state must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own. [f] ... [][]\u2022\u2022 \u2022 [T]he conflict is to be resolved, not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, compelling the courts of each state to subordinate its own statutes to those of the other, but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight.\u201d (294 U.S. at pp. 546-547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Based on the foregoing authority, <em>Shear </em>held that the full faith and credit clause did not require California to substitute the Arizona statute for its own statute because California, as the forum state, has a significant state interest in applying its own law: \u201cThere can be few more significant public policies of this state than that of protecting the safety of its citizens.\u201d <em>(Shear, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 288.) Citing <em>Shear, </em>the Court of Appeal below held that defendant\u2019s full faith and credit argument was \u201cwithout substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Defendant does not dispute the rule articulated in <em>Shear. </em>He claims that he is not asking California to substitute the Arizona statute for its own statute, but to simply give full faith and credit to the Arizona court\u2019s judgment of dismissal which, under Arizona law, prevents such a guilty plea from being used to enhance a sentence in a subsequent Arizona criminal proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>As explained below, we hold that the full faith and credit clause does not preclude a state from determining under its own laws whether a guilty plea in another jurisdiction constitutes a prior conviction for purposes of its habitual criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">A. <em>Full Faith and Credit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Article IV, section 1 of the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each state to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.\u201d Title 28, section 1738 of the United States Code implements the full faith and credit clause as follows: \u201cSuch Acts, records and judicial proceedings or copies thereof so authenticated, shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken.\u201d The full faith and credit clause applies to matters between states (see, e.g., <em>Sun Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Wortman </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 717, 722-724 [100 L.Ed.2d 743, 108 S.Ct. 2117]) and to matters between a state and the federal government. (See, e.g., <em>Migra </em>v. <em>Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Education </em>(1984) 465 U.S. 75, 81 [79 L.Ed.2d 56, 104 S.Ct. 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Defendant claims that the full faith and credit clause \u201cis \u2018exacting\u2019 as to judgments,\u201d and therefore the clause \u201capplies without qualification to the Arizona <em>judgment </em>of dismissal.\u201d Not so. Although it has been held in civil cases that \u201cthe full faith and credit command \u2018is exacting\u2019 with respect to \u2018[a] final judgment . . . rendered by a court with adjudicatory authority over the subject matter and persons governed by the judgment\u2019 \u201d <em>(Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Hyatt </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 488, 494 [155 L.Ed.2d 702, 123 S.Ct. 1683]), we have stated that the full faith and credit clause \u201c \u2018does not require that sister States enforce a foreign penal judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bacigalupo </em>(1991) 1 Cal.4th 103, 133, fn. 9 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 335, 820 P.2d 559] (Bacigalupo), citing <em>Huntington </em>v. <em>Attrill </em>(1892) 146 U.S. 657 [36 L.Ed. 1123, 13 S.Ct. 224] <em>(Attrill), </em>and <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>George </em>(1970) 399 U.S. 224 [26 L.Ed.2d 578, 90 S.Ct. 1963] <em>(Nelson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>In <em>Attrill, </em>the high court recognized that there are limitations upon the extent to which a state may be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce the penal judgment of another state in contravention of its own statutes or policy. There, a judgment creditor had previously secured a judgment against the former director of a New York corporation for transferring stock to members of his family in order to defraud creditors. The judgment creditor sought to enforce this judgment in Maryland, but the Maryland Court of Appeals dismissed the creditor\u2019s bill in equity on the grounds that the underlying judgment was a penalty under the New York statute and therefore not subject to the full faith and credit clause. <em>(Attrill, supra, </em>146 U.S. at pp. 663-664.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In order to determine whether a \u201cpenalty\u201d was subject to the full faith and credit clause, the high court recalled the \u201cfundamental maxim of international law, stated by Chief Justice Marshall in the fewest possible words: \u2018The courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Attrill, supra, </em>146 U.S. at p. 666.) The high court then carefully distinguished the words \u201cpenal\u201d and \u201cpenalty,\u201d noting that the full faith and credit clause does not obligate one state to enforce the penal laws of another state: \u201cCrimes and offences against the laws of any state can only be defined, prosecuted and pardoned by the sovereign authority of that State; and the authorities, legislative, executive or judicial, of other States take no action with regard to them, except by way of extradition to surrender offenders to the State whose laws they have violated, and whose peace they have broken.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 669; see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>North Carolina </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 287, 295, fn. 6 [87 L.Ed. 279, 63 S.Ct. 207] [\u201cIt has been repeatedly held that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of . . . another.\u201d]</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">The high court affirmed this aspect of its <em>Attrill </em>holding in <em>Nelson, supra, </em>399 U.S. 224, in which the petitioner was incarcerated in a California state prison for robbery. During this custody period, the petitioner was transported to North Carolina to stand trial on a robbery charge. He was convicted and thereafter returned to California to serve the remainder of his California sentence. North Carolina then placed a detainer on the petitioner. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 225-226.) A federal district court held that the petitioner was foreclosed from challenging the North Carolina conviction while he was incarcerated in California. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 226.) On appeal, the petitioner contended that the mere existence of the detainer amounted to \u201ca form of custody\u201d because it affected his custodial classification and probability of parole on the California sentence. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 227.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>In discussing the petitioner\u2019s claim, the high court, following Attrill, stated that \u201cthe Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require that sister States enforce a foreign penal judgment\u201d <em>(Nelson, </em>supra, 399 U.S. at p. 229), and observed that \u201cCalifornia is free to consider, what effect, if any, it will give to the North Carolina detainer in terms of [the petitioner\u2019s] present \u2018custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In a footnote discussing California\u2019s ultimate duty to extradite petitioner, the high court underscored the inapplicability of the full faith and credit clause, stating: \u201c[T]he Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require California to enforce the North Carolina penal judgment in any way.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 229, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">And in <em>Bacigalupo, </em>we held that nothing in the full faith and credit clause required us to adopt the New York rule that criminal charges dismissed as part of a plea bargain constitute an acquittal. Instead, we held that we were free to more narrowly define \u201cacquittal\u201d as \u201ca judicial determination of the truth or falsity of the charge,\u201d as provided under California law. <em>(Bacigalupo, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at pp. 133-134.) We therefore concluded that the facts underlying the New York charges were admissible in a California death penalty case as evidence of an aggravating circumstance under section 190.3, factor (b). <em>(Bacigalupo, </em>at p. 134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The holdings in <em>Attrill, Williams, Nelson, </em>and <em>Bacigalupo </em>are fatal to defendant\u2019s argument. If California need not give full faith and credit to penal judgments of another state, then it is free to determine under its own laws whether defendant\u2019s Arizona plea constitutes a conviction for purposes of the three strikes law, notwithstanding the subsequent Arizona judgment discharging defendant from probation and dismissing the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Indeed, there is general agreement that the full faith and credit clause, even if it does apply to criminal judgments, does not prevent a state from (1) enhancing a sentence based on an out-of-state conviction for which the defendant has been pardoned; and (2) determining under its own laws whether a guilty plea in another jurisdiction constitutes a prior conviction. In either instance, the treatment accorded by a sister state to a judgment or other criminal proceeding does not preclude our state from using that judgment or proceeding to enhance a sentence under our habitual criminal statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>For example, in <em>People v. Dutton </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 505 [71 P.2d 218] <em>(Dutton), </em>we squarely rejected the argument that the full faith and credit clause prevented the use of an out-of-state prior conviction to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence after the defendant had been pardoned for that offense. In <em>Dutton, </em>we first referenced the companion case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Biggs </em>(1937) 9 Cal.2d 508 [71 P.2d 214], in which we rejected the contention that an out-of-state prior conviction for which the defendant had been pardoned by the state\u2019s governor could not be considered under our habitual criminal statutes. <em>(Dutton, supra, 9 </em>Cal.2d at p. 506.) As we explained in <em>Biggs: </em>\u201cTo say, however, that the offender is \u2018a new man\u2019, and \u2018as innocent as if he had never committed the offense\u2019, is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal. A person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d <em>(Biggs, supra, 9 </em>Cal.2d at p. 511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We concluded in <em>Dutton: </em>\u201cDefendant in the instant case advances several contentions not made in the <em>[Biggs) </em>case. He urges, first, that the trial court denied full faith and credit to the act of the governor of Wisconsin, in violation of article IV, section 1, of the federal Constitution. No authority is cited to support the remarkable assertion that California, in determining the appropriate punishment for a person convicted of crime in this state, is denying effect to acts of the chief executive of Wisconsin. He pardoned the defendant for the first offense; this state punishes him for the second offense only, and full faith and credit is not involved.\u201d <em>(Dutton, supra, 9 </em>Cal.2d at p. 506.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">But defendant points out that we implicitly rejected the <em>Dutton </em>holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 137 [37 Cal.Rptr. 605, 390 P.2d 381], in which we held that under the full faith and credit clause, a certified copy of the defendant\u2019s conviction for armed robbery in Oklahoma, for which the defendant had received a pardon, could not be admitted into evidence in the penalty trial of a subsequent California death penalty case: \u201cUnder the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution, article IV, section 1, California must give an administrative decision of Oklahoma, represented here by the pardon, the same effect in California as that decision would have borne in Oklahoma. <em>[Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt </em>(1943) 320 U.S. 430, 435, 443 [88 L.Ed. 149, 64 S.Ct. 208].] Since Oklahoma courts treat the pardoned defendant as a person not convicted of crime <em>[Cloud v.

For the reasons stated below, we conclude that <em>Dutton </em>has the better view.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Our holding in <em>Dutton </em>followed the reasoning set forth in <em>Carlesi </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1914) 233 U.S. 51 [58 L.Ed. 843, 34 S.Ct. 576], in which the defendant challenged a New York habitual criminal statute that took into consideration a prior federal conviction for which the defendant had been pardoned by the President. The high court stated: \u201cThe issue is a narrow one and involves not the determination of the operation and effect of a pardon within the jurisdiction of the sovereignty granting it, but simply requires it to be decided how far a pardon granted as to an offense committed against the United States operates . . . [in] a subsequent state offense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57.) Because \u201cthe act of the State in taking into consideration a prior offense committed against the United States after pardon . . . was not in any degree a punishment for the prior crime but was simply an exercise by the State of a local power within its exclusive cognizance, there could be no violation of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\"><em>Dutton, Biggs, </em>and <em>Carlesi, </em>when read together, express the view that because a pardon does not \u201cwipe out\u201d the existence of the prior crime, that conviction may be used to enhance a sentence under a habitual criminal statute because the defendant is being punished only for the second offense and the full faith and credit clause is not implicated. And, as it was in 1937 when <em>Dutton </em>was decided, the weight of authority in the United States today is that the full faith and credit clause does not prevent a conviction for which the defendant has been pardoned from being used to enhance a sentence under another state\u2019s habitual criminal statute. (See generally Annot., Pardoned or Expunged Conviction as \u201cPrior Offense\u201d Under State Statute or Regulation Enhancing Punishment for Subsequent Conviction (2002) 97 A.L.R.5th 293, and cases cited.) As stated in <em>Groseclose v. Plummer </em>(9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>1939) 106 F.2d 311, 313: \u201cNotwithstanding the . . . pardons, the stubborn fact remains that the habit of crime was upon [defendant]. The executive clemency of one state could not, under any law of such state, prevent a sister state from taking cognizance of plain facts, and from applying its police laws to them.\u201d <em>People v. Terry, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 137, is therefore overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Finally, our conclusion that the treatment accorded by a sister state to a judgment or other criminal proceeding does not preclude our state from using that judgment or proceeding to enhance a sentence under our habitual criminal statutes is consistent with the weight of authority from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In <em>New Mexico v. Edmonson, supra, </em>818 P.2d 855, for example, the issue before the court was whether a Texas conviction that was \u201cset aside\u201d after completion of probation, and which could not be considered under the Texas habitual criminal statute, could nonetheless be considered under the New Mexico habitual criminal statute. Citing <em>Nelson </em>and <em>Attrill, </em>the court stated \u201c[i]t is not at all clear that the Full Faith and Credit Clause applies to criminal matters.\u201d <em>(Edmonson, supra, </em>818 P.2d at p. 860.) \u201cEven assuming that it does, we believe that it would rarely, if ever, compel one state to be governed by the law of a second state regarding the punishment that can be imposed for a crime committed within the first state\u2019s boundaries.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court therefore held that the full faith and credit clause did not apply: \u201c[T]he deterrent and punitive purposes of [habitual criminal] statutes argue strongly in favor of upholding their provisions against any challenge under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 861.) As New Mexico treated a guilty plea as a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of its habitual criminal statute, the court affirmed the use of the Texas conviction for purposes of the New Mexico habitual criminal statute. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">In <em>McClish v. Arkansas </em>(1998) 331 Ark. 295 [962 S.W.2d 332], the state, pursuant to its habitual offender statute, introduced evidence of the defendant\u2019s Oklahoma conviction for rape during the sentencing phase of defendant\u2019s robbery trial. The Oklahoma court had accepted the defendant\u2019s no contest plea to the rape charge, deferred imposition of judgment and placed him on probation; upon his successful completion of probation, the defendant was discharged without a court judgment of guilt, the plea was expunged from the record, and the charge was dismissed with prejudice to any further action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 333.) The court applied Arkansas law and held that the defendant had suffered a conviction when his no contest plea was accepted. In so holding, it rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the Oklahoma plea should not be admissible in an Arkansas court for sentence enhancement purposes because an Oklahoma court would prohibit the use of that plea for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>such purposes. The court stated, \u201cthe State of Arkansas is undeniably free to independently legislate its own sentencing policy and procedures, which may be contrary to the law of foreign states.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">In <em>Bui </em>v. <em>Ashcroft </em>(N.D.Tex., Jan. 31, 2003 No. 3:02-CV-1140-L) 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1565, Bui was deported based on a Texas \u201cdeferred adjudication,\u201d under which a Texas court, after receiving a plea of guilty or no contest, defers further proceedings without an adjudication of guilt and places the defendant on probation; upon successful completion of probation, the proceedings are dismissed and the defendant is discharged. Bui argued that the deferred adjudication was not a conviction under Texas law and, under the statutory counterpart to the federal constitution\u2019s full faith and credit clause,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the federal court must apply Texas law. The court disagreed: \u201c \u2018[Ajccording full faith and credit to a state judgment need not control the collateral consequences that flow from the judgment.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . \u2018[T]he consequences which a state chooses to attach to a conviction in its courts for purposes of its own law are for it to say; but they cannot control the consequences to be given it in [another] proceeding . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bui, supra, </em>2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1565, at pp. *5-*6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In <em>Poo v. Hood </em>(S.D.N.Y., Feb. 12, 1992 No. 89 CIV. 7874 (MBM)) 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1535 <em>(Hood), </em>petitioner\u2019s Florida guilty plea resulted in a disposition called \u201cadjudication withheld,\u201d wherein the Florida court declines to convict the defendant if the defendant successfully completes probation. The petitioner argued that New York\u2019s considering of this conviction under its habitual offender statute violated full faith and credit. The court disagreed: \u201cNew York\u2019s statutory choice to treat a finding of guilt as the predicate to imposing a heavier penalty when a defendant commits another crime cannot violate the full faith and credit clause, regardless of how Florida chooses to treat the same event\u201d <em>(id. </em>at <em>pp. </em>*15-* 16) because the \u201cfull faith and credit clause does not lodge in the state of original conviction the power to control the effect of that conviction on later acts committed outside that state.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. *17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">At bottom, <em>Edmonson, McClish, Bui </em>and <em>Hood </em>stand for the proposition that, given a state\u2019s legitimate interest in enforcing its own sentencing procedures and policies for repeat offenders who commit crimes within the state, the full faith and credit clause does not bar a state from determining, under its own laws, whether an out-of-state guilty plea constitutes a \u201cconviction\u201d for purposes of a habitual criminal statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree. As stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>Hood, </em>\u201cthe profile of the shadow that conviction casts on later events is the business of the state where those later events occur.\u201d <em>{Hood, supra, </em>1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1535, p. *18.) We now turn to the question of whether defendant\u2019s Arizona conviction constitutes a \u201cprior conviction\u201d under the three strikes law.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Conviction Is a Strike Under California Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The three strikes law imposes enhanced punishment, \u201c[Notwithstanding any other law, if a defendant has been convicted of a felony and it has been pled and proved that the defendant has one or more prior felony convictions ....\u201d(\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (c), 1170.12, subd. (a).) A prior conviction for purposes of the three strikes law includes \u201cA conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that, if committed in California, is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison. A prior conviction of a particular felony shall include a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all of the elements of the particular felony as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(2), 1170.12, subd. (b)(2).) Assault with a firearm, defendant\u2019s crime, is included as a \u201cprior conviction\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c)(8) and section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">The three strikes law continues: \u201cThe determination of whether a prior conviction is a prior felony conviction for purposes of [this section] shall be made upon the date of that prior conviction and is not affected by the sentence imposed unless the sentence automatically, upon the initial sentencing, converts the felony into a misdemeanor. None of the following dispositions shall affect the determination that a prior conviction is a prior felony .... [1] (A) The suspension of imposition of judgment or sentence. Q] (B) The stay of execution of sentence.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The three strikes law clearly provides that a prior conviction occurs upon \u201cthe date of that prior conviction and is not affected by the sentence imposed.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1).) The statutory language thus comports with the general California rule that \u201c \u2018A plea of guilty constitutes a conviction.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Banks </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 370, 390-391 [1 Cal.Rptr. 669, 348 P.2d 102].) \u201cIndeed, it is settled that for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>purposes of a prior conviction statute, a conviction occurs at the time of entry of the guilty plea.\u201d (Castello, supra, 65 Cal.App.4th at p. 1253.) As we stated in <em>People v. Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 203 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480], \u201cFor purposes of a \u2018prior conviction\u2019 statute, defendant suffers such a conviction when he pleads guilty.\u201d We affirmed this view with specific reference to the three strikes law in <em>People v. Rosbury </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 206, 210 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 635, 932 P.2d 207], in which we cited with approval <em>People v. Williams </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1632, 1636 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 448] for its holding \u201cthat under the three strikes law \u2018when guilt is established, either by plea or verdict, the defendant stands convicted and thereafter has a prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d (Rosbury, at p. 210.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">But defendant claims he was placed on \u201cdiversion\u201d pursuant to section 13-3601, former subdivision (H) of the Arizona Revised Statutes, the \u201cArizona diversion statute,\u201d because he was statutorily obligated to complete a \u201cdiversion\u201d program for domestic violence offenders. Upon completion of such program, his case was dismissed. Defendant therefore argues that he was not \u201cconvicted\u201d under California law because the Arizona proceedings under section 13-3601, former subdivision (H) of the Arizona Revised Statutes were akin to proceedings under California\u2019s deferred entry of judgment program for drug offenders, under which a guilty plea, upon the successful completion of the program, \u201cdoes not constitute a conviction for any purpose.\u201d (\u00a7 1000.1, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Defendant is incorrect. California has limited this statutory benefit to certain nonviolent drug offenders and, as will be shown below, has specifically <em>excluded </em>such a benefit where the offender has committed a crime involving domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In 1972, California enacted its drug diversion program. (\u00a7\u00a7 1000.1-1000.4, added by Stats. 1972, ch. 1255, \u00a7 17, p. 2469.) The statutory scheme provided that defendants eligible under this chapter could waive their right to a speedy trial and, by entering an approved drug diversion program, be diverted from criminal proceedings for no less than six months nor more than two years. (\u00a7 1000.2.) No guilty plea was required. If the divertee performed unsatisfactorily, criminal proceedings were resumed. (\u00a7 1000.3.) If the diver-tee successfully completed the program, criminal charges under this chapter were dismissed and the arrest upon which the diversion was based was deemed never to have occurred. (\u00a7\u00a7 1000.3, 1000.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Effective January 1, 1997, the Legislature replaced California\u2019s drug diversion program with the current deferred entry of judgment program. (Stats. 1996, ch. 1132, \u00a7 2.) Under the new program, an eligible defendant can enter a plea of guilty, participate in a drug rehabilitation program and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>upon completion of the program, have the charges dismissed. (\u00a7\u00a7 1000-1000.2.) \u201cA defendant\u2019s plea of guilty pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose unless a judgment of guilt is entered pursuant to Section 1000.3.\u201d (\u00a7 1000.1, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Defendant places great reliance on this last provision, that \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s plea of guilty pursuant to this chapter shall not constitute a conviction for any purpose . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1000.1, subd. (d).) But this provision applies, by its terms, only to guilty pleas entered \u201cpursuant to this chapter.\u201d There is nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended to change the general rule, discussed above, that a guilty plea constitutes a conviction. Instead, the Legislature simply decided to encourage individuals with a drug problem to enter a drug program by offering them the incentive that, upon completion of the drug program, their conviction would disappear.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Indeed, the fact that the Legislature intended to limit this statutory benefit to carefully chosen nonviolent drug offenders is aptly illustrated by the fact that, in 1995, the Legislature <em>repealed </em>the domestic violence misdemeanor diversion program,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> specifically because of the serious nature of domestic violence. The Legislature declared: \u201cDomestic violence is a serious and widespread crime. Between two and four million American women are beaten annually by their husbands or boyfriends; 1,400 women are killed each year by current or former husbands or boyfriends; domestic violence is the second leading cause of injury to women aged 15 to 44 years, [f] . . . Until recently, domestic violence has not received sufficient priority in public policy concerning crime and public safety. According to an analysis of state statistics, about two-thirds of those arrested for felony spousal abuse were prosecuted, with 80 percent of those cases treated as misdemeanors. [][]... Domestic violence has long-term effects that are disastrous for social policy and threatens the stability of the family and negatively impacts all family members, especially children, who learn that violence is an acceptable way to cope with stress or problems. . . . [f] . . . Diversion programs for perpetrators of domestic violence, while worthwhile in intention and sometimes effective, are inadequate to address domestic violence as a serious crime [f] . . . Therefore, the Legislature finds it important to treat domestic violence as a serious crime.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 641, \u00a7 1, subds. (a)-(e), p. 5069.) Our state has <em>never </em>had a diversion program for domestic violence felonies that involve violence, such as aggravated assault with a handgun against a spouse, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>crime to which defendant entered a plea of guilty in Arizona. Defendant\u2019s analogy to our deferred entry of judgment program for drug offenders is inapt.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">All that remains, therefore, is to determine whether defendant\u2019s Arizona guilty plea meets the requirements of a guilty plea under the three strikes law. It does. Defendant in the prior case waived Ms right to a court or jury trial and entered a plea of guilty to aggravated assault pursuant to a written plea agreement. The Arizona court questioned defendant, found there was a factual basis for Ms plea, and accepted the plea. Defendant was placed on probation and imposition of sentence was suspended. Our tMee strikes law specifically provides that the suspension of imposition of sentence, does <em>not </em>affect the determination that such prior conviction constitutes a strike. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1)(A), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1)(A).) Defendant was ordered to \u201ccomply with all 16 standard conditions of probation.\u201d The court subsequently found that defendant violated the conditions of his probation and filed a \u201cNotice of Rights of Review After Conviction,\u201d advising defendant of Ms right to file a petition for <em>postconviction </em>relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to aggravated assault with a handgun constiMtes a prior conviction under the tMee strikes law. (See \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(2).) As stated by the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at page 1638: \u201cThe focus of the tMee strikes law is conduct: did the defendant commit a felony after having previously committed one or more serious or violent felonies? When a defendant pleads guilty to or is convicted of a felony, the law is satisfied factually that he or she committed it. When the deterrent effect of the law fails and the defendant subsequently commits another felony, he or she becomes a repeat offender and deserves harsher punishment, regardless of whether judgment and sentence have been pronounced on the initial offense, [f] Given the focus and purpose of section 667 (b)-(i), we conclude that \u2018prior felony convictions\u2019 in section 667, subdivision (c), falls within the general rule illustrated in <em>[People v. Rhoads </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 56 [270 Cal.Rptr. 266]]: when guilt is established, either by plea or verdict, the defendant stands convicted and thereafter has a prior conviction.\u201d As stated by the Court of Appeal, defendant\u2019s guilty plea constituted a prior conviction \u201cfor purposes of the tMee strikes law, [and] notMng in the subsequent Mstory of the case in Arizona may now be interposed to require a contrary conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>III. DisposraoN</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">No matter what leniency Arizona may or may not bestow upon its recidivist criminals who have committed domestic violence felonies, once we are satisfied that a defendant\u2019s factual guilt was established in the foreign state, and once we are satisfied that such conviction constitutes a strike under our three strikes law, that prior crime will count here. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">George, C.

Class 6 felonies include possession of burglary tools (Ariz. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 13-1505, subd. (B)) and theft of a motor vehicle (Ariz. Rev. Stat., \u00a7 13-1802, subd. (C)).

The terms and conditions of probation shall include those necessary to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and additional conditions and requirements which the court deems appropriate, including imposition of a fine, incarceration of the defendant in a county jail, payment of restitution and any counseling or diversionary programs available to the defendant.

The court stated: \u201cProbation for a felony granted pursuant to section 13-3601(H) is \u2018probation for a conviction of a felony offense\u2019 within the enhancement provisions of [the habitual criminal statute]\u201d because \u201c[t]he fact that no formal judgment had been entered did not change the fact that admission of guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>showed [the defendant] to be a threat to society.\u201d <em>(Green, supra, </em>852 P.2d at 403.) Thus, the court\u2019s language in <em>Green </em>suggests that a conviction dismissed under Arizona Revised Statutes, section 13-3601, former subdivision (H) would nonetheless constitute a prior conviction under Arizona\u2019s habitual criminal statute because the \u201cadmission of guilt showpng] [the defendant] to be a threat to society\u201d is not blotted out by the fact that he committed the new crime during, <em>or after, </em>the probationary period. We need not decide this question here, given our conclusion that the full faith and credit clause does not preclude California courts from determining whether defendant\u2019s Arizona guilty plea constitutes a prior conviction under California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1225 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 610, 25 P.3d 1090], we decided that an expunged Texas conviction could be considered under California\u2019s Sexually Violent Predators Act. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.) The parties in <em>Vasquez </em>stipulated that the Texas proceeding \u201cundisputedly \u2018resulted] in a conviction\u2019 [citation] for an offense in another state containing all of the elements of a listed California offense.\u201d (Vasquez, <em>supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 1233.) We therefore did not decide the issue advanced in the present case, which is whether the full faith and credit clause compels us to resort to the foreign state\u2019s definition of \u201cconviction\u201d as a predicate to utilizing such \u201cconviction\u201d in our state. Indeed, full faith and credit was not discussed at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\"> Title 28 United States Code section 1738; see discussion at page 888, <em>ante.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b898-9\"> The full faith and credit clause has been unsuccessfully interposed in a variety of criminal contexts.
