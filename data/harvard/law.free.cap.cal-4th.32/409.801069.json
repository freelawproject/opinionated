(See <em>Apartment Assn, of Los Angeles County, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 830, 835 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 719, 14 P.3d 930].) Article XIII D of the state Constitution (hereafter article XIII D) specifies various restrictions and requirements for assessments, fees, and charges that local governments impose on real property or on persons as an incident of property ownership. Here, the main issue is whether a charge that a local water district imposed as a condition of making a new connection to the water system, and that the district used to finance capital improvements to the water system, is subject to the restrictions of article XIII D. Other questions presented are whether article XIII D prohibits a local water district from continuing to include in the new connection fees a fire suppression charge, the proceeds of which are used to purchase firefighting and emergency medical equipment for the district\u2019s volunteer fire department, and whether an ordinance imposing a water connection fee may be amended by a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On these questions, we conclude: (1) a capacity charge imposed as a condition for making a new connection to a water system, the proceeds of which are used to finance capital improvements, is not an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D, and thus it is not subject to article XIII D\u2019s restrictions on assessments; (2) a fire suppression fee imposed as a condition for making a new connection to a water system, the proceeds of which are used to purchase firefighting and emergency medical equipment, is not a property-related fee or charge under article XIII D, and thus it is not subject to article XIII D\u2019s prohibition against property-related fees and charges for general governmental services; and (3) an ordinance enacted by a community services district to impose a water connection fee may be amended by a resolution. Because these conclusions are consistent with the trial court\u2019s judgment but inconsistent with part of the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion, we will reverse that court\u2019s judgment with directions to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Because neither party petitioned the Court of Appeal for a rehearing, we take the facts largely from that court\u2019s opinion. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 28(c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Defendant Shasta Community Services District (the District) is a local public entity organized under the community services district law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61000 et seq.). It operates a water system for residential and commercial users and a volunteer fire department that provides both fire suppression and emergency medical services. In February 1994, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>adopted an ordinance (No. 1-94) establishing a \u201cstandard connection fee\u201d of $2,000, plus the cost of a water meter, for new water service connections. According to the ordinance, this fee included a capacity charge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of $600 for future improvements to the water system and a fire suppression charge of $400. The ordinance did not expressly allocate the remaining $1,000, but one may infer that it covered the cost of installing the water service connection because the ordinance also provided that if the water main was not on the same side of the street or highway as the property to be served, \u201cthe District will charge the actual cost of the connection to the extent such cost exceed [sic] the sum of $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In November 1997, the District adopted a resolution (No. 10-97) to amend this ordinance. According to the resolution, applicants for new water service connections would be required to pay: (1) a \u201cstandard connection fee\u201d; (2) the actual cost of a water meter; and (3) if the property owner chose to have the District install the service connection, the \u201cactual cost of the materials, labor, and overhead\u201d for installing the \u201centire service connection including the meter, line setter, meter box, appurtenant equipment, and mainline extension, if any.\u201d The \u201cstandard connection fee\u201d consisted of a $3,176 capacity charge for capital improvements to the water system and a $400 fire suppression charge. The resolution stated that the $3,176 capacity charge was \u201cbased upon estimated project costs of $762,300 for future improvements assigned to the new development of 240 future connections which equals $3,176 per connection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In March 1998, plaintiffs Jerry Richmond, Linda Panich, Hank Edelstein, and Victoria Edelstein, both individually and doing business as a joint venture, brought this action to test the validity of the resolution increasing the fees for new connections. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 860; Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 66013, 66022.) They alleged that they owned real property within the District and also within an area proposed for annexation into the District. They challenged the resolution on many grounds, only three of which are relevant here: (1) The resolution imposed an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D, but the District had not satisfied the constitutional requirements for imposing an assessment; (2) the $400 fire suppression charge was a \u201cfee\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d within the meaning of article XIII D, and it violated article XIII D\u2019s prohibition against fees or charges for general governmental services; and (3) the 1994 ordinance could be amended only by another ordinance, not by a mere resolution. Plaintiffs requested a declaratory judgment that the resolution was void and a permanent injunction restraining the District from enforcing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>The action was tried to the court without a jury. At the trial, the District presented evidence showing, among other things, that the capital improvements to be funded by the $3,176 capacity charge, including a new 500,000-gallon storage tank, would both remedy existing deficiencies in the water system and expand the system\u2019s ability to provide service to new customers through new connections. The $3,176 charge was calculated by allocating 50 percent of the cost of the improvements to new connections and 50 percent to existing connections. Water customers throughout the district would benefit from the improvements, but customers in certain higher-elevation areas would receive somewhat less benefit than other customers. After considering the evidence, the superior court granted judgment for the District. The court concluded: (1) The connection fee imposed by resolution No. 10-97 is not a special assessment but a development fee exempt from article XIH D; (2) the fire suppression charge is merely the continuation of a fee imposed before article XIII D was enacted; and (3) the connection fee could legally be adopted by a resolution (enactment of an ordinance was not required).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment, except as to the fire suppression charge. The court reasoned that the District\u2019s connection fee was not an assessment within the meaning of article Xm D because that constitutional provision by implication defines an assessment as a charge imposed on specific identified parcels, whereas the connection fee was not imposed on identified parcels. Because the connection fee was imposed only when a property owner requested a new service connection, the specific properties for which connections would be sought could not be identified (although the number of such requests could be estimated), and thus the connection charge could not be characterized as an assessment. The Court of Appeal also concluded that the connection fee, because it was incurred only when the owner voluntarily requested a new service connection, was properly characterized as a development fee, and as such it was exempt from the requirements of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">With respect to the fire suppression charge, however, the Court of Appeal accepted plaintiff\u2019s argument that it was a fee for general governmental services prohibited by section 6, subdivision (b)(5), of article XIII D. The Court of Appeal rejected the District\u2019s argument that this provision did not apply to fees authorized by laws enacted before article XIII D became effective, but only to fees that were newly enacted or increased thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Finally, the Court of Appeal concluded that the District could validly use a resolution to amend an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>II. The Capacity Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">To determine whether the District\u2019s $3,176 capacity charge, imposed only on applicants for new service connections, violates article XIII D\u2019s restrictions on assessments, we must interpret our state Constitution. \u201cThe principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.\u201d <em>(Thompson </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 117, 122 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 46, 18 P.3d 1198].) The aim of constitutional interpretation is to determine and effectuate the intent of those who enacted the constitutional provision at issue. <em>(Ibid.) </em>To determine that intent, we begin by examining the constitutional text, giving the words their ordinary meanings. (Ibid.; accord, <em>Leone v. Medical Board </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 660, 665 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 61, 995 P.2d 191].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Section 2 of article XTTI D defines an \u201cassessment\u201d as \u201cany levy or charge upon real property ... for a special benefit conferred upon the real property . . . .\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (b).) It defines \u201cspecial benefit\u201d as \u201ca particular and distinct benefit over and above general benefits conferred on real property located in the district or to the public at large . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Section 4 of article XIII D establishes procedures and requirements for assessments. A local public agency may not impose an assessment, as defined in article XIIID, unless: (1) the agency identifies \u201call parcels which will have a special benefit conferred upon them and upon which an assessment will be imposed\u201d (art. XIII D, \u00a7 4, subd. (a)); (2) the agency obtains an engineer\u2019s report that supports the assessment (id., \u00a7 4, subd. (b)); (3) the assessment does not exceed the reasonable cost of the proportional special benefit conferred on the affected parcel <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 4, subds. (a) &amp; (f)); and (4) after giving notice to affected property owners and holding a public hearing, the agency does not receive a majority protest b\u00e1sed on ballots \u201cweighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 4, subds. (c)-(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">To determine what constitutes an assessment under article XIII D, it is necessary to consider not only article XIII D\u2019s definition of an assessment, but also the requirements and procedures that article XIII D imposes on assessments. Article XIII D requires that an agency imposing an assessment identify \u201call parcels which <em>will </em>have a special benefit conferred upon them and upon which an assessment <em>will </em>be imposed.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 4, subd. (a), italics added.) The agency then must give written notice of the proposed assessment to the owners of these identified parcels <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 4, subd. (c)) and provide an opportunity for a protest using ballots \u201cweighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property\u201d (id., \u00a7 4, subd. (e)).</p>\n<p id=\"AAL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Because the capacity charge is imposed only on property owners who apply for a new service connection, the District cannot identify the parcels upon which the capacity charge will be imposed. Here, the District <em>estimated </em>that there would be 240 new connection applications, but the District did not and could not <em>identify </em>the specific parcels for which new connection applications would be made. At most, the District can identify the parcels within its boundaries on which the capacity charge <em>would </em>be imposed <em>if </em>the owners applied for a service connection. But the matter is more complex, because many existing undeveloped parcels would likely be subdivided into an indeterminable number of smaller parcels, for each of which a connection might be requested, thus making it impossible to now determine \u201cthe proportional financial obligation of the affected property.\u201d And even this understates the problem, because owners of property outside the District\u2019s boundaries may seek service connections by applying for annexation of their property into the District. Therefore, it is impossible for the District to comply with article XIII D\u2019s requirement that the agency identify the parcels on which the assessment will be imposed and provide an opportunity for a majority protest weighted according to the proportional financial obligation of the affected property.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeal that the proper conclusion to be drawn from this impossibility of compliance is that an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D must not only confer a special benefit on real property, but also be imposed on identifiable parcels of real property. Because the District does not impose the capacity charge on identifiable parcels, but only on individuals who request a new service connection, the capacity charge is not an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">This construction is consistent with settled rules of constitutional interpretation. \u201cCourts construe constitutional phrases liberally and practically; where possible they avoid a literalism that effects absurd, arbitrary, or unintended results.\u201d <em>(Carman </em>v. <em>Alvord </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 318, 327 [182 Cal.Rptr. 506, 644 R2d 192]; see also <em>California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1133, 1147 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 693, 899 P.2d 79] [\u201ca practical construction is preferred\u201d].) Construing article XIII D\u2019s definition of assessment as applying only to charges imposed on identifiable parcels avoids the probably unintended result of prohibiting local water districts from imposing capacity charges, no matter how modest or reasonable, for new connections because of the inherent impossibility of identifying in advance the parcels for which new connections would later be requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">This construction is also consistent with article XIII D\u2019s definition of an assessment as a \u201clevy or charge <em>upon real property </em>. . . .\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>subd. (b), italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District does not impose the capacity charge on real property as such, but on individuals who apply for new service connections. It is the applicant who must pay, and the District may not impose a lien or otherwise have recourse to the property to compel payment. Rather, the District simply does not initiate water service until the charge is paid. A charge that operates in this way cannot be described as a charge upon real property, within the .meaning of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Finally, this construction is consistent with the aim of Proposition 218 to enhance taxpayer consent. Here, the District proposed to divide the costs of new capital improvements between users receiving service through existing connections and users applying for new connections. This case concerns only imposition of costs on new connections. Presumably, any costs imposed on customers receiving service through existing connections would be subject to article XIII D\u2019s voter approval requirements, and thus their consent. Customers who apply for new connections give consent by the act of applying. Moreover, water connection fees are already subject to significant constraints under Government Code section 66013.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Plaintiffs rely on this court\u2019s decision in <em>San Marcos Water Dist. </em>v. <em>San Marcos Unified School Dist. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 154 [228 Cal.Rptr. 47, 720 P.2d 935] <em>(San Marcos). </em>The issue there was whether a provision of the state Constitution exempting public entities from payment of property taxes (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)) applied to a local water district\u2019s capacity fee, used to fund capital improvements to the water system. The constitutional property tax exemption for public entities had been construed to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>special assessments, but not user fees, and thus the issue presented to this court was whether the capacity charge was more properly characterized as a special assessment or as a user fee for purposes of this constitutional provision. We concluded that a capacity charge was a hybrid, in the sense that it had some characteristics of a user fee and some characteristics of an assessment. <em>(San Marcos, supra, </em>at p. 163.) We concluded also, however, that the fee should be considered an assessment for purposes of the public entity property tax exemption. We established a bright-line rule that \u201ca fee aimed at assisting a utility district to defray costs of capital improvements will be deemed a special assessment from which other public entities are exempt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 164\u2014165.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><em>San Marcos, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 154, is not on point here. We were not there construing the term \u201cassessment\u201d as used in article XIII D; instead, we were construing the constitutional provision exempting public entities from property taxes (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 3, subd. (b)), a provision in which the term \u201cassessment\u201d does not appear. In deciding what constituted an assessment in <em>San Marcos, </em>we sought to determine and effectuate the constitutional purpose for exempting public entities from property taxes, a purpose that plays no role in interpreting the provisions of article XIII D that are at issue here. The characteristic that we found determinative for identifying assessments in <em>San </em>Marcos\u2014that the proceeds of the fee were used for capital improvements\u2014 forms no part of article XIII D\u2019s definition of assessments. For each of these reasons, we agree with the Court of Appeal that <em>San Marcos </em>is not helpful, much less controlling, in this strikingly different context. (See <em>Ginns </em>v. <em>Savage </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 520, 524, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 377, 393 P.2d 689] [\u201cLanguage used in any opinion is of course to be understood in the light of the facts and the issue then before the court, and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154] [a word may have different legal meanings in different contexts]; <em>In re Marriage of Buol </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 751, 757, fn. 6 [218 Cal.Rptr. 31, 705 P.2d 354] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Plaintiffs invoke the rule that when a term has been given a particular meaning by a judicial decision, it should be presumed to have the same meaning in later-enacted statutes or constitutional provisions. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hurtado </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 1179, 1188-1189 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 52 P.3d 116]; <em>Arnett v. Dal Cielo </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 4, 19 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 923 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>P.2d 1].) Plaintiffs argue that <em>San Marcos, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 154, gave the term \u201cassessment\u201d a precise legal meaning as applying to capacity charges used to fund capital improvements, and therefore the term \u201cassessment\u201d in article XIII D, enacted after <em>San Marcos, </em>must be construed to have the same meaning. But the rule that plaintiffs invoke does not apply when, as here, the statute or constitutional provision contains its own definition of the term at issue: \u201cIf the Legislature has -provided an express definition of a term, that definition ordinarily is binding on the courts.\u201d <em>(Curie </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 16 P.3d 166].)  Here, article XIII D provides both an express definition of assessment and an implied qualification of that definition through the requirement that the agency identify the specific parcels on which the assessment will be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Plaintiffs next rely on the definition of assessment in Government Code section 53750, part of the Proposition 218 Omnibus Implementation Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 53750-53753) that the Legislature enacted in 1997. (Stats. 1997, ch. 38, \u00a7 5.) Government Code section 53750 states that \u201c[f]or purposes of Article XIII C and Article XIII D of the California Constitution\u201d an \u201cassessment\u201d means \u201cany levy or charge by an agency upon real property that is based upon the special benefit conferred upon the real property by a public improvement or service, that is imposed to pay the capital cost of the public improvement, the maintenance and operation expenses of the public improvement, or the cost of the service being provided.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53750, subd. (b).) As plaintiffs point out, this definition does not distinguish between charges imposed only in response to a request for service and charges imposed on previously identified parcels. In this respect, the statutory definition is no different from the constitutional definition in section 2, subdivision (b), of article XIII D. But the statutory provisions implementing article XIII D, like article XIII D itself, assume that assessments are imposed only on identified parcels. Under Government Code section 53753, subdivision (b), before levying a new or increased assessment, an agency must give notice \u201cto the record owner of each identified parcel.\u201d Government Code section 53750, subdivision (g), defines an \u201cidentified parcel\u201d as \u201ca parcel of real property that an agency has identified as having a special benefit conferred upon it and upon which a proposed assessment is to be imposed . . . .\u201d Because the statutory provisions merely reflect the constitutional provisions, they do not alter our conclusion that under article XIII D an assessment is a charge imposed on previously identified parcels, and not a charge imposed only as a condition of extending service through a new service connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Arguing that a charge imposed only on property owners who voluntarily seek a governmental service or approval may properly be characterized as an assessment, plaintiffs call our attention to the Integrated Financing District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53175 et seq.), under which local agencies may establish \u201ccontingent assessments\u201d payable only when a landowner applies for development approval. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 53187.) As plaintiffs point out, the Integrated Financing District Act includes notice and majority protest provisions for owners of property subject to the contingent assessment <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 53183). (See <em>Southern Pacific Pipe Lines, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 451, 461-462 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 745].) We agree that the District\u2019s capacity charge is similar to a contingent assessment under the Integrated Financing District Act, but this observation does not assist plaintiffs. Unlike article XIII D, the Integrated Financing District Act does not require a local agency to identify in advance the particular parcels that <em>will be </em>subject to the assessment. Instead, the notice of intention to impose a contingent assessment goes to all owners of property within the proposed assessment zone, and the assessment cannot be imposed if protested by \u201cthe owners of more than one-half of the area of the property within the proposed . . . district which is proposed to be subject to the contingent assessment immediately or in the future . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 53183, subd. (d).) Thus, under the Integrated Financing District Act, in contrast to article XIII D, all owners of property <em>potentially </em>subject to a charge are entitled to notice and a weighted vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Article XIII D could have been written, like the Integrated Financing District Act, to cover contingent assessments as well as assessments imposed only on previously identified parcels. But it was not written in that manner, and we remain persuaded that a capacity charge contingent on some voluntary action by the property owner is not an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Plaintiffs argue that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing the District\u2019s capacity charge as a development fee. Observing that development fees \u201care imposed only if a property owner elects to develop\u201d <em>(Loyola Marymount University v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1267 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 424]), the Court of Appeal reasoned that the District\u2019s capacity charge, because it was imposed only in response to a property owner\u2019s voluntary decision to request a service connection, should be considered a development fee and thus exempt from the requirements of article XIII D under its section 1, subdivision (b), stating that \u201c[n]othing in this article . . . shall be construed to . . . [a]ffect existing laws relating to the imposition of fees or charges as a condition of property development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Plaintiffs insist that the District\u2019s capacity charge cannot be a development fee because the District has no authority to approve or disapprove property development, and because a property owner may request a new service connection without proposing any new development, such as when the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>of a previously developed residential parcel decides to use the District\u2019s water instead of water from an existing well on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">We agree with plaintiffs that the District\u2019s capacity charge is not a development fee. It is similar to a development fee in being imposed only in response to a property owner\u2019s voluntary application to a public entity, but it is different in that the application may be only for a water service connection without necessarily involving any development of the property. (See <em>Utility Cost Management </em>v. <em>Indian Wells Valley Water Dist., supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 1191 [noting that a capacity charge \u201cmight apply regardless of whether a development project is at issue\u201d]; <em>Capistrano Beach Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Taj Development Corp. </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 524, 530 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 382] [concluding that a capacity charge is not a development fee under the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66000 et seq.)].) Our agreement that the capacity charge is not a development fee does not assist plaintiffs, however, because it does not mean that the capacity charge is an assessment within the meaning of article XIII D. The capacity charge is neither an assessment nor a development fee under article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We conclude, as did the trial court and the Court of Appeal, that the District\u2019s capacity charge is not an assessment under article XITT D.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">III. The Fire Suppression Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Article XIII D provides: \u201cNo fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental services including, but not limited to, police, <em>fire, </em>ambulance or library services, where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (b)(5), italics added.) At the trial below, the evidence showed that the District uses the proceeds of the fire suppression component of the connection fee to purchase equipment for its volunteer fire department, including both firefighting equipment and emergency medical equipment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fire department provides firefighting and emergency medical services to the public at large. Accordingly, the District\u2019s fire suppression charge is \u201cimposed for general governmental services\u201d within the meaning of section 6, subdivision (b)(5), of article XIII D, and it is prohibited by that provision if it satisfies article XIII D\u2019s definition of a \u201cfee or charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Article XIII D defines a \u201cfee\u201d or \u201ccharge\u201d as \u201cany levy other than an ad valorem tax, a special tax, or an assessment, imposed by an agency upon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership, including a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (e).) It defines \u201cproperty-related service\u201d as \u201ca public service having a direct relationship to property ownership.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The District argues that the connection fee, including its fire suppression component, does not fall within article XIII D\u2019s definition of a fee or charge because it is not imposed \u201cupon a parcel or upon a person as an incident of property ownership.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e).) The District does not impose the fee on parcels of real property but on persons who apply for a water service connection. The District does not impose the fee on such persons \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d but instead as an incident of their voluntary decisions to request water service. If a person fails to pay the connection fee, the District does not collect it by levying upon the person\u2019s property. Rather, because the person applying for service has not satisfied a condition for extending service, the District does not make the water connection and does not provide water service.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We agree that a connection charge, because it is not imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d (art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e)), is not a fee or charge under article XIII D. A connection fee is not imposed simply by virtue of property ownership, but instead it is imposed as an incident of the voluntary act of the property owner in applying for a service connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Urging a different constmction, plaintiffs rely on article XIII D\u2019s definition of a fee or charge as \u201cincluding a user fee or charge for a property-related service.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd. (e).) They argue that supplying water is a \u201cproperty-related service,\u201d and, therefore, all charges for water service must be deemed to be imposed \u201cupon a person as an incident of property ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">We agree that supplying water is a \u201cproperty-related service\u201d within the meaning of article XIII D\u2019s definition of a fee or charge. In the ballot pamphlet for the election at which article XIII D was adopted, the Legislative Analyst stated that \u201c[f]ees for water, sewer, and refuse collection service probably meet the measure\u2019s definition of property-related fee.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1996), analysis of Prop. 218 by Legis. Analyst, p. 73.) The Legislative Analyst apparently concluded that water service has a direct relationship to property ownership, and thus is a property-related service within the meaning of article XIIID because water is indispensable to most uses of real property; because water is provided through pipes that are physically connected to the property; and because a water provider may, by recording a certificate, obtain a lien on the property for the amount of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>delinquent service charges (see Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 61621, 61621.3). But the Legislative Analyst was apparently referring to fees imposed on existing water service customers, not fees imposed as a condition of initiating water service in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Several provisions of article XIII D tend to confirm the Legislative Analyst\u2019s conclusion that charges for utility services such as electricity and water should be understood as charges imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership.\u201d For example, subdivision (b) of section 3 provides that \u201cfees for the provision of electrical or gas service shall not be deemed charges or fees imposed as an incident of property ownership\u201d under article XIII D. Under the rule of construction that the expression of some things in a statute implies the exclusion of other things not expressed <em>(In re Bryce C. </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 226, 231 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 120, 906 P.2d 1275]), the expression that electrical and gas service charges are not within the category of property-related fees implies that similar charges for other utility services, such as water and sewer, are property-related fees subject to the restrictions of article XIII D.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">This implication is reinforced by subdivision (c) of article X1H D, section 6, which expressly excludes \u201cfees or charges for sewer, water, and refuse collection services\u201d from the voter approval requirements that article XIII D imposes on property-related fees and charges. Because article XIII D does not include similar express exemptions from the other requirements that it imposes on property-related fee and charges, the implication is strong that fees for water, sewer, and refuse collection services are subject to those other requirements. (See <em>Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. v. City of Roseville </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 637, 645 [119 Cal.Rptr.2d 91] [reaching the same conclusion].)</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Thus, we agree that water service fees, being fees for property-related services, may be fees or charges within the meaning of article XIII D. But we do not agree that <em>all </em>water service charges are necessarily subject to the restrictions that article XIII D imposes on fees and charges. Rather, we conclude that a water service fee is a fee or charge under article XIIID if, but only if, it is imposed \u201cupon a person as an incident of property ownership.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 2, subd. (e).) A fee for ongoing water service through an existing connection is imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d because it requires nothing other than normal ownership and use of property. But a fee for making a new connection to the system is not imposed \u201cas an incident of property ownership\u201d because it results from the owner\u2019s voluntary decision to apply for the connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Any doubt on this point is removed by considering the requirements that article XIII D imposes on property-related fees and charges. As with assessments, article XIII D requires local government agencies to identify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>parcels affected by a property-related fee or charge. Specifically, it requires the agency to identify \u201c[t]he parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for imposition.\u201d (Art. XIII D, \u00a7 6, subd. (a)(1).) As we have explained, it is impossible for the District to comply with such a requirement for connection charges, because the District cannot determine in advance which property owners will apply for water service connection. As with assessments, this impossibility of compliance strongly suggests that connection fees for new users are not subject to article XIII D\u2019s restrictions on property-related fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Because the connection fee, including the fire suppression charge, is not a property-related fee or charge within the meaning of article XIII D, it is not subject to article XIII D\u2019s prohibition on property-related fees or charges for general governmental services.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">IV. Amendment of an Ordinance by a Resolution</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Government Code section 66016, part of the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66000 et seq.), provides in subdivision (b): \u201cAny action by a local agency to levy a new fee or service charge or to approve an increase in an existing fee or service charge shall be taken only by ordinance <em>or </em>resolution.\u201d (Italics added.) We agree with the Court of Appeal that this provision authorizes the District to use a resolution to increase existing connection fees, and that this authorization applies even when the fees were initially imposed by an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Arguing to the contrary, plaintiffs assert that the Mitigation Fee Act is procedural rather than substantive. In other words, it does not give local water districts substantive authority to impose fees, but instead it merely regulates the manner in which fees may be imposed. But whether a fee imposed by ordinance may be amended by resolution is essentially a question of procedure, not substance. Therefore, we may and do construe Government Code section 66016 as giving the District authority to use a resolution to amend a fee ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">In support of their position that the District may not use a resolution to amend an ordinance imposing a connection fee, plaintiffs rely on <em>Cavalier Acres, Inc. v. San Simeon Acres Community Services District </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 798 [199 Cal.Rptr. 4] <em>(Cavalier Acres), </em>in which the Court of Appeal concluded that a community services district could impose or increase water charges only by ordinance. In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Cavalier Acres </em>Court of Appeal relied on Government Code section 61621.5 and Health and Safety Code section 5471. Relying on the rule of construction that when two statutory provisions conflict, the one that is more specific controls, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the <em>Cavalier Acres </em>Court of Appeal stated that, as applied to water charges imposed by a community services district, Government Code section 61621.5 and Health and Safety Code section 5471 were both more specific than Government Code section 66016.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Government Code section 61621.5 is part of the Community Services District Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61000 et seq.). As here relevant, it provides; \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this section, a district may <em>by ordinance </em>adopt regulations binding upon all persons to govern the construction and use of its facilities and property, including regulations imposing reasonable charges for the use thereof.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61621.5, subd. (a), italics added.) By its terms, this provision applies only to charges for the use of a community services district\u2019s facilities, not charges for its <em>services. </em>The Community Services District Law gives districts authority to impose charges for services, including charges for water, in a different section, Government Code section 61621. (See <em>Waterman Convalescent Hospital, Inc. v. Jurupa Community Services Dist. </em>(1996) 53 Cal.App.4th 1550, 1552-1553 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 264].) As relevant here, it provides: \u201cA district may prescribe, revise and collect rates or other charges for the services and facilities furnished by it . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61621.) Nothing in this provision requires a community services district to act by ordinance rather than by resolution when, as here, it revises and prescribes the charges for water service.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Health and Safety Code section 5471 is part of article 4 (\u201cSanitation and Sewerage Systems\u201d) of chapter 6 (\u201cGeneral Provisions with Respect to Sewers\u201d) of part 3 (\u201cCommunity Facilities\u201d) of division 5 (\u201cSanitation\u201d) of the Health and Safety Code. As relevant here, it reads: \u201cIn addition to the powers granted in the principal act, <em>any entity </em>shall have power, <em>by an ordinance </em>approved by a two-thirds vote of the members of the legislative body thereof, to prescribe, revise and collect, fees, tolls, rates, rentals, or other charges, including <em>water, </em>sewer standby or immediate availability charges, for services and facilities furnished by it, either within or without its territorial limits, in connection with its <em>water, </em>sanitation, storm drainage, or sewerage system. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Health and Safety Code section 5471 does not apply to the District because it is not an \u201centity\u201d within the meaning of this provision. Health and Safety Code section 5470 states that \u201c \u2018[e]ntity\u2019 means and includes counties, cities and counties, cities, sanitary districts, county sanitation districts, sewer maintenance districts, and other public corporations and districts authorized to acquire, construct, maintain and operate sanitary sewers and sewerage systems.\u201d The District is a public agency organized as a community services district under the Community Services District Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61000 et seq.) to provide water service. Nothing in the record indicates it is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to construct, maintain, or operate sewers or sewerage systems. In this respect, <em>Cavalier Acres, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 798, is distinguishable because the community services district at issue there provided both water and sewer services. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 800.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Moreover, even if we assume that Health and Safety Code section 5471 applies to the District, that provision, by its terms, confers authority \u201c[i]n addition to\u201d the authority otherwise granted to a public entity. In other words, its main purpose is to supplement rather than to limit a public agency\u2019s authority to impose charges for water or sewer services in connection with a water or sewerage system. For a public agency organized as a community services district, the \u201cprincipal act\u201d <em>(ibid.) </em>providing its authority is the Community Services District Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 61000 et seq.). As we have seen, Government Code section 61621 authorizes community services districts to establish charges for water services without requiring that they act by ordinance rather than by resolution, and Government Code section 66016, part of the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code, \u00a7 66000 et seq.), expressly authorizes districts to use either a resolution or an ordinance to impose or increase a service charge. We do not read Health and Safety Code section 5471 as limiting or abrogating that authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Again, we find <em>Cavalier Acres, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.3d 798, to be distinguishable. In 1984, when the Court of Appeal decided <em>Cavalier Acres, </em>the wording of Health and Safety Code section 5471 was materially different. The introductory phrase (\u201cIn addition to the powers granted in the principal act\u201d) was not present, having been added later by amendment. (Stats. 1988, ch. 706, \u00a7 1, p. 2348.) The 1988 amendment demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s intent that Health and Safety Code section 5471 not be read as limiting the powers conferred on public entities by the laws under which they were organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Before beginning to provide water service to real property through a new connection, the District requires its new customers to pay a capacity fee and a fire suppression fee. Both of these fees are used to firnd capital improvements, the former to the water system and the latter to the volunteer fire department. Because these fees are imposed only on the self-selected group of water service applicants, and not on real property that the District has identified or is able to identify, and because neither fee can ever become a charge on the property itself, we conclude that neither fee is subject to the restrictions that article XIII D imposes on property assessments and property-related fees. We also conclude that the District could properly use a resolution to amend an ordinance establishing these fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed and the matter is remanded to that court with directions to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">George, C.

Code, \u00a7 66013, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> In this regard, it may be instructive to compare article XIII D\u2019s definition of an assessment as a \u201clevy or charge upon real property\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 2, subd.
