Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 2935), is subject-to the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law\u2019s limitation on postsentence credits to 20 percent of the prisoner\u2019s sentence. (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (c)(5) (hereinafter section 667(c)(5)), 1170.12, subd. (a)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">We conclude that a \u201creduction of the sentence\u201d under section 2935 is distinct from credits under the Three Strikes law, and thus, is not subject to its 20 percent limitation. (\u00a7\u00a7 667(c)(5), 1170.12, subd. (a)(5).) Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which held to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Factual And Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">This background is largely taken from the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">In 1996, petitioner Ronnie E. Young pleaded guilty to first degree burglary and was sentenced to nine years in state prison. He also had a prior felony conviction, which subjected him to the Three Strikes law. In January 2001, while serving his prison sentence, petitioner saved the life of his work supervisor, Bud Stocking, by performing the Heimlich maneuver and dislodging food blocking Stocking\u2019s airway. Stocking had motioned another inmate to help, but that inmate refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>Petitioner requested the Department of Corrections (Department) to reduce his sentence based on this event. (\u00a7 2935.) Stocking expressed gratitude to petitioner for his actions, but the Department denied petitioner\u2019s request because he had already been awarded the maximum amount of credit permitted under the Three Strikes law. (\u00a7\u00a7 667(c)(5), 1170.12, subd. (a)(5).) Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which the superior court summarily denied. The Court of Appeal issued an order to show cause, but later denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Relying on what it considered to be the plain language of section 667, the Court of Appeal majority held that the sentence reduction under section 2935 is subject to the 20 percent limitation of credits under section 667(c)(5). The majority concluded, \u201cIt would elevate form over substance to conclude that a reduction differs from a credit.\u201d However, the majority reached its conclusion \u201cregretfully\u201d: \u201cWe publish this opinion to urge the Legislature to amend section 667 so that such an inmate is theoretically eligible to receive a reduction of sentence pursuant to section 2935.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Presiding Justice Gilbert, in dissent, agreed with petitioner that section 2935\u2019s sentence reduction was unrelated to credits under the Three Strikes law. He found it significant that section 667(c)(5) and section 2935 employ different language. He joined the majority\u2019s urging to amend section 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Defendants who are serving their determinate prison sentences may earn prison conduct credits to \u201cshorten the period of incarceration.\u201d <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 38, 40 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 37 P.3d 403]; \u00a7\u00a7 2931 [good behavior/participation credit available to persons who committed crimes before 1983], 2933 [worktime credits].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">Another way defendants may shorten their period of incarceration is by performing a heroic act under section 2935. The Three Strikes law, however, limits the amount of credits available under article 2.5 to 20 percent of the defendant\u2019s sentence. (\u00a7\u00a7 667(c)(5), 1170.12, subd. (a)(5).) The question is, does a \u201creduction of the sentence\u201d under section 2935 constitute a credit for purposes of the Three Strikes law? We conclude that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">As part of the Three Strikes law amending section 667 in 1994, section 667(c)(5) provides that a recidivist prisoner\u2019s postsentence conduct credits may not exceed 20 percent of the sentence: \u201cNotwithstanding any other law ... [][].. . [t]he total amount of credits awarded pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 shall not exceed one-fifth of the total term of imprisonment imposed and shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>accrue until the defendant is physically placed in the state prison.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Martinez </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 29, 34 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 921, 65 P.3d 411] [\u201crecidivist with a prior strike may earn postsentence credits only up to 20 percent of the total prison sentence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Enacted in 1982 and not amended since then, section 2935 provides in full: \u201cUnder the guidelines prescribed by the rules and regulations of the director,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Director of Corrections may grant up to 12 additional months of reduction of the sentence to a prisoner who has performed a heroic act in a life-threatening situation, or who has provided exceptional assistance in maintaining the safety and security of a prison.\u201d (See <em>Dix v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 442, 462-463 [279 Cal.Rptr. 834, 807 P.2d 1063].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Our task is to determine the meaning of and relationship between sections 667(c)(5) and 2935 in this context. \u201cWe begin by examining the words of the respective statutes; if the statutory language is not ambiguous, then we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citations.] If, however, the statutory language lacks clarity, we may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] In such situations, we strive to select the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature\u2019s apparent intent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes\u2019 general purposes.\u201d <em>(People v. Walker </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 577, 581 [128 Cal.Rptr.2d 75, 59 P3d 150].)</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The Three Strikes law\u2019s limitation on postsentence credits applies \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other law.\u201d (\u00a7 667(c)(5).) We recently affirmed that this language \u201c \u2018eliminates potential conflicts between alternative sentencing schemes\u2019 by providing that for defendants with a qualifying prior conviction, the Three Strikes law \u2018takes the place of whatever law would otherwise determine . . . sentence for the current offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Acosta </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 132 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 435, 52 P.3d 624] [\u00a7 667, subd. (f)(1)].) By its own terms, section 667(c)(5) applies to \u201ccredits awarded pursuant to Article 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) . . . .\u201d Thus, we have held that section 2933, governing prison worktime credits, is subject to section 667(c)(5)\u2019s 20 percent limitation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buckhalter </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 20, 32 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 25 P.3d 1103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Although agreeing that section 2935 is part of article 2.5, petitioner maintains that section 2935 does not include the term \u201ccredits,\u201d and cites other provisions in article 2.5 that do include that term. As such, \u201cpetitioner submits that when the Legislature subsequently used the term credits, as it did in section 667, it should be construed to refer only to statutes using that term.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Section 2935 gives the Director of Corrections discretion to grant a prisoner up to \u201c12 additional months of reduction of the sentence\u201d for performing a heroic act. Unlike section 2935, provisions governing good behavior and participation credits available to persons who committed crimes before 1983 (\u00a7 2931), worktime credits (\u00a7 2933), and those provisions referring to sections 2931 or 2933 in article 2.5 (\u00a7\u00a7 2932, 2932.5, 2933.1, 2933.2, 2933.3, 2933.6, 2934) all include the term \u201ccredit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">The absence of the term \u201ccredit\u201d in section 2935 is significant because the 20 percent limitation expressly applies to \u201ccredits\u201d awarded under article 2.5. (\u00a7 667(c)(5).) \u201cWhere a statute referring to one subject contains a critical word or phrase, omission of that word or phrase from a similar statute on the same subject generally shows a different legislative intent.\u201d <em>(Craven v. Crout </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 779, 783 [209 Cal.Rptr. 649].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, section 190, which sets forth the punishment for murder, provides that \u201cArticle 2.5 (commencing with Section 2930) of Chapter 7 of Title 1 of Part 3 shall not apply to reduce any minimum term of a sentence imposed pursuant to this section.\u201d (\u00a7 190, subd. (e).) In contrast to section 667(c)(5), section 190, subdivision (e), contains broad language that would arguably govern any \u201creduction\u201d under section 2935. Finally, the term \u201cadditional\u201d in section 2935 suggests that a sentence reduction under this provision is above and beyond the credit available under sections 2931 and 2933. This interpretation would avoid rendering the term \u201cadditional\u201d superfluous. (Pe<em>ople v. Aguilar </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1023, 1030 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 655, 945 P.2d 1204].)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The legislative history of the Three Strikes law also supports this conclusion. That history suggests that the 20 percent limitation applies to only postsentence conduct credits in article 2.5 (e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 2931, 2933). The revised analysis of Assembly Bill No. 971, which amended section 667, stated: \u201cThis bill provides that: [f] . . . [f] 2. A person who has been convicted of one or more prior serious or violent felonies be limited to <em>good-time/work-time credits </em>not to exceed one-fifth of the total term of imprisonment imposed, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>any new felony.\u201d (Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Rep. to Sen. Rules Com. on Assem. Bill No. 971 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 2, 1994, p. 1, italics added; <em>In re Cervera </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 1073, 1083-1084 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 762, 16 P.3d 176] (cone. opn. of Werdegar, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">The difference between a sentence reduction and a credit is not merely semantic in this context. There is a qualitative difference between a sentence reduction based on a heroic act (\u00a7 2935) and postsentence conduct credits (\u00a7\u00a7 2931, 2933). Sections 2931 and 2933 serve to encourage a prisoner\u2019s conformity to prison regulations and his participation in rehabilitative activities to facilitate reintegration into society. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saffell </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 223, 233 [157 Cal.Rptr. 897, 599 P.2d 92]; <em>People v. Caruso </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 13, 19 [207 Cal.Rptr. 221].) By working and not engaging in misconduct in prison, i.e., activities that generally affect only the prisoner himself, a prisoner may earn credits toward reducing his determinate sentence. (\u00a7\u00a7 2931, 2932, 2933.) Section 2935, however, is substantially different because it rewards a prisoner\u2019s selfless act of heroism, which may save the life of another. In this case, petitioner saved the life of his work supervisor when another prisoner refused to help. As petitioner emphasizes, his heroic act in prison was particularly significant because other prisoners may have become hostile toward him for helping \u201cthe enemy,\u201d and prison guards could have misconstrued petitioner\u2019s actions as attacking rather than saving the supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">The Legislature has treated a heroic act reduction (\u00a7 2935) differently than conduct credits in other respects also. For instance, section 2932, subdivision (a)(1), provides that \u201cany time credit accumulated pursuant to Section 2931 or to Section 2933\u201d may be \u201cdenied or lost\u201d under certain circumstances. In contrast, section 2935 is not subject to section 2932\u2019s limitations. Thus, a one-time sentence reduction for a heroic act, which act will presumably occur infrequently, may not be denied or lost either partially or completely based on a prisoner\u2019s misconduct.  Indeed, unlike sections 2931 arid 2933, section 2935 by its own terms is not expressly limited to determinate sentences. (\u00a7\u00a7 2931, subd. (a) [provision applicable to sentences under \u00a7 1170], 2933, subd. (a) [same]; <em>People v. Buckhalter, supra, 26 </em>Cal.4th at p. 31; but see \u00a7 190, subd. (e) [\u201cArticle 2.5 .. . shall not apply to reduce any minimum term of a sentence imposed pursuant to this section\u201d].) These differences further demonstrate that the Legislature considered a sentence reduction under section 2935 qualitatively and functionally distinct from postsentence conduct credits (\u00a7\u00a7 2931, 2933).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">In prison, where correctional officers and other employees face substantial dangers already, encouraging prisoners to behave in a manner that might save lives is commendable and necessary. A contrary interpretation of sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>667(c)(5) and 2935 would create a disincentive for Three Strikes prisoners who have reached their maximum credit limit to \u201cperform[] a heroic act in a life-threatening situation.\u201d (\u00a7 2935.) It is difficult to imagine that the Legislature intended to give all prisoners, <em>except </em>those Three Strikes prisoners, an incentive to save another\u2019s life. Moreover, as petitioner notes, subjecting section 2935 to the 20 percent limitation under section 667(c)(5) could create, the anomalous result of rewarding prison misconduct. For instance, if two Three Strikes prisoners who have reached their 20 percent limit both perform a heroic act, only the prisoner who engages in misconduct and thus loses time credit under section 2932 would be eligible for a sentence reduction under section 2935.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The purpose of the Three Strikes law is \u201cto ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\u201d (\u00a7 667, subd. (b) [legislative intent applicable to subds. (b)-(i) inclusive].) Allowing. Three Strikes prisoners to receive at most a one-year sentence reduction for performing a heroic act (\u00a7 2935) does not undermine this purpose: these recidivist prisoners are still serving longer sentences than first-time offenders. Moreover, \u201cour decisions make clear that this purpose is not a mantra that the prosecution can invoke in any Three Strikes case to compel the court to construe the statute so as to impose the longest possible sentence.\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 490, 501 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 280, 976 P.2d 831].)</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">We reverse the Court of Appeal\u2019s judgment and remand the cause for proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">George, C.
