The provision at issue exempted from coverage jewelry stolen from a vehicle unless the insured was \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u201d The question presented is whether the exception to that exclusion applies when the insured is not in the vehicle but is in close proximity to the vehicle and is attending to it when the theft occurs. We conclude the vehicle theft exclusion, as a whole, is ambiguous and fails to plainly and clearly alert insureds that there is no coverage if a theft occurs when the insured has stepped out of the vehicle but remains in close proximity and is attending to it. We therefore hold that coverage is not precluded as a matter of law and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The facts in this case are simple and essentially undisputed. On February 17, 2000, Brian Callahan, a jewelry salesman, left his home with two \u201chard cloth garment bags\u201d containing jewelry (some of which belonged to E.M.M.I. Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of jewelry) in the trunk of his vehicle. Shortly after driving away from his home, he heard a clanking noise emanating from the rear of the vehicle. Callahan stopped on the side of the road to investigate the source of the noise, got out of the car and closed the car door but left the engine running. He walked to the rear of the vehicle and, as he crouched down to visually inspect the exhaust pipes, he felt someone pass quickly by him. When he looked up, he saw an individual get into his car and drive away. Callahan was no more than approximately two feet from the car during the entire time he was outside the vehicle until the time of the theft. The police subsequently found the vehicle, but the jewelry was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">E.M.M.I. was insured under a jeweler\u2019s block insurance policy issued by Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich). The policy insured E.M.M.I. against \u201crisks of direct physical \u2018loss\u2019 to the covered [jewelry] except those causes of \u2018loss\u2019 listed in the Exclusions.\u201d Under \u201cExclusions\u201d the policy provided that Zurich would \u201cnot pay for \u2018loss\u2019 caused or resulting from . . . [t]heft from any vehicle unless, you, an employee, or other person whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>only duty is to attend to the vehicle are <em>actually in or upon </em>such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u201d (Italics added.) Callahan was specifically designated to carry E.M.M.I.\u2019s jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">E.M.M.I. submitted a claim to Zurich under the policy. Zurich\u2019s field adjuster was instructed to ascertain whether Callahan had been physically touching the car when the theft occurred, and therefore had been \u201cin or upon\u201d the car. Because E.M.M.I. was unable to show that Callahan had been physically touching the vehicle when the theft occurred, Zurich denied the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">On July 20, 2000, E.M.M.I. filed a lawsuit against Zurich for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unfair business practices. E.M.M.I. also sued its insurance agent, Vartan Karlubian, for professional negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The parties, E.M.M.I., Zurich, and Karlubian, subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication. The superior court granted Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied E.M.M.I.\u2019s and Karlubian\u2019s motions. The court found that \u201cwhere the insured was outside the car, crouched down, inspecting the underneath exhaust pipes, before the sequence of events of theft commenced, there unequivocally is no coverage under terms requiring the insured to be in or upon the vehicle at the time of theft.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The Court of Appeal affirmed the resulting judgment. It ruled that \u201c[although [the salesman] was in close proximity to the car, he was not actually in or upon it.\u201d We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Jeweler\u2019s block insurance, conceived at the turn of the last century, provides coverage under a single policy for the \u201cvarious risks inherent\u201d in the jewelry business. (Annot., Construction and Effect of \u201cJeweler\u2019s Block\u201d Policies or Provisions Contained Therein (1994) 22 A.L.R.5th 579; 1 Couch on Insurance (3d ed. 1997) \u00a7 1:57.) It \u201cis different from most other traditional forms of property insurance which are considered \u2018named-peril\u2019 insurance policies. Under named-peril policies, an insurer agrees to indemnify its insured for losses resulting from certain risks of loss or damage which are specifically enumerated within the provisions of the policy. In contrast, under a jewelers\u2019 block policy all risks of loss or damage to jewelry may be insured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>subject to certain exceptions.\u201d <em>(Star Diamond, Inc. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London </em>(E.D.Va. 1997) 965 F.Supp. 763, 765 <em>(Star Diamond).) </em>Thus, the coverage language in this type of insurance policy is quite broad, generally insuring against all losses not expressly excluded. In the present case, the policy excluded from coverage theft from a vehicle unless the insured or a designated employee was \u201cactually in or upon\u201d the vehicle at the time of the theft. As the Minnesota Supreme Court has observed, \u201cThe [exclusion] was obviously intended to cover any situation where a loss occurred when the property was not protected by the presence of someone in or upon the car . . . .\u201d <em>(Ruvelson, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1951) 235 Minn. 243, 251 [50 N.W.2d 629, 634] <em>(Ruvelson).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">A. <em>Rules Governing Interpretation of Insurance Policies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">As a question of law, the interpretation of an insurance policy is reviewed de novo under well-settled rules of contract interpretation. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619] <em>(Waller).) </em>\u201cThe fundamental rules of contract interpretation are based on the premise that the interpretation of a contract must give effect to the \u2018mutual intention\u2019 of the parties. \u2018Under statutory rules of contract interpretation, the mutual intention of the parties at the time the contract is formed governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1639.) The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u201d <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1644), controls judicial interpretation. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 1638.)\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">A policy provision is ambiguous when it is susceptible to two or more reasonable constructions. <em>(Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18.) Language in an insurance policy is \u201cinterpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe proper question is whether the [provision or] word is ambiguous in the context of <em>this </em>policy and the circumstances of <em>this </em>case. [Citation.] \u2018The provision will shift between clarity and ambiguity with changes in the event at hand.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 868 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263].) Ambiguity \u201c \u2018 \u201cis resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the [insurer] believed the [insured] understood them at the time of formation. [Citation.] If application of this rule does not eliminate the ambiguity, ambiguous language is construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. [Citation.]\u201d \u201cThis rule, as applied to a promise of coverage in an insurance policy, protects not the subjective beliefs of the insurer but, rather, \u2018the objectively reasonable expectations of the insured.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>[Citation.] \u2018Any ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 763 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Furthermore, policy exclusions are strictly construed (see e.g., <em>Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 16; <em>MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 635\u2019 648 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 228, 73 P3d 1205]), while exceptions to exclusions are broadly construed in favor of the insured <em>(Aydin Corp. v. First State Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1183, 1192 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 959 P.2d 1213]; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Lynette C. </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1073 [279 Cal.Rptr. 394]). \u201c \u2018[A]n insurer cannot escape its basic duty to insure by means of an exclusionary clause that is unclear. As we have declared time and again \u201cany exception to the performance of the basic underlying obligation must be so stated as clearly to apprise the insured of its effect.\u201d [Citation.] Thus, \u201cthe burden rests upon the insurer to phrase exceptions and exclusions in clear and unmistakable language.\u201d [Citation.] The exclusionary clause \u201cmust be <em>conspicuous, plain and clearT </em>\u2019 [Citation.] This rule applies with particular force when the coverage portion of the insurance policy would lead an insured to reasonably expect coverage for the claim purportedly excluded.\u201d <em>(MacKinnon, supra, </em>at p. 648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">B. <em>Interpretation of the Vehicle Theft Exclusion and Exception</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">E.M.M.I. does not contend that Callahan, E.M.M.I.\u2019s designated salesperson, was \u201cin\u201d the vehicle at the time of the theft, but instead argues that he was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle. The controversy therefore centers on the meaning of the term \u201cupon\u201d as it is used in the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion. While the parties contend that the term \u201cupon\u201d is unambiguous as applied to the facts of this case, they disagree on how that term should be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Prehminarily, we reject Zurich\u2019s contention that an ordinary and reasonable person would understand the phrase \u201cactually in or upon\u201d only in a legal sense or as a \u201clegalism, used only for distinctly legal purposes.\u201d We reject this construction because it runs afoul of elementary rules of contract interpretation that policy language is interpreted in its ordinary and popular sense <em>(Waller, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18) and as a \u201clayman would read it and not as it might be analyzed by an attorney or an insurance expert.\u201d (E.g., <em>Crane v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 112, 115 [95 Cal.Rptr. 513, 485 P.2d 1129]; see Civ. Code, \u00a7 1638; <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1644 [\u201cwords ... are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal meaning\u201d unless used by the parties in that sense].) The policy at issue in this case defines certain words, such as \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d and further provides that \u201c[o]ther words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning.\u201d Neither the phrase \u201cactually in or upon\u201d nor the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cupon\u201d is enclosed in quotation marks. Thus, nothing in the policy indicates or suggests that the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion is to be construed in a specialized or technical manner, or as Zurich contends\u2014as used in statutes and ordinances. Absent evidence that the parties intended the provision to have a specialized meaning, we must reject Zurich\u2019s contention and construe the term in question as would a layperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">E.M.M.I. contends the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion applies in this case because its salesman was in close proximity to the automobile when the theft occurred. It rests on the fact that the word \u201cupon\u201d is interchangeable with \u201con\u201d and that the definition of \u201con\u201d includes \u201cin close proximity.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s 10th New Collegiate Diet. (1995) pp. 811, 1298 [\u201ca village [on] the sea\u201d]; Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1088 [defining \u201con\u201d as \u201cupon; as soon as; near to; along; along side of; adjacent to; contiguous to; at the time of; following upon; during; at or in contact with the upper surface of a thing\u201d].) Zurich disagrees that close proximity is sufficient and implicitly relies on the definition of \u201con\u201d \u201cindicating] means of conveyance\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s 10th New Collegiate Diet., <em>supra, </em>at p. 811; Random House College Diet. (rev. ed. 1980) p. 1444), such as \u201con a ship\u201d or \u201con a train\u201d and the definition of \u201cupon\u201d meaning \u201cup and on; upward so as to get or be on\u201d (Random House College Diet., <em>supra, </em>at p. 1444), such as \u201cupon\u201d a motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Of course, the fact that a word carries multiple meanings does not by <em>itself render it </em>ambiguous. <em>(Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co., supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 868.) The context in which the word \u201cupon\u201d appears in this policy and under the circumstances of this case, however, renders its meaning ambiguous. Generally, one does not use the phrase \u201cupon the vehicle\u201d in ordinary usage, especially in the sense of \u201ctraveling upon the vehicle.\u201d Nor is the phrase \u201cupon the vehicle\u201d generally used to mean in close proximity to a vehicle, as E.M.M.I. contends. <em>It is true </em>that \u201cupon\u201d could refer to someone riding upon a motorcycle or the running board of an antique car, such as: \u201cthe salesman must be on or upon the motorcycle.\u201d Along this line the Court of Appeal observed that when the jeweler\u2019s block policy was conceived in the early 1900\u2019s, the word \u201con\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d would have unambiguously applied to a horse or a horse-drawn carriage, and today, the same holds true with respect to motorcycles. But there is no indication that motorcycles are widely used by jewelry salespeople as a means of transporting jewelry; thus an insured would not reasonably expect that \u201cupon\u201d was intended to apply to motorcycles, as opposed to offering an alternative to the requirement that the insured actually be in the vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, the language in the policy does not clearly alert the insured to Zurich\u2019s restricted meaning, and it is improbable that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>insured would interpret the language to apply to motorcycles, as opposed to automobiles. In short, neither definition squarely supports the parties\u2019 respective arguments. We therefore conclude the language in the vehicle theft exception is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Although the main culprit for this ambiguity is the use of the word \u201cupon\u201d to refer to a vehicle, the ambiguity is exacerbated by the use of the word \u201cor.\u201d The exception to the vehicle theft exclusion is phrased in the disjunctive\u2014 \u201cactually in <em>or </em>upon\u201d\u2014and therefore a reasonable insured would likely interpret the exception to mean that the insured must be either inside the vehicle, or in some other location relative to the vehicle. (See, e.g., <em>Houge </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1955) 44 Cal.2d 706, 712 [285 P.2d 257] [\u201cIn its ordinary sense, the function of the word \u2018or\u2019 is to mark an alternative such as \u2018either this or that\u2019 \u201d].) Presented with such an alternative, we do not believe a reasonable insured would construe the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion to mean that the insured must be either inside or on top of the vehicle, or that the term \u201cupon\u201d applies solely to motorcycles. An insured using an automobile would not expect coverage to vanish when engaged in routine and necessary activity such as stepping out of the car to retrieve the jewelry from the backseat or trunk. Had the insurer intended the phrase \u201cor upon\u201d to apply solely to the use of motorcycles or other means of transportations such as ships and trains, it could, and should, have made this intention clear to the insured. The insurer could have, for example, defined the meaning of \u201cupon\u201d in the context of the policy language. This is a burden that rests squarely with Zurich, as the insurer. <em>(MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 648.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Finding the vehicle theft exclusion and its exception ambiguous, we must resolve the ambiguity in favor of the insured, consistent with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>(Kazi </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 871, 879 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 15 P.3d 223].) As noted above, the jeweler\u2019s block policy at issue here provided broad coverage against loss of the insured jewelry. Given that broad coverage language, an insured would have a reasonable expectation that coverage would be provided in this context\u2014when the insured is in close proximity to the vehicle and attending to it when the theft occurs. To construe the exception to the vehicle theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>exclusion, and specifically the word \u201cupon,\u201d as applying only to situations in which the insured is inside or physically touching the vehicle would upset the reasonable expectations of the insured. Such a narrow construction would unreasonably preclude coverage when the insured exits the vehicle and walks a short distance to retrieve the insured merchandise from either the backseat or the trunk of the vehicle, unless the salesperson keeps constant contact with the car while walking toward the rear of the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The broad coverage language\u2014providing coverage for all losses except those expressly excluded\u2014along with the ambiguous language in the exclusionary provision, does not support this construction. (See <em>Star Diamond, supra, </em>965 F.Supp. at p. 767 [\u201cSuch an interpretation would result in a denial of coverage for a loss occurring when the insured stepped out of his vehicle to open a rear door or the trunk of his car to retrieve the insured property.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Because the exclusionary clause as a whole is ambiguous, it cannot be said to be clear and plain in limiting coverage. <em>(MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 649.) In no way does the policy language alert a reasonable insured that coverage is lost by simply stepping outside of the vehicle. In such a case, the insured is in close proximity to the jewelry and is providing some protection against theft. That Zurich\u2019s position is counterintuitive to what a reasonable insured would expect is partly borne out by its response to a question posed at oral argument. In that response, Zurich maintained that an insured traveling by train would come within the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion if the insured left the jewelry in one compartment while he or she walked to a different compartment, such as the dining car, because such insured would be \u201cupon\u201d the train. Thus, according to Zurich, an insured who remains in close proximity to an automobile and is paying attention to it, providing a theft deterrent, would not be covered under the policy, but an insured traveling by train who leaves the jewelry completely unattended, thus providing no deterrence to theft, would be covered. This outcome cannot be said to be consistent with an insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Zurich further contends that the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion does not apply in the present case because the purpose of the exception is \u201cto insure against theft by force or intimidation, but not by stealth.\u201d The Court of Appeal likewise observed: \u201cAs courts in other jurisdictions have. explained, the purpose of the provision is to cover a loss by theft from a car in the presence of someone in or upon it, that is, theft by force or intimidation directed at those present, but not by stealth alone.\u201d We disagree. Nothing in the language of the policy suggests such limitation. Rather, reading the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>exclusionary clause and the exception in light of the broad coverage language <em>(MacKinnon v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 635), it appears most reasonable to read the exclusion as applying when the vehicle and the insured jewelry were left unattended and, hence, more vulnerable to thievery. Given the high incidence and relative ease of car theft, it is reasonable that an insurer would exclude coverage for thefts from unattended vehicles. (See, e.g., <em>Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d at p. 634 [exclusion \u201cobviously intended to cover any situation where a loss occurred when the property was not protected by the presence of someone in or upon the car\u201d].) Coverage for thefts from unattended vehicles might well command an increased premium. But if the insured is \u201cin or upon\u201d the vehicle when the theft occurs, the loss is covered whether or not the theft is accomplished by force or by stealth. A thief, for example, may stealthily break into the trunk of a car while the insured is sitting in the car. (See, e.g., <em>Sphere Drake Ins. PLC </em>v. <em>Trisko </em>(D.Minn. 1998) 24 F.Supp.2d 985, 989, affd. on other grounds (8th Cir. 2000) 226 F.3d 951, 955-956 [police detective describing situations where thieves, using special tools, were able to break into a vehicle\u2019s trunk unbeknownst to the vehicle\u2019s occupant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Our conclusion that the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion is not limited to thefts accomplished by force or intimidation is bolstered by the fact that the language in the exception uses the term \u201ctheft\u201d as opposed to \u201crobbery.\u201d Robbery requires the use of force or intimidation, while theft does not. (See, e.g., 2 Witkin and Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Crimes Against Property, \u00a7 94, p. 125 [explaining that for a robbery to occur, \u201c[t]he property must be taken by either force (violence) or fear (intimidation)\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramkeesoon </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 346, 351 [216 Cal.Rptr. 455, 702 P.2d 613] [\u201cTheft is a lesser included offense of robbery; robbery has the additional element of a taking by force or fear\u201d].) The common dictionary definition of these terms also supports this distinction. For instance, MeniamWebster\u2019s 10th New Collegiate Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at page 1222, defines theft as \u201cthe felonious taking and removing of personal property with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it,\u201d while robbery is defined as \u201clarceny from the person or presence of another by violence or threat\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1013).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Significantly, the word \u201ctheft\u201d is used both in the vehicle theft exclusion and its exception. Despite this, Zurich would have us find that the vehicle theft exclusion applies generally to all thefts from a vehicle, while the exception applies only to the greater crime of robbery. Accepting Zurich\u2019s interpretation would require that we give different meanings to the same term used in the same policy paragraph. This would run afoul of the rule of contract interpretation that the same word used in an instrument is generally given the same meaning unless the policy indicates otherwise. (See, e.g., <em>Palmer v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 1109, 1116-1117 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 647, 988 P.2d 568]; <em>Victoria v. Superior Court </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>734, 741 [222 Cal.Rptr. 1, 710 P.2d 833]; <em>People ex rel. Lockyer v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. </em>(2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 516, 526 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 151].) Had Zurich intended the exception to apply only to situations involving force or intimidation, i.e., robbery, while the exclusion applied to theft, it should have used the more accurate term \u201crobbery\u201d to put the insured on notice. As written, a reasonable insured would not interpret the language as Zurich contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Construing the ambiguous language in favor of the insured, in a manner consistent with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations, and keeping in mind that exclusionary provisions are narrowly interpreted while exceptions are broadly construed, we hold that the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion applies when an insured is in close proximity to the vehicle and is attending to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">C. <em>Judicial Interpretations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">While this court has never had occasion to interpret the vehicle theft exclusion at issue here, numerous decisions, including two from this state, have interpreted or applied the same or similar language. Although the majority of these decisions denied coverage, as explained below, they do not compel a different outcome here.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Of the California cases, the most significant is <em>Revesz </em>v. <em>Excess Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 125 [106 Cal.Rptr. 166] <em>(Revesz). </em>In that case, the Court of Appeal construed a \u201csalesman\u2019s floater\u201d policy with exclusion and exception provisions identical to those at issue in this case. There, the salesman, in need of driving directions, parked at a curb in front of a gas station, locked the ignition, got out, and took his keys with him as he walked around in front of the car toward a parkway. Thirty seconds after leaving his car and while he was still within two to three feet from it, the salesman heard the car door close and saw a thief drive away in his car, which contained his jewelry. The insured maintained that the term \u201cupon\u201d in the exception to the policy exclusion should be interpreted to mean \u201c \u2018in or about\u2019 or \u2018in close proximity to\u2019 [the] vehicle while the insured is engaged in work incidental to loading, unloading or transporting jewelry. Such interpretation would provide coverage while the insured is walking to the rear of his car to remove jewelry, or while he is changing a tire, or while he momentarily leaves his vehicle to obtain directions, the situation presented in [that] case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 127-128.) The Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to decide whether the term \u201cupon\u201d should be interpreted as urged by the insured: \u201cHaving parked his vehicle at the curb, locked the ignition, removed his keys, and left the vehicle for the purpose of seeking information, he had <em>temporarily abandoned </em>the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 129, italics added.) The exception to the exclusion therefore did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>apply. The court noted, however, \u201cthe word \u2018upon\u2019 might under some factual situations require interpretation\u201d and that \u201c[t]he controlling factors are not the time interval and the distance traveled but [the insured\u2019s] intent and conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 128-129; see also <em>Nissel v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1103 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 174] [no coverage for theft of jewelry from an unattended vehicle].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The majority of cases from other jurisdictions similarly involve the temporary abandonment of the vehicle, and hence, the courts in those cases reached the same conclusion. In <em>Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d 629, for instance, a jewelry salesman parked and locked his vehicle, crossed the street, and entered a hotel to purchase coffee. The salesman did not take the heavy jewelry with him into the hotel because \u201c \u2018[tjhere were about six or eight steps to climb, and several doors to be opened, in order to enter the [hotel].\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 631.) After returning to his vehicle two to four minutes later, the salesman found that his car window had been broken and the jewelry taken. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Minnesota Supreme Court, in holding that the loss was not covered, concluded that the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion was \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d requiring the insured to \u201cbe <em>[a]ctually </em>in or upon the automobile when the loss occurs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 633, italics added; see also <em>Sphere Drake Ins. PLC v. Trisko, supra, </em>24 F.Supp.2d 985 [applying Minnesota law].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Conceding that the salesman was \u201ctemporarily absent\u201d from the vehicle at the time of the theft <em>(Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d at p. 631), the insured in <em>Ruvelson </em>argued that \u201cupon\u201d should be given a broad interpretation to include \u201c \u2018in proximity to,\u2019 \u2018in the neighborhood of,\u2019 \u2018in the presence of,\u2019 or \u2018in the charge of.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 632.) The court rejected this interpretation, observing that courts \u201chave uniformly construed this and similar language adversely to the contentions of [the insured].\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>discussing <em>Greenberg </em>v. <em>Rhode Island Ins. Co. </em>(1946) 188 Misc. 23 [66 N.Y.S.2d 457, 459], in which the court concluded that the word \u201cactually\u201d in the exception \u201cmeans that which exists in fact or reality, in contrast to that which is constructive, theoretical or speculative.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In <em>Royce Furs, Inc. v. Home Insurance Co. </em>(1968) 30 A.D.2d 238 [291 N.Y.S.2d 529] <em>(Royce Furs), </em>a fur salesman parked and locked his vehicle and entered a hotel to register. The vehicle, which contained furs locked in the trunk, was parked six to 10 feet from the hotel entrance and was visible from inside the hotel through a large window. As the salesman returned to his vehicle, a man bolted into the car and drove off. <em>(Id., </em>291 N.Y.S.2d at p. 530.) The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division denied coverage because the salesman was not \u201cactually in or upon\u201d the vehicle when the theft occurred, pointing out that the insured\u2019s \u201crepresentative was not in the automobile, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>was far enough from it to have given the thief the opportunity to enter the car.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>291 N.Y.S.2d at p. 532.) Although noting that it would serve little purpose to discuss other cases applying similar policy language because \u201ceach case must be judged on its own factual situation,\u201d the court observed \u201cthat in almost every instance where similar clauses have been considered by the courts, coverage was denied where the automobile was not attended; or where the insured, or the employee, was not in or upon the car; or where there was no employee present whose sole duty was to attend such vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>291 N.Y.S.2d at p. 531; see also <em>Thomas Noe, Inc. v. Homestead Ins. Co. </em>(6th Cir. 1999) 173 F.3d 581 [insured inside house]; <em>Centennial Ins.

He pulled into a gas station, refueled his vehicle, and went inside the station to pay. He returned to his vehicle within minutes to find the jewelry had been stolen from the trunk. The federal district court denied coverage, noting that the insured \u201cwas not literally, physically, in or upon the car at the time of the theft.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 842.) The court stated: \u201cCourts have consistently held nearly identical policy language to be unambiguous and, based upon such exclusions, have denied coverage to insureds who were not literally in or upon their vehicles at the time of the losses, even though the insureds may have been only a short distance away from the vehicle, watching the vehicle, or absent from the vehicle for only a short period of time. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 843.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">In each of the above cases in which coverage was denied, the court held that the insured was not \u201cin or upon\u201d the vehicle because the insured or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>designated employee had temporarily abandoned the vehicle when the theft occurred. However, in a case involving facts similar to those in the present case, coverage was found where the insured\u2019s representative, although not inside the vehicle or touching it, was in close proximity to the vehicle and attending to it when the theft occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">In <em>Star Diamond, supra, </em>965 F.Supp. 763, the insured drove into a gas station and \u201c[o]nce a pump was free, [he] parked his car, turned off the engine, exited his car and walked to the rear of the driver\u2019s side of his car where the pump was located. As he approached ... the pump, he bumped into his car several times and ... at no time was he more than nine inches from his car. When [the insured] reached the pump, he inserted a credit card into the pump several times in an attempt to authorize his purchase electronically. During this time, [the insured] had his back toward his car.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 764.) After repeated attempts to refuel, the insured returned to his car, three to five minutes after exiting the vehicle, and discovered that the bag containing the jewelry was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The federal district court in <em>Star Diamond </em>held that coverage was not precluded under the vehicle theft exclusion, concluding that the plain meaning of the word \u201cupon\u201d as used in the exception to the exclusion encompassed \u201c \u2018in or into close proximity or contact with.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Star Diamond, supra, </em>965 F.Supp. at p. 767, quoting Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1981) p. 2518.) The court distinguished the cases discussed above in which coverage was denied, observing that \u201c[i]n each of the foregoing cases, the insured had temporarily abandoned, walked away or diverted his attention from the vehicle . . . when the [theft] occurred. These cases differ from the facts of this case. Here, the insured remained inches from his vehicle after he exited and was attending to his vehicle at the time the loss occurred.\u201d <em>(Star Diamond, supra, </em>at p. 767.)</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The court further found that the plain meaning of the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion did not support the insurer\u2019s contention that the insured had to physically be in the vehicle when the theft occurred in order for the exception to come into force, explaining that \u201cthis interpretation ignores the applicability of the term \u2018upon\u2019 altogether.\u201d <em>(Star Diamond, supra, </em>965 F.Supp. at p. 767.) Rejecting the insurer\u2019s suggestion that \u201cupon\u201d was meant to apply to situations involving motorcycles, the court stated: \u201cBy implication . . . [the insurer] contends that the term \u2018upon\u2019 does not apply wherever it is physically possible for the insured to be \u2018in\u2019 the vehicle with the insured property.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] However, the use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>terms \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018upon\u2019 results in both terms modifying vehicle. If [the insurer] wished to condition coverage on the requirement that the insured be \u2018actually in\u2019 the vehicle at the time of the loss, it could easily have drafted the exception to achieve this result.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court found \u201cthat the term \u2018upon\u2019 encompasses situations where the insured is actually attending to his vehicle to facilitate the transport of insured property [and] should thus include instances where the insured exits his vehicle to tend to the insured property in the back seat or trunk, change a tire or refuel his vehicle, and is physically adjacent to and attending to the vehicle.\u201d <em>(Ibid.-, </em>accord, <em>Lackow v. Ins. Co. of North America </em>(1976) 52 A.D.2d 579 [382 N.Y.S.2d 529] [exception applied when insured\u2019s employee was at the rear of the vehicle opening the trunk at the time of the theft].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Zurich calls into question the <em>Star Diamond </em>decision because, according to Zurich, the court incorrectly distinguished <em>Royce Furs, supra, </em>291 N.Y.S.2d 529, and <em>Wideband Jewelry Corp. v. Sun Ins. Co. of New York, supra, </em>619 N.Y.S.2d 339 <em>(Wideband), </em>which held the exception inapplicable. Zurich places great reliance on the fact that the theft in <em>Royce Furs </em>occurred while the insured\u2019s representative was walking back to his vehicle from the hotel at which he had just registered, and hence his attention was no longer diverted. We find no significance in this fact. The exception became inapplicable and the vehicle theft exclusion operable once the insured\u2019s representative temporarily abandoned the vehicle by leaving it and entering the hotel. By so abandoning the vehicle, the insured\u2019s representative invited the sort of mischief from which the insurer sought to insulate itself\u2014theft of the insured jewelry resulting from the abandonment of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Zurich similarly contends that the <em>Star Diamond </em>court incorrectly distinguished <em>Wideband, supra, </em>619 N.Y.S.2d 339. In a short, single-paragraph discussion, the <em>Wideband </em>court held that the exception did not apply because the insured\u2019s employee was \u201capproximately six feet away from his vehicle when the thieves opened the trunk and stole\u201d the jewelry. <em>(Ibid.) </em>While Zurich is correct that the facts recited do not facially indicate that the insured\u2019s employee had abandoned, walked away, or diverted his attention from the vehicle, the fact that the insured\u2019s employee was six feet away, and apparently unaware that thieves were breaking into the trunk of his vehicle, permits the inference that the employee had temporarily abandoned the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>vehicle. In any case, given <em>Wideband\u2019s </em>very limited discussion, it does not cast doubt upon the holding in <em>Star Diamond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Our holding that the insured in the present case was \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle when the theft occurred is consistent with the cases discussed above in which coverage was denied under the vehicle theft exclusion. In none of the cases in which the court found the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion inapplicable and denied coverage was the insured or its representative similarly \u201cupon\u201d the vehicle. The insureds in those cases were not in close proximity and actually attending to the vehicle when the theft occurred. Nonetheless, they claimed coverage under the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion by advocating an interpretation of \u201cupon\u201d that was inconsistent with the language and purpose of the policy exclusion. The insured in <em>Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d at page 631, for example, contended that the exception applied, despite acknowledging the salesman was \u201ctemporarily absent\u201d from the vehicle when the theft occurred. The insured urged that the term \u201cupon\u201d included, inter alia, the definition of \u201cin the neighborhood of.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 632.) To accept that definition and allow coverage in that situation, however, would render meaningless the terms in the vehicle theft exclusion and its exception. Similarly, in <em>Revesz </em>the insured maintained that \u201cupon\u201d meant \u201c \u2018in close proximity to\u2019 \u201d his vehicle and applied when the \u201cinsured [was] walking to the rear of his car to remove jewelry, or while he is changing a tire, <em>or while he momentarily [left] his vehicle to obtain directions, </em>the situation presented in [that] case.\u201d <em>(Revesz, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d at pp. 127-128.) While the first two situations would arguably come within the meaning of \u201cupon\u201d and hence the exception, the latter situation would not because in such a situation the insured has abandoned the vehicle, thus leaving it and the insured jewelry vulnerable to theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In response to these and similar contentions, some courts have used broad language that would appear to bar recovery whenever the insured was outside the vehicle at the time of the theft. (See, e.g., <em>Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d at p. 631 [noting that courts have uniformly rejected the insured\u2019s contention that \u201cupon\u201d means \u201cin proximity\u201d and similar meanings]; <em>American Stone Diamond v. Lloyd\u2019s of London, supra, </em>934 F.Supp. at p. 843 [\u201cCourts have consistently . . . denied coverage to insureds who were not literally in or upon their vehicles at the time of the losses, even though the insureds may have been only a short distance away from the vehicle, watching the vehicle, or absent from the vehicle for only a short period of time\u201d]; accord, <em>Equity Diamond Brokers, Inc. v. Transnational Ins. Co., supra, </em>151 Ohio.App.3d at p. 752; <em>Cordova, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lloyd\u2019s Underwriters, supra, </em>643 N.Y.S.2d 534 [exception \u201chas consistently been given a literal construction rejecting various theories of constructive possession of the vehicle\u201d].) However, as explained above, the insureds in those cases were advocating a very broad interpretation of the term \u201cupon\u201d that would encompass their act of abandoning the vehicle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>But because the insureds or the insureds\u2019 salespersons had temporarily abandoned their vehicles in those cases, they were not \u201cupon\u201d their vehicles as required by the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion; those courts therefore were not called upon to decide whether the exception would apply in the circumstances presented in the present case. In our view, those courts fashioned a rule that was broader than necessary, given the specific factual circumstances they confronted, namely, the temporary abandonment of the vehicle. (See, e.g., <em>Revesz, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d at pp. 128-129 [declining to interpret the term \u201cupon\u201d since the insured had temporarily abandoned the vehicle and was therefore in no sense \u201cupon\u201d it].) To the extent these cases may be construed to deny coverage in all cases in which the insured was outside the vehicle at the time of the theft, irrespective of the insured\u2019s distance from the vehicle and the insured\u2019s conduct, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Finally, Zurich agrees with the <em>Revesz </em>court that an insured\u2019s intent and conduct must be considered in determining the applicability of the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion. Zurich contends that the facts of <em>Revesz </em>and this case are substantially similar and that E.M.M.I.\u2019s salesman manifested the same intent and conduct to temporarily abandon his vehicle, as did the insured in <em>Revesz, </em>when he locked the ignition and left his vehicle to seek directions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In <em>Revesz, </em>the insured intended to and did abandon his vehicle as he walked away from it in search of directions. With his back to the car, he was not only unable to observe his car, but apparently did not realize that someone was breaking into it despite the fact the door was locked and the insured was only two to three feet from the car. <em>(Revesz, supra, </em>30 Cal. App. 3d at p. 126.) Unlike the insured in <em>Revesz, </em>the salesman here did not intend to and did not abandon his vehicle when he walked to the rear to inspect the tailpipe area. His intent and conduct was solely to attend to his vehicle without abandoning it or the jewelry locked in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">For the reasons above, we conclude that the vehicle theft exclusion is ambiguous and did not clearly and plainly apprise the insured that coverage would be lost by merely stepping out of the car. Construing the exception in the insured\u2019s favor, we hold that E.M.M.I.\u2019s salesman, who was approximately two feet from and actually attending to his vehicle when the theft occurred, came within the scope of the exception to the vehicle theft exclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>III.

(Dis. opn. of Chin, J., <em>post, </em>at p. 489.) This historical meaning of the words used in a policy, however, does not illuminate the meaning of the policy language to a reasonable layperson in contemporary times who may well be unaware of this historical meaning. Even accepting that the words once unambiguously referred to horses and horse-drawn carriages, that clarity loses its luster when applied to \u201cvehicles\u201d in a modem insurance policy. That is, words that may once have been unambiguous, are not necessarily so when the context of their usage has changed. In interpreting policy language, we construe it as would a reasonable layperson, not an expert, attorney, or a historian. <em>(Crane v. State Farm &amp; Cas.

Its salesman, Brian Callahan, was carrying jewelry in his car. When Callahan heard a \u201cclunking\u201d noise coming from the car, he pulled the car over, got out of the car while leaving its engine running, went to the back of the car and bent over to look under the car. A thief ran by him, got into the car, and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">Defendant Zurich American Insurance Company (Zurich) insured E.M.M.I. under a \u201cjeweler\u2019s block\u201d policy. The policy excludes from coverage any loss from a vehicle unless an employee is \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u201d E.M.M.I. brought this action against Zurich to recover for the loss under the policy. The trial court granted Zurich\u2019s motion for summary judgment because \u201cthere unequivocally is no coverage under terms requiring the insured to be in or upon the vehicle at the time of the theft.\u201d The Court of Appeal, after reviewing the policy and applicable law in depth, affirmed, holding that the words \u201cactually in or upon\u201d do not mean close proximity. The majority reverses the Court of Appeal. I would affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">The applicable law is well established and clear. The ordinary rules of contract interpretation apply to the construction of an insurance policy. <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 762-763 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889]; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) Judicial interpretation is controlled by words, as they are understood in their ordinary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>popular sense. (Civ.

The function of the court in interpreting an instrument \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in its terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858; <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S., supra, </em>at p. 764; <em>Jensen v. Traders &amp; General Ins. Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 786, 790 [345 P.2d 1].) Language cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract and courts are \u201cnot to strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 18-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The ordinary, common, and popular understanding of the words \u201cactually upon\u201d mean in fact on a vehicle. Here, Presiding Justice Turner, writing for a unanimous Court of Appeal panel, put it thus: \u201c[T]he provision in question is unambiguous. In its ordinary and popular usage (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1644; <em>Bank of the West </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1265), \u2018upon\u2019 is interchangeable with \u2018on.\u2019 (E.g., Newbury House Online Dict.

Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, <em>supra, </em>at page 1466 defines \u2018upon\u2019 as follows, \u2018[0]n (in various senses), or up and on: <em>on </em>and <em>upon are </em>generally interchangeable, the choice being governed by idiom, sentence rhythm, etc.\u2019 \u2018On\u2019 <em>can </em>mean \u2018in close proximity with,\u2019 as in \u2018a village <em>[on] </em>the sea,\u2019 or \u2018stay <em>[on] </em>your opponent.\u2019 (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 811.) \u2018Upon\u2019 can also mean \u2018in or into close proximity or contact with\u2019 as in \u2018the enemy is <em>[upon] </em>us,\u2019 or \u2018despondency fell <em>[upon] </em>me.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Dict. (1981) p. 2517.) But we have not found any definition of \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018upon\u2019 that includes in close proximity <em>to a car. </em>(See Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 1574 [\u2018on\u2019 is \u2018used as a function word to indicate presence within,\u2019 as in \u2018rode there <em>[on] </em>a train,\u2019 or \u2018booked passage <em>[on] </em>an ocean liner\u2019].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">No one would understand the statement that \u201ca person is on a car\u201d to mean that the person was standing next to the car or two feet away from it. There simply is no room in this context to refuse to recognize and give meaning to the ordinary and common understanding and usage of the words. The language is clear. The use of the word \u201cactually\u201d in the phrase \u201cactually in or upon\u201d makes what is already clear unquestionable. As numerous courts have already recognized, the word \u201cactually\u201d in the phrase \u201cclearly negates constructive presence and possession. (See <em>Royce Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Insurance Company </em>(1968) 30 App.Div.2d 238 [291 N.Y.S.2d 529, 530-531]; <em>Phil G. Ruvelson, Inc. </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Recently, in <em>American Stone Diamond, Inc. v. Lloyds of London </em>(S.D.Tex. 1996) 934 F.Supp. 839, 843, the court summarized and cited some of these decisions. \u201cCourts have consistently held nearly identical policy language [\u2018actually in or upon\u2019] to be unambiguous and, based upon such exclusions, have denied coverage to insureds who were not literally in or upon their vehicles at the time of the losses, even though the insureds may have been only a short distance away from the vehicle, watching the vehicle, or absent from the vehicle for only a short period of time. See, e.g., <em>Williams v. Fallaize Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>220 Ga.App. 411 [469 S.E.2d 752] (1996) (exclusion applicable where insured was in store 25 feet from vehicle at time of theft); <em>Wideband Jewelry Corp. </em>v. <em>Sun Ins.

Co., </em>235 Minn. 243 [50 N.W.2d 629] (1951) (exclusion applicable where insured was away from vehicle for a few minutes to use bathroom and drink cup of coffee at time of theft). See especially <em>JMP Associates, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>109 Md.App. 343 [674 A.2d 562] (1996) (exclusion applicable where insured was inside service station paying for gasoline at time of theft).\u201d (See also Annot., Construction and Effect of \u201cJeweler\u2019s Block\u201d Policies or Provisions Contained Therein (1994) 22 A.L.R.5th 579, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The words \u201cactually in or upon\u201d are clear and unequivocal. It is not for this court to rewrite the parties\u2019 contract by construing language to mean something it does not mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>CHIN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjY\">I respectfully dissent, for I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s insurance coverage interpretation. The insurance policy at issue excludes from coverage jewelry stolen from a vehicle unless the insured was \u201c <em>\u2018actually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 468, italics added.) The italicized language is unambiguous. It does not, as the majority insists, contemplate coverage when the insured or its representative is \u201cin close proximity\u201d to the vehicle or somewhere nearby at the time of the theft. Rather, the insurer\u2019s use of the phrase <em>\u201cactually in or upon such vehicle\u201d </em>was deliberate. Jewelry invites theft. Jewelry in unattended vehicles especially invites theft. The intent of the exclusion of theft when the insured is not actually, literally, in or upon the car, is to ensure the actual presence of someone in or upon the car in order to avoid a theft. <em>(Ruvelson, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1951) 235 Minn. 243 [50 N.W.2d 629, 635] <em>(Ruvelson).) </em>Conversely, the <em>absence </em>of an actual presence in or upon the unoccupied vehicle offers the criminal the opportunity to steal. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Zurich did not insure against theft when the insured\u2019s representative was nearby or close to the car, but only when he was <em>actually </em>in or upon the vehicle. Therefore, when Brian Callahan, who was in charge of the car containing the jewelry, exited the vehicle and left the engine running, he increased the risk of theft of the car and anything in it, including the jewelry. Under the insurance policy\u2019s plain language, and the many interpretative principles that guide us in reviewing insurance coverage issues, the theft is excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Jeweler\u2019s block insurance was conceived by Lloyds of London at the turn of the previous century. <em>(JMP Associates, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(1997) 345 Md. 630 [693 A.2d 832, fn.l].) The \u201call risk\u201d insurance is different from other property or \u201cnamed peril\u201d insurance because the policy insures all risks of loss or damage to the jewelry subject to certain exclusions. The policy contains an exclusion for all jewelry theft as follows: \u201cWe will not pay for \u2018loss\u2019 caused by or resulting from any of the following: [][]... Theft from any vehicle unless you, an employee, or other person whose sole duty is to attend the vehicle are actually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft.\u201d The exclusion and exception for thefts that occur when the employee is \u201cactually in or upon [the insured\u2019s] vehicle\u201d has long been included in the policy. Although exceptions to exclusions are construed broadly in the insured\u2019s favor, courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists and unambiguous policy language controls. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Two California cases have considered a similar issue under comparable jeweler\u2019s block policies. In <em>Revest v. Excess Ins. Co. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 125 [106 Cal.Rptr. 166] <em>(Revest) </em>and <em>Nissel v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1103 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 174] <em>{Nissel), </em>the Courts of Appeal denied coverage for the theft of jewelry from a car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>because the subject vehicles containing the jewelry were parked and left unattended. In both cases, the courts found the \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle\u201d requirement unambiguous and concluded the drivers intended to abandon their vehicles temporarily either to get directions or engage in other business. The majority attempts to distinguish these cases on the ground that Callahan did not intend to abandon the vehicle or turn his attention away from it. Instead, he wanted to inspect it in order to determine the origin of a rattling noise, and had to exit the vehicle in order to conduct his inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The majority places much emphasis on the fact that the court in <em>Revesz, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d at pages 128-129, looked to the insured\u2019s intent and conduct in determining whether the theft that occurred was after the insured salesman stopped to ask for directions. <em>Revesz </em>found' that by parking his car at the curb, locking the ignition, removing the keys, and leaving the vehicle to seek information, he had temporarily abandoned it. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In direct contrast to the majority, however, <em>Revesz </em>concluded that the requirement that the insured or its representative remain \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle\u201d was not ambiguous, and placed great emphasis on the word \u201cactually\u201d to find no coverage. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Indeed, <em>Revesz </em>specifically observed that temporary abandonment of the insured jewelry can occur when the employee is \u201cnot actually in or upon his vehicle\u201d and \u201cthe thief is able to take possession of the vehicle and its contents without interference from him.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, although <em>Revesz </em>stated that the insured\u2019s intent was relevant, it relied solely on the clear and explicit words of the policy, and not the insured\u2019s intent, in finding no coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Nissel, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th at page 1103, is also instructive. There, two thieves stole a bag containing diamonds and other items from the salesman\u2019s vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1106.) Similar to the policy at issue here, the jeweler\u2019s block policy in <em>Nissel </em>excluded thefts from an automobile unless the insured (or its permanent employee) at the time of the loss was \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1107.) Although the insured made no claim that the policy exclusion was unclear or ambiguous, the court held that because the employee was not actually in or upon the vehicle when the theft occurred, the exclusion barred coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1114; see also <em>Taff v. Atlas Assur. Co. </em>(1943) 58 Cal.App.2d 696, 701 [137 P.2d 483] [\u201cIf he should not leave his jewelry in his unguarded car exposed to the hazards of theft, ... his coverage was complete; but he did choose so to leave it, he had got what he bought\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The majority of other state courts agree that the insured or its employee must actually, literally, be in or on the vehicle in order for the exception to apply. (See, e.g., <em>American Stone Diamond, Inc. v. Lloyds of London </em>(S.D.Tex. 1996) 934 F.Supp. 839, 843-844; see also <em>Sphere Drake Ins. PLC v. Trisko </em>(D.Minn. 1998) 24 F.Supp.2d 985, 992-996; <em>Wideband Jewelry </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>Corp. v. Sun Ins. Co. of New York, Inc. </em>(1994) 210 A.D.2d 220 [619 N.Y.S.2d 339] [no coverage when employee six feet away from vehicle when theft occurred]; <em>Greenberg v. Rhode Island Ins. Co. </em>(1946) 188 Misc. 23 [66 N.Y.S.2d 457, 459] (Greenberg) [car parked on street while representative ate in restaurant].) As <em>American Stone Diamond </em>observed, \u201c[c]ourts have consistently held nearly identical policy language to be unambiguous and, based upon such exclusions, have denied coverage to insureds who were not literally in or upon their vehicles at the time of the losses, even though the insureds may have been only a short distance away from the vehicle, watching the vehicle, or absent from the vehicle for only a short period of time.\u201d <em>(American Stone Diamond, supra, </em>934 F.Supp. at p. 843.) Even <em>Revesz </em>relied on the majority of state cases that place \u201cgreat emphasis on the word \u2018actually,\u2019 indicating that it clearly negates constructive presence and possession.\u201d <em>(Revesz, supra, </em>30 Cal.App.3d at p. 129.)</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">The cases the majority relies on for support generally stand alone in their conclusion that the requirement that the insured or its representative be \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft\u201d includes close proximity to the vehicle. <em>(Lackow </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of North America </em>(1976) 52 A.D.2d 579 [382 N.Y.S.2d 529]; <em>Star Diamond v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London </em>(E.D.Va. 1997) 965 F.Supp. 763, 765.) Indeed as the Court of Appeal noted, neither of these cases has been followed in any other jurisdiction. In <em>Lackow, </em>the court found coverage under a similar policy when the insured\u2019s employee was at the rear of the vehicle opening its trunk at the time of the theft. The court interpreted the \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle\u201d at the time of the loss to include coverage when the insured was close enough to the vehicle \u201cto be able to observe a theft of the contents.\u201d <em>(Lackow, supra, </em>52 A.D. at p. 579.) In <em>Star Diamond, </em>the company president placed his knapsack full of diamonds on the floor behind the front seat of his car. After he stopped at a gas station, and when he was not more than nine inches from his car, the knapsack was stolen. <em>(Star Diamond, supra, </em>965 F.Supp. at p. 764.) The policy excluded theft of the jewelry unless the insured was \u201cin or upon the vehicle at the time of the loss.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 765.) The court disregarded the policy\u2019s clear meaning and broadened coverage beyond the policy\u2019s scope to hold that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d between the words \u201cin\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d meant coverage was not conditioned solely on the insured being \u201cactually in\u201d the vehicle. In addition, the court concluded that the term \u201cupon\u201d should allow coverage when the insured exits the car to attend to the vehicle. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 767.) Under the clear and explicit policy language, this conclusion is questionable. As noted, no other jurisdiction has followed the case, even though our majority plans to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Standard dictionary definitions also undermine the majority\u2019s strained approach to insurance policy interpretation. As the Court of Appeal observed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cupon\u201d is interchangeable with the word \u201con.\u201d (See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (10th ed. 1995) p. 1298.) Whereas \u201con\u201d can mean \u201cin close proximity with,\u201d as in \u201ca village <em>on </em>the sea\u201d or as a function word to mean \u201cpresence within,\u201d as in \u201crode on a train\u201d there is no definition of \u201con\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d that includes in close proximity <em>to a car. </em>The majority\u2019s hypothetical, in response to a comment made during oral argument involving an insured who carelessly leaves jewelry in one train compartment while walking to a different compartment, strains the policy\u2019s application and ignores the standard rules of word usage and function.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In addition, as the Court of Appeal also noted, if we view the terms \u201con\u201d or \u201cupon\u201d from a historical perspective, those words \u201clogically and unambiguously apply to a horse or a horse-drawn carriage. One would be upon rather than in a horse or carriage. In modem times, the words \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018upon\u2019 would apply to a motorcycle. In the ordinary sense of the words,.whether one is \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018upon\u2019 a vehicle means the same thing; the usage varies with the object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The majority of courts agree that the insurer\u2019s use of the word \u201cactually\u201d is also quite significant. Indeed, the courts adopting the majority view would agree that placing the word \u201cactually\u201d in the beginning of the policy\u2019s exception to the exclusion to theft \u201cbelies any argument that the exclusion can be avoided when the insured is in close proximity to the car or is watching it.\u201d In <em>Greenberg, supra, </em>66 N.Y.S.2d at page 459, the court pointed out that, \u201cActual means that which exists in fact or reality, in contrast to that which is constructive, theoretical or speculative. [Citation.] [][] We must give due recognition to the use of the word \u2018actually\u2019 and must conclude it was inserted and intended for a definite purpose\u2014to indicate the intention that presence in reality presence in fact was required and not a constructive or theoretical one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The majority also cites many rules of insurance policy interpretation to support its holding. They all favor the view that there is no coverage here. For example, the majority relies on the mle that an insurance policy is considered ambiguous only when it is susceptible to two or more constructions. <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 18.) The phrase interpreted here, \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft,\u201d is capable of one meaning only: The insured must be in or upon the vehicle when the theft occurs in order for coverage to apply. The rale is clearly stated by several courts that \u201c[t]he [exclusion] was obviously intended to cover any situation where a loss occurred when the property was not protected by the presence of someone in or upon the car.\u201d <em>(Ruvelson, supra, </em>50 N.W.2d at p. 634; maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The majority also acknowledges, but refuses to follow, the statutory mandate to interpret written contract terms under their \u201cclear and explicit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>meaning, and in their \u201cordinary and popular sense.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1644, 1638.) Under these rules, we must find that the jeweler\u2019s block theft policy requirement that the insured party remain \u201cactually in or upon the vehicle at the time of such theft\u201d to mean what it says. There is no ambiguity here. To hold otherwise ignores the obvious intent of the specific and limited exception to the exclusion for theft, and potentially risks increased premiums for jewelry theft protection, a risk I cannot concede.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">According to the clear and explicit words used in the jeweler\u2019s block policy before us, the insurer reasonably decided that actual presence of the insured or its representative in the car would likely deter a thief, while the absence of an actual presence offers the thief an opportunity to steal. As one court noted, \u201copportunity makes the thief. If [the insured] had been in the automobile, probably the thief would not have entered.\u201d <em>(Princess Ring Co. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>(1932) 52 R.I. 481 [161 A. 292, 293].) Long ago, insurance companies decided to insure against the theft of jewelry in vehicles only if the insured or its representative took basic precautions to guard against the theft. When the insured or its representative leaves the car for any reason, the risk of theft increases. That is what happened here. When Callahan left the car, with its engine running, to inspect a potential problem, he was not \u201cactually in or upon such vehicle at the time of the theft\u201d as the exception to the theft exclusion requires. He left the vehicle and its contents exposed to theft.
