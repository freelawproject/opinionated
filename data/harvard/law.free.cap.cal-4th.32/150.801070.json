Reed </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 448 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 R2d 311] <em>(Lake), </em>we held that, notwithstanding the predecessor statute to section 13380, an <em>unsworn </em>statement by a <em>nonarresting </em>officer is admissible, pursuant to the public employee record exception to the hearsay rule, at an \u201cadministrative per se\u201d review hearing conducted by the DMV. <em>(Lake, </em>at p. 461.) The question presented by this case is whether, at such a hearing, the DMV may, in addition to considering the arresting officer\u2019s sworn statement, also consider an <em>unsworn </em>statement by the <em>arresting </em>officer. The DMV, we conclude, may properly do so, for section 13557 provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe department shall consider the sworn report submitted by the peace officer pursuant to Section 23612 or 13380 <em>and any other evidence accompanying the </em>report.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Factual and Procedural Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">A California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer observed Daniel L. MacDonald, who was driving in the No. 5 lane on a freeway, encroach two feet into the No. 4 lane, and then slowly drift five feet onto the shoulder. When the officer stopped MacDonald, he observed that MacDonald\u2019s eyes were red and watery, his speech thick and slurred, and an odor of alcohol was emanating from his breath. MacDonald admitted he had been drinking. He failed several standard field sobriety tests, and upon being transported to a police station, his blood-alcohol concentration twice tested at .11 percent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officer issued an administrative per se suspension order, confiscated MacDonald\u2019s driver\u2019s license, and issued him a temporary license.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>On the date of the incident, the arresting officer completed a sworn report on DMV form 367. With respect to the facts and circumstances which led to the stop, he wrote: \u201cOBS, S/V [subject vehicle] DRIVING W/B 101 DESOTO TO TOPANGA WEAVING SIDE TO SIDE IN W-l LANE\u2014STOP MADE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">On the same date, the officer completed a \u201cDriving Under the Influence Arrest/Investigation Report\u201d (CHP form 202) and the narrative/supplement report (CHP form 556). These two reports, which we will refer to collectively as the \u201cunsworn report,\u201d and which we have summarized in the first paragraph of this statement of the factual and procedural background, provided a more detailed narrative of the circumstances leading to the stop and arrest, but were not sworn.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">MacDonald requested an administrative hearing to review his license suspension. (\u00a7 13558, subd. (a).) At the hearing, MacDonald\u2019s counsel objected to the unsworn report, contending an unsworn report by the arresting officer is inadmissible hearsay. The hearing officer overruled the objection and sustained the license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">MacDonald petitioned for writ of mandate to set aside the suspension. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The petition was granted. Relying on <em>Solovij v. Gourley </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 1229 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 278] <em>(Solovij), </em>the superior court held the unsworn report was inadmissible under section 13380, and the sworn report alone failed to provide reasonable cause for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Concluding <em>Solovij </em>was wrongly decided, the Court of Appeal reversed with directions to reinstate the suspension. <em>\u201cSolovij </em>erred in fashioning an exclusionary rule which precludes the DMV from considering an arresting officer\u2019s <em>unsworn </em>report on the ground the arresting officer\u2019s sworn report was inadequate. Although section 13380 requires the <em>arresting </em>officer to send the DMV a <em>sworn </em>report of all information relevant to the enforcement action (\u00a7 13380, subd. (a)), the statute does not specify a penalty or consequence for the officer\u2019s failure properly to fill out the sworn report (see <em>ibid.), </em>and specifically does not require the result reached in <em>Solovij, </em>a decision which appears to be contrary to the intent and spirit of the administrative per se law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">We agree with the Court of Appeal, and, accordingly, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">In <em>Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 448, we described in detail the statutory framework of the administrative per se law, and we will briefly reiterate that discussion insofar as it is required for understanding the related issue presented by this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Under the administrative per se law, the DMV must immediately suspend the driver\u2019s license of a person who is driving with .08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood. (\u00a7 13353.2, subd. (a)(1).) The procedure is called \u201cadministrative per se\u201d because it does not impose criminal penalties, but simply suspends a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license as an administrative matter upon a showing the person was arrested for driving with a certain blood-alcohol concentration, without additional evidence of impairment. <em>(Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 454, fn. 1.) The express legislative purposes of the administrative suspension procedure are: (1) to provide safety to persons using the highways by quickly suspending the (hiving privilege of persons who drive with excessive blood-alcohol levels; (2) to guard against erroneous deprivation by providing a prompt administrative review of the suspension; and (3) to place no restriction on the ability of a prosecutor to pursue related criminal actions. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 454; <em>Gikas </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 841, 847 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 500, 863 P.2d 745].)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The administrative per se laws were deemed necessary due to the time lag that often occurs between an arrest and a conviction for driving while intoxicated or with a prohibited blood-alcohol concentration. During this interim period, arrestees who would eventually be convicted of an intoxication-related driving offense were permitted to continue driving and, possibly, endangering the public. Moreover, without administrative per se laws, persons with extremely high blood-alcohol concentration levels at the time of arrest could escape license suspension or revocation by plea bargaining to lesser crimes or entering pretrial diversion. Thus, by providing for an administrative license suspension prior to the criminal proceeding, the law affords the public added protection. <em>(Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 454\u2014455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Under the administrative per se law, when a person is arrested for driving under the influence and is determined to have a prohibited blood-alcohol concentration, the arresting officer or the DMV serves the person with a notice of order of suspension. (\u00a7\u00a7 13353.2, subds. (b), (c), 13382; <em>Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 455.) The notice informs the driver the license suspension will be effective 30 days from the date of service, states the reason and statutory grounds for the suspension, and explains the driver\u2019s right to seek an administrative hearing. (\u00a7\u00a7 13353.2, subd. (c), 13353.3, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>After the arresting officer serves a driver with the notice of order of license suspension, the DMV conducts an automatic internal review of the merits of the suspension. (\u00a7 13557, subd. (a); <em>Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 455.) In its review, the DMV considers the sworn report submitted by the peace officer and any other evidence accompanying the report. (\u00a7 13557, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In addition to the automatic internal review, the driver may request a hearing, in which case the DMV holds a contested review hearing on its decision to suspend a license. (\u00a7 13558, subd. (a).) \u201cThe rules potentially governing the evidence available for use in such hearings are set forth in division 6, chapter 3, article 3 of the Vehicle Code, commencing with section 14100. [Citation.] Two provisions are especially relevant. First, section 14104.7 states in pertinent part: \u2018At any hearing, the department shall consider its official records and may receive <em>sworn </em>testimony.\u2019 Second, for all matters not specifically covered by division 6, chapter 3, article 3 of the Vehicle Code, section 14112 incorporates the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act governing administrative hearings generally.\u201d <em>(Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 458.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Government Code section 11513 addresses the admissibility of evidence in administrative hearings. It states in relevant part: \u201cThe hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses, except as hereinafter provided. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of the evidence over objection in civil actions.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In <em>Solovij, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 1229, the DMV suspended Solovij\u2019s license for driving with a blood-alcohol level of .08 percent or more. The administrative hearing officer considered both sworn and unsworn reports submitted by the arresting officer. The trial court granted Solovij\u2019s petition for writ of mandate on the ground there was no competent evidence in the sworn report to justify the initial stop and detention. The Court of Appeal affirmed, concluding that \u201cwithout a sworn report containing competent evidence the officer\u2019s unsworn report cannot supply the missing competent evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1231.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The <em>Solovij </em>court distinguished <em>Lake. </em>\u201cHere the question is whether the DMV properly considered the unsworn report of the <em>arresting </em>officer.\u201d <em>(Solovij, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1234, italics added.) The <em>Solovij </em>court acknowledged that the DMV\u2019s \u201creliance on the arresting officer\u2019s unsworn report does not involve the hearsay rule. The unsworn report of the arresting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>officer is just as much a public employee record as the unsworn report of the nonarresting officer found admissible in <em>Lake.\u201d (Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe problem,\u201d in the <em>Solovij </em>court\u2019s view, was that \u201csection 13380 expressly requires the arresting officer to file a sworn report containing \u2018all information relevant to the enforcement action . . . .\u2019 We presume that when the Legislature said the arresting officer must include \u2018all information\u2019 in a sworn report, it meant what it said. An unsworn report will not suffice, [f] It is true that at the hearing, the DMV is not limited to a consideration of the arresting officer\u2019s sworn report. But the DMV cannot evade the statutory requirement that the arresting officer must include all information in a sworn report simply by categorizing the arresting officer\u2019s unsworn report as additional evidence, [f] Our Supreme Court said in <em>Lake: </em>\u2018[P]emitting the department\u2019s hearing officer to consider and rely on [the nonarresting officer\u2019s] unsworn police report does not unfairly evade the requirement . . . that the arresting officer file a sworn report.\u2019 <em>(Lake </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 460.) Permitting the department\u2019s hearing officer to consider and rely on the arresting officer\u2019s unsworn report would unfairly evade that requirement.\u201d <em>(Solovij, </em>at p. 1234.)</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">This Court of Appeal declined to follow <em>Solovij. </em>\u201cHere, although section 13380 provides the arresting officer \u2018shall\u2019 send the DMV a sworn report of all information relevant to the enforcement action, the statute does not specify a consequence for the officer\u2019s failure to properly complete the sworn report. The consequence fashioned by <em>Solovij </em>for the arresting officer\u2019s failure to perfect the sworn report is at odds with the rest of the statutory scheme, which does not limit the DMV\u2019s review to the information contained in the sworn report and allows the DMV to consider an officer\u2019s <em>unsworn </em>report which meets the conditions for admissibility. <em>(Lake </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 461.) [][] Further, the <em>Solovij </em>interpretation of section 13380 thwarts, rather than advances, the express legislative purpose of the administrative per se law to protect the public \u2018 \u201cby quickly suspending the driving privilege of persons who drive with excessive blood-alcohol levels.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Lake v. Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 454.) [f] Finally, our determination that the DMV may consider the unsworn report of an <em>arresting </em>officer does not prejudice the interests of the arrestee. Regardless of whether information relevant to the enforcement action is set forth in a sworn report or an unsworn report, the statutory scheme guards against an erroneous deprivation by providing a prompt administrative review of the suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">In <em>Dibble v. Gourley </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 496 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 709] <em>(Dibble), </em>the same Court of Appeal that decided <em>Solovij, </em>Division Six of the Second District, reaffirmed its holding in that case, while rejecting the contrary holding in this case by Division Three of the same district. <em>(Dibble, </em>at p. 501.) The <em>Dibble </em>court rejected \u201cour colleagues\u2019 criticism that our interpretation of section 13380 \u2018thwarts, rather than advances, the express legislative purpose of the administrative per se law to protect the public \u201c \u2018by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>quickly suspending the driving privilege of persons who drive with excessive blood-alcohol levels.\u2019 \u201d\u2019(... [Q]uoting <em>Lake v. Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 454.) If a person successfully objects to an arresting officer\u2019s unsworn report at an administrative hearing and the sworn report is insufficient to meet. the DMV\u2019s burden of proof, the DMV can call the officer to testify. <em>(Lake, </em>at p. 458; \u00a7\u00a7 13558[,] subd. (b), 14104.7.) Although it may be more practical to allow consideration of the arresting officer\u2019s unsworn reports, the power to fashion such a rule lies exclusively with the Legislature. Of course, all of this is rendered moot and the purpose of the law satisfied if all of the relevant information is included in the officer\u2019s sworn report.\u201d <em>(Dibble, </em>at p. 502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The <em>Dibble </em>court is quite correct in observing that \u201call of this\u201d could easily have been rendered moot. <em>{Dibble, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 502.) As the <em>Dibble </em>court points out, one simple means of rendering it moot would have been by training officers to attach additional pages to their sworn DMV reports and to expressly incorporate the additional pages by reference. Section 13380, subdivision (b) calls for the arresting officer\u2019s sworn report to be made \u201con forms furnished or approved by [the DMV].\u201d The problem is that the form designed by the DMV gives the arresting officer only two and one-half lines to \u201c[d]escribe in detail the facts and circumstances that led to the stop or contact.\u201d Instead of attaching additional pages to the sworn DMV form, as the form suggests, the officers in these cases have been providing the detailed information on separate unsworn CHP forms. If, as we conclude, the plaintiffs in these cases elevate form over substance, the DMV and the CHP have themselves to blame. \u201cThose who craft such forms\u2014like those who prepare instructions for the assembly of children\u2019s toys or mail-order furniture\u2014should themselves be required to use the form before imposing it on the intended user.\u201d <em>{Dibble, </em>at p. 504, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">To resolve this case we must strike a balance between the two pertinent statutory provisions. While section 13380 provides that an officer making an arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs shall immediately forward to the DMV \u201ca <em>sworn </em>report of <em>all information relevant to the enforcement </em>action\u201d (italics added), section 13557 provides that the DMV \u201cshall consider the sworn report submitted by the peace officer . . . <em>and any other evidence accompanying the </em>report\u201d (italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The conclusion reached by the Courts of Appeal in <em>Solovij, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 1229, and <em>Dibble, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 496\u2014that the DMV may not consider an <em>unsworn </em>report by the <em>arresting </em>officers\u2014is certainly arguable. However, given our conclusion in <em>Lake </em>that the DMV may consider an <em>unsworn </em>report by a <em>nonarresting </em>officer, it would be anomalous if it could not also consider an <em>unsworn </em>report by the <em>arresting </em>officer that is intended to supplement the officer\u2019s sworn report. Again, in an administrative hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201c[a]ny relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs . . . .\u201d <em>(Lake, </em>at p. 458, quoting Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (c).) <em>\u201cA </em>police officer\u2019s report, even if unsworn, constitutes \u2018the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lake, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 461.) Again, too, we must not lose sight of the reason for the \u201cslight relaxation of the rules of evidence applicable to an administrative per se review hearing,\u201d a rationale we reiterated in <em>Lake: </em>\u201c[T]he administrative per se laws are intended to provide an efficient mechanism whereby those persons who drive after consuming dangerous amounts of alcohol can have their driver\u2019s licenses quickly suspended so as to ensure they will not endanger the public by continuing to drive. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">To summarize: Section 13380 provides the arresting officer\u2019s sworn report will contain \u201call information relevant to the enforcement action.\u201d Therefore, the Legislature clearly anticipates the sworn report will contain all or nearly all of the information necessary to remove the offender\u2019s license. In light of this legislative intent, the sworn report cannot be wholly devoid of relevant information. However, so long as a sworn report is filed, it is consistent with the relaxed evidentiary standards of an administrative per se hearing that technical omissions of proof can be corrected by an unsworn report filed by the arresting officer. In this case, the arresting officer filed a sworn report.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and we disapprove of <em>Solovij v. Gourley, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th 1229, and <em>Dibble </em>v. <em>Gourley, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 496, insofar as they are inconsistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">George, C.
