As relevant here, a plaintiff must timely file a claim for money or damages with the public entity. (\u00a7 911.2.) The failure to do so bars the plaintiff from bringing suit against that entity. (\u00a7 945.4.) In this case, we consider whether failure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with this claim presentation requirement subjects a complaint to a general demurrer. We conclude it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-10\">Plaintiff Bernard Bodde<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was an inmate in the California state prison system. Plaintiff filed suit against defendants the State of California and various state agencies and employees<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> alleging that they misdiagnosed his lung cancer as tuberculosis and failed to provide him with adequate medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-11\">In their first three demurrers, defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contended, among other things, that plaintiff failed to comply with the claim presentation requirement contained in Government Code section 900 et seq. The trial court sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>each of these demurrers with leave to amend. Following the last order granting leave to amend, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. The complaint alleged five causes of action: (1) violation of 42 United States Code section 1983, (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (3) violation of Government Code section 845.6, (4) negligence, and (5) negligence per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">With respect to the state law claims (counts two through five), the complaint alleged that plaintiff had submitted a claim to the Office of the Attorney General, which \u201crepresented that [it was] authorized to accept service for the State Board of Control for the State of California\u201d and \u201cled [plaintiff] to believe that [he was] serving the State Board of Control.\u201d The complaint further alleged that plaintiff \u201creceived telephonic notice that there were small errors contained in the original claim and was requested to file an Amended Claim.\u201d According to the complaint, \u201can Agent of the Attorney General represented to [plaintiff] that she would accept service of said amended claim, and that the requested changes would correct any errors concerning said claim.\u201d As requested, plaintiff filed an amended claim. The complaint then alleged that plaintiff only learned that the Office of the Attorney General\u2014rather than the State Board of Control\u2014had been mistakenly served over one year after he discovered he had lung cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">Defendants demurred, alleging once again that plaintiff failed \u201cto state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\u201d and that his state law claims were \u201cbarred by [his] failure to comply with Government Code section 900 et seq.\u201d This time, the trial court overruled the demurrer, holding that the complaint pled \u201cfacts which if true could support a claim of estoppel so as to avoid the failure to comply with sections 911.2 and 911.4 of the Government Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">Defendants then filed a petition for writ of mandate, asking the Court of Appeal to issue an order sustaining their demurrer to the third amended complaint as to all state law claims. After issuing an order to show cause, the court denied the petition. In doing so, the court did not reach the estoppel issue. Instead, the court held that compliance with the claim presentation requirement contained in section 900 et seq. is not an element of a cause of action against a public entity and need not be alleged. Thus, noncompliance is not a ground for sustaining a general demurrer. According to the court, the state may only \u201craise its defense of noncompliance with the Tort Claims [Act] requirement on a motion for summary judgment and/or at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>We granted review and limited the issue to whether failure to plead facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement of section 900 et seq. may be raised on a general demurrer to the complaint. We conclude it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">Under section 911.2, \u201c[a] claim relating to a cause of action for death or for injury to person or to personal property . . . shall be presented as provided in Article 2 (commencing with Section 915) of this chapter not later than six months after the accrual of the cause of action.\u201d Section 945.4 then provides that \u201cno <em>suit for money or damages may be brought against a public entity </em>on a cause of action for which a claim is required to be presented in accordance with Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 900) and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 910) of Part 3 of this division until a written claim therefor has been presented to the public entity and has been acted upon by the board, or has been deemed to have been rejected by the board, in accordance with Chapters 1 and 2 of Part 3 of this division.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Italics added.) Thus, under these statutes, failure to timely present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from filing a lawsuit against that entity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1243-7\">Plaintiff concedes that his state law claims are subject to this claim presentation requirement. He, however, contends his complaint need not allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the requirement because compliance is not an element of a cause of action against a public entity. As such, his state law claims are not subject to demurrer for failure to so allege. Defendants counter that failure to allege compliance subjects a claim for money or damages against a public entity to demurrer for either lack of subject matter jurisdiction (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (a)) or for failure to \u201cstate facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 430.10, subd. (e)). We conclude that failure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement subjects a claim against a public entity to a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>Our analysis begins with our decision in <em>Williams v. Horvath </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834 [129 Cal.Rptr. 453, 548 P.2d 1125], In <em>Williams, </em>we held that the claim presentation requirement \u201cis inoperative in an action brought under\u201d 42 United States Code section 1983. To reach this holding, we found that \u201cthe filing of a claim for damages \u2018is more than a procedural requirement, it is a condition precedent to plaintiff\u2019s maintaining an action against defendant, in short, an integral part of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 842, quoting <em>Illerbrun v. Conrad </em>(1963) 216 Cal.App.2d 521, 524 [31 Cal.Rptr. 27].) We further observed that \u201c[o]ur own view of the claims requirement comports with that of\u2019 <em>Willis v. Reddin </em>(9th Cir. 1969) 418 F.2d 702 <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 841)\u2014which held that \u201c \u2018California statutes or ordinances which condition the right to sue the sovereign upon timely filing of claims and actions are . . . <em>elements of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action </em>and conditions precedent to the maintenance of the action\u2019 \u201d <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 839, italics added, quoting <em>Willis, </em>at p. 704). Because the claim presentation requirement is a \u201cstate substantive limitation[] couched in procedural language\u201d <em>(Williams, </em>at p. 841), we concluded that the supremacy clause precluded us from applying the requirement to the federal cause of action <em>(id. </em>at p. 842 [129 Cal.Rptr. 453, 548 P.2d 1125]). (See also <em>Allis-Chalmers </em>v. <em>City of Oxnard </em>(1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 876, 881 [165 Cal.Rptr. 128] [\u201cin holding the 100-day claims requirement of the Tort Claims Act inapplicable, the [California] Supreme Court distinguished the substantive nature of the claims requirements from the procedural nature of statutes of limitations which remain applicable to federal actions\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1244-4\">Consistent with <em>Williams, </em>we have observed that \u201csubmission of a claim to a public entity pursuant to section 900 et seq. \u2018is a condition precedent to a tort action and the failure to present the claim bars the action.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>Desert Hospital Dist. </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 699, 708 [263 Cal.Rptr. 119, 780 P.2d 349], quoting <em>Lutz v. Tri-City Hospital </em>(1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 807, 812 [224 Cal.Rptr. 787].) Similarly, some Courts of Appeal have expressly stated that compliance with the claim presentation requirement is an element of a cause of action against a public entity. (See, e.g., <em>Del Real v. City of Riverside </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 761, 767 [115 Cal.Rptr.2d 705]; <em>Wood v. Riverside General Hospital </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1113, 1119 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 8].) Thus, our Courts of Appeal have repeatedly held that failure to allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>subjects a complaint to general demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, the Court of Appeal in this case acknowledged that it had consistently held the same prior to its ruling in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>This consistency in the holdings of our courts follows logically from the history of claim presentation statutes in California. Prior to 1959, California law contained a variety of \u201cstatutes and county and city charters and ordinances which bar[red] suit against a governmental entity for money or damages unless a written statement or \u2018claim\u2019 setting forth the nature of the right asserted against the entity, the circumstances giving rise thereto and the amount involved [were] communicated to the entity within a relatively short time after the claimant\u2019s cause of action [had] accrued.\u201d (2 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1959) p. A-7.) And from 1857 to 1959, California courts consistently held that failure to allege compliance with these claim presentation requirements subjected a complaint to a general demurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-5\">In 1959, after studying this patchwork of claim presentation requirements, the California Law Revision Commission \u201crecommended adoption of uniform procedures for claims against local governmental entities. [Citation.] The Legislature accepted the commission\u2019s recommendation and enacted the present scheme for presentation of claims.\u201d <em>(Minsky </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 113, 120 [113 Cal.Rptr. 102, 520 P.2d 726].) In construing this new statutory scheme, we continued to hold that failure to allege compliance constituted a failure to state a cause of action and subjected a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>complaint to demurrer. (See <em>Dias v. Eden Township Hospital Dist. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 502, 503-504 [20 Cal.Rptr. 630, 370 P.2d 334].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Following our decision in <em>Muskopf </em>v. <em>Coming Hospital Dist. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 211 [11 Cal.Rptr. 89, 359 P.2d 457]\u2014which abrogated common law immunity for public entities\u2014in 1963 the Legislature enacted the Tort Claims Act. As part of the act, the Legislature amended the claim presentation statutes. (See <em>Minsky v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at p. 120, fn. 11; <em>Burgdorf v. Funder </em>(1966) 246 Cal.App.2d 443, 446^47 [54 Cal.Rptr. 805].) But these amendments did not alter the fundamental nature of the claim presentation requirement\u2014which still required plaintiffs to submit a timely claim for money or damages to a public entity in order to maintain an action against that entity. (See Cal. Law Revision Com. com., reprinted at 32 West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code (1995 ed.) foll. \u00a7 911.2, p. 561 [\u201cThis section is substantially the same as the first paragraph of Government Code [former] Section 715 . . . .\u201d]; Cal. Law Revision Com. com., reprinted at 32A pt. 1 West\u2019s Ann. Gov. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 945.4, p. 15 [noting that section 945.4 merely amended former sections 641 and 710 by preventing \u201ca claimant from bringing an action against a public entity until his claim has been acted upon or is deemed to have been rejected\u201d and limiting the time an entity has to consider the claim].) Indeed, the Legislature did not intend \u201cto expand the rights of plaintiffs in suits against governmental entities, but to confine potential governmental liability to rigidly delineated circumstances: immunity is waived only if the various requirements of the act are satisfied.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Horvath, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d at p. 838.) As such, the language of the amended claim presentation statutes \u201cmake[s] it clear that ... a plaintiff must still allege in his complaint that he has complied with the claim statute in order to state a cause of action against a public employee.\u201d <em>(Burgdorf, </em>at p. 447.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">In light of this overwhelming case law and history, we conclude that a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating or excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement. Otherwise, his complaint is subject to a general demurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-7\">The cases cited by plaintiff and the Court of Appeal do not dictate a contrary conclusion. Each of these cases involved the <em>premature </em>filing of a complaint against a public entity even though the plaintiff had submitted a timely claim to the entity (see <em>Radar v. Rogers </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 243, 246 [317 P.2d 17] <em>(Radar); Cory v. City of Huntington Beach </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 131, 133 [117 Cal.Rptr. 475] <em>(Cory); Petersen v. City of Vallejo </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 757, 768 [66 Cal.Rptr. 776] <em>(Petersen); Taylor </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 255, 258 [4 Cal.Rptr. 209] <em>(Taylor)) </em>or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>had successfully petitioned for leave to present a late claim under sections 911.4 or 946.6 (see <em>Bell v. Tri-City Hosp. Dist. </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 438, 441-442 [241 Cal.Rptr. 796] <em>(Bell); Bahten v. County of Merced </em>(1976) 59 Cal.App.3d 101, 103-104 [130 Cal.Rptr. 539] <em>(Bahten); Savage </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 793, 794-795 [84 Cal.Rptr. 650] <em>(Savage)). </em>None of these cases considered whether failure to allege compliance or circumstances excusing compliance subjected a complaint to a general demurrer for failure to state a cause of action, and they are not relevant here. (See <em>Illerbrun v. Conrad, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.2d at p. 524 [holding that cases involving \u201cprematurity of action brought\u201d do not apply where the plaintiff failed to file a claim for damages].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">Moreover, these cases are distinguishable on their facts. In those cases where the plaintiffs submitted a timely claim but prematurely filed a complaint, the courts refused to dismiss the action because the plaintiffs had substantially complied with the claim presentation requirement. According to these courts, the plaintiffs, by filing the claim and prematurely filing the complaint, had satisfied the purpose behind the requirement\u2014to give the entity the opportunity to investigate and settle the claim before suit was brought. (See <em>Radar, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d at p. 249; <em>Cory, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d at p. 136; <em>Petersen, supra, </em>259 Cal.App.2d at pp. 770-771; <em>Taylor, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.2d at pp. 262-263.) Likewise, in those cases where the plaintiffs prematurely filed a complaint against a public entity before obtaining leave to present a late claim but failed to timely amend that complaint after obtaining leave, the courts refused to dismiss the action because the plaintiffs had substantially complied with the claim presentation requirement. (See <em>Bell, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 449; <em>Bahten, supra, 59 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 112; <em>Savage, supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 797.) Thus, these cases actually enforced the claim presentation requirement and did not excuse the plaintiffs from alleging facts showing or excusing compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Some of these cases did, however, state that compliance with the claim presentation requirement is not an element of a cause of action against a public entity. (See <em>Bell, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 444; <em>Bahten, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.3d at p. 107.) As explained above, these statements are erroneous. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1240-1243.) We therefore disapprove of <em>Bell v. Tri-City Hospital Dist., supra, 196 </em>Cal.App.3d 438, and <em>Bahten v. County of Merced, supra, 59 </em>Cal.App.3d 101, to the extent they conflict with our decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s reliance on language in Government Code section 911.2 stating that the claim must be filed within six months \u201cafter the accrual of the cause of action\u201d is also misplaced. Government Code section 901 defines the \u201cdate of the accrual of a cause of action\u201d for purposes of Government Code section 911.2 as \u201cthe date upon which the cause of action would be deemed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>to have accrued within the meaning of the statute of limitations which would be applicable thereto <em>if there were no requirement that a claim be presented to and be acted upon by the public entity before an action could be commenced </em>thereon.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, the reference in Government Code section 911.2 to \u201cthe accrual of the cause of action\u201d has no bearing on the elements that must be pled to \u201cstate facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action\u201d under Code of Civil Procedure section 430.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Finally, requiring plaintiffs to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate or excuse compliance does not deprive them of their due process rights or unfairly bar just claims. As an initial matter, we note that the Legislature has provided numerous ways to obtain relief from the claim presentation requirement. For example, sections 911.4, 911.6, 911.8 and 946.6 contain a detailed scheme permitting litigants to petition the public entity and the court for leave to present a late claim. Sections 910.8 and 911 also require public entities to alert a claimant to any deficiencies in his claim or waive any \u201cdefect or omission in the claim as presented\u201d (\u00a7 911). Moreover, a plaintiff need not allege strict compliance with the statutory claim presentation requirement. Courts have long recognized that \u201c[a] claim that fails to substantially comply with sections 910 and 910.2, may still be considered a \u2018claim as presented\u2019 if it puts the public entity on notice both that the claimant is attempting to file a valid claim and that litigation will result if the matter is not resolved.\u201d <em>(Del Real </em>v. <em>City of Riverside, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 769, fn. omitted.) Finally, a plaintiff may arguably be able to satisfy the claim presentation requirement by alleging an appropriate excuse, such as equitable estoppel. (See <em>Ard v. County of Contra Costa </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 339, 346-347 [112 Cal.Rptr.2d 886].) Accordingly, we see no reason to ignore the overwhelming precedent establishing that failure to allege compliance or circumstances excusing compliance with the claim presentation requirement subjects a complaint to a general demurrer for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. Because the Court of Appeal never considered whether plaintiff had, in fact, alleged facts sufficient to excuse compliance on the ground of estoppel, we remand for consideration of this unresolved issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">m.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">George, C.

The trial court subsequently issued an order converting the action into a survivor action, appointing Patricia Bodde, plaintiff\u2019s successor in interest and beneficiary, as special administrator of his estate and substituting Patricia Bodde as a party to the action.

None of these exceptions apply here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1243-10\"> Although a Court of Appeal has suggested that failure to comply with the claim presentation requirement divests the court of jurisdiction over a cause of action against a public entity (see <em>Kim v. Walker </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 375, 384 [256 Cal.Rptr. 223]), we have long held to the contrary. As we noted in <em>County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 545, 550 [94 Cal.Rptr. 158, 483 P.2d 774], \u201cas of 1963, court decisions had clearly settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>a court which erroneously entertained an action against a governmental entity, despite noncompliance with claims requirements, committed only an error of law; it did not act in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d Thus, we concluded that noncompliance does not divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction over causes of action against public entities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 551.)
