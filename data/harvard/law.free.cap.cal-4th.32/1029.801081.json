Co. v. Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 812 [258 Cal.Rptr. 161, 771 P.2d 1247] <em>(Calfarm).) </em>\u201cFormerly, the so-called \u2018open competition\u2019 system of regulation had obtained, under which \u2018rates [were] set by insurers without prior or subsequent approval by the Insurance Commissioner ....\u2019\u201d <em>(20th Century Ins.

This new article required, among other things, approval by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of California (hereafter Commissioner)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for all insurance rate increases (see <em>id. </em>at pp. 909-910), and \u201cprovide[d] for consumer participation in the administrative ratesetting process\u201d <em>(Walker v. Allstate Indemnity Co. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 750, 753 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 132]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Pursuant, in part, to statutes enacted as part of Proposition 103, the Commissioner promulgated section 2646.6 of title 10 of California Code of Regulations (hereafter Regulation 2646.6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (a), \u201c[e]ach insurer writing in excess of ten million dollars in\u201d certain \u201clines of insurance . . . [o]n or before March 1 of every year . . . shall file a Community Service Statement . . . with the Department of Insurance\u2019s Statistical Analysis Bureau in Los Angeles.\u201d The statement must contain specified statistical information concerning the insurer\u2019s business in the State of California, organized by ZIP code, including information described as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>\u201cRecord A data.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Record A data consists of \u201cthe total earned exposures and total earned premiums, and the total number of exposures new, exposures canceled, and exposures non-renewed, stated separately\u201d for each line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>insurance and ZIP code. (Reg. 2646.6, subd. (b)(1).) The statement, including the record A data, is subject to Insurance Code section 1861.07, pursuant to Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c). And Insurance Code section 1861.07 provides that \u201c[a]ll information provided to the commissioner pursuant to this article shall be available for public inspection, and the provisions of Section 6254(d) of the Government Code and Section 1857.9 of the Insurance Code shall not apply thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">In this case, we consider the validity of the public inspection provision found in Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c) and the scope of the public disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07. We conclude that (1) the public inspection provision of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c) is valid; and (2) Insurance Code section 1861.07 does not incorporate the exemption from disclosure found in Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k), and does not therefore exempt information protected by the trade secret privilege from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">As required by Regulation 2646.6, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company and State Farm General Insurance Company (collectively State Farm) filed a community service statement with the Commissioner in 1998. In a letter accompanying its statement, State Farm wrote: \u201cSTATE FARM INSURANCE COMPANIES CONSIDER[] THE'INFORMATION CONTAINED IN RECORD A, B, AND C HEREIN AS PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL. IT IS PROPRIETARY IN NATURE, CONSTITUTES TRADE SECRET MATERIAL, AND IS NOT TO BE DISSEMINATED BEYOND THE DESIGNATED RECIPIENTS WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE STATE FARM INSURANCE COMPANIES.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Despite State Farm\u2019s invocation of the trade secret privilege, the Commissioner, without notifying State Farm beforehand, provided its community service statement to David \u201cBimy\u201d Bimbaum upon his request pursuant to Regulation 2646.6 and Insurance Code section 1861.03. After learning about this, State Farm sent a letter to the Commissioner, protesting the release of its trade secrets to Bimbaum and asking the Commissioner to take all reasonable steps to retrieve this information. The Commissioner then sent a letter to Bimbaum stating that it had \u201cinadvertently released\u201d the information and asking him to return it. Bimbaum, however, refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">State Farm then filed this action against Bimbaum and the Commissioner, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. In its complaint, State Farm alleged that \u201cthe information contained in the Community Service Statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>confidential and constitutes trade secrets belonging to State Farm\u201d and is not subject to public inspection under Insurance Code section 1861.07. It sought, among other things, the return of its trade secret information and an injunction barring Bimbaum from using or disclosing that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Soon thereafter, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, Inc., and the Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. (collectively interveners), successfully intervened in the action. In their complaint, the interveners sought a declaration \u201cthat the Community Service Statement and data insurers file with the [Commissioner] ... are public records subject to public inspection and not exempt from public disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-5\">State Farm then amended its complaint. The amended complaint included the interveners and clarified that only the record A data was a trade secret. State Farm also added two declaratory relief claims. First, it sought \u201ca declaration that 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6(c) is invalid to the extent that it purports to make Insurance Code \u00a7 1861.07 applicable to data submitted by State Farm pursuant to 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6, and purports to make data submitted in confidence by State Farm pursuant to 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6 publicly available.\u201d Second, it sought a \u201cdeclaration that Insurance Code \u00a7 1861.07 does not abrogate trade secret rights; that trade secret protections apply to information submitted under Insurance Code \u00a7 1861.07; that State Farm\u2019s data submitted in Record A . . . constitutes a trade secret; and that, if Insurance Code \u00a7 1861.07 applies to data submitted pursuant to 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6, State Farm\u2019s data submitted in Record A to each of its Community Service Statements must be held as confidential by the [Commissioner] and cannot be produced pursuant to a Public Records Act request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">After the trial court dismissed Birnbaum from the action,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> both the Commissioner and the interveners moved for summary judgment. The court granted both motions. In granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion, the court held that the Commissioner \u201cdid not exceed [his] powers in enacting and implementing 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6(c), and State Farm has not shown that there is an exception to the requirements of 10 C.C.R. \u00a7 2646.6(c) and Insurance Code \u00a7 1861.07 for information which would otherwise be considered a trade secret.\u201d In granting the interveners\u2019 motion, the court held that (1) \u201cthere is no triable issue as to any material fact; there is no showing by [State Farm] of economic value of the Record A data in the Community Service Statements, Cal. Regs. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 2646.6; and the Community Service Statements and Record A data are not a trade secret\u201d; (2) \u201cthe California Department of Insurance did not exceed its powers in promulgating Section 2646.6 of Title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>10 of the California Code of Regulations to ensure that insurers do not unfairly discriminate against poor and ethnic communities\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe Community Service Statements and data insurers file with the California Department of Insurance pursuant to Cal. Regs. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 2646.6 are public records subject to public inspection under Regulation \u00a7 2646.6(c) and Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1861.07 and are not exempt from public disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">The Court of Appeal affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> First, the court concluded that State Farm had standing to bring an action to prevent the Commissioner from disclosing its record A data. Second, the court held that the Commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority by making community service statements subject to the public disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07. Third, the court found no trade secret exception to the public disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07. According to the court, Insurance Code section 1861.07 declared a general rule requiring disclosure <em>\u201cwithout </em>exceptions\u201d and did not incorporate the exemption from disclosure for statutory privileges found in Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k). Thus, State Farm could not shield its record A data from public inspection by asserting the trade secret privilege codified in Evidence Code section 1060. Finally, the court held that, even if the trade secret privilege applied, it \u201cstill would not protect State Farm\u2019s record A data.\u201d Relying on <em>Uribe </em>v. <em>Howie </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 194 [96 Cal.Rptr. 493], the court held that Evidence Code section 1060, even if applicable, could not shield this data from disclosure because \u201cthe public interest is better served by disclosure . . . than by nondisclosure.\u201d As a result, the court declined to consider State Farm\u2019s contention that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether its record A data is a trade secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">We granted review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">Before the Court of Appeal, State Farm contended the Commissioner exceeded his \u201cstatutory authority by. making community service statements subject to the public disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07 and that California Code of Regulations, title 10, section 2646.6, subdivision (c) [was] invalid to the extent that it purported] to do so.\u201d According to State Farm, only information submitted pursuant to article 10 of chapter 9 of part 2 of division 1 of the Insurance Code (hereafter article 10) must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>disclosed under Insurance Code section 1861.07, and community service statements do not contain such information. The court rejected this contention. Citing Insurance Code section 1861.03,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it concluded that \u201carticle 10 is not only about rates and rate regulation; it also concerns other factors that may impermissibly affect the availability of insurance.\u201d Thus, \u201c[i]t was well within the authority of the Commissioner to conclude that requiring insurers to submit the information contained in those statements would facilitate his obligations to implement and enforce article 10.\u201d In a convoluted argument, State Farm now challenges this holding. We, however, find the public inspection provision of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c) to be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">In reviewing the validity of a regulation, \u201c[o]ur function is to inquire into the legality of the regulations, not their wisdom.\u201d <em>(Morris v. Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 737 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697].) The Commissioner \u201chas broad discretion to adopt rules and regulations as necessary to promote the public welfare.\u201d <em>(Calfarm, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 824.) Thus, our task \u201cis limited to determining whether the regulation (1) is \u2018within the scope of the authority conferred\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11373) and (2) is \u2018reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute\u2019 (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11374).\u201d <em>(Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. v. Superior Court </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 392, <em>411 [128 </em>Cal.Rptr. 183, 546 P.2d 687].) In this case, State Farm only challenges the authority of the Commissioner to enact the public inspection provision of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c). We must therefore conduct an independent examination (see <em>20th Century, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 271-272) and determine \u201cwhether in enacting the specific rule\u201d the Commissioner \u201creasonably interpreted the legislative mandate\u201d <em>{Fox v. San Francisco Residential Rent etc. Bd. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 651, 656 [215 Cal.Rptr. 565]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">The challenged portion of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c) provides that community service statements are subject to Insurance Code section 1861.07. As relevant here, Insurance Code section 1861.07 states that \u201call information\u201d submitted to the Commissioner \u201cpursuant to\u201d article 10 \u201cshall be available for public inspection . . . .\u201d Because all information provided pursuant to article 10\u2014which encompasses Insurance Code sections 1861.01 to 1861.16\u2014is subject to public disclosure under Insurance Code section 1861.07, the validity of the regulation depends on whether the statutes in article 10 authorize the Commissioner to require community service statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>In answering this question, we first find that Office of Administrative Law (OAL) opinions approving Regulation 2646.6 are irrelevant. \u201cThe approval of a regulation ... by the [OAL] . . . <em>shall not be considered </em>by a court in any action for declaratory relief brought with respect to a regulation.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11350, subd. (c), italics added; see also <em>Jimenez </em>v. <em>Honig </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1034, 1040, fn. 4 [233 Cal.Rptr. 817] [\u201cThe courts are precluded from considering ... the opinion of the OAL ... in reviewing the validity of the regulation\u201d].) Thus, we reject State Farm\u2019s claim that we are constrained by holdings of the OAL. As such, we may consider all the article 10 statutes cited as authority for the promulgation of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c)\u2014i.e., Insurance Code sections 1861.02, 1861.03 and 1861.05\u2014in determining the regulation\u2019s validity. (See Note, foil. Regulation 2646.6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Nor, contrary to State Farm\u2019s contention, did the Court of Appeal consider whether Insurance Code section 1861.03 actually incorporates provisions of the Unruh Act and other business laws. Rather, the court correctly observed that Insurance Code section 1861.03 made \u201cthe business of insurance subject to the state\u2019s antitrust and unfair business practice laws and to the Unruh Civil Rights Act.\u201d (See also <em>Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 394 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 487, 826 P.2d 730] [Ins. Code, \u00a7 1861.03 \u201cmerely modifies preexisting law, to provide, in essence, that insurers are subject to the unfair business practices laws <em>in addition to </em>preexisting regulations under the McBride Act, as amended\u201d].) Based on the breadth of these business laws, the court then concluded that article 10 \u201cencompasses more than rate matters and addresses other factors that may impermissibly affect the availability of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">In doing so, the Court of Appeal correctly found that the Commissioner did not exceed his authority by promulgating the public inspection provision of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c). As part of Proposition 103, article 10\u2019s stated purpose was \u201c \u2018to protect consumers from arbitrary insurance rates and practices, to encourage a competitive insurance marketplace, to provide for an accountable Insurance Commissioner, and to ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians.\u2019 \u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 42A West\u2019s Ann. Ins. Code (1993 ed.) foil. \u00a7 1861.01, p. 649.) To this end, article 10 gives the Commissioner broad authority over insurance rates <em>(California Auto. Assigned Risk Plan </em>v. <em>Garamendi, supra, </em>232 Cal.App.3d at pp. 913-914), and expressly precludes him from approving rates that are \u201cexcessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of\u2019 chapter 9 of the Insurance Code (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1861.05, subd. (a)). Through Insurance Code section 1861.03, subdivision (a), the article also subjects the business of insurance to laws prohibiting discriminatory and unfair business practices. Thus, article 10 is not limited in scope to rate regulation. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>also addresses the underlying factors that may impermissibly affect rates charged by insurers and lead to insurance that is unfair, unavailable, and unaffordable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">As such, the Commissioner undoubtedly has the authority under article 10 to gather any information necessary for determining whether these factors are impermissibly affecting the fairness, availability, and affordability of insurance. This information necessarily includes statistical data relevant to the Commissioner\u2019s determination that a California community is under-served by the insurance industry. (See Reg. 2646.6, subd. (c) [using information from community service statements, the Commissioner shall \u201cissue the Commissioner\u2019s Report on Underserved Communities which will report those communities within California, designated by ZIP code, that the Commissioner finds to be underserved by the insurance industry\u201d].) Therefore, the Commissioner reasonably concluded that community service statements fall within his legislative mandate under article 10. Accordingly, we conclude that the Commissioner did not exceed his statutory authority by promulgating Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c), and subjecting these statements to the public disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Although the public inspection provision of Regulation 2646.6, subdivision (c) is a valid regulation, the scope of disclosure required by the regulation depends on the scope of disclosure required by Insurance Code section 1861.07. According to State Farm, Insurance Code section 1861.07, by expressly barring the application of the exemption from public disclosure codified in Government Code section 6254, subdivision (d), establishes that the rest of Government Code section 6254 applies. Specifically, State Farm contends Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k)\u2014which exempts from disclosure \u201c[r]ecords, the disclosure of which is exempted or prohibited pursuant to federal or state law, including, but not limited to, provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege\u201d\u2014controls. Thus, trade secret information privileged under Evidence Code section 1060 should be exempt from public disclosure under Insurance Code section 1861.07. (See <em>CBS, Inc. </em>v. <em>Block </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 656 [230 Cal.Rptr. 362, 725 P.2d 470] [Gov. Code, \u00a7 6254, subd. (k) \u201cmerely incorporates other prohibitions established by law\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">The interveners contend Insurance Code section 1861.07 establishes an absolute rule in favor of public disclosure, and its language barring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>application of Government Code section 6254, subdivision (d) merely buttresses this rule. Thus, according to the interveners, neither Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k) nor Evidence Code section 1060 applies to a records request. As explained below, we agree with the interveners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">\u201cWhen construing a statute, we must \u2018ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wilcox v. Birtwhistle </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 973, 977 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 260, 987 P.2d 727], quoting <em>DuBois </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978].) \u201cIn determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) At the same time, \u201cwe do not consider . . . statutory language in isolation.\u201d <em>(Flannery </em>v. <em>Prentice </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 572, 578 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 809, 28 P.3d 860].) Instead, we \u201cexamine the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision, construing its words in context and harmonizing its various parts.\u201d <em>(Alford v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1040 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 63 P.3d 228].) Moreover, we \u201c \u2018read every statute \u201cwith reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Calatayud </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1057, 1065 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 959 P.2d 360], quoting <em>People v. Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].) \u201cThese rules apply equally in construing statutes enacted through the initiative process.\u201d <em>(Day </em>v. <em>City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">We now apply these rules. Insurance Code section 1861.07 states: \u201cAll information provided to the commissioner pursuant to [article 10] shall be available for public inspection, and the provisions of Section 6254(d) of the Government Code and Section 1857.9 of the Insurance Code shall not apply.\u201d The first clause broadly requires public disclosure of <em>\u201c[a]ll </em>information provided to the commissioner pursuant to\u201d article 10\u2014which, by definition, includes record A data. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1861.07, italics added.) Thus, Insurance Code section 1861.07, on its face, subjects State Farm\u2019s record A data to public inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>The second clause of Insurance Code section 1861.07\u2014which states that two specific statutory exemptions from disclosure do not apply\u2014does not alter this conclusion. The statutes listed in the second clause\u2014Government Code section 6254, subdivision (d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Insurance Code section 1857.9<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 specifically exempt from disclosure records relating to regulatory information provided by insurers to state agencies. Because the application of these exemptions would nullify the broad disclosure mandate of Insurance Code section 1861.07, the drafters of Proposition 103 presumably added the second clause to make clear that these exemptions do not apply. As such, this clause does not establish that the other statutory exemptions from disclosure found in Government Code section 6254\u2014such as section 6254, subdivision (k)\u2014do apply. Indeed, the drafters\u2019 use of the inclusive term \u201call\u201d to describe the information subject to public disclosure bolsters this construction of Insurance Code section 1861.07. (See <em>California Assn, of Dispensing Opticians </em>v. <em>Pearle Vision Center </em>(1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 419, 429 [191 Cal.Rptr. 762] [use of \u201cinclusive terms such as \u2018in any form directly or indirectly\u2019 and \u2018or otherwise\u2019 \u201d indicated that the listed items were not intended to be exclusive], disapproved on another ground in <em>Leach </em>v. <em>City of San Marcos </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 648, 661 [261 Cal.Rptr. 805]; <em>Worthington v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 384, 388 [134 Cal.Rptr. 507] [\u201cThe general expression [\u2018any and all\u2019] we deem not to be limited by the description of two common positions of persons engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>by others\u201d].) Thus, when viewed in context, the exemptions listed in Insurance Code section 1861.07 \u201care meant to be examples rather than an exhaustive listing of all those\u201d statutory exemptions that are inapplicable. <em>{California Assn, of Dispensing Opticians, </em>at p. 429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Such a construction comports with the purpose behind Proposition 103. Proposition 103 was enacted to \u201c \u2018ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wolfe v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 554, 564 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].) To achieve this goal, the drafters established a public hearing process for reviewing insurance rate changes. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1861.05, 1861.055, 1861.08.) In doing so, the drafters sought to \u201cenable consumers to permanently unite to fight against insurance abuse . . . .\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Gen. Elec. (Nov. 8, 1988) arguments in favor of Prop. 103, p. G88.) By giving the public access to all information provided to the Commissioner pursuant to article 10\u2014which was enacted by Proposition 103\u2014our construction of Insurance Code section 1861.07 is wholly consistent with Proposition 103\u2019s goal of fostering consumer participation in the rate-setting process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">Nonetheless, State Farm contends our rules of statutory construction compel a contrary conclusion. According to State Farm, Insurance Code section 1861.07, by specifying that the exemption from disclosure found in Government Code section 6254, subdivision (d) does not apply, establishes that the rest of Government Code section 6254\u2014including its other exemptions from disclosure, such as the exemption codified in subdivision (k)\u2014 does apply. Otherwise, the clause would be mere surplusage and serve no purpose, in direct contravention of our rules of statutory construction. (See, e.g., <em>Williams v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 337, 357 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 882, 852 P.2d 377] [\u201cAn interpretation that renders statutory language a nullity is obviously to be avoided\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">State Farm also claims that the rule of statutory construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>establishes that the other exemptions from disclosure codified in Government Code section 6254 should apply. Under this rule, \u201cwhere exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be presumed unless a contrary legislative intent can be discerned.\u201d <em>(Mountain Lion Foundation </em>v. <em>Fish &amp; Game Com. </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 116 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 580, 939 P.2d 1280].) According to State Farm, the second clause of Insurance Code section 1861.07 creates an exception to the general rule\u2014that records identified in Government Code section 6254 may be exempt from disclosure\u2014for those records identified in subdivision (d). Thus, it contends no exception should be presumed for those records identified in any other part of Government Code section 6254, including subdivision (k). (See <em>Mountain Lion Foundation, </em>at p. 116.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>These rules of statutory construction do not, however, apply here. As explained above, the language of Insurance Code section 1861.07, when viewed in context, is not ambiguous and, by its terms, requires public disclosure of the record A data. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1043-1044.) The rules cited by State Farm therefore \u201ccannot perform [their] proper role of resolving an ambiguity in statutory language or uncertainty in legislative intent because here we encounter neither ambiguity nor uncertainty.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 599, 603 [68 Cal.Rptr. 297, 440 P.2d 497].) \u201cIn these circumstances there is no room for the proposed rule[s] of construction.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Indeed, we have long recognized that these rules do not control where, as here, the statutory language \u201cmay fairly comprehend many different objects, some of which are mentioned merely by way of example, without excluding others of similar nature.\u201d <em>(Estate of Banerjee </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 527, 539, fn. 10 [147 Cal.Rptr. 157, 580 P.2d 657].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-4\">Finally, the fact that insurers may invoke the trade secret privilege in the public hearing process established by Proposition 103, pursuant to Insurance Code section 1861.08, does not dictate a different result.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is nothing anomalous about precluding insurers from invoking the trade secret privilege after they have already submitted trade secret information to the Commissioner pursuant to a regulation validly enacted under article 10 (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1045), while permitting them to invoke the privilege in response to a request for information in a public rate hearing. Insurance Code section 1861.07 merely requires public disclosure of \u201cinformation provided to the commissioner pursuant to\u201d article 10. By definition, this information is relevant to the Commissioner\u2019s mandate under article 10 to \u201c \u2018ensure that insurance is fair, available, and affordable for all Californians.\u2019 \u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 42A West\u2019s Ann. Ins. Code, <em>supra, </em>foil. \u00a7 1861.01 at p. 649.) Given that article 10 seeks to encourage public participation in the rate-setting process (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1045), precluding insurers from withholding trade secret information already provided to the Commissioner because of its relevance under article 10 (see <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1040-1042) is certainly reasonable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And such a conclusion does not render meaningless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>insurers\u2019 power to invoke the trade secret privilege at the public rate hearing, because insurers may still prevent disclosure of trade secret information not already provided to the Commissioner pursuant to article 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that Insurance Code section 1861.07 does not incorporate the exemption to disclosure found in Government Code section 6254, subdivision (k), and that trade secret information is therefore not exempt from disclosure. Because we find that State Farm may not invoke the trade secret privilege to prevent disclosure of its record A data under Insurance Code section 1861.07, we decline to address the other issues raised by State Farm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">George, C.
