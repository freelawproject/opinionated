Bosa Stevens, wife of said Alanson, subsequently became a pauper, and a charge upon the township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-12\">At the time of the death of Alanson Stevens, one John Catterson held a judgment against him in the sum of $700. On August 2d 1878, this judgment was duly revived by scire facias against the administrator, and on the following day a fi. fa. was issued thereon, directed against decedent\u2019s interest in the farm in Sterling township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-13\">On August 15th 1878, on application of the overseers of the poor of Stirling township and of the widow, the Orphans\u2019 Court stayed the fi. fa. until the widow should have the sum of $300 appraised to her and set apart out of the real estate. Appraisers were appointed, who on September 5th 1881 filed an appraisement of the whole of decedent\u2019s interest in the farm at $300. The same day the widow filed an acceptance of the appraisement. On October 8th 1881, before absolute confirmation thereof by the court, the following withdrawal of the application for the appraisement was filed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-14\">\u201cFor and in consideration of the sum of twelve dollars, to me in hand paid by John Catterson, of Sterling township, Wayne County, Pa., a judgment creditor of Alanson Stevens, deceased, as well as for other good and valuable considerations, I hereby withdraw my application for the appraisement to me of property to the value of three hundred dollars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>from the estate of said Alanson Stevens, deceased, filed in the above stated case, and agree to make no further demand or claim for said appraisement, and hereby authorize the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Wayne county, to file this withdrawal of record in the case. Witness my hand and seal the day of October, a. d., 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-4\">Her</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">\u201c Eose <em>x Stevens. </em>[Seal.]\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">Mark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">On October 25th 1881, the overseers of the poor made application to have the withdrawal stricken off. They averred that all the proceedings theretofore taken in the matter of the appraisement and exemption had been instituted by them, and that Eose Stevens had readily signed all papers presented by them to her, with the understanding that the proceedings were to be for their use. They further averred that the signature of said Eosa to the above withdrawal had, they believed, been obtained from her without any understanding upon her part of the nature of the instrument, she being of weak mind. Appended to this application was an affidavit by Eosa Stevens, stating, inter alia, \u201c that she never intended to sign any paper withdrawing her claim for the three hundred dollars, and that the purported withdrawal by her, dated in October 1881, was signed by her without understanding the nature thereof, and the effect of so doing. That she has heretofore voluntarily turned over unto the poor-masters of Sterling this claim of three hundred dollars, so far as she could do so, and allowed them to proceed for her in the matter, and that she never intended to sign any paper which would in any way interfere with having the three hundred dollars set apart as claimed out of the real estate of her deceased husband, and further saith not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">The court, after argument, granted the application and struck off the withdrawal, whereupon John Catterson took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-9\"><em>George 8. </em>Purdy, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiK\">\u2014 The widow had a perfect right to withdraw her application. The act granting her the exemption of three hundred dollars is in pari materia with the exemption act of 1849: Neff\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris 247; Davis\u2019 Appeal, 10 Casey 257; Hufman\u2019s Appeal, 31 P. F. Smith 331; Morris <em>v. </em>Shafer, 12 Norris 491. She had a right to waive her claim at any time before the property exempted was set out for her: Biddle <em>v. </em>Moore, 3 Barr 178 ; Kyle and Dunlap\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 353 ; Appeal of the Overseers of White Deer Township, 38 Leg. Int. 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b26-10\">The widow had no right to assign her claim. , An assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ment was tantamount to an abandonment: Bowyer\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris 214; Shelly\u2019s Appeal, 12 Casey 373; Pittman\u2019s Appeal, 12 Wright 315 ; Frances\u2019 Estate, 25 P. F. Smith 222 ; Crozier\u2019s Appeal, 9 Norris 388.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-6\"><em>E. G. </em>Hamlin, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV\">\u2014 The withdrawal was evidently procured by fraud. The widow, having by her acts induced the overseers to expend time and money in pushing her claim, was estopped from filing a withdrawal: Dezell <em>v. </em>Odell, 3 Hill (N. Y.) 219; Beaupland <em>v. </em>McKeen, 4 Casey 124; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Moltz, 10 Barr 531; Miller\u2019s Appeal, 3 Norris 391; Wise <em>v. </em>Rhodes, 3 Norris 402; Klein <em>v. </em>Caldwell, 10 Norris 144; Young <em>v. </em>Babilon, 10 Norris 280.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b27-7\">Chief Justice Shakswood</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 6th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">If, as is alleged, the court below made absolute the rule to strike off the widow\u2019s withdrawal of her claim for $300 under the Act of April 14th 1851, \u00a7 5, Pamph. L. 613, on the ground that she had no right to withdraw it, we think it was an error, as contrary was field by this court in White Deer Township\u2019s Appeal, 38 Legal Intell. 285. But the ground of the action of the court does not appear of record. The order of the court is simply that the widow\u2019s withdrawal be stricken off. The record sliows affidavits and depositions. There is an affidavit of the widow herself averring that she never intended to sign any paper withdrawing her claim for the $300, and that the purported withdrawal by her dated in October 1881, was signed by her without understanding the nature thereof, and the effect thereof.\u201d Non constat that this was not the ground of the order. But however it may have been, it is clear that this was but an interlocutory order, and no appeal lies to this court except from the final decree of distribution. The appellant may appeal from that decree if the money is eventually awarded to the widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">Appeal quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
