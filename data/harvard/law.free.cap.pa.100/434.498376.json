On March 13th 1881 he died, and nine days afterwards the register granted letters of administration to Joseph Bowersox, a son, and Samuel Bowersox, a brother of the intestate and his committee in lunacy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-18\">Susannah Bowersox, claiming to be the widow of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>cedent, and the right to administer his estate, appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court. She was seventy years old at the time, and was living with Philip Swineford, a son by her former marriage with George Swineford, deceased. By his will George Swineford-left Susannah certain property to be enjoyed by her only while she remained his widoyv- Before the commissioner appointed by the court to take testimony, Susannah Bowersox testified that her maiden name was Inhoff, that she had been twice married; the first time to George Swineford, and after his death \u2014 about twenty years previous to the date of testifying\u2014 to John Browersox, by Preacher May (now deceased), and that after her marriage with John Bowersox, she had lived with him until he was taken to the asylum. She further testified that she could read nothing except German printing and could not sign her name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-6\">Many other witnesses testified that both John and Susannah Bowersox had told them that they were married; and that they had lived together for twenty years, during which time they had the general reputation in the neighborhood of being married, and repeatedly executed deeds as husband and wife. A family Bible belonging to John Bowersox was produced, containing a separate leaf, upon which was entered in German \u2014 alleged to be in the handwriting of John Bowersox \u2014 the following: \u201cWe entered into holy matrimony in the year 1860 on the 19th day of May \u2014 with Susannah Inhoff.\u201d No other record of the marriage was produced, nor any witness of the ceremony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-7\">On the part of the administrators Joseph Bowersox testified that on some occasions both John and Susannah Bowersox in presence of each other, had told him they were married, but that afterwards they acknowledged they were not; and through his influence on November 26th 1877, after the adjudication of lunacy, they were married by one Squire Bowersox, at which time they acknowledged that they had not been previously married. Numerous witnesses were then produced who testified that there were contradictory stories in the neighborhood during the time that John and Susannah Bowersox lived \u201ctogether, some people affirming that they were, and others that they were n,ot husband and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-8\">After a hearing the Orphans\u2019 Court sustained Susannah Bowersox\u2019s appeal, and Bucher, P. J., entered the following decree: \u201c The letters heretofore granted are vacated, and it is ordered that the register issue letters to Susannah Bowersox, widow of decesed, upon her giving satisfactory security according to law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-9\">Whereupon Joseph and Samuel Bowersox took this appeal assigning for error the decree of the court: <em>(a) </em>In holding that Susannah Bowersox is the widow of John Bowersox, and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>such entitled to letters of administration on his estate.

J. Smith </em>and <em>A. </em>IF. Potter, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahe\">\u2014 Opposed to the testimony of Susannah Bowersox, is the fact that during the years she claims to have been married to John Bowersox she received benefit under the will of her former husband; also the fact that she was married November 26th 1876 to John Bowersox (which marriage was of course void on account of his lunacy), and the further fact that if she was married as she alleges, it was kept secret from the respective families. The evidence produced of marriage, by reputation and cohabitation, was not sufficient. A presumption of marriage by reputation must be established \u201c by the speech of the people in the neighborhood.\u201d Here the opinion of the people was so divided in its character, that no presumption of marriage can arise from it: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stump, 3 P. F. S. 132; Greenawalt <em>v. </em>McEnelley, 4 Nor. 356.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">Susannah Bowersox is not a competent person to administer the estate, on account of her ignorance, her advanced age, her physical disability, and the fact that she lives with, and is controlled by Philip Swineford, who is largely indebted to the estate and refuses to pay: Ellmaker\u2019s estate, 4 Watts 34; Bieber\u2019s Appeal, 1 Jones 157. Besides, having no property, she brings no personal liability to the trust, and although she may not be insolvent within tlie meaning of the Acts of Assembly, yet this is sufficient reason to render her incompetent: Cases last above cited, and Cornpropst\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey 538.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-7\"><em>Charles Hower </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANi\">\u2014 Almost all the witnesses examined prove that John Bowersox told them after May I860, that he was married to Susannah, or that the old people acknowledged deeds in their presence, as man and wife. This in addition to the appellee\u2019s positive-testimony, and the entry in the family Bible. The marriage was also established by evidence of cohabitation and reputation, the preponderance of testimony being largely in favor of this view. The fact that they were married again in 1876 is not vital; this was done through the influence of J oseph Bowersox, who insisted upon it; and the report that they were not previously married originated with him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">The appellant\u2019s position as to the competency of Susannah Bowersox to administer this estate, cannot be maintained. It is unnecessary to inquire into the business qualifications of persons who desire t\u00f3 administer estates. The 22d section of the Act of March-15th 1832 (P. D. 410, pl. 27) does speak of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cincompetency,\u201d referring, no doubt, to lunatics, idiots, insane persons, and those too young or who are litigants with the estate, but does not exclude any one for want of education. Cornpropst\u2019s Appeal (supra) decides that insolvency renders a person otherwise entitled to take out letters, incompetent. But Susannah Bowersox is not insolvent. It has not been shown that she owes a dollar.'</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-6\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"AGj\">delivered the opinion of the Court, October 2d 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">John Bowersox died intestate. The register granted letters of administration on his estate to the appellants, one of whom is a son, and the other a brother of the intestate. Susannah Bowersox, claiming to be the widow of the decedent, and the right to administer on his estate, appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court, After hearing, the court vacated the letters issued to the appellants, and ordered that letters be issued to. Susannah Bowersox.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Two objections are made to the conclusion of the court: one to finding her to be the widow of the decedent, the other to deciding that she was a proper person to be entrusted with the management of the estate. We have carefully examined the evidence. We think it amply sufficient to justify the court in finding that she had been married to John Bowersox. Not only was there positive evidence of the fact of their marriage : birt they undoubtedly lived together for some twenty years; and the clear weight of evidence shows, as husband and wife during all that time. The apparent desire not to make the marriage generally known, is accounted for by the fact that all right to her former husband\u2019s property terminated when she ceased to be his widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The effort to prove her an improper person clearly failed. It is true she is rather illiterate. She cannot write. She cannot read printing unless it be in German. She has not a business education. In this respect she is like a large majority of the widows in the Commonwealth. The Act of Assembly giving the widow a preferred right to administer on the estate of her deceased husband has not made an imperfect or defective education, a legal disqualification. A good mind and sound judgment, a knowledge of the values of property, and of the practical business transactions of life, are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute. All these the appellee has. They will enable her to select competent assistants and able advisers. This will secure an efficient and faithful discharge of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">It is further claimed, inasmuch as she has no separate property, that she comes within the prohibition declared in Cornpropst\u2019s Appeal, 9 Casey 537, by reason of insolvency. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>This is a misapprehension of the moaning of insolvency. It is not the mere absence of property liable to seizure on execution. It is the owing of debts in excess of the value of his tangible property. If he owes no debt ho is not insolvent, although he may have no such property. A young mechanic or laborer out of debt, just starting for himself with no property but his knowledge, brawny arm, and energetic will, is not insolvent. Nor is one without visible property, owing no debt, who has acquired a learned profession which he is about to follow. In all these cases each may by industry, labor, and economy, pay his way and contract no debts. Without debts there can be no insolvency. Poverty and insolvency are not synonymous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The evidence in the present case does not show the appellee to owe a single dollar. If anything remain of her husband\u2019s estate after paying his debts, she will have property. That will be in addition to the undoubted security which she must give before the letters are issued to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Decree' affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-6\">Siiarswood, C.
