L. Harvey. The sheriff sold said property, under the Harvey writ, on May 16th 1877 to the said W. D. and E. F. Brown, who took possession thereof, and the sheriff, on September 21st 1S77, paid over the proceeds of said sale to Harvey, with the consent of, or without objection by the Browns.

L. Harvey <em>v. </em>Nautilus Slutter, being the same execution that the deputy sheriff, Erotli, had in his hands and spoke of in his examination when called by the plaintiffs.

The risk of its being seized in this way was one of the risks assumed, in our judgment, by the sureties when they executed the bond. We think, therefore, that the evidence is incompetent. The objection is sustained, the evidence excluded, and at the request of defendants\u2019 counsel bill is sealed. (First assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u25a0 The plaintiff presented the following jaoint:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-4\">That the defendants by their undertaking in their bond, to pay a definite and stipulated sum thereby liquidated and fixed the value of the property levied upon, whatever it may have been, as between them and the plaintiffs in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">Answer. We affirm this point. The value of the property so far as regards this case is the amount of the judgment. The liability on the bond is for that. (Second assignment of- error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-6\">The defendants presented, inter alia, the following points. 2. That under the evidence in this case, the sureties, namely, Charles Kessler and P. J. Campbell, are discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\">Answer. We decline to affirm that point. (Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">4. That the delivery of the property mentioned in the bond to the obligee therein named was a compliance with the conditions thereof, and therefore there can be no recovery in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">Answer. We cannot affirm this point, because the delivery of the property mentioned in the bond to the obligee was not a delivery in pursuance of the obligation of the bond, but was a compulsory delivery by virtue of a sheriff\u2019s sale on another writ, issued upon another judgment. It is the duty of the court to construe the meaning of papers and contracts between parties, and we hold that the meaning of this bond was not that such a delivery as occurred in this case should satisfy its terms. We therefore refuse to affirm the point. (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\">The court charged the jury, inter alia These being the facts, we instruct you as matter of law, that the contingency contemplated by the bond arose, and the liability on the part of the bondsmen accrued, when the property was seized and sold upon another execution, and its production under the first execution thus rendered impossible. The suit being upon the bond, the law being in our judgment as we have stated, nothing lias been shown by these defendants which will relieve them from liability under the bond. They-are therefore liable for the amount of the debt in the judgment of Messrs. Brown against Nautilus Slutter, that being the condition of the bond.\u201d (Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-11\">\u201c Under the views which the court has explained to you of' the law of the case, it will be your duty to find for the amount of the original claim, with interest added, in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d (Seventh- assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">Yerdict and judgment for the plaintiff, for $526.65, and judgment thereon, whereupon the defendants took this writ of. error, assigning for error the rejection of their offer of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>dence, the answers to plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 points, and the portion of the charge above quoted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-6\"><em>G.

If he put it or its proceeds to another use than that contemplated in the bond, he is estopped from bringing suit on the bond as legal plaintiff, and his assignees stand in no better position. The sureties at least were discharged. It is said that lie did not get the property on the Brown execution. But that was the firs'! lien ; the rule to open the Brown judgment and the taking of the bond did not affect its lien : Hastings <em>v. </em>Quigley, 2 Clark 431; Sedgwick\u2019s Appeal, 7 W. &amp; S. 260, 263. The Brown\u2019s execution was entitled to the proceeds of the sale prior to the Harvey execution, yet the court directed a verdict on the bond for plaintiff. If the property remained subject to other process after taking such a bond, a subsequent levy would always produce a forfeiture of the bond. This the law will not suffer: Hastings <em>v. </em>Quigley, supra; Hagan <em>v. </em>Lucas, 10 Peters 400.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-7\"><em>T. B.

The subsequent levy on the goods under an execution did not satisfy the condition of the bond: Coar <em>v. </em>Green, 5 Luz. Leg.

Appeal, 11 Norris 200.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b327-8\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"Ad9F\">delivered the opinion of the court,, October 2d 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">This suit was on a bond executed under the following circumstances. A fi. fa. in favor of the Browns against Slutter was put in the hands of the sheriff the latter part of March; a second fi. fa. against the same defendant in favor of Iiarvey was put in hands \u2018 the fore part of April. Both executions were returnable on the second Monday of May then next. On the 30th of April, with both executions in his hands, the sheriff made a levy on the execution in favor of the Browns- upon personal property. Afterwards on the same day the court granted a rule to show cause why the judgment in favor of the Bi\u2019owns should not be opened.and tlie defendant let into a defence ; at the same time ordering \u201c all proceedings to be stayed \u2014 sheriff to be secure in his levy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The sheriff proceeded no further on this execution, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>suffered the property levied on to remain in the possession of the defendant. Some few days thereafter, the precise time is not shown, the bond in suit was executed by the plaintiffs in error. The execution in favor of Ilarvey was also levied on the same property: but at what time the evidence fails to disclose. It is alleged and not denied to have been on the same day the bond was given. On the 16th May the property was sold by the sheriff on the execution of Harvey and purchased by the Browns.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The first specification of error is to the rejection of evidence offered to prove, inter alia, that the sheriff obtained possession of the property on the execution of Harvey, on the morning of the sale; that lie retained the money produced by the sale until September following; to be followed by evidence that by consent of the Browns he paid the money on the execution in. favor of Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u25a0The relevancy of this evidence depends on whether the lien of the levy on the execution of the Browns was divested by the order staying the writ, and the takipg of the bond by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">If the plaintiffs in the execution had voluntarily agreed to a stay thereof beyond the return day of the writ, their ^Lien would have been postponed to that of a subsequent execution creditor guilty of no laches. This stay, however, was not by act of the plaintiffs in the \u25a0 execution. It was by the court. The order of the latter clearly does not show any intention to disturb the lien of the levy ; but on the contrary to continue it, and make it secure.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">It is claimed inasmuch as the sheriff took a bond with sureties for the forthcoming of the property or the payment of the execution, that this operated as a discharge of the lien, and the second execution thereupon acquired a preferred right to the proceeds of the sale. We cannot consent to this conclusion. In the language of the court, the purpose of the bond was to make the sheriff \u201csecure in his levy.\u201d It was not to divest or destroy the lien, but to make it firm and steadfast.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">In Sedgwick\u2019s Appeal, 7 W. <em>&amp; </em>S. 260, it was held that an execution stayed under the Act of 16th July 1842, did not lose its lien upon the personal property levied on. We see no sound reason for holding the effect on the lien to be different when the fi. fa. be stayed by virtue of the command of a statute, than when stayed by virtue of the common law powers vested in th.e court. In either case security is given for the forthcoming of the property: but it is not withdrawn from the custody of the law. Unless there be unreasonable delay in reclaiming the same it is as free from the reach of other processes as if it liad remained continuously in the hands of the sheriff: Hagan <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Lucas, 10 Peters 400. When tbe injunction staying the writ be removed, the property can be sold without a new levy thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">This property was sold in less than three weeks after the execution in favor of the Browns was ordered to be stayed. There had been no unreasonable delay.in reclaiming it on that execution.\" When the bond was executed, it declared the property to be in the possession of the defendant in the execution. It was pertinent to prove it so remained, until the day of sale. This was after the return day of each fi. fa. The lien of the execution first in time was no more lost than the lien of the later one.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The plaintiffs in the first execution were purchasers at the sale. They had full knowledge of the sum produced thereby, and it must be assumed they knew their right thereto. If they omitted to assert that right, and consented that the money be applied on the later execution, it was the voluntary transfer to \u25a0another of money to which they were entitled.. In equity, it must operate as a payment to them of that amount. The first and seventh assignments are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">It may be conceded that the alternative obligation of the bond is greater than the sheriff had a right to require. An obligation to deliver the property when legally demanded, or to pay the value thereof, would have answered the just requirements of the law. The obligors appear to have voluntarily assumed a stronger obligation, and they are bound thereby. It is very probable that the value of the property levied on was admitted to be fully equal to the amount of the execution, and, therefore, the alternative agreement to pay the amount of the execution with costs, was considered of no practical importance. Be that as it may, no cause is shown why the obligors shall not be held to a fulfillment of the obligation which they assumed : People <em>v. </em>Reeder, 25 N. Y. 302; Burrall <em>v. </em>Acker, 23 Wend. 606. The remaining assignments are, therefore, not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Judgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
