That on three occasions the defendant went into the house, and saw Mrs. Bobertson, but they generally remained outside near the gate. That in September \u00cd880, defendant invited her to take a walk, about 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, which they did, and that during their absence they had sexual intercourse, and that this was repeated about four weeks later. She gave birth to a child May 28th 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-9\">Her testimony in relation to the alleged promise of marriage prior to the seduction was, that on both the occasions referred to the defendant \u201cwent down upon his knees, and promised to marry her if she would let him do \u2014 what he did do,\u201d and that she would not have permitted it otherwise. This testimony was not corroborated. There was, however, some testimony that the defendant afterwards said to Mrs. Bobertson \u2014 Margaret\u2019s mother \u2014 he was sorry fo.r what he had done; that he couldn\u2019t marry her before two weeks; \u201c he promised to be there and set the day, and didn\u2019t come.\u201d Defendant denied such promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\">There was no evidence indicative of an intention of marriage on the \u00a1Dart of the defendant, other than the fact that he would meet her once or twice a week and walk with her, &amp;c., with her parent\u2019s knowledge, and without their objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-11\">The defendant testified: Q. Tell what the reputation of this girl'is there, in Dunmore, from the speech of the people? A. I heard said, she was kind of a loose character \u2022 she went by the name of the \u201c regular\u201d in Dunmore. I don\u2019t believe I went with her over two or three times before I heard rumors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-12\">The father of Miss Bobertson (the prosecutor), on cross-examination, was asked: Q. Don\u2019t you know, that your daughter goes by the name of the \u201cregular\u201d in Dunmore? A. No, sir, I never did. Yes, sir, I have have heard talk, but have no certainty of it, and these are the characters, that got it up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s ease defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to take from the jury the question of seduction, and submit to them no other question but that of fornication and bastary. Motion overruled; exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\">The court charged the jury, inter alia :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">\u201c The prosecutor alleges that there was a promise of marriage made to his daughter before this illicit connection took place .... The defendant says that he never made a promise of marriage to this young lady, but admits that he did have illicit connection with her. This evidence of course contradicts the testimony of the daughter of the prosecutor. Now the decisions say, before there can be a conviction in a case of this nature, there must be other corroborating evidence sustaining the promise of marriage, and that corroborative evidence may be made out by positive proof or by circumstantial evidence. This is one of the essential requisites to be found by you from the evidence in this case, before there can be a conviction..... That, therefore, leaves but two questions for you to ascertain as the case is now presented to you: first, was she a young lady of good repute; second, did the illicit connection take place because of the promise of marriage ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-8\"><em>\u201c </em>It is contended that this case requires the essentials so far as the making of presents, writing of love-letters and all of such things that pass between young people, to make out this case. But we have long passed that day, so far as courtship is concerned. There is no doubt but that in the early history of these cases, when the defendant was not permitted to go upon the witness stand and not allowed to testify, that there should be corroborative evidence to sustain the charge made by the young lady of the promise of marriage; but in our day and generation, when a defendant may go upon the witness -stand and'testify equally as well as the prosecutor, then of course these essentials are not absolutely necessary, although they may yet appear in the case. The proper way to dispose of cases of this kind is to take each case as it stands on its own four legs, take the case as the parties built it up, keeping in mind their standing in society and their immediate manner of courtship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-9\">\u201c One man may desire to court the girl he desires to make his wife in a secluded place, or he may desire to keep it quiet; another may be in the habit of keeping company with a young-lady and appear upon the public highway from time to time so that all may see him; hence there is no standard, each case must stand on its own four legs as the parties built it up. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-10\"><em>\u201c </em>Now in this case it is for you to say whether the meeting of these parties, which continued for over a year, was merely for the purpose of having illicit connection, or whether it was for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>an honorable purpose on the part of the defendant \u2014 that is, for the purpose of making this young lady his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">\u201cNow it is for yon to say from all of the evidence and the surrounding circumstances of this case whether the original meeting was honorable, or whether, if he made a promise of marriage, it was made for an honorable purpose, and not for the purpose of deceiving this young lady and gaining her affection so that he might have illicit connection with her.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">Verdict, guilty in manner and form, &amp;c. The defendant was sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution and afine of $500, and to separate and solitary confinement in the Eastern penitentiary for one year and six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">The defendant, having obtained a special allocatur, took this writ, assigning for error the refusal by the court of his motion to withdraw the question of seduction from the jury, and the portions of the charge above quoted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-9\"><em>Cornelius </em>Smith, for the plaintiff in error, cited \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVt\">Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Walton, 2 Brewst. 489.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-10\"><em>J.

The record having been brought into this court for review, several errors have been assigned to the rulings of the learned judge, the most material of which are the second and third.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">It was palpable error to instruct the jury, that evidence to corroborate the prosecutrix in regard to the promise of marriage is no longer necessary. Upon this point the learned judge charged: \u201c There is no doubt but that in the early history of these cases, when the defendant was not permitted to go upon the witness stand, and not allowed to testify, that there should be corroborative evidence to sustain the charge made by the young lady of the promise of marriage. But in our day and generation, when a defendant may go upon the witness stand and testify equally as well as the prosecutor, then of course these essentials are not absolutely necessary, although they may yet appear in the case. The proper way to dispose of cases of this kind is to take each case as it stands on its own four legs, take the case as the parties built it up, keeping in mind their standing in society, and their immediate manner of courtship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">The 41st section of the Act of 31st March 1860, P. L. 392, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>which defines the offence of seduction, expressly provides, \u201c That the promise of marriage shall not be deemed established, unless the testimony of the female seduced is corroborated by other evidence, either circumstantial or positive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The fact that a defendant charged with seduction is now allowed to testify on his own behalf does not repeal tbis provision of the Act of 18G0. It is urged, however, that this error was cured by the previous portion of the charge, in which the law upon this subject was correctly ruled. If we take the charge as a whole we find this point ruled both ways. Unfortunately, the erroneous ruling was the last, and therefore likely to have made lodgment with the jury. \"We cannot say it did no harm, in view of the conviction of the plaintiff in error, and the very feeble corroboration of the prosecutrix upon the question of the promise of marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The learned judge, also erred in charging: <em>\u201c </em>It is contended that this case requires the essentials, so far as the making of presents, writing of love-letters and all of such things that pass between young people, to make out this case. But we have long passed that day, so far as courtship is concerned .... One man may desire to court the girl he desires to make his wife in a secluded place, or ho may desire to keep it quiet; another may be in the habit of keeping company with a young lady and appear upon the public highway from time to time so that all may see him; hence there is no standard, each case must stand on its own four legs as the. parties built it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">This instruction wras not calculated to aid the jury in arriving at a correct conclusion. In view of the character of the evidence it was not only inadequate but misleading and erroneous. The attentions from which the jury were permitted to infer a promise of marriage were of an equivocal character. The plaintiff in error had been in the house of the prosecutrix but four times, according to her own statement and that of her mother, and then only for a short time. He met her out in the evenings, sometimes at church, walked home with her, and left her at the gate. This is not the kind of intercourse that usually takes place between persons engaged to be married. It may teud to matrimony, but is quite as likely to lead to something else. Circumstantial evidence of an engagement of marriage is to be found in the proof of such facts as usually accompany that relation. Among them may be mentioned letters, presents, social attentions of various kinds, visiting together in company, preparations for housekeeping, and the like. These and similar circumstances, especially when the attentions are exclusive and continued a long time; may well justify a jury in finding a promise of marriage. But the court below ignored all these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>matters, as being no longer essential, or rather, as belonging to a past age, and virtually instructed the jury that attentions paid to a woman \u201c in a secluded place \u201d are quite as satisfactory evidence of such promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We cannot assent to this proposition. The circumstances which will warrant a jury in finding an intention to marry must be of those pure acts which mark an honorable purpose, and not attentions which are consistent only with the pursuit of lust.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The instruction complained of in the fourth assignment, while not positive error, was well calculated to mislead the jury in the absence of any adequate instruction upon the law of\u2019 the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The fifth assingment does not appear to be sustained by an exception, and moreover is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">We cannot say it was error to refuse to withdraw the question of seduction from the jury. There was some proof that plaintiff: in error admitted the promise to marry. The mere evidence of his attentions to the young woman was not sufficient to carry the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The judgment is reversed, and it is ordered that the record, with this opinion setting forth the causes of reversal, be remanded to the court below for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
