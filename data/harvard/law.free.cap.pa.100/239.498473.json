A testator, by his will, devised and bequeathed to his wife his whole residuary estate, iu trust, to apply one third the net income to herself, and two-thirds part thereof among his children, each child to have an equal share. At the expiration of seven years from his death, testator authorized his wife to make partition of his estate among his children in equal shares, (or if any should die, to their children the parent\u2019s share), said partition to vest the estates according to the terms thereof, as fully as if therein devised. Testator further empowered his wife to make said partition upon such trusts and limitations as she should see proper, and directed, that until said partition, no interest iu his estate should vest in' iris said children. Testator further empowered his wife in her discretion to retain the whole or any part of each child\u2019s share, and to incorporate the same in said partition. <em>Held, </em>that no interest in the principal of testator\u2019s estate vested until the expiration of seven years from his death and the making of the partition as aforesaid, and that where the income arising from any share was retained in accordance with the discretionary power in the will, the same became a part of the principal, and did not vest until the share of which it formed a part was allotted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b255-13\">2.

The trustees of an estate embracing a ground-rent which was much in arrear, agreed with the owners of the property upon which the rent was reserved, that said property should be leased for a term of years, the rents to bo paid to the trustees, they to pay certain taxes already accrued and to accrue. This was done in order to obviate the necessity of selling the property at judicial sale, and probably being obliged to buy in the same to protect the interests of the estate. Upon the filing of the account of the trustees: <em>Held, </em>that as the arrangement appeared to have been made to aid both capital and income, the trustees should divide the gross disbursements for taxes equally between the capital account and the income account.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b256-7\">April 5th 1882.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Aq8I\">Before Sharswood O.

Barger as aforesaid. And the said partition and allotment so made by declaration under her hand and seal, and acknowledged and recorded, shall vest the estates according to the terms thereof as fully as if herein devised. And my said wife shall, in the said partition and declaration, allot to and vest the shares of all my children, except the eldest six, in herself as trustee of said younger children, upon such trusts as she shall in said declaration set forth and establish.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">\u201cAnd my said wife shall at that time, or at any time thereafter in her discretion, make distribution of all the remainder of my estate according to the interests and proportions named in said article \u2018 Fifth,\u2019 securing to herself in said declaration and distribution her interest defined in said article \u2018Fifth.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">\u201cAnd I expressly declare and order, that my said wife may, in said declaration and said distribution, make and declare any and all trusts and limitations as she may then deem necessary or proper for the welfare of my children, or any and each of them: and that until then no interest in my estate shall vest in them, or either of them, except as provided in said article \u2018 Fifth \u2019; and as to that interest, my said wife may, in her discretion, retain the whole or any part of each child\u2019s proportion until said declaration or distribution, and incorporate it therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">Seventh. I appoint my said wife executrix of this my will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">By a subsequent codicil testator provided, inter alia, as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">\u201c I hereby revoke and alter two provisions in my will:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>\u201cFirst. By reason of the birth of my son, John Cook Iiirst, since its date, I direct that eleven shares, instead of ten shares of my estate, be made ; one share to said John Cook Hirst, in all respects as if his name had been written in the will as one of my eleven children, subject in all respects^ as therein written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">\u201c Second. I direct that the shares of all my minor children shall be held by my wife for their support and education, without any liability to account therefor to any one, including my last-born son, until the majority of each; this provision to stand in my will instead of the provision therein contained relating to their support and education, which I revoke, and substitute this.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">Letters testamentary were issued to Mrs. Hirst, who subsequently, however, became of unsound mind, whereupon letters d. b. n. c. t. a. were issued to the present accountant, who was also substituted as trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">One of testator\u2019s sons was named William L. Hirst, Jr. said son was indebted to Mary Clark, and was in 1878, solicited by her for an assignment of all his interest in his father\u2019s estate in order to secure said debt. William L. iiirst, Jr., declined to execute such an assignment, but on October 28th 1878, gave to said Mary Clark a bond for $1,500, accompanied by a mortgage of all his interest in his father\u2019s estate, which mortgage contained the usual thirty day clause and was duly recorded November 25th 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">Interest was punctually paid upon this mortgage while William L. Hirst, Jr., lived, the last payment being made January 28th 1880. On March 17th 18S0, William L. Iiirst, Jr., died, and thereafter interest on the said mortgage remained unpaid. Mary Clark at once notified the accountant of her mortgage, and claimed that all sums of money otherwise payable to William L. Hirst, Jr., should be paid to her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">On the audit, it was claimed, on behalf of said Mary Clark, that all income from the estate accruing to William L. Iiirst, Jr., after her notice, should be paid to her on account of the mortgage, and that the accountants should not be credited with payments made in disregard of said notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">Upon this point the auditing judge adjudicated, inter alia, as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">\u201c The only question to be determined is : Had William L. Hirst, Jr., any interest in his father\u2019s estate at the time of filing these accounts, or did his interest cease when he died <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">\u201c As the time for distribution of the corpus of the estate will not arrive until at least as late as August 30, 1883, it is unnecessary now to consider his interest in such corpus, as whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u25a0was vested in the real estate so far as to give a preference in its descent to his brothers and sisters of the whole blood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">\u201c But with regard to the income until the time for distribution of the principal, it seems clear that he had a vested interest \u2014not limited to the duration of his own life. The legal estate is given to the widow until the time \u2022 fixed for distribution, in trust to pay one-third of the income to herself during her widowhood, and the balance, to the children of testator, living at the time of his death, without any limitation as to the period for which it is so to be paid, other than the time appointed for final distribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">\u201c In the meantime she may sell real estate (the proceeds to be regarded as real estate), and in making distribution she may make such limitations, not however affecting the size or amount of the share, as she may think necessary or proper for the welfare of the testator\u2019s children or any of them. [How far this right is affected by the present condition of her mind, and in whom, in the meanwhile, the inheritance of the estate is vested is a question not now arising.] The testator himself, while declaring that until the final distribution of the estate no interest shall vest in his children, expressly excepts their interest in the income, which he recognizes as having vested in them under the provision made with regard to its payment to them \u2014 a' recognition which is repeated in a somewhat different shape in the second codicil. It is true that he undertakes to qualify their interest in the income by providing that his wdfe \u201c may, in her discretion, retain the whole or any part of each child\u2019s proportion until said declaration or distribution, and incorporate it therein,\u201d but this is in effect a trust for accumulation, which, so far as concerns children not minors is void altogether, and so far as concerns those who are, is void with regard to the direction to capitalize (\u201c to incorporate it therein \u201d). Washington\u2019s Appeal, 25 Smith 102, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The provision that in making partition, distribution, \u2018 if any shall die\u2019 shall be \u2018 to their children the parent\u2019s share,\u2019 merely indicates the order of succession, and does not reduce the estate vesting at the testator\u2019s death: Boraston\u2019s Case, 3 Coke 21, a; Manderson <em>v. </em>Lukens, 11 Harris 31; Womrath <em>v. </em>McCormick, 1 Smith 504; Crawford v.

Atkins, 10 Barr. 158.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">So much of the net income during the period covered by the accounts filed by the accountants as have accrued upon the share of William L. Hirst, Jr., since the date of his death, and since the date of the first default made in the payment of the interest due on the said mortgage (viz., April 28th 1880), is therefore awarded to Jos. W. Hunsicker, Esq., as attorney for Mary Clark, on account of said mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Among the assets of the estate was a ground rent of $3,900 issuing out of the West End Hotel. The rent had been unpaid for several years and the property was further incumbered by unpaid taxes and water rent. In order to prevent the necessity of selling out the property for arrears of the rent and probably being obliged to buy in the same, the trustees on April 16th 1S79, entered into written agreement whereby it was arranged that the property should be rented for five years, the rents to be paid to the accountants, who were to discharge all taxes and water rent already accrued and to accrue and to apply any balance on account of ground rent. In pursuance of this arrangement, accountants received $3,500 and paid out $5,609.48 for taxes and water rent. These items were included in the income account. The auditing judge ordered that portion of the last item paid for taxes, etc., accruing prior to the making of said arrangement to be stricken from the credits in the income account and transferred to the capital account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">Exceptions to this report were filed by Adele Barger et ah, children of \"William L. Hirst, claiming as next of kin of William L. Hirst, Jr., deceased, on the ground that the auditing judge erred in awarding any part of the share of said William L. Hirst, Jr., to Mary Clark. The accountants also filed exceptions, on the ground that the auditing judge erred in ordering the above credits to be transferred iron the income to the capital account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">The court, in an opinion by Ashman, J., dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">Adele II.

Hirst, administrator of William L. Hirst, Jr., also appealed, assigning for error the decree awarding any part of the appellant\u2019s intestate\u2019s share of his father\u2019s estate to Mary Clark, and the refusal to award the same to appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">The Philadelphia Trust, Safe Deposit and Insurance Company also appealed, assigning for error the dismissing of its exceptions and the decree of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">After these appeals had been taken, Edwin De Eorrest Hirst, a son of William L. Hirst, Jr., deceased, appeared by his guardian, O. D. Kinney, and presented a petition praying to be allowed to intervene as a -party appellant, having been entirely unaware of the present litigation until after the record thereof had been removed into the Supreme Court. The prayer was granted, whereupon Edwin De Forrest Hirst assigned for error the action of the court in decreeing that William L.

Hirst, Jr., as one of the children of William L. Hirst, Sr., deceased, by the will of the latter in the income of the estate from testator\u2019s death to the time of partition, was at most a chattel interest. Mary Clark, the mortgagee thereof, not having taken possession before the death of the mortgagor, and having had no right to take possession until default, which did not occur until after the mortgagor\u2019s death, has now no right to take the mortgaged fund as against the administrator of the mortgagor: Kater <em>v. </em>Steinruck\u2019s Administrator, 4 Wright 503 ; Fitler <em>v. </em>Shotwell, 7 W. &amp; S. 16 ; Building Association <em>v. </em>Bolster, 11 Norris 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">The purpose of the agreement as to the hotel property was to benefit the income of the estate ; therefore, the charges under the agreement to be paid by-the trustees, should be borne by income.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-10\"><em>Angelo T.

The limitation contravenes no rule of law, it is not in violation of the rule of perpetuities, and the validity and effect of such dispositions are no longer open questions: Glanvill <em>v. </em>Glanvill, 2 Mer. 38; Wakefield <em>v. </em>Dyott, 4 Jur.

And my said wife shall, at that time, or any time thereafter in her discretion, make distribution of all the remainder of my estate, according to the interests and proportions named in said article fifth.\u201d The testator further proceeds, \u201c and I expressly declare and order that my said wife may, in said declaration and said distribution, make and declare any and all trusts and limitations as she may then deem necessary or proper for the welfare of my children, or any or each of them ; and that until then, no interest in my estate shall vest in them, or either of them, except as provided in said article fifth ; and as to that interest, my said, wife may, in her discretion, retain the w'hole or any part of each child\u2019s projoortion, until said declaration or distribution, and incorporate it therein.\u201d William L. Hirst, Jr., was one of the six elder children.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">It is very clear the testator did not intend, that on his death any estate should vest in his son. The property was not given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to him, but to the wife of the testator in trust. On or after the expiration of seven years from the death of the latter, she was authorized to make partition and allotment among all the children. This partition and allotment then made was to vest the estate in each one to whom a portion was allotted. This language clearly precluded the idea that an estate vested in any child prior to that time. Not only must the seven years have expired, but his wife must have made the distribution, and declared all trusts and limitations that she thought proper. To remove all doubt as to the intention of the testator as to the time any estate should vest in his children, he proceeds- to declare, \u201c until then, no interest in my estate shall vest in them, or either of them.\u201d The exception referred to the income only. It will be observed, lmwever, that during the seven years there was no express devise of income to the children in the fifth article; but his wife was \u201c to apply \u201d the same for their benefit. That, however, was so changed in the sixth article as to leave it discretionary with her, whether to'apply any part of the income within the seven years, or to withhold all of it until the distribution of the corpus of the estate was made, and then incorporate in each child\u2019s proportion the sum thus withheld. When the income arising from any share was so retained, it became a part of the principal, and did not vest until the share of which it formed a part was allotted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In case of the death of any of the children within the seven years, and consequently before any partition or allotment made, then the portion which the parent otherwise would have received, was to be allotted to, and vested in, the child or children of the one so dying. In such contingency, no interest vested in the child of the testator ; but the estate passed directly from the testator to the grand-child. The fact that the trustee was authorized in her discretion to apply some or all of the income for the benefit of the children, did not vest it in any child, until so applied. . The gift takes effect only in the issue of the dead child, and is, therefore, a substantive gift to the issue: Theobald on Wills 494. The application of income for the benefit of the children, within the seven years, rested solely in the discretion of the trustee. During that time nothing tangible passed to the children on which they could execute a valid mortgage. Perry on Trusts, sections 386a and 386b. The right to the income ceased when the right to acquire the capital was barred : Comfort <em>v. </em>Austen, 12 Simons 218. As then under the dis\u25a0cretionary power of the trustee she did retain the undistributed \u25a0income, it did not vest in William L. Hirst, Jr., and his administrator cannot now claim it: Huber\u2019s Appeal, 30 P. F. Smith 348. This view in regard to discretionary powers is not in coniiiet with the statute forbidding perpetuities: Brown <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Williamson\u2019s Executors, 12 Casey 338 ; Huber\u2019s Appeal, supra. The appellant, Edwin Do Forrest Hirst, did not take the estate by transmission through his father, William L. Hirst, Jr., but took that which the latter might have acquired, had he lived until the expiration of the seven years: Pleasonton\u2019s Appeal, 3 Out. 363. The appellee presents no equities arising from ignorance of the mortgagor\u2019s holding no vested interest when she took the mortgage. He had previously notified her in writing that \u201c by the provisions of the will, no interest of any kind whatever vests in myself or in any of the children, until the execution of the deed of distribution, seven years after the death of my father.\u201d She did not take any possession of the property sought to be mortgaged, prior to the death of the mortgagor. The court, therefore, erred in decreeing any portion of the fund to Mary Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The question whether the sums aggregating $5,680.16 should be chargeable to income account or to principal, is not free from difficulty. We cannot agree with the conclusion of the auditing judge, that they were paid exclusively to preserve the capital of tire estate, nor are we able to see that they enured exclusively to the benefit of the income fund. The object of the agreement of April 16th 1879, appears to have been to aid both income and capital. These sums were paid in furtherance of that object. Each, therefore, should bear a share, and it seems to us equitable to divide this gross sum equally between income and principal. Further than this, the assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The appeal of Anthony A. Hirst, administrator of William L. Hirst, Jr., is dismissed at his costs. As to the several other appellants, the</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Decree is reversed, and it is ordered that distribution bo made conformably with this opinion. It is further ordered that the appellants each pay one half of the costs of their respective appeal, and the appellees the other half.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
