Iieatli from a decree of the said court sustaining a demurrer to, and dismissing a bill in equity filed by him against Joseph Slocum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-5\">The facts of the case, as set forth in the bill in equity, were ' substantially as follows. On March 12th 1878, William H.IIeath, being seised of five several lots of ground in the city of Scrantou, gave a judgment note for the sum of $6240 to Joseph Slocum. Said judgment note was the same day entered up, constituting a lien upon the five several lots aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">At various times Heath paid to Slocum on account of said judgment the sum of $480. In or about the month of August 1879, Heath caused a writ of fieri facias to be issued on said judgment, directed against the five several lots of ground aforesaid. The sheriff duly levied upon the said lots and advertised the same to be sold on August 9th 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-7\">Prior to this date, however, Heath entered into a parol agreement with Slocum, whereby it was understood that the lots should be sold collectively, and should be bid off at a nominal sum for Slocum, that a sheriff\u2019s deed should be made to him therefor, and that he should continue to hold the title to said lots as secui'ity for the unpaid portion of the purchase money. It was further understood, that if said Heath should tenderte Slocnm the unpaid portion of said judgment within ninety days after the acknowledgment of the sheriff\u2019s deed, Slocum would thereupon transfer the title to said lots to Heath or his nominee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-8\">The sheriff\u2019s sale took place as advertised. The attorneys of both Heath and Slocum deterred persons present at the sale from bidding, by representing that the sale was for the protection of the defendant, and in pursuance of an arrangement between him and the plaintiff. The lots were all sold collectively for the gross sum of ^860, and a sheriff\u2019s deed was therefor executed to Slocum. Heath, in pursuance of his agreement, also furnished $90 in money for the purpose of paying the costs of the sheriff\u2019s sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-9\">Subsequently, within ninety days of the acknowledgment of Slocum\u2019s deed, Heath tendered to him the unpaid balance on the judgment, and demanded a transfer of the title to the lots, which Slocum declined to make, whereupon the present j^roceeding was instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-10\">The bill prayed that the sheriff\u2019s deed to Slocum be decreed to be a mortgage, that an account be taken of the balance duo upon the judgment, and that upon payment by Heath of said balance, Slocum be decreed to transfer and convey to Heath, all his right, title and interest in and to the lots in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-11\">Defendant demurred to the whole bill on the ground that it set forth no cause of action. The court, after argument, in an opinion by Handley, P. J., sustained the demurrer and entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>a decree dismissing the bill. The complainant thereupon took this appeal, assigning for error the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-6\"><em>JI. M.

He cannot retain it without bad faith and fraud; equity will not permit one to hold a benefit derived through fraud: Sheriff <em>v. </em>Neal, 6 Watts 540 ; Boynton <em>v. </em>Housler, 23 P. F. Smith 453; Morey <em>v. </em>Herrick, 6 Harris 128; Plumer <em>v. </em>Reed, 2 Wright 46; Cook <em>v. </em>Cook, 19 P. F.

The sheriff\u2019s deed to Slocum is therefore a mortgage, or a trust ex maleficio arises: Sweetzer\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264; Boynton <em>v. </em>Housler, 23 Id. 458; Seichrist\u2019s Appeal, 16 Id. 237; Cook <em>v. </em>Cook, 19 Id. 443 ; Dauzeisens\u2019 Appeal, 23 Id. 65.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">The fact that Heath agreed to pay and actually did pay part of the costs, further impresses this character on the transaction: Hiester <em>v. </em>Maderia, 3 W. &amp; S. 384; Kisler <em>v. </em>Kisler, 2 Watts 323 ; Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, 9 Watts 36; Haines <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 10 Watts 313; Blyholder <em>v. </em>Gilson, 6 Harris 134.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">It is well established in Pennsylvania that where a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale obtains title for less than the value of the property, and pi\u2019events bidding by representing that he is purchasing for the defendant under an agreement with him, and there is such agreement, upon which the defendant relied, his conduct is calculated to do injury to the defendant, and he cannot reap the benefit of such conduct. He becomes a trustee for the person who has been deceived: Stewart <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 461; Brown <em>v. </em>Dysinger, 1 Rawle 413 ; McKennan <em>v. </em>Pry, 6 Watts 137; Seylar <em>v. </em>Carson, 19 P.

Albro </em>and <em>A. Iiicketts, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aq8\">\u2014 The alleged agreement was without consideration, and cannot therefore be enforced: Whitehill <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 P. &amp; W. 405; Kennedy\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Barr 445 ; Campbell\u2019s Estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>7 Barr 100 ; Shorb\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Schultz, 7 Wright 207; Dollar Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Bennett, 26 P. F. Smith 402.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\">In order to give jurisdiction in equity, something more must be shown than a mere breach of a parol agreement: Haines <em>v. </em>O\u2019Connor, 10 Watts 313; Kellum <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Casey 158; Barnet <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 8 Casey 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">As to the necessity of regarding the distinctioti between eases of equity jurisdiction, and those wherein parties have a right to a trial in the regular forms at law, see North Pa. Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Snowden, 6 Wright 488 ; Schlocht\u2019s Appeal, 10 P. F. Smith 172; Clark\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 447; Norris\u2019 Appeal, 14 Id. 275 ; Tillmes <em>v. </em>Marsh, 17 Id. 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">The only thing presented which even approaches a case of equity jurisdiction is the charge that bidders were prevented from purchasing at the sheriff\u2019s sale. But it will bo observed that it is nowhere charged that appellee made any statements whatever, nor that he Avas even, present at the sheriff's sale. Nor is the charge of Avliat did occur sufficiently definite to fix any liability ; whether the representation alleged Avas made by appellant\u2019s attorney or by appellee\u2019s attorney, does not appear. Moreover, the AAdiole of the alleged representation is \u201c that the sale Avas in pursuance of an arrangement.\u201d Clearly there Avas nothing in this to fasten a trust upon appellee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">We understand the case to bo fully decided in favor of. appellee by the cases of Blyholder <em>v. </em>Gilson, 6 Harris 134; Dollar Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Bennett, 26 P. F. Smith 402 ; Carhart\u2019s Appeal, 28 P. F. Smith 100.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b20-8\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">delivered the opinion of the court, February 27th 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-9\">The court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill, upon the ground that it sets forth no such cause of action as entitled him to be heard in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-10\">If the bill had set forth a mere naked agreement on the part of Slocum, the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, to hold the property purchased at said sale, Avith his OAvn money, for the benefit of Heath, the appellant, the case Avould have been Avithin the ruling in Dollar Savings Bank <em>v. </em>Bennett, 26 P. F. S. 402. There are averments in the bill, liOAvever, Avhich take it out of this line of cases. They are, 1st, that by means of the arrangement referred to, persons present at the sale Avere prevented, from bidding ; a bid on one of the pieces of land Avas AvithdniAvn, and all the'pieces were allowed to be sold collectively for a nominal sum. 2d. That in pursuance of an agreement to that effect, the appellant furnished a portion of the money necessary to pay the costs of the sheriff\u2019s sale. Here is something more than a naked promise to hold the property in trust for Heath. Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>bidders were silenced because they were told that Slocum was buying for the defendant in the execution; several properties which the law required to be sold separately were put up and sold in a lump, for a nominal sum, while the costs of the sale were in part paid by Heath. \"We think the facts as set forth in the bill bring the case within the principle of Sweetzer\u2019s appeal, 21 P. F. S. 264, where a sheriff\u2019s deed was held to be a mortgage, and the grantee named therein a trustee for the man whose land he had bought at sheriff\u2019s sale; and the more recent case of Christy <em>v. </em>Sill, 11 Pittsburgh Legal Journal (N. S.) 101, where the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, who had falsely represented at said sale that he was bidding for the family, and by means of this and other fraudulent representations induced other parties not to bid, and procured the propery to be knocked down to him for a less sum than its value, was held to be a trustee ex maleficio for the parties thus defrauded.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">We are of the opinion that it was error to sustain the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">\u2022 Decree reversed at the costs of the appellees, and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
