Scranton was put into the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale by which the transfer to the Jifkins was made, simply a nominal party, we, at the. time, acting for William E. Dodge, who was the party lending the Jifkins the sum of $12,000 for which the mortgage, under which the proceedings presented by the plaintiffs were conducted; and that Joseph H. Scranton continued to act as the agent of William E. Dodge, and the agent of the present plaintiffs, Mrs. Atterbury, down to at least 1872, and that the whole transaction was simply one gotten up to transfer this property to the Jifkins in the manner agreed upon between them and Addison Sweetzer, and that Joseph H. Scranton\u2019s name was used simply as that of a nominal party to effect the transfer in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>sucli way as would be satisfactory to Joseph II.

RicJceits, </em>for tlie plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXW\">\u2014 The fact that Sweetzer had obtained a rule to show cause -why the judgment should not be opened and he be let into a defence to the action of scire facias on the mortgage, was offered and admitted for the purpose of showing that we had had a day in court for the presentation of our defence, and that the' decision on that rule was res adjudicata, and thereby precluded us from again setting up our defence in this action of ejectment. That would have been so if the court had made that rule absolute and we had had a trial of the scire facias on the merits. But the court discharged the rule. That was not a day in court; it was the refusal of a day in court, at that stage. We therefore were entitled to our day on the trial of this ejectment: Wistar <em>v. </em>McManes, 4 P. F. Smith 318; Mevey\u2019s Appeal 4 Barr 80. But the court held that the matter was res adjudicata, and directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The refusal of our rule was an interlocutory order, and an interlocutory order is never res adjudicata. Our property is thus taken from ns without our constitutional right of a jury trial. Our title had previously been adjudicated by this court in our favor, as against the Jifkins, in Sweetzer\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264. It is true the present plaintiffs were not parties to, and are therefore not bound by that decision ; but, on the other hand, we were not parties to the plaintiffs\u2019 sci. fa., and are not bound by that judgment.. The plaintiffs here claim under the Jifkins title, and, as mortgagees, or purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale under the mortgage, take only such title as the mortgagor had. The nature of the Jifkins title was therefore the very essence of the inquiry.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-6\"><em>W. II. Jessup </em>and <em>I. J. Post, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWo\">\u2014The assignee of a mortgage takes subject to the equities of the mortgagor, but not as to latent equities of cestuis quo trust of the mortgagor or other persons : Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Barr 399 ; Wethrill\u2019s Appeal, 3 Grant 281; Taylor <em>v. </em>Gitt, 10 Barr 428; McConnell <em>v. </em>Wenrich, 4 Harris 365; Mullison\u2019s Estate, 18 P. F. Smith 212; Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Casey 142; Price on Liens 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-7\">The admission of the docket entry raised a question of law; its admission was proper, and could not injure the defendant. The record shows that all the questions involved in the offer by agreement of the parties had been submitted to the court and decided in the scire facias proceedings on the mortgage: Lewis <em>v. </em>Nenzel, 2 Wr. 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-8\">Sweetzer had the benefit of the money raised by the mortgage in question \u2014 it went to pay his debts. The plaintiff Mrs. Atterbury took her assignment of the mortgage in good faith without notice of any secret arrangement between Jifkins and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Sweetzer, and she is not affected thereby. The offers to prove such secret arrangement were therefore properly rejected.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b38-5\">Mr. Justice Merour</author>\n<p id=\"ADf\">delivered the opinion of the Court, October 2d 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">This action of ejectment is to recover land purchased by the defendants in error, at sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment obtained on a mortgage. The plaintiff in error seeks to attack the validity of the judgment, and thereby defeat the title acquired at the sheriff\u2019s sale. We think all the evidence offered insufficient for that purpose, and therefore rightly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">It is not sufficient that the plaintiff in error was once the owner of the land, and caused the title thereto to be transferred to the Jifkins, whereby under a secret arrangement the latter held 'as mortgagees. They held the land by a title regular on its face, which to the eye of the world gave full power to execute a valid mortgage on the land. In fact it was conve,yed to them for that purpose: Sweetzer\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 264. Relying on a title regular on its face, and without notice of any trust or equity affecting its force and effect, Dodge loaned the money to them and took the mortgage in question. The reference in the offer to the agency of Scranton in the transaction, is too vague and indefinite to affect Dodge with notice of the alleged arrangement between the plaintiff in error and the Jifkins. If, however, it was otherwise as to Dodge, there is no offer to prove that the defendant in error had any notice when she purchased the mortgage and took the assignment thereof. She purchased in good faith and the assignment to her was duly recorded. The assignee of a mortgage takes it discharged of the equities of persons not parties to it, of which he has no notice: Mott <em>v. </em>Clark, 9 Barr 399; Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Casey 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The portion of the offer contained in the second specification that the mortgage was paid in full as between the plaintiff in error and the mortgagors, was properly rejected. No payment between them could satisfy the claim of the mortgagee. The further offer was clearly inadmissible to show that, as between the Jifkins and the defendants in error, \u201cthere have been such transactions and such evidences of collusion as warrants the deduction or inference that it was paid also to them.\u201d The offer gives no information in regard to what facts are proposed to be proved from which the alleged deduction or inference may be drawn. An offer of evidence should aver with reasonable distinctness and certainty the facts sought to be proved; without this, we are not able to say that the rejection of the offer caused any injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">The fourth specification is also in disregard of our rules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>The offer was to prove \u201c by the report of the master,\u201d that the amount of the mortgage ivas paid prior to the scire facias thereon. \u201cThe report of the master\u201d is not set forth. It is not shown, so that we can say whether it would prove the fact alleged. \"Whenever error is alleged to the rejection of records or instruments of writing, a copy thereof should be furnished in order to enable us to determine as to its relevance and sufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">We fail to see that the plaintiff in error was unduly prejudiced by the admission in evidence of the record referred to in the first specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The defendant in error in good faith purchased under proceedings on a judgment regular on its face. She took and holds discharged of all the alleged equities of which she had no notice. She does not need to show the proceedings on the rule taken by the plaintiff in error, to maintain her title. We discover no ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Judgment affirmed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
