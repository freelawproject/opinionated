That all provisions of the Act of Assembly approved the 24th of April, 1857, entitled : <em>\u2018 </em>an act relative to the insurance companies,\u2019 shall apply to life and accident insurance companies.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-9\">Service of the writ was accepted for the defendant, de bene esse, who afterwards took a rule on plaintiff to show cause why the summons and all proceedings thereon should not be set aside for matter of record, which rule was made absolute, no opinion filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-10\">The plaintiff thereupon took this writ of error, assigning for error the decree of the court in making absolute the above rule.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-11\"><em>James B. lieilly, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AotO\">\u2014 To hold that the Act of 1868 does not extend the provisions of the Act of 1857 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to life and accident insurance companies, so as to authorize suit to be brought in the county where the person insured resided, is to render it entirely inoperative; contrary to the well established principle that a statute must be so construed as to give it operation, if the language will permit: Howard Association\u2019s appeal, 20 P. F. Smith 344. As a remedial statute this should be liberally interpreted, and the intention of the makers carried out rather than the letter of the act : Dame, Seymour &amp; Co.\u2019s Appeal; 12 P.

Co., 2 Pearson. 248 in Common Pleas of Dauphin county, and in Anspach <em>v. </em>The Guardian Mutual Aid Society, 10 W. N. C. 568, by the Common Pleas of Lebanon county, that insurance on human life is not <em>\u201c property </em>insured\u201d within the meaning of the Act of 1857, and its supplement of 1868. In a policy of life insurance, all the incidents of \u201c property insured \u201d are wanting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">If the construction contended for by jfiaintiif in <em>error is </em>maintained, a corporation might have a number of different suits to answer at the same time, issuing out of as many jurisdictions, and the attendance of its officers and the production of its boobs, might be necessary in all these places at once.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b400-7\">Mr. Justice Sterrett</author>\n<p id=\"A8Z\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 2d 1882.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In addition to the remedies theretofore provided by law the act of April 24th 1857, Purd. 802, pl. 53, declares it shall be lawful for any one who may have a cause of action against an insurance company, \u201c to bring suit in any county where the property insured may be located, and to direct any process to the sheriff of either of the counties of this Commonwealth,\u201d etc. Prior to the passage of that act, the class of suitors, intended to be benefited thereby, was obliged to seek redress in the courts of the county where the insurance companies might be located. This was generally attended with great inconvenience and expense in procuring testimony and securing the attendance of witnesses at points often very remote from their homes and the locality of the loss. In view of these and other considerations, and for the purpose of providing a suitable remedy, the Act of 1857 was doubtless passed; but, the language employed did not clearly include life and accident insurance companies, both of which were equally within the mischief that required a remedy, and hence the supplement of April 8th 1868, P. L. 70, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>passed, declaring that all the provisions of the former act \u201c shall apply to life and accident insurance companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">While the legislative intention is not as clearly expressed as it might have been, we have no doubt the supplement was intended to authorize suits to be brought against life and accident insurance companies in the county where the person insured resided, where the subject of the risk insured against was domiciled or located. A consideration of the reasons which evidently prompted its enactment also tends to sustain this view of the supplement. If it is not susceptible of that construction it is utterly nugatory and meaningless. Such a conclusion would not harmonize with the principle that every statute should be so construed as to give it operation, if the language will permit. A remedial statute, such as this supplement evidently is, should receive a liberal interpretation in advancement of the remedy contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In view of these considerations, we are of opinion that the learned court erred in making the order complained of-.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Decree reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
