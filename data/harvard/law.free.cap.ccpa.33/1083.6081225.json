Claims 4 and 5 were rejected as being drawn to-nonelected species and, therefore, need not be considered on tlieir merits, as they are allowable only in the event claim 2, which is generic to claims 3, 4, and 5, is held to be patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-23\">The claims are method claims. They read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-24\">2. A method of killing insects which includes the step of exposing the insects to a toxic amount of a mono substituted halogen acetonitrile having a boiling point less than 200\u00b0 G.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>3. A method of hilling insects which includes the step of exposing the insects to a toxic amount of chloroacetonitrile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-3\">4. A method of killing insects which includes the step of exposing the insects to a toxic amount of bromoacetonitrile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">5. A method-of killing insects which includes the step of exposing the insects to a toxic amount of iodoacetonitrile.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">At the time of the examiner\u2019s statement to the Board of Appeals, appellant\u2019s application contained 13 claims, and the references relied upon by the examiner in rejecting all of the 13 claims were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">I. G. IT. (British), 432,188, July 23, 1035.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">Bousquet et al., 2,030,093, February 11, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">French patent, 816,921, May 10, 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">Collie et al., 2,268,108, December 30, 1941.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Technical Bulletin No. 162 \u2014 published in 1929 by U. S. Dept, of Agriculture.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-11\">See pages 30 and 31.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">In appellant\u2019s brief before the Board of Appeals it was stated that \u2022 appellant acquiesced in the rejection of the Primary Examiner as to claims 1, and 6 to 13, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">Claim 1, which was withdrawn before the Board of Appeals, was rejected by the Primary Examiner on the. patent to Collie et al. and the British patent. As that claim is not before us, those patents need not be considered since they were not used as references against the claims here on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">It is not contended here by counsel for appellant that the mono substituted halogen acetonitrile, called for by claim 2, or the chloro-acetonitrile, called for by claim 3, are new compounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">In claim 2, which as hereinbefore noted is generic to the other appealed claims, appellant has substituted a halogen for a hydrogen in acetonitrile.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-16\">Claim 3 is a species claim in which the halogen substituted is chlorine' and the compound produced is chloroacetonitrile.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-17\">\u201cHalogen\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-18\">* * * <em>Chem. </em>An element or radical wliicb forms salts by direct union with metals; \u2014 at present applied to chlorine, bromine, and iodine, and usually fluorine; sometimes also to cyanogen. See CHLORINE FAMILY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">\u201cChlorine family\u201d is defined by the same authority as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-21\"><em>Chem. </em>The elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, called the halogens (salt formers). They are univalent toward hydrogen, metals, and other elements, but chlorine, bromine, and iodine also form higher oxygen compounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-22\">In agreeing with counsel for appellant that the disclosure in the French patent should not be given great weight in the consideration of the appealed claims, the Board of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-23\">Regarding the- French patent, applicant urges that its teaching is that the common property of the class of compounds disclosed is due to the olefinic link<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>age. With this we' agree, and we do not give great weight to the disclosure among his compounds of one which would contain both chlorine and a ON group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">With reference to the Bonsqnet et al. patent, attention was called by the tribunals of the Patent Office to a statement contained therein, reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">The toxicity of these lauryl derivatives also perists if the lauryl chain carries a negative substituent such as 01, SO.JH which does not modify the straight carbon chain character of the lauryl radical.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In other words, the patentees Bousquet et al. disclosed that the substitution of a chlorine did not add to, or. subtract from, the effectiveness of the insecticidal properties of their product, and it is argued by counsel for appellant that because the substitution of chlorine did not increase the toxicity of the patentees\u2019 insecticide, the patent is not a good reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In affirming the examiner\u2019s rejection of the appealed claims on the prior art, the board relied upon the reference Technical Bulletin No. 162, published by the United States Department of Agriculture in 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">It clearly appears from Bulletin No. 162 that acetonitrile (methyl cyanide) is used as a \u201cfumigant\u201d and is effective as an insecticide. It further appears from that publication that a maximum dosage of 392 mg. per liter of acetronitrile killed 90% of weevils upon exposure for tAventy:four hours. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Counsel for appellant contend that, although the toxic effect of acetonitrile (methyl cyanide) had been known since 1929, \u201cit never occurred to anyone to try a halogen substituted acetonitrile,\u201d and argue that, therefore, the appealed claims are, patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">It appears from appellant\u2019s application, and it is not questioned by the Board of Appeals, that using chloroacetonitrile of 5 mg. per liter produced a 100% kill in a period of one hour; that, as stated by counsel for appellant, \u201cThis is ^gth of the dosage of the Bulletin [reference] for y2ith of the time and it resulted in total destruction of the insects\u201d; and that when the dosage was reduced to 3 mg. per liter a 98.3% kill was obtained in one hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Without going into detail, it may be pointed out that the insecticidal properties of appellant\u2019s product are far superior to the insecticidal properties of acetonitrile (methyl cyanide) disclosed in the Bulletin reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">It is not questioned here that chloroacetonitrile, the specific compound called for by claim 3, is, as stated by the board in its decision, \u201cone of the simplest derivatives of methyl cyanide, having the same&gt; structure except that one hydrogen has been replaced by chlorine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Owing to the fact that the record discloses that acetonitrile (methyl cyanide) is a well-known insecticide, and as it appears from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>Bousquet et al. patent that the substitution of a chlorine did not subtract from the effectiveness of the patentees\u2019 lauryl cyanide, it would seem to be obvious that when appellant used chloroacetonitrile, in which a chlorine is substituted for a hydrogen in acetonitrile (methyl cyanide), it was to be expected that it would possess insecticidal properties when used in a toxic amount. Under the circumstances, appellant\u2019s discovery that chloroacetonitrile was useful as an insecticide, or that it possessed insecticidal properties to a greater degree than acetonitrile, does not, in our opinion, involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">It certainly could not properly be contended that had appellant discovered that chloroacetonitrile possessed to the same degree the insecticidal properties of acetonitrile, his discovery involved invention. Having every reason to suppose that his composition would be valuable as an insecticide when used in a toxic amount, appellant is not entitled to a patent for a method of killing insects by the use of such a composition based solely on the degree of effectiveness which he found the composition possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">For the reasons stated, we are of opinion that appealed claims 2 and 3 were properly rejected on'fhe prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As hereinbefore noted, claims 2 and 3 were also rejected on the ground that they are broader than the disclosure in appellant\u2019s application. .</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Appellant states in his application that his alleged invention relates to \u201cfumigants,\u201d and there is nothing stated therein to indicate that at the time of the filing of his application he was aware of the fact, if it'be a fact, that the insecticidal properties of mono substituted halogen acetonitrile, called for by claim 2, and chloroacetonitrile, called for by claim 3, could be used otherwise than as \u201cfumigants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">It will be observed that the claims are not limited to so-called \u201cfumigants,\u201d but are sufficiently broad to read upon other forms of insecticides, such as solids arid liquids.-</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">In his statement to the Board of Appeals, the Primary Examiner stated that claims 2 and 3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">are further rejected as too broad and indefinite in failing to restrict the claims to fumigation. The disclosure is restricted to fumigation oflly. Fumigation necessitates the use of compounds in gaseous form. * * * and there is nothing in the case to indicate that the compounds disclosed would kill insects when applied in solid or liquid form. Accordingly, the present claims are not confined to the subject matter disclosed, and fail to set forth the alleged \u00bfinvention with the particularity required by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">With reference to that ground of rejection, the Board of Appeals .said: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>\u25a0and entered a general affirmance of the examiner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The rejection of claims 2 and 3 as too broad and indefinite in failing to restrict them to fumigation was not traversed in the brief, so is assumed to have been proper * * *,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>Counsel for appellant state in their brief that they had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">inadvertently omitted to set out in writing any argument with regard to the form rejection as to Claims 2 and 3, that is, because the Examiner thought they should be limited to a method of fumigation rather than a method of killing insects. This matter was argued orally before the Board and it may well be that inasmuch as the decision was written almost four months after the hearing that they did not recall the argument. It may well be that this Court will decide, as is their right, to stand on the printed Record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">(It may be said at this point that the court accepts without question the statement of counsel for appellant that the Primary Examiner\u2019s holding that the claims are broader than appellant\u2019s disclosure was argued orally before the Board of Appeals.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">With reference to that issue, counsel further state :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">The fact is that no good reason has been advanced by anyone for so limiting the \u25a0claims. While toxic materials which have a boiling point below 200\u00b0 C. are particularly useful as fumigants due to their- comparative ease of vaporization, yet this fact alone does not exclude the .ability of those materials to kill by other methods, that is, as a contact poison. The art of record being absolutely silent as to the use of the killing agents by any method, no reason is seen why the Applicant is not entitled to claim the killing of insects with them no .patter what the specific- method. This requirement is thought to be unreasonable and .unjustified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">It may be, as argued by counsel for appellant, that appellant\u2019s compounds \u201care particularly useful as fumigants dije to their comparative ease of vaporization,\u201d and that that fact does not \u201cexclude the ability of those materials to kill by other methods, that is, as a contact poison.\u201d However,-appellant\u2019s application is limited, as stated by the Primary Examiner and as hereinbefore noted, to so-called \u201cfumigants,\u201d and there is nothing in the application to indicate that appellant\u2019s composition would kill insects when applied in either solid or liquid form. \u2022On the contrary, appellant states in his application that Tiis alleged <em>\u201cinvention in its broadest aspect </em>is concerned with the discovery that ^,11 members of the generic class of mono substituted acetonitriles \"which have a boiling point below 200\u00b0 C. <em>are useful as fumigants.'1'1 </em>[Italics not quoted.] Furthermore, as stated in the brief of the Solicitor for the Patent Office, \u201cthe function of a claim is not to cover everything as to which the prior art is silent, but to point out what the applicant has invented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">It is well settled that claims in an application which are broader than the applicant\u2019s disclosure are not allowable. See <em>In re Bryson D. </em>Horton, 19 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 871, 875, 54 F. (2d) 961, 12 U. S. Pat. Q. 221; <em>In re Thompson, </em>30 C. C. P. A. (Patents) 1058, 1062, 135 F. (2d) 930, 57 USPQ 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">We are of opinion that appealed claims 2 and 3 are broader than the disclosure in appellant\u2019s application and that they were properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>rejected for that reason. Accordingly, tbe decision of tbe Board of Appeals, affirming tbe decision of the Primary Examiner rejecting claims 2 and 3 on tbe prior art and on tbe ground that they are broader than tbe disclosure in appellant\u2019s application, is <em>affirmed,.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
