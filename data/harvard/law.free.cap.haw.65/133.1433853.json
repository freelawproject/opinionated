Appellees contend that the reclassification was not an \u201caction\u201d and that hence, no environmental assessment was required. The word \u201caction\u201d is defined in \u00a7 343-2(2) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cAction\u201d means any program or project to be initiated by any agency or applicant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Section 343-1, HRS, (which was a new section added by Act 197, Session Laws of 1979) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">The legislature finds that the quality of humanity\u2019s environment is critical to humanity\u2019s well being, that humanity\u2019s activities have broad and profound effects upon the interrelations of all components of the environment, and that an environmental review process will integrate the review of environmental concerns with existing planning processes of the State and counties and alert decision makers to significant environmental.effects which may result from the implementation of certain actions.

C. him, </em>Deputy Corporation Counsel, for appellee, Department of General Planning.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In adopting Act 197, the legislature expressed its concern with the preservation of the environment and indicated a desire that there be an environmental assessment with respect to any proposed use of conservation land. However, given the wording of \u00a7 343-5(a)(2), there could never be an environmental assessment because of such use after the land had been reclassified to urban since it would then no longer be classified as conservation. If, therefore, we accept the appellees\u2019 position, \u00a7 343-5(a)(2) would apply only where an application for a permit for such use is made to the Department of Land and Natural Resources (hereinafter \u201cDLNR\u201d) pursuant to what is now \u00a7 13-2-19 of that department\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">This would mean that someone desiring to make use of conservation lands would be subject to the issuance of an environmental assessment when applying for a permit from the DLNR under that department\u2019s highly restrictive regulations, but could, and would, avoid such a requirement entirely by simply applying to the LUC for a reclassification. In view of the wording of the statute, the legislative findings and the State\u2019s environmental policy (Chapter 344, HRS), we d\u00f3 not believe the legislature intended or the statute requires any such result. Certainly, had that been the intent of the statute, appropriate language to accomplish such a result could easily have been drafted. We hold that when an application is made for the reclassification of conservation lands to other uses, an environmental assessment is necessary before the LUC can reclassify the lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Accordingly, the judgment below is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>CONCURRING OPINION OF</p>\n<author id=\"ANg\">NAKAMURA, J\u201e</author>\n<judges id=\"AH7\">WITH WHOM RICHARDSON, C.J., JOINS</judges>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">I concur in the result reached by the court, for the judgment below is clearly subject to reversal. But I do not read HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2) (1976) (renumbered \u00a7 343-5(a)(2) in 1979) as being applicable to a petition for a district boundary amendment submitted to the Land Use Commission. The pertinent legislative mandates, in my opinion, are contained in HRS Chapter 205, whose demands with respect to a public agency\u2019s examination of the environmental effects of a proposed action are greater than those in HRS \u00a7 343-4. Moreover, the record does not demonstrate any neglect on the Commission\u2019s part to address environmental concerns. Its actual vice in effecting the reclassification, in my view, was a failure to heed the statutory command that \u201c[ijnsofar as practicable conservation lands shall not be reclassified as urban lands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The subject land consists of 8.4 acres of vacant land situated at the crest of a ridge overlooking the Pearlridge Estates Subdivision in Central Oahu which were within the conservation district for purposes of the Land Use Law, HRS Chapter 205. The foregoing designation, however, did not correspond with the zoning of the land under County zoning ordinances. By action of the City Council early in 1977, the use designated for the subject land on the Oahu Interim Zoning Control Map had been changed from agricultural to residential and the use indicated on the Oahu General Plan Detailed Land Use Map had been amended from preservation to residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">Appellees Lear Siegler, Inc. and Lear Siegler Properties, Inc. (Lear Siegler or petitioner) filed a Petition For Boundary Amendment From Conservation To Urban with the Land Use Commission on September 25, 1978. The request for change originally encompassed 10.2 acres of land, but the petitioner subsequently discovered 1.8 acres thereof were already within the urban district and amended the petition to reflect this fact. After due notice to interested persons, the Commission conducted a hearing in accord with the procedure prescribed by HRS Chapter 205. The appellants were among those who were permitted to intervene and participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>in the proceedings. The hearing which commenced on February 6, 1979 extended over a two-day period, and witnesses representing the petitioner, the Department of General Planning of the City and County of Honolulu, the Department of Planning and Economic Development of the State of Hawaii, and intervening parties presented testimony and documentary evidence in support of or in opposition to the petition. The intervenors included the Pearlridge Estates Community Association, Life of the Land, and a number of individuals. The organizations and individuals who participated in the hearing voiced numerous objections thereto, citing among other concerns the possibly deleterious effects of the proposed reclassification upon the environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The Decision and Order reclassifying the subject land as urban land was issued on August 30, 1979. The twenty-nine page document contained detailed findings of fact covering the gamut of subjects discussed by the parties in the course of the. hearing. An appeal to the circuit court by some of the intervenors followed, and the Commission\u2019s decision was essentially affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The questions posed for determination, in my estimation, are whether an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement as prescribed by HRS Chapter 343 was a prerequisite for the approval of the boundary amendment petition and whether the preconditions delineated in HRS Chapter 205 for the grant of a boundary change were satisfied. The issues compel the interpretation and reconciliation of two discrete statutes with related goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">The earlier enactment, HRS Chapter 205, was passed in 1961 \u201cin order to preserve, protect and encourage the development of the lands in the State for those uses to which they are best suited for the public welfare.\u201d S.L.H. 1961, c. 187, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The implementation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>this three-pronged legislative policy called for a classification of all the lands in the State into three land-use districts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a restriction of uses therein to those consistent with the classifications. The administration of the law was delegated to an independent commission, the Land Use Commission, and its primary function was to \u201cclassify and district\u201d the lands. S.L.H. 1961, c. 187, \u00a7 2. But these initial determinations were not intended to be immutable as the statute contained provisions for subsequent boundary amendments, as well as periodic comprehensive reviews of \u201cthe classification and districting of all lands.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The statutory provisions governing district boundary amendments were reviewed by this court in <em>Town v. Land Use Commission, </em>55 Haw. 538, 524 P.2d 84 (1974). We concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that when the Commission considered a petition for boundary change that had been challenged by interested parties, it was involved in a \u201ccontested case\u201d rather than in \u201crule making\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 546-48, 524 P.2d at 89-91. In essence, we ruled it was then engaged in a quasi-judicial function. Consequently, detailed procedural requisites were written into HRS Chapter 205 in the following legislative session. <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1975, c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>193. The Commission was also \u201cconstituted as a quasi-judicial body and mandated to make impartial decisions based on proven facts and established policies.\u201d S.L.H. 1975, c. 193, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, no district boundary amendment may now be approved</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">unless the commission finds upon the clear preponderance of the evidence that the proposed boundary is reasonable, not violative of section 205-2 and consistent with the interim policies and criteria established pursuant to section 205-16.1, or any state plan enacted by the legislature which plan shall supersede any, interim guidance policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">HRS \u00a7 205-4(h). And the interim policies which were effective at all relevant times provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that such amendments were subject to approval \u201conly as reasonably necessary to accommodate growth and development, provided there are no significant adverse effects upon agricultural, natural, environmental, recreational, scenic, historic, or other resources of the area.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205-16.1 (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> With respect to conservation lands, the specific interdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>was that \u201c[ijnsofar as practicable conservation lands shall not be reclassified as urban lands.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The subsequent enactment, the Hawaii Environmental Protection Act (HEPA), HRS Chapter 343, was passed in 1974 \u201cto establish a system of environmental review at the State and County levels which will ensure that environmental concerns are given appropriate consideration in decision-making along with economic and technical considerations.\u201d Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 27-74, in 1974 Senate Journal, at 775-76; Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 27, in 1974 House Journal, at 863-64. In reviewing HRS \u00a7 343-5 recently, we observed that HEPA\u2019s genesis was discernible in the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). <em>Molokai Homesteaders Cooperative Association v. Cobb, </em>63 Haw. 453, 464, 629 P.2d 1134, 1142 (1981). We further noted HEPA \u201cis wider in scope than the federal or the typical state analogue, for the state law covers private actions in certain defined situations and <em>areas.\u201d Id. </em>at 465, 629 P.2d at 1143. Yet, \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>prescribed role of the EIS [environmental impact statement] in the state environmental protection scheme is informational.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>HRS \u00a7 343-2(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">While HEPA was being considered by the legislature, the House Committee on Judiciary and Corrections offered a draft of the relevant measure that contained specific provisions making an EIS a prerequisite for any action proposing \u201cthe use of any land for which a change in land use district or classification, chafige in zoning or change in the county general plan is required.\u201d <em>See </em>H. B. No. 2067-74, H. D. I;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 556-74, in 1974 House Journal, at 768. Although the House initially accepted this draft, the Senate did not. The Senate draft of the pertinent measure deleted the foregoing provisions and substituted language closely resembling that of HRS \u00a7 343-4. <em>See </em>H. B. No. 2067-74, H. D. 1, S. D. 1; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 956-74, in 1974 Senate Journal, at 1126-27. And the final draft of the bill which was adopted by the legislature contained no reference to actions proposing \u201cthe use of any land for which a change in land use district or classification... is required.\u201d <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1974, c. 246, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The nature and character of the environmental assessment and the impact statement prescribed by HRS Chapter 343 and the foregoing legislative history, in my opinion, do not support a holding that HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2) is applicable to a petition for a boundary amendment. Furthermore, no reasonable basis appears for the Iegis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>lature to compel an adherence thereto when proposals to reclassify conservation lands are presented but not when requests to reclassify other lands are.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">The nature and character of the environmental assessment and impact statement prescribed by HEPA suggest the Land Use Commission was not obligated to engage in an assessment pursuant to HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2) prior to rendering a decision here \u2014 it would have served no constructive purpose in light of the actual constraints imposed on the Commission by HRS \u00a7 205-16.1. The environmental assessment demanded by the former informs a government agency that a proposed action \u201cmay have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d HRS \u00a7 343-4(b). If the agency so determines, it would then be compelled to secure an environmental impact statement. <em>Id. </em>But its acceptance merely signifies that the document \u201cfulfills the definition of an environmental impact statement, adequately describes identifiable environmental impacts, and satisfactorily responds to comments received during the review of the statement.\u201d HRS \u00a7 343-1(1) (1976) (renumbered \u00a7 343-2(1) in 1979). Hence, HRS \u00a7 343-4 simply ensures agency consideration of environmental concerns before a decision is rendered. <em>Molokai Homesteaders Cooperative Association v. Cobb, supra, </em>63 Haw. at 465, 629 P.2d at 1143; <em>Cf. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 558 (1978) (NEPA\u2019s \u201cmandate to the agencies is essentially procedural\u201d). <em>See also Strycker\u2019s Bay Neighborhood Council, Inc. v. Karlen, </em>444 U.S. 223, 227 (1980); <em>Kleppe v. Sierra Club, </em>427 U.S. 390, 410 n.21 (1976). But when the boundary amendment in question was under consideration, the Commission was subject to a mandate that a reclassification could be approved only if a clear preponderance of the evidence adduced at a contested hearing indicated it was \u201creasonably necessary to accommodate growth and development\u201d and would cause \u201cno significant adverse effects upon agricultural, natural, environmental, recreational, scenic, historic, or other resources of the area.\u201d HRS \u00a7 205-16.1.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An obligation to engage in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>environmental assessment pales in comparison with these stringent preconditions for the approval of a boundary amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">HEPA\u2019s legislative history likewise conveys a definite suggestion that \u201ca change in land use district or classification\u201d does not trigger the requirement of an environmental assessment pursuant to HRS \u00a7 343-4. As noted, language that would have made such an assessment a requisite for a boundary change was incorporated in a preliminary draft of the relevant measure but dropped from subsequent drafts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This deletion, I would conclude, manifests a design not to include a boundary amendment within the class of \u201cactions\u201d subject to HRS \u00a7 343-4. The requirement of environmental assessments for actions proposing \u201cany use within any land classified as conservation district\u201d in HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2) was in all likelihood meant to cover proposals for the use of conservation lands addressed to the agency empowered to regulate such use, the Board of Land and Natural Resources. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 183-41. Thus, neither the language nor the history \u00f3f HRS \u00a7 343-4 furnishes reasonable grounds for construing it to apply to conservation district boundary amendments, particularly when boundary proposals implicating agricultural and rural lands obviously are not subject to its directives. For the pertinent restraints on the Commission are found elsewhere in the prevailing statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"A3j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Although the Commission disregarded the provisions of HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2), it nonetheless weighed the possible environmental consequences of the reclassification as decreed by HRS \u00a7 205-16.1. The record substantiates an adherence to all of the interim policy guidelines delineated in the latter, save one. Ironically, the policy tailored for special application to petitions for reclassification of conservation land was the one ignored. Interim Policy No. 7 proclaimed that \u201c[ijnsofar as practicable conservation lands shall not be reclassified as urban lands.\u201d But the Commission failed to appreciate the thrust of the guideline, for its conclusion in this regard was that \u201c[i]t is practicable to reclassify the subject property to an urban district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Reading the particular guideline within the context of the Land Use Law and its goals,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I would conclude the purpose of the policy was to retain conservation land as such unless a clear need for more urban land that could not be met otherwise was demonstrated or unless \u201cinjustice or inequity\u201d would result from a denial of the request for amendment. Neither prerequisite for the reclassification from conservation to urban was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The petitioner acknowledged that its own survey in 1978 indicated there were 706.5 acres of undeveloped lands designated for multi-unit residential use in Central and Leeward Oahu.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And when the attorney for an intervenor questioned a witness on whether \u201cit is practicable not to have the subject property reclassified,\u201d the Commission\u2019s chairman displayed an insensitivity to the significance of the policy and nearly deflected meaningful inquiry thereon. The witness, who appeared on behalf of the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>General Planning of the City and County of Honolulu, nevertheless acknowledged the practicability of retaining the land in the conservation district. The relevant portion of the transcript of the hearing before the Commission is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Therefore, I would conclude the Commission failed to follow a pertinent command of HRS \u00a7 205-16.1 rather than HRS \u00a7 343-4(a)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> S.L.H. 1961, c. 187, \u00a7 1 read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\"><em>Findings and declaration of purpose. </em>Inadequate controls have caused many of Hawaii\u2019s limited and valuable lands to be used for purposes that may have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>short-term gain to a few but result in a long-term loss to the income and growth potential of our economy. Inadequate basis for assessing lands according to their value in those uses that can best serve both the well-being of the owner and the well-being of the public have resulted in inequities in the tax burden, contributing to the forcing of land <em>resources </em>into uses that do not best serve the welfare of the State.

D. 1, as it emerged from the committee read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">Sec. _-3 <em>Requirements, </em>(a) Except as otherwise provided, an environmental impact statement shall be required, and its approval shall be a condition precedent, for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-11\">(2) Any action proposing the use of any land in the area between the shoreline and three hundred feet inland from the shoreline, the use of any land in a conservation district, the use of any land for the construction of resort and hotel facilities, or the use of any land for which a change in land use district or classification, change in zoning or change in the county general plan is required.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\"> Although the interim policies articulated in HRS \u00a7 205-16.1 are no longer effective because a state plan has been adopted, HRS \u00a7 205-16 provides that \u201cno amendment to any land use district boundary nor any other action by the land use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>commission shall be adopted unless such amendment or other action conforms to the state plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">A review of the Hawaii State Planning Act, HRS Chapter 226, indicates the interim policies have been restated in the state plan, though not necessarily in similar form. For example, HRS \u00a7 226-105 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\"><em>Hawaii\u2019s land resources. </em>Priority actions for the use of Hawaii\u2019s resources:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">(1) Preserve and improve shoreline open spaces and scenic resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">(2) Seek to utilize Hawaii\u2019s limited land resources wisely in order to insure the protection of the environment and the availability of the shoreline, conservation lands and other limited resources for future generations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">(3) Seek to accommodate urban growth in existing urban areas while maintaining agricultural lands in agricultural designation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra, </em>for provisions in H. B. No. 2067-74, H.

Thus, conservation lands must be preserved if practicable, agricultural lands should be protected, and urban lands should be developed in an orderly fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> Petitioner sought to have the classification changed in order to develop planned development housing (PDH) units. Its survey showed there were 706.5 acres of vacant land in Central and Leeward Oahu designated for multi-unit housing purposes, <em>i.e., </em>either as PDH or A (apartment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b161-5\"> The transcript reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">Q.

Just ask him the question. Does he think its [sic] a good idea or a bad idea. I don\u2019t want this practicable and not practicable and all that business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">MR. NAKAGAWA: Well the thing is that the regulation is worded in terms of a negative, and the wording is that it shall not be reclassified from conservation to urban.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">THE CHAIRMAN: Well ask him if he thinks it should or should not, and no double negatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">MR. NAKAGAWA: Well let me think of a way to ask him that question. Q. In your opinion is it practicable to have the subject property remain in conservation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">A. Yes, its [sic] practicable to have it remain in conservation; its [sic] also practicable, as we find, to reclassify the 5.4 acres to urban. Now bear in mind that we\u2019re not recommending reclassification of the other 3 acres we\u2019ve just been discussing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Tr.
