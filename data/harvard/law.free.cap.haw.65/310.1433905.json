We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">Appellant filed an application for approval of rate increase, revised rate schedule and for an interim rate increase. The consumer advocate recommended a lesser increase. After a hearing, the PUC issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law and fixed the rates well below appellant\u2019s request. Appellant then moved for reconsideration on 14 grounds. Many of those grounds were general in nature without specifics, as the Commission noted. The Commission, after considering the motion, denied the same and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">Our Rule 3(b)(5) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-16\">[T]he appellant shall file an opening brief, containing.. .:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-17\">(5) A concise statement of the points on which appellant intends to rely, set forth in separate, numbered paragraphs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>.. . When the point involves findings or conclusions of the court below, those urged as error shall be quoted and there shall be included a statement of the particulars wherein the findings of fact or conclusions of law are alleged to be erroneous. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Appellant has completely failed to follow the provision just quoted. As a consequence, appellant\u2019s opening brief is virtually incomprehensible. As stated in the Answering Brief of the appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arl\">Appellant\u2019s arguments are nothing more than vague conclusory statements which do not specify (1) how the Public Utilities Commission ... committed error, (2) why it was error for the Commission to rule in a particular manner, nor (3) how Appellant was prejudiced by the alleged error. Indeed, throughout Appellant\u2019s brief, it is difficult to discern exactly what it is that Appellant is contesting. (Answering.Brief at p.3.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Appellant\u2019s failure to abide by the rule quoted merits dismissal of the appeal. We have, however, reviewed the record and find no basis for reversing or modifying the Commission\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">An appeal to this court from a rate order of the PUC is authorized by \u00a7 269-16(f), HRS. On such an appeal, the standard of review is set forth in \u00a7 91-14(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Upon review of the record the court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case with instructions for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision and order if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because of the administrative findings, conclusions, decisions, or orders are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">(2) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">(4) Affected by other error of law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, . and substantial evidence on the whole record; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">(6) Arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-15\">We do not find that the orders appealed from were made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>violation of any constitutional or statutory provisions or were in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission or were made upon unlawful procedure or were affected by any other error of law or were clearly erroneous or were arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Av6\"><em>Roy M.
