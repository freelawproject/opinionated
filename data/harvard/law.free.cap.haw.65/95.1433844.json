Upon consideration of the issues raised which merit discussion, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">We shall first consider whether the trial judge\u2019s remarks near the dose of the prosecutor\u2019s case and his permitting the victim to testify a second time denied appellant a fair trial. These claims of error stemmed from the proceedings that followed immediately after the victim had been examined by all parties and excused from the stand. The. prosecutor, desirous of assisting the jury in identifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>scene of the alleged crimes through photographs already receiv\u00e9d into evidence, had planned to recall her to testify as to the proximity of the different views depicted in the pictures to each other. It appeared to appellant\u2019s counsel through the prosecutor\u2019s own statement that this testimony would conclude the government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A discussion over the necessity of linking the scenes was held out of the jury\u2019s hearing, and concluded with the following interchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">THE COURT: What is your pleasure, Mr. Prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">MR. KANESHIRO: Well, in that case, Your Honor, the State would have to call the witness because this area located in State\u2019s Exhibit 6 is also depicted by State\u2019s Exhibit 5. And we have to show the link just to aid the jury in understanding the general scene of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">THE COURT: All right. You want a recess?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">MR. KANESHIRO: Okay, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">THE COURT: <em>In case the Prosecution is about to rest its case, my only caution to both sides is, review very thoroughly what you have proven so far. </em>All right, let\u2019s take a recess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Before the jury was excused for the break, however, counsel for Margiotta stipulated to the connection between the scenes shown in the photographs. The prosecutor nonetheless indicated that the State had not concluded its case, and the court recessed. When the parties returned, but again in the absence of the jury, the prosecutor requested that he be permitted to return the victim to the stand \u201cbecause the State, after reviewing the notes, feel [sic] that it missed one element that [it] would like to bring forth through the witness. There\u2019s an indication by the witness that she recalls testimony that she did not give on direct examination that she would like to give.\u201d He disclosed that the victim, during recess, had mentioned to a crisis center worker that she had failed to testify that she did not resist the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>defendants because she was attempting to hide her friend\u2019s knife from them, and that she had also failed to mention certain remarks that the defendants had made to her during the episode. The judge recalled the victim for the limited purpose of testifying to these matters, but only after both she and the crisis center employee had been examined by all parties in the jury\u2019s absence to determine the substance of the conversation between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Appellant asserts that the court improperly tipped the prosecutor, who was about to rest his case, that he had not met his burden of proof, for it was only after the judge\u2019s cautionary remark that the prosecutor recalled the victim to testify on matters which substantially prejudiced the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">It is of course a well-established and elementary principle of our system of justice that a judge presiding over a trial has the obligation to maintain impartiality and fairness in the proceedings before him. <em>Glosser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 82 (1942); <em>State v. Pokini, </em>55 Haw. 640, 645, 526 P.2d 94, 101 (1974). And thus while judges are entrusted with wide latitude in the making of comments during the course of a trial, <em>Taylor v. Carborundum Co., </em>107 Ill. App.2d 12, 28, 246 N.E.2d 898, 906 (1969), any remarks must be calculated with extreme care so as not to reflect, <em>inter alia, </em>judicial bias toward either party or opinion as to the weight of the evidence or the merits of the case. <em>Kanoy v. Hinshaw, </em>273 N.C. 418, 426, 160 S.E.2d 296, 302 (1968). But before this appellate court may find that a judge, through his statements, destroyed a defendant\u2019s opportunity for a fair trial, the defendant must demonstrate that those comments prejudiced the jury against him, <em>Taylor v. Carborundum Co., supra; State v. Griffin, </em>4 Wash. App. 947, 484 P.2d 448 (1971), or otherwise unduly and adversely affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Babcock v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway Co., </em>83 Ill. App.2d 919, 923, 404 N.E.2d 265, 270 (1979); <em>Commonwealth v. Ryder, </em>467 Pa. 484, 487, 359 A.2d 379, 381 (1976). For the defendant\u2019s guarantee of a fair trial does not shield him from all erroneous, unwise or irrelevant remarks made during the course of the proceedings, but only from those which may reasonably be said to have prejudiced him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The assertion that the judge\u2019s warning unduly and unfairly prejudiced the outcome of the trial has not been established by appellant and remains a matter of purest speculation. Even assuming that the remark, neutrally phrased, constituted a hint to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>prosecutor that he had not proven his case, there exists no indication whatsoever that the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent actions would have been any different had it not been uttered. That the new information was volunteered by the victim and not elicited by the prosecutor strongly suggests otherwise. More importantly, however, the judge\u2019s statement was made in a bench conference out of the jury\u2019s hearing, and thus could not have affected the minds of the jurors at all. We cannot conclude from these circumstances that the judge\u2019s word of caution denied appellant a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Appellant\u2019s second argument that the judge abused his discretion by erroneously allowing the victim to retestify without limiting the scope of her examination is wholly unsupported by the record and the law. The latitude permitted counsel in offering testimony and the order of that testimony rests completely within the discretion of the trial court, and an abuse of that discretion must be established before reversal of a conviction based on the testimony or a new trial may be warranted. <em>Territory v. Alcosiba, </em>36 Haw. 231, 236 <em>(1942); Territory v. Kimbrel, </em>31 Haw. 81, <em>89 (1929); Mist v. Kewalo, </em>13 Haw. 302, 303 (1901); <em>see </em>Haw. R. Evid. 611 &amp; Commentary; <em>cf. Filipino Federation of America, Inc. v. Cubico, </em>46 Haw. 353, 372, 380 P.2d 488, 499 (1963); <em>Territory v. Kimbrel, supra </em>(reopening case for further evidence before submission to jury is within trial judge\u2019s discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The prosecutor herein had not rested his case when the victim retook the stand to testify. Before the court allowed her to do so, both she and the crisis center worker were examined in the jury\u2019s absence for the purpose of determining the manner in which the new testimony had been discovered and the substance of that testimony. The judge thereafter limited the scope of the direct examination to matters which had not been covered during the victim\u2019s previous appearance on the stand. The defendants were given full opportunity to cross-examine her. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution\u2019s evidentiary presentation, arguing that the government had failed to establish the element of forcible compulsion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewing the testimony in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the court concluded that there existed sufficient evidence from which a jury could convict the co-defendants of the crimes charged, and accordingly denied the motion. Appellant now contends that the court\u2019s action constituted prejudicial error, warranting reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In reviewing a motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial court\u2019s duty rests in determining whether, \u201cupon the evidence viewed in a light most favorable to the government, and giving full play to the right of the jury to determine credibility, weigh the evidence, and draw therefrom justifiable inferences of fact, a reasonable mind might fairly conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Brighter, </em>62 Haw. 25, 31, 608 P.2d 855, 859 (1980); <em>State v. Murphy, </em>59 Haw. 1, 19, 575 P.2d 448, 460 (1978); <em>State v. Yabusaki, </em>58 Haw. 404, 411, 570 P.2d 844, 848 (1977). Of course the judge in this case must have been able to conclude that a jury could find forcible compulsion beyond a reasonable doubt, for \u201c[i]t is well established, as a precept of constitutional as well as statutory law, that an accused in a criminal case can only be convicted upon proof by the prosecution of every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Lima, </em>64 Haw__, _, 643 P.2d 536, 539 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\u201cForcible compulsion,\u201d that element common to both rape and sodomy which characterizes the manner in which the criminal act is committed, is defined in HRS \u00a7 707-700(12) (1976) as \u201cphysical force that overcomes earnest resistance; or a threat, express or implied, that places a person in fear of immediate death or serious physical injury to himself or another person, or in fear that he or another person will immediately be kidnapped.\u201d HRS \u00a7 707-700(3) (1976) defines \u201cserious physical injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Appellant maintains that neither earnest resistance nor fear from threats was established by the victim\u2019s testimony. He claims that her sole response to any putative exertion of force by him was the exclamation \u201cplease don\u2019t.\u201d According to him, the record fails to demonstrate that the victim attempted to flee, cry out, or otherwise interfere with appellant\u2019s actions. With respect to any express or implied threats, appellant notes that the victim testified merely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>being \u201cscared\u201d and at most to an apprehension of \u201cbeing hurt,\u201d neither of which indicates a fear of \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d By her own admission, the victim confirmed that she did not offer physical resistance when appellant first sat on her legs, pinned down her arms, pulled off her jeans and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her. But she asserted as the reason for her apparent submission that she was fearful of being injured by the co-defendants, which fear was heightened by her awareness that her companion\u2019s knife was lodged in the sand near her legs and coujd have been used against her by either assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">As this court recendy recognized in <em>State v. Jones, </em>62 Haw. 572, 617 P.2d 1214 (1980), \u201cwhere submission without earnest resistance is alleged to have been induced by fear, such apprehension must have been of death or serious physical injury and must have been reasonable as judged by the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 617 P.2d at 1217. Like earnest resistance, then, this fear of death or serious injury is an inherently relative concept, <em>Dumer v. State, </em>64 Wis.2d 590, 609-10, 219 N.W.2d 592, 603 (1974), and the aggressor\u2019s intimidations of a victim need not have been made in any particular manner to enable a jury to believe that the victim\u2019s will to resist had been overcome by fear. The definitional penal statute itself, by accounting for the reality that an \u201cimplicit\u201d threat may instill the same apprehension of danger in a victim as an \u201cexpress\u201d threat, anticipated that a determination of the reasonableness of the victim\u2019s fear would be subjective and based upon the totality of circumstances surrounding the assault. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 707-700(12) (1976). And where the defendant\u2019s threats standing alone would not suffice to support a rape or sodomy conviction, the facts may be such that the \u201ccombined effect of the defendant\u2019s threats and the force he applied may ....\u201d <em>State v. Jones, supra </em>at 575, 617 P.2d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Applying these rules to the facts as viewed most favorably to the government, we are compelled to agree with the trial court that a reasonable mind could have found forcible compulsion to have been shown beyond a reasonable doubt. The incident occurred in the darkness of the early morning hours on a secluded portion of Diamond Head beach. The victim was ultimately confronted alone by two men, both of whom had been drinking heavily before reaching the park. She witnessed her companion being assaulted, shoved to the ground, and chased off the beach by defendant Margiotta, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>and found herself alone with appellant. Her friend never returned to the beach. When appellant climbed onto her legs and pinned down her arms, the victim begged \u201cplease don\u2019t\u201d and asked to be released. Appellant refused, threatening to hurt her if she didn\u2019t shut up. Following intercourse, appellant again ordered the victim to shut up. When defendant Margiotta reappeared, he told her that her companion \u201cwas a no good haole,\u201d that she \u201cought to have someone like him,\u201d and that \u201che could beat up anybody.\u201d The co-defendants engaged in sexual intercourse and fellatio simultaneously, switching places on top of her several times before the police arrived. When the officers reached the scene, they found the victim very upset and crying heavily. During the entire incident, the victim was afraid of being injured by the two men, and was also fearful of the possibility that they might discover her friend\u2019s knife nearby and use it against her.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The knife\u2019s blade was approximately four to five inches long, and the victim, conscious that the handle was protruding from the sand, attempted during the entire episode to conceal it with her legs.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aaz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>William H. Brady (Brady Brady </em>of counsel) on the briefs for defendant-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b119-8\"><em>Wevley H. Shea, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Although the record is not replete with attestations of fear of specific injury, we believe that appellant\u2019s explicit threat of harm, together with Margiotta\u2019s show of brute force against the victim\u2019s companion and boast of strength manifesting a power to carry out the threat, when viewed in the context of the circumstances, enabled a jury to find that the victim\u2019s fear of serious injury was a reasonable one. <em>See State v. Jones, supra </em>at 577, 617 P.2d at 1218. Giving due regard to the jury\u2019s function of assessing the credibility of the witnesses and of weighing the evidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court was in error in believing that a jury could find forcible compulsion to have been shown beyond a reasonable doubt, which it eventually did.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Finding appellant\u2019s remaining contention to lack merit, we sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-11\"> The portion of HRS I 707-730 under which the co-defendants were convicted provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\"><em>Rape in the first degree. </em>(1) A male commits the offense of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">(a) He intentionally engages in sexual intercourse, by forcible compulsion, with a female and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">(i) The female is not, upon the occasion, his voluntary social companion who had within the previous twelve months permitted him sexual intercourse; ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-15\"> HRS \u00a7 707-733(l)(a)(i) (1976) recites as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-16\"><em>Sodomy in the first degree. </em>(1) A person commits the offense of sodomy in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-17\">(a) He intentionally, by forcible compulsion, engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person or causes another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse, and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-18\">(i) The other person was not, upon the occasion, his voluntary social companion who had within the previous twelve months permitted him sexual contact of the kind involved; ....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\"> Just after the victim was excused from the stand, the prosecutor uttered the following: \u201cYour Honor, before calling our last witness, the State would make a motion to move into evidence what has been marked as State\u2019s Exhibits 6,7,8,9, and 10 for Identification.\u201d This last witness was to have been the police officer who had taken the photographs, but because of his unavailability, the prosecutor proposed recalling .the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em> </em>The victim testified as follows on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">Q.
