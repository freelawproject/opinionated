Pilago was convicted under a multiple-count indictment for offenses under the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), namely, (Count I) possession of a prohibited firearm, section 134-8, (Count III) receiving, retaining or disposing of stolen property (firearm), section 708-831(l)(c) and (Count V), possession of firearm by a person convicted of certain crimes, section 134-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-20\">The most critical issue in this case is whether the trial court erred in failing to suppress certain taped conversations between the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>and appellant. It is appellant\u2019s contention that these warrantless and surreptitious recordings violated the rights secured to him under the search and seizure provisions of article I, section 7 of the Hawaii State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On November 20,1978, Officer Russell Akana, who was working in an undercover capacity for the Honolulu Police Department\u2019s \u201cProject Hukilau,\u201d was contacted by a confidential informant who advised him of the availability of a certain firearm. Officer Akana then contacted one Lawrence Jove, who informed Akana that the appellant, Bryan Pilago, had an M-60 machine gun available. Appellant\u2019s phone number was also later obtained from Jove.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In the evening of November 21,1978, Officer Akana, posingas a prospective buyer named \u201cJunior,\u201d telephoned appellant at his home to arrange a meeting at which the purchase of the weapon by \u201cJunior\u201d could be consummated. The terms of the purchase were reached during this conversation. It was also agreed that \u201cJunior\u2019s\u201d boy would pick up Jove shortly after midnight at the Latin Villa nightclub in Kalihi where Jove worked as a doorman, and drive him to Violet\u2019s Grill nearby where the meeting would take place. Unknown to appellant, this conversation was being recorded by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Detectives John Paekukui and Terumitsu Yasuda were assigned to pose as \u201cJunior\u2019s\u201d boys who were to pick up Lawrence Jove and proceed to Violet\u2019s Grill. Officer Yasuda carried a tape recorder concealed on his person to record the transaction. They met Jove as arranged, and as they were walking toward Yasuda\u2019s car, appellant unexpectedly joined them. All of them except Jove, who returned to the Latin Villa, then proceeded to appellant\u2019s vehicle which was parked in the nightclub\u2019s parking lot. Appellant\u2019s father, Angelino Pilago, was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and stepped out of the car to join the parties as they approached the vehicle. This area was readily accessible to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">With the assistance of his father, appellant opened the trunk of his vehicle and showed the undercover officers an M-60 machine gun. He explained to them where the weapon had come from, its condition, and how it worked. The entire conversation was taped by Officer Yasuda. Detective Paekukui then turned the purchase money over to appellant, and the officers thereafter left with the weapon in their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In the afternoon of November 22, 1978, Officer Akana telephoned appellant at his home, again identifying himself as \u201cJunior.\u201d The officer expressed satisfaction with the \u201cpurchase\u201d and engaged appellant in further discussions regarding it and other matters of a related nature. This conversation, too, was recorded by the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">On the basis of the facts before us, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his recorded statements. <em>State v. Lester, </em>64 Haw. 659, 649 P.2d 346 (1982). He did not, in our opinion, exhibit that actual (subjective) expectation of privacy that the Katz<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> test requires. Neither are we satisfied that in the circumstances appellant\u2019s expectation of privacy, when viewed objectively, would have been justifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Appellant additionally challenges his conviction for several firearms offenses. He contends that the offenses arose out of a single transaction; consequently, he argues that HRS \u00a7 701-109(I)(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prohibits multiple prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">He also contends his convictions of the three counts violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit. We hold that where a defendant in the context of one criminal scheme or transaction commits several acts independendy violative of one or more statutes, he may be punished for all of them if charges are properly consolidated by the State in one trial. <em>State v. Pia, </em>55 Haw. 14, 19, 514 P.2d 580, 585 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss indictment on the ground that article I, section 11 of the Hawaii Constitution was self-executing and required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appointment of an independent counsel upon impanelment of the grand jury. Appellant\u2019s argument was answered by our recent decision in <em>State v. Rodrigues, </em>63 Haw. 412, 629 P.2d 1111 (1982), however, wherein we held that article I, section 11 of the Hawaii State Constitution, creating the position of independent grand jury counsel, is not self-executing.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>(a) One offense is included in the other, as defined in subsection (4) of this section. ...</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b41-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>Herbert B.
