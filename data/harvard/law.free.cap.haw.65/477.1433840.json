One order granted a motion to dismiss an amendment to a third-party complaint and the other assessed attorney\u2019s fees in favor of the third-party defendant against the third-party plaintiff. The order dismissing the amendment to the third-party complaint contained the appropriate recitals under Rule 54(b), HRCP, and thus was a final and appealable order. On a review of the record, we see no error in the granting of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-14\">As to the order granting attorney\u2019s fees, numerous cases hold that attorney\u2019s fees cannot be granted unless authorized by statute, rule of court, agreement, stipulation or Hawaiian precedent. <em>Dress Mfg. Co. v. Cadinha, </em>33 Haw. 456, 478 (1935); <em>Welsh v. Campbell, </em>42 Haw. 490, 498 (1958); <em>Brown v. Tokuda, </em>49 Haw. 311, 417 P.2d 636 (1966); <em>Salvador v. Popaa, </em>56 Haw. 111, 530 P.2d 7 (1974); <em>Cain v. Cain, </em>59 Haw. 32, 575 P.2d 468 (1978).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxDa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>Richard H. Lachmann (Kelso, Spencer, Snyder &amp; Sterling </em>of counsel) on the brief for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9nL\"><em>John Rapp (Goodsill Anderson Quinn </em>of counsel) on the brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It is apparent in the record that the court below granted attorney\u2019s fees because it felt that the amendment to the third-party complaint was brought in bad faith. The order below, however, was entered in 1978. There was not then any statute, rule of court or Hawaiian judicial precedent for such an award. <em>Cuerva &amp; Associates v. Wong, </em>1 Haw. App. 194, 616 P.2d 1017 (1980). In 1980, by Act 286, the legislature added \u00a7 607-14.5, HRS, which permits an award of attorney\u2019s fees against \u00e1 party whose claim is found to be completely frivolous. Since that statute was not yet in effect when the order was entered, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
