Morishige (defendant) was convicted of Assault in the First Degree and Attempted Assault in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>First Degree after ajury trial in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit. He was further adjudged a persistent offender, as defined in HRS \u00a7 706-662(1), and a multiple offender, as defined in HRS \u00a7 706-662(4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment for twenty years, without possibility of parole for a period of ten years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His appeal raises several questions concerning the trial and one related to the imposition of sentence. From a review of the record, we conclude the trial court committed no reversible error in tlie course of trial. But we are of the opinion that it should not have foreclosed defendant\u2019s attempts to demonstrate the ineffectiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of counsel in prior cases upon which the extended and mandatory term of imprisonment was predicated. We therefore set aside the sentence and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AAg-\">The defendant, a previously convicted felon, shot Alvin Morishige, his brother, and attempted to shoot Linnell Endo, his brother\u2019s girlfriend, with a rifle on November 21, 1978. The first count of the indictment returned by the Grand Jury charged the defendant with a violation of HRS \u00a7 134-7(b), Possession of Firearm by a Person Convicted of Certain Offenses. The indictment\u2019s second and third counts charged him with Attempted Murder in violation of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 705-500 and 707-701. On defendant\u2019s motion, the unlawful possession of firearm charge was severed from the attempted murder charges for trial purposes. However, he entered a guilty plea on the firearm offense and proceeded to trial on the offenses of attempts to commit murder. The trial jury found him guilty of lesser included offenses of Assault in.the First Degree and Attempted Assault in the First Degree, rather than Attempted Murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The State subsequently moved for the imposition of an extended term of imprisonment pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-661,706-662(1) and 706-662(4) and for the imposition of a mandatory minimum term pursuant to HRS \u00a7 706-660.1 (b)(2). The motions were granted after a consolidated hearing on the motions, and defendant was sentenced to prison for twenty years with no possibility of parole for a period of ten years. The defendant\u2019s timely appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The questions posed for determination, in our view, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-11\">1. Whether the trial court erred by not allowing defendant twelve peremptory juror challenges pursuant to Rule 24(b), Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (HRPP), and HRS \u00a7 635-30, since conviction of the offenses charged would have subjected defendant to life imprisonment under the provisions of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-661 and 706-662.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-12\">2. Whether the trial court erred in permitting testimony that the defendant claims was not disclosed to him in response to a pre-trial request made pursuant to Rule 16, HRPP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-13\">3. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>grant a motion for mistrial after an impaneled juror observed defendant in shackles outside the courtroom during the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">4. Whether the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to grant a motion for mistrial after a court-appointed psychiatrist referred to defendant\u2019s record of prior criminal offenses in his testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">5. Whether the trial court should have permitted testimony on the claimed ineffectiveness of counsel in prior cases during the hearing on the State\u2019s motions seeking the imposition of an extended term of imprisonment and a mandatory minimum term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Addressing the questions related to the conduct of the trial, we first consider the defendant\u2019s claim that he should have been allowed to exercise twelve peremptory juror challenges rather than the three permitted by the trial court. The argument he advances is that Rule 24(b), HRPP<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and HRS \u00a7 635-30<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> entitled him to twelve peremptory challenges because the provisions of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-661 and 706-662 prescribing extended sentences for persistent and multiple offenders subjected him to possible life imprisonment. Thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>the offense charged, he claims, was \u201cpunishable by life imprisonment\u201d and one for which twelve challenges are provided by statute and rule. While the proposition is not without appeal, it has been examined and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In <em>State v. Masaniai, </em>63 Haw. 354, 628 P.2d 1018 (1981), the defendant-appellant and his co-defendant, who had been charged with three counts of robbery, were each permitted to exercise two peremptory challenges on voir dire pursuant to Rule 24(b), HRPP. On appeal, the defendant-appellant argued in the manner defendant does here that twelve challenges should have been allowed as \u201cthe court could have imposed a maximum term of life imprisonment pursuant to the multiple offender provisions of HRS \u00a7 706-662(4).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 628 P.2d at 1021. But as we observed, \u201c[a]t the voir dire stage, it is uncertain whether the extended term provision for a multiple offender is applicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded the charged offense governed the number of challenges on voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The conclusion that the number of challenges is fixed by the maximum penalty directly attaching to the charged offense is buttressed by the history of the rule, which was derived from Rule 24 of the Hawaii Rules of Criminal Procedure. The commentary to Rule 24(b), HRPP, as proposed, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">Section (b) is the same as HRCrP 24(b). It was enacted into statute in 1972 and is found in HRS Section 635-30. Under the Penal Code, only murder carries a life sentence. Class A felonies are punishable by a life sentence only upon a finding that the defendant is a certain kind of offender, i.e., a persistent, multiple, dangerous or professional criminal, and apparently would not be entitled to 12 peremptories under the rule. Cf. Note to Rule 11(c)(2) commenting on the meaning of \u201cmaximum penalty\u201d as not including any extended'term which is based not on the offense itself but on the background of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahx\">Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure (Proposed Draft), June 1975, Commentary to Rule 24.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hence, a defendant is entitled to twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>peremptory challenges on voir dire only when the charged offense itself carries a penalty of life imprisonment. And as the offense for which the defendant was indicted, attempted murder, was punishable by imprisonment for a maximum term of twenty years, he was properly allowed three peremptory challenges. <em>See State v. Alo, </em>57 Haw. 418, 426, 558 P.2d 1012, 1017 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 922 (1977); HRS \u00a7 705-502 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The trial court\u2019s allowance of testimony by two \u201csurprise\u201d witnesses over the objections of defendant is raised next as reversible error. The claim of \u201csurprise\u201d stems from the State\u2019s neglect to disclose the names of the two and the nature of their anticipated testimony in advance of trial, despite a pre-trial request for particular information regarding prospective prosecution witnesses made pursuant to Rule 16, HRPP. Defense counsel was apprised of the prosecution\u2019s intention to call a firearms expert on the morning the trial began. That Elaine Uyehara would testify she had once heard the defendant say the shooting of his brother would be a mercy killing was communicated to counsel for defendant only a few days before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">Though the State failed to abide by the prescript for disclosure of relevant information upon due request, the violation of Rule 16 of itself did not serve to bar the proffered testimony. In <em>State v. Sugimoto, </em>62 Haw. 259, 614 P.2d 386 (1980), the prosecution was guilty of a similar transgression of the rule. The trial court nonetheless permitted two witnesses whose names were not on the list of prospective witnesses submitted earlier to give evidence at trial, but only after measures to dispel the prejudicial effect of the tardy disclosure were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>taken.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to defendant\u2019s assertion on appeal that the proper course of action for the trial court was a declaration of mistrial, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">[A] violation of Rule 16 does not warrant an immediate declaration of a mistrial by the trial court. The rule provides that where a party fails to comply with its terms \u201cthe court may order such party to permit the discovery, grant a continuance, <em>or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d </em>Rule 16(e)(8)(i), HRPP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 262, 614 P.2d at 389 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The trial court here did no less to ensure that prejudice would not result from the tardy disclosure concerning the firearms expert. Defense counsel was afforded adequate time to interview him and to seek the services of another expert if counsel desired. Moreover, the court suggested the possibility of a continuance of trial to accommodate counsel if he actually encountered difficulties. No abuse of discretion has been demonstrated under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Although the prosecuting attorney also failed to inform the defense of his intention to have Elaine Uyehara relate the defendant\u2019s statement about \u201cmercy killing\u201d to the jury until a few days before trial, she was hardly a \u201csurprise\u201d witness. The record indicates her name was initially on the list of prospective witnesses for the defense. We discern no prejudice flowing from the fact that her name did not appear on the original roster of prosecution witnesses; the trial court\u2019s allowance of her testimony did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">A claim of reversible error predicated upon the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial after a juror purportedly observed the defendant \u201cin chains\u201d outside the courtroom on the second day of trial is advanced next. Defendant contends \u201cin this case, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>viewed as a whole shows that there is a strong likelihood that this incident was prejudicial.\u201d He thus maintains the trial court erred by denying the motion for mistrial. The allegations of prejudicial effect, however, are not substantiated by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Indulging in \u201csome presumptions in favor of the integrity of the jury,\u201d we said in <em>State v. Hashimoto, </em>46 Haw. 183, 191-92, 377 P.2d 728, 734 (1962), that it was \u201ca far-fetched conjecture that jurors under oath would spontaneously harbor prejudice immediately upon seeing a defendant brought to court in manacles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 377 P.2d at 734. And in <em>State v. Reverio, </em>61 Haw. 95, 595 P.2d 1069 (1979), we concluded the trial court erred by dismissing the case on grounds that prospective jurors had observed the defendant in shackles prior to the commencement of trial. In our view, \u201ca brief and fortuitous observation of defendant in shackles by jurors . .. [was] not prejudicial,\u201d and an affirmative showing of prejudice should have been required before the case was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 98, 595 P.2d at 1071. A juror\u2019s witnessing the defendant in shackles during the course of trial likewise \u201cdoes not, <em>ipso facto, </em>raise a presumption of prejudice.\u201d State <em>v. Hashimoto, supra, </em>46 Haw. at 191, 377 P.2d at 734. A demonstration of prejudice is also a requisite for a declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">When the trial court was apprised that a juror \u201cwalked right by Mr. Morishige and Mr. Falk (a guard) while Mr. Falk was taking his leg irons off,\u201d counsel for defendant was permitted to examine the juror out of the presence of other jurors. The transcript of the voir dire examination discloses the juror was uncertain about what had transpired. His testimony was that he saw the defendant standing, a man bending down, and a woman standing nearby; he thought the defendant was being shackled, but was ambivalent in this regard. The juror spoke to no one else of the incident, and he was admonished not to relate its occurrence to anyone else. Significantly, no testimony regarding a prejudicial effect upon the juror or anyone else was elicited. And as no prejudice was demonstrated, there were no grounds for declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Defendant\u2019s final assertion of reversible error committed during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>trial is premised on the admission of testimony concerning his prior criminal and anti-social conduct. Pursuant to a motion <em>in limine </em>presented by defendant, the trial court ruled before trial that evidence of his record of prior criminal offenses and incarceration would be excluded from trial. Nevertheless, the psychiatrist who was a rebuttal witness on behalf of the State was allowed to discuss the defendant\u2019s prior history of criminal and anti-social behavior in the course of his testimony. The receipt of such evidence, however, did not necessarily constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u201cThe admission of evidence which tends to prove the commission of crimes other than the crime charged gives rise to several problems.\u201d <em>State v. Iaukea, </em>56 Haw. 343, 348, 537 P.2d 724, 729 (1975). For one, \u201c[t]he jury may believe that the defendant is guilty merely because he is a likely person to do such acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And of course, a defendant cannot be expected to be prepared \u201cto defend himself against the evidence of collateral crimes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus courts following the common law tradition have generally closed \u201cthe whole matter of [the defendant\u2019s] character, disposition and reputation on the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d <em>Michelson v. United States, </em>335 U.S. 469, <em>475 (1948);</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> see also </em>Rule 404(a), Fed. R. Evid. and Rule 404(a), Haw. R. Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">But they have not foreclosed evidence of other crimes in all situations, for it unquestionably has evidentiary value beyond the substantiation of character, disposition, and reputation. Where, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>example, such evidence may be relevant in establishing elements essential to the prosecution and its probative value outweighs the possible prejudice, courts have not displayed a reluctance to receive the evidence. Thus we concluded in <em>Iaukea </em>that the \u201ctestimony in controversy regarding other criminal acts allegedly committed by the defendant\u201d was properly admitted \u2014 it was \u201crelevant and material to the proof of an element of the crimes charged in the indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Iaukea, supra, </em>56 Haw. at 351, 537 P.2d at 731. The element at issue was forcible compulsion, which we found was \u201cwholly distinct from [the defendant\u2019s] propensity or bad character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further concluded the testimony probably could have been admitted under another widely accepted view, one we subsequently characterized as \u201cthe more restrictive view that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible except when it helps to establish one of five issues: intent, motive, absence of mistake or accident, identity, or common scheme or plan.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>59 Haw. 1, 8, 575 P.2d 448, 454 (1978).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The testimony in question here was not adduced \u201con the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief\u201d to demonstrate the defendant was \u201cby propensity a probable perpetrator\u201d of the crimes charged by the indictment. <em>Michelson v. United States, supra, </em>335 U.S. at 475. Pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>portedly, it was elicited to rebut a clinical psychologist called by the defense who testified the defendant was suffering from an acute mental disorder that \u201cprevented him from knowing right from wrong\u201d and \u201cfrom conforming his behavior to the requirements of the law\u201d when the alleged offenses occurred.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The testimony that the defendant lacked a substantial capacity to appreciate the nature of his conduct and to make it conform to the requirements of law imposed an additional burden on the State. For it then became incumbent on the prosecution to negate the defendant\u2019s claim; the establishment of an element of the crimes had been placed in doubt by testimony that defendant was unable to form the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The thrust of the rebuttal testimony was that the defendant retained a substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct despite his drug dependency. The State\u2019s witness ascribed defendant\u2019s criminal behavior to an \u201canti-social personality\u201d rather than the mental disorder described earlier by the defense witness. Defendant\u2019s prior history of criminal and anti-social behavior was cited in support of this opinion. This evidence, in our view, was relevant and had a tendency to establish the offenses charged; <em>see State v. Murphy, supra, </em>59 Haw. at 8, 575 P.2d at 454; it could have gone to establish the necessary intent. <em>See State v. Apao, </em>59 Haw. 625, 638, 586 P.2d 250, 259 (1978). Moreover, it was adduced to rebut a defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">Evidence of the prosecution tending to rebut a defense will not be excluded because it also tends to show the commission of another crime by the accused. Thus, where the accused asserted the defense of alibi, evidence of his commission of another crime was admissible to show that he was in the vicinity in question at the time of the crime charged; or where the accused asserted the defense of insanity, evidence which tended to show that he was sane was admissible even though it also tended to show that he was guilty of another crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">1 C.E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 258 (13th ed. 1972) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Though the defendant insists the evidence in question should not have been admitted because it was highly prejudicial, there is no reason for this court to disturb the determination of its admissibility. \u201cThe responsibility for maintaining the delicate balance between probative value and prejudicial effect lies largely within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Iaukea, supra, </em>56 Haw. at 349, 537 P.2d at 729. No abuse of discretionary authority appears.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We turn now from the defendant\u2019s assertions of trial error to the question posed on the imposition of the extended and mandatory term of imprisonment. The averment of prejudicial error here is premised on the trial court\u2019s rejection of testimony on the purported ineffectiveness of defendant\u2019s attorneys in prior convictions upon which the enhanced sentence was grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">A hearing to determine whether an extended sentence should be imposed pursuant to HRS \u00a7\u00a7 706-662(1) and 706-662(4) cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>equated \u201cwith the routine sentence of a trial judge who is vested with wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence which may be utilized by him in the proper disposition of convicted offenders.\u201d <em>State v. Kamae, </em>56 Haw. 32, 38, 526 P.2d 1200, 1204 (1974). \u201cEachof the subsections of \u00a7 706-662 requires the trial court to engage in a two-step process to impose a sentence for an extended term. The first step involves a finding by the court that the defendant is within the class of offenders to which the particular subsection applies.\u201d <em>State v. Huelsman, </em>60 Haw. 71, 76, 588 P.2d 394, 398 (1978). If the court so finds, it must then decide whether the defendant\u2019s commitment for an extended term is necessary for the public\u2019s protection (where the extended term is sought under subsections (1), (2), (3), and (5)) or that his criminality is so extensive that an extended term is warranted (where the extended term is sought under subsection (4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The establishment of the defendant\u2019s status as a persistent or multiple offender at the initial step \u201cinvolves \u2018historical facts\u2019, the proof of which exposes the defendant to punishment by an extended term sentence, similarly to the manner in which the proof of his guilt exposes him to ordinary sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 588 P.2d at 400. Hence, these facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a hearing where the ordinary rules of evidence apply. <em>State v. Kamae, </em>56 Haw. 628, 635-38, 548 P.2d 632, 637-38 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And when prior convictions are used to enhance the penalty for another offense, the record in each case must \u201cshow that. . . [the defendant] was represented by counsel during .. . the alleged prior offenses of which he was convicted, or that he intelligently and voluntarily waived his constitutional right to counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Kamae, supra, </em>56 Haw. at 638, 548 P.2d at 639. \u201cTo permit a conviction obtained in violation of <em>Gideon v. Wainwright </em>to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense (see <em>Greer v. Beto, </em>384 U.S. 269 [1966]) is to erode the principle of that case.\u201d <em>Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U.S. 109, 115 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">This court has yet to pass on the procedural demands related to the imposition of a mandatory term of imprisonment under HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(b). But in <em>State v. Freitas, </em>61 Haw. 262, 602 P.2d 914 (1979), we examined another mandatory sentencing statute, S.L.H. 1976, c.181 (subsequently codified as HRS \u00a7 706-606.5), and concluded \u201cordinary sentencing procedures should apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277, 602 P.2d at 925. For while the ultimate assessment of an extended term under HRS \u00a7 706-662 remains discretionary with the trial court, \u201cAct 181 ... is a mandatory sentencing statute .. . [that] admits of no such discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Still, we decreed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">that before sentence may be imposed under Act 181, the defendant must be given reasonable notice of the intended application of Act 181; he must be given the opportunity to be heard; the fact of his prior conviction must be established by satisfactory evidence; and he must have been represented by counsel (or have-knowingly and intelligently waived representation) at the time of his prior conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>Id. See also State v. Caldeira, </em>61 Haw. 285, 602 P.2d 930 (1979); <em>State v. Afong, </em>61 Haw. 281, 602 P.2d 927 (1979). We likewise deem it essential in a hearing to determine whether a mandatory term is imposable under HRS \u00a7 706-660.1(b) that \u201cthe fact of prior conviction and the fact of legal representation or the waiver thereof . . . [be] properly presented to the court for its consideration.\u201d <em>State v.

The record in this case substantiates the prior convictions premised on guilty pleas entered by the defendant; it further reflects the presence of counsel in the previous cases.

Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. 28, 30, 501 P.2d 977, 979 (1972); <em>see Reece v. Georgia, </em>350 U.S. 85, 90 (1955); <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 69-70 (1942); <em>Avery v. Alabama, </em>308 U.S. 444, 446 <em>(1940); Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 57 (1932). That this right to effective counsel extends to a defendant pleading guilty to felony charges is also clear. <em>See McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14 (1970); <em>Stough v. State, </em>62 Haw. 620, 618 P.2d 301 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The onus of proving ineffectiveness, however, rests with the defendant, <em>State v. Antone, </em>62 Haw. 346, 348, 615 P.2d 101, 104 (1980), who faces a two-fold task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">First, . . . [he] must establish specific errors or omissions of defense counsel reflecting counsel\u2019s lack of skill, judgment or diligence. <em>State v. Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. at 30, 501 P.2d at <em>979; People v. Pope, </em>23 Cal.3d 412, 425, 590 P.2d 859, 866 (1979). Second,. . . [he] must establish that these errors or omissions resulted in either the withdrawal or substantial impairment of a potentially meritorious defense. <em>State v. Kahalewai, </em>54 Haw. at 32, 501 P.2d at 980; <em>People v. Pope, </em>23 Cal.3d at 425, 590 P.2d at 866. Where . . . [a defendant] successfully meets these burdens, he will have proven the denial of assistance \u201cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 348-49, 615 P.2d at 104 (footnote omitted). The defendant\u2019s burden is obviously a heavy one; he ought not be denied an opportunity to meet it.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Having found no error in the conduct of the trial, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.

In 1966 Federal Rule II was amended to add the requirement that the court determine that the defendant understands \u201cthe consequences of his plea.\u201d This is being further refined under Proposed Federal Rule 11. The objective is to insure that the defendant knows what penalty he faces in pleading guilty: The maximum penalty of which he is to be informed is that which is set \u201cfor the offense to which the plea is offered.\u201d This refers to the maximum penalty directly attaching to the offense itself and not to possible additional adverse ramifications of conviction nor to additional penalties such as extended terms based on the defendant\u2019s background.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b377-11\"> Our opinion noted the trial judge\u2019s efforts in this regard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">The trial judge fully inquired into the circumstances surrounding the calling of Kahao and Ancheta. ...

Not that the law invests the defendant with a presumption of good character, <em>Greer v. United States, </em>245 U.S. 559, but it simply closes the whole matter of character, disposition and reputation on the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. The state may not show defendant\u2019s prior trouble with the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable perpetrator of the crime. The inquiry is not rejected because character is irrelevant; on the contrary, it is said to weigh too much with the jury and to so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge. The overriding policy of excluding such evidence, despite its admitted probative value, is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Michelson v. United States, <em>supra, </em>335 U.S. at 475-76 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b380-8\"> The discussion of these \u201ctwo basic formulations\u201d of the relevant rule of evidence in <em>Iaukea </em>was recapitulated in <em>Murphy, </em>where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">In <em>State v. Iaukea, </em>56 Haw. 343, 537 P.2d 724 (1975), we noted the difficulties which may arise when evidence is introduced which tends to prove the commission of crimes other than those with which the defendant is charged. We went on to discuss in <em>Iaukea </em>the two basic formulations of the rule pertaining to use of evidence involving other crimes. Under the first formulation, which encompasses a more liberal approach, evidence of other crimes is deemed to be admissible if it is found to be relevant and to have a tendency to establish the offense charged. The second (or \u201calternative\u201d) formulation, which is most often recited by courts around the country, is the more restrictive view that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible except when it helps to establish one of five issues: intent, motive, absence of mistake or accident, identity, or common scheme or plan. While these five traditional exception categories are not intended to be exhaustive, courts which follow the alternative approach are usually reluctant to admit evidence of other crimes which does not fall within those categories.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">State v.

But we believe our holding would not have been any different even if the rules had been in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">Rule 404(b), Haw. R. Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible where such evidence is probative of any other fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, modus operandi, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">and Rule 403 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-16\">Thus the Hawaii Rules of Evidence provide that evidence of other crimes is inadmissible to show the defendant is \u201cby propensity a probable perpetrator\u201d of the crime charged, but admissible to prove any other fact of consequence to the determination of the case, assuming of course, that the evidence is not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\"> But the \u201cprocedural standards to which the second phase of an extended term sentence proceeding . . .
