(hereafter Aloha and Hawaiian, respectively; the taxpayers, collectively) challenge the taxation of inter-island air carriers under the Public Service Company Tax Law, HRS Chapter 239, in these consolidated appeals from the Tax Appeal Court. They claim the assessment of a tax on the \u201cgross income each year from the airline business\u201d pursuant to HRS \u00a7 239-6<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> runs afoul of the federal constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Supremacy and Commerce Clauses<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513 proscribes the levy of a tax premised on \u201cthe gross receipts derived\u201d from air transportation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude the State tax in question, as applied to the taxpayers, has not been rendered unconstitutional by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the foregoing federal legislation and affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">Aloha and Hawaiian are Hawaii corporations engaged in the transportation of persons, property, and mail by air between terminal and intermediate points in Hawaii. Prior to the enactment of S.L.H. 1981, c. 167, they fell within the meaning of \u201cPublic service company\u201d as the term was defined in HRS \u00a7 239-2 because a common carrier by air was deemed a public utility by HRS \u00a7 269-1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See In re Tax Appeal of Aloha Airlines, Inc., </em>56 Haw. 626, 627, 547 P.2d 586, 587 (1976). Although the crucial federal statute was enacted in 1973 as part of the Airport Development Acceleration Act of 1973, the taxpayers nevertheless continued to file annual returns as required by HRS \u00a7 239-4 and to pay the tax as prescribed by HRS \u00a7 239-6 without question for several years thereafter. The taxpayers\u2019 present position on the invalidity of HRS \u00a7 239-6 as it applies to airlines was initially advanced in 1977 when Aloha filed amended returns for the 1973, 1974, and 1975 calendar years. Hawaiian sought no refund of the tax payments in question until 1978 when it submitted, amended returns for 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976. All claims for refunds were summarily disallowed by the State Director of Taxation (the Director). Aloha\u2019s return for 1976 and Hawaiian\u2019s return for 1977 reflected their present views regarding the unconstitutional nature of the Public Service Company Tax. The Director, however, ruled 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513 was \u201cnot applicable for Hawaii tax purpose,\u201d and assessments consistent with HRS \u00a7 239-6 were made. Timely appeals to the Tax Appeal Court from the Director\u2019s determinations on the refunds and assessments followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The appeals were submitted to the Tax Appeal Court for decision on stipulated facts and briefs filed by the taxpayers and the Director. Aloha and Hawaiian conceded they were public service companies within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 239-2, but argued, as they do here, that there is an irreconcilable conflict between HRS \u00a7 239-6 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513 and the State law has been voided by the federal statute. The court rejected their arguments, ruled the Public Service Company Tax is \u201ca property tax and a general tax,\u201d and concluded the Director properly assessed the tax against the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Aloha asserts the State law in question contravenes the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause of the federal constitution; Hawaiian\u2019s claim of unconstitutionality is premised on the Supremacy Clause. We begin our analysis with a review of the State and federal statutory provisions involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">Hawaii\u2019s Public Service Company Tax is a direct descendant of the Public Utility Tax which was adopted in 1932. Although airlines were not covered by the tax on public utilities when it first became effective, they became subject to the tax shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two decades later, air carriers were exempted from payment of the utility tax and subjected to taxation under the General Excise Tax Law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislature reconsidered this decision in 1963 and again decided inter-island air carriers should be classified with public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>utilities for State tax purposes; it concomitantly redesignated the Public Utility Tax as the Public Service Company Tax. <em>See </em>S.L.H. 1963, c. 147, \u00a7 2(a). Airlines have since been subject to taxation pursuant to HRS \u00a7 239-6 which delineates the basis and the rates for assessing the tax against common carriers by air and water, motor carriers, and contract carriers other than motor carriers. The foregoing provisions levy a flat four or three percent tax on gross income from utility business. Others subject to the Public Service Company Tax are likewise taxed on the basis of their gross incomes, but at varying rates (beginning at 5.885%) determined in each case by the ratio between the net income and the gross income from utility business. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 -239-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">Our Territorial predecessors considered the nature of the levy in question early in the history of the Public Utility Tax; they concluded it \u201cimposes a tax comparable to the <em>ad valorem </em>real and personal property taxes otherwise imposed\u201d by the laws of the Territory of Hawaii. <em>Hawaii Consolidated Railway v. Borthwick, </em>34 Haw. 269, 281 (1937), <em>aff'd, </em>105 F.2d 286 (1939). And the rationale for so concluding was stated in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">Authorities on taxation have uniformly recognized with approval the efforts of some of the States to avoid the difficulties encountered in <em>ad valorem </em>assessments of the real and personal property of utilities actually employed in the utility business by substituting a tax upon gross incomes from utilities from utility business, upon net income from the same source or both. (See Lutz, Public Finance [2d ed.] p. 462, etseq.; Luce, \u201cAssessment of Real Property for Taxation,\u201d 35 Mich. L. Rev. 1217; Ravage, \u201cValuation of Public Utilities for Ad Valorem Taxation,\u201d 41 Yale L. J. 487.) And this method of taxation of real and personal property of utilities within the taxing jurisdiction has the unqualified approval of the courts. It will suffice to cite the leading cases on the subject decided by the United States Supreme Court. (See <em>Cudahy Packing Co. v. Minnesota, </em>246 U.S. 450, 453, <em>United States Express Co. v. Minnesota, </em>223 U.S. 335, 346; <em>Galveston, Harrisburg, etc. Ry. Co. v. Texas, </em>210 U.S. 217, 226, 227.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al\"><em>Id. </em>at 280. In the court\u2019s view, the \u201cearning capacity of property devoted to the utility business .. . [was] reflected by gross income from [the] utility business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. We have not had occasion to examine the relevant taxing provisions since the specific language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>covering the taxation of airlines and other carriers was adopted in 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Turning to the federal statutes, we initially note the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 219 (the Development Act) and the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 236 (the Revenue Act) were passed in tandem \u201cto provide for the expansion and improvement of the Nation\u2019s airport and airway system.\u201d H. R. Rep. No. 91-601,91st Cong., 2d Sess., 1 <em>,reprintedin </em>[1970] U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. NEWS 3047,3047. In short, the Development Act declared a congressional policy to increase federal expenditures for the foregoing purpose and the Revenue Act was designed to provide the means for implementation. \u201cIn substantial part, this purpose . . . [was] to be achieved through the imposition and application of airport and airway user charges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Certain taxes already in existence were increased and other new aviation user taxes were imposed to finance the desired expansion and improvement of the system. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4261 and 4271. The taxes imposed on the air transportation of persons and property were made payable in each case \u201cby the person making the payment subject to tRe tax.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4261(d) and 4271(b)(1). And an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Airport and Airway Trust Fund was established to serve as the repository of the taxes collected and the moneys appropriated for the program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Two years later Congress\u2019 attention was redirected to the program by a perceived need for even greater federal funding of the costs of airport development. But in the meanwhile the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority District v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>405 U.S. 707 (1972), had been issued. There, the Court held the imposition of \u201ca charge by a State or municipality of $1 per commercial airline passenger to help defray the costs of airport construction and maintenance,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 709, did not necessarily constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce. Fearing a proliferation of similar charges at airports throughout the country, Congress included the provisions presently codified as 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513 in the Airport Development Acceleration Act of 1973,87 Stat. 88-90 (1973). That the proscriptions embodied therein were in response to the judicial approval of the new head taxes adopted by state and local governments subsequent to the passage of the Airport and Airway Development and Revenue Acts of 1970 is expressly confirmed by a pertinent legislative document. <em>See </em>S. Rep. No. 93-12,93d Cong., 1st Sess. 1, <em>reprinted in </em>[1973] U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. NEWS 1434.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The preemptive language chosen by Congress, however, is couched in the broadest of terms in one subsection of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513. Section 1513 (a) forbids the levy or collection of a state or local</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">tax, fee, head charge, or other charge, directly or indirectly, on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce or on the sale of air transportation or on the gross receipts derived therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Read literally, the subsection decrees a federal preemption of the entire field of commercial aviation taxes. For every tax, fee, or charge levied on air transportation must perforce be met, directly or indirectly, from gross receipts derived from \u201cthe airline business\u201d or by the users of air transportation. But \u00a7 1513(b) demonstrates that Congress could not have intended so broad a preemptive sweep since the subsection permits the levy and collection of state and local</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a).. . , including property taxes, net income taxes, franchise taxes, and sales or use taxes \u00f3n the sale of goods or services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Property taxes, net income taxes, and franchise taxes, of course, are ordinarily derived from the \u201cgross receipts\u201d of airlines, and sales taxes applicable to air transportation can only be those where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>incidence would normally be expected to fall on the ultimate users of airline services. Our task then is to harmonize the seeming contradictions consistently with the purpose of the relevant federal legislation and ascertain whether the tax imposed by HRS \u00a7 239-6 is a forbidden charge enumerated in \u00a7 1513(a) or a permitted tax described by \u00a7 1513(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Focusing on the allegations of unconstitutionality advanced by the taxpayers, we first address Aloha\u2019s assertion that HRS \u00a7 239-6, as it has been applied to inter-island air carriers, constitutes an undue burden on commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Aloha claims the exaction of the tax in question is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause under principles enunciated in <em>Crandall v. Nevada, </em>73 U.S. 35 (1867), <em>Capitol Greyhound Lines v. Brice, </em>339 U.S. 542 (1950), and <em>Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority District v. Delta Airlines, Inc., supra. </em>The cases in Aloha\u2019s estimation proclaim a \u201crule\u201d that \u201ca tax upon interstate commerce will only be constitutional if it is not excessive in comparison with the state or local governmental benefit conferred.\u201d Since the tax at issue generates revenues for the State\u2019s General Fund and not for purposes related to airport development and maintenance, Aloha argues the State confers no benefit in exchange for the levy and the tax therefore fails to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">But in <em>Crandall </em>and <em>Evansville-Vanderburgh, </em>the questioned charges were passenger head taxes imposed on persons traveling in interstate commerce, and in <em>Capitol Greyhound Lines, </em>the tax in question was specifically levied on interstate and intrastate carriers for the privilege of using the roads of Maryland. Consequently, we find the foregoing citations of authority inapposite, and seek guidance instead from more recent Supreme Court decisions delineating definitive standards for determining whether a state tax infringes the Commerce Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u201cIn reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes,. . . [the] goal [of the Supreme Court] has . .. been to \u2018establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry\u2019 focusing on \u2018the practical effect of a challenged <em>tax\u2019 Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>425, 443 (1980).\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, </em>453 U.S. 609, 615 (1981). The analysis now favored by the Court is the four-part test described in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274 (1977). \u201cUnder that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it \u2018is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.\u2019 430 U.S., at 279.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, supra, </em>453 U.S. at 617. Aloha does not dispute that the Public Service Company Tax satisfies the first three prongs of the four-part test; it argues, as we have noted, that the tax falters on the final leg because the moneys exacted by the State are not expended for airport purposes. But Aloha\u2019s belief in this regard does not reflect the Court\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The Court customarily affords states wide latitude in imposing general revenue taxes, and \u201cthere is no requirement under the Due Process Clause that the amount of general revenue taxes collected from a particular activity must be reasonably related to the value of the services provided to the activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, this latitude is not \u201cdivested by the Commerce Clause merely because the taxed activity has some connection to interstate commerce; particularly when the tax is levied on an activity conducted within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623. For it was never \u201cthe purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.\u201d <em>Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, </em>303 U.S. 250, 254 (1938). And this share of the burden includes sharingin the cost of benefits such as \u201ca trained work force and the advantages of a civilized society.\u201d <em>Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, </em>441 U.S. 434, 445 (1979). We experience no difficulty in concluding that the imposition of Hawaii\u2019s Phblic Service Company Tax on a Hawaii corporation engaged in business as an inter-island air carrier does not constitute an undue burden on commerce, and move on to the problems engendered by the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">The Supremacy Clause provides that the \u201c \u2018Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land ... any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u2019 [U.S. Const.] Art. VI, cl. 2. It is basic to this constitutional command that all conflicting state provisions be without effect. <em>See McCulloch v. Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 427 (1819). <em>See Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. <em>52(1941).\" Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981). Yet there is no unerring test to determine just when a state provision is without effect by reason of preemption. As the Court teaches us,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">[t]here is not \u2014 and from the very nature of the problem there cannot be \u2014 any rigid formula or rule which can be used as a universal pattern to determine the meaning and purpose of every act of Congress.. .. [The] Court, in considering the validity of state laws in the light of treaties or federal laws touching the same subject, has made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference. But none of these expressions provides an infallible constitutional test or an exclusive constitutional yardstick. In the final analysis, there can be no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\"><em>Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at 67 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The preemption dispute of present concern implicates the State of Hawaii\u2019s taxing power. It is fundamental that \u201c[t]he power of taxation is indispensable to .. . [the] existence [of state governments], and is a power which, in its own nature, is capable of residing in, and being exercised by, different authorities, at the same time.\u201d <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 199(1824).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In this sense, it is like the police power. Hence, the \u201c[consideration [of a state tax] under the Supremacy Clause starts with the basic assumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law. See <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).\u201d <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 746. For the historic powers of the states are \u201cnot to be superseded ... unless that. .. [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>331 U.S. at 230. Or as the Court has otherwise stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">[i]t will not be presumed that a federal statute was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>supersede the exercise of the power of the state unless there is a clear manifestation of intention to do so. The exercise of federal supremacy is not lightly to be presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><em>Schwartz v. Texas, </em>344 U.S. 199, 202-03 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\"><em>Rice </em>also recounts the several ways in which congressional design to supplant state provisions \u201cmay be evidenced,\u201d namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">The scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for States to supplement it. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Public Service Comm\u2019n, </em>250 U.S. 566, 569; <em>Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson, </em>315 U.S. 148. Or the Act of Congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject. <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, </em>312 U.S. 52. Likewise, the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose. <em>Southern R. Co. v. Railroad Commission, </em>236 U.S. 439; <em>Charleston &amp; W. C. R. Co. v. Varnville Co., </em>237 U.S. 597; <em>New York Central R. Co. v. Winfield, </em>244 U.S. 147; <em>Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., supra. </em>Or the state policy may produce a result inconsistent with the objective of the federal statute. <em>Hill v. Florida, </em>325 U.S. 538.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-8\"><em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>331 U.S. at 230. And as the Court reiterates in <em>Maryland v. Louisiana,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">[o]f course, a state statute is void to the extent it conflicts with a federal statute \u2014 if, for example, \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, </em>373 U.S. 132, 142-143 (1963), or where the law \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>at 67.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-10\"><em>Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, </em>451 U.S. at 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Thus we carefully examine the statutes implicated in the present controversy to ascertain whether an unmistakable intent of Congress to displace the State law appears, mindful that there is no \u201cinfallible constitutional test\u201d to determine congressional purpose, <em>Hines v. Davidowitz, supra, </em>312 U.S. at 67, but knowing that there are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>nevertheless, several ways in which \u201c[s]uch a purpose may be evidenced.\u201d <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>supra, 331 U.S. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">We earlier observed that 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513 broadly forbids the levy by state and local governments of taxes or other charges on air commerce, yet permits the collection of a wide range of state and local taxes. But as we have also seen, the exercise of federal tax power in a particular field is not necessarily incompatible with a similar exercise of power by the states. What initially appears paradoxical in the federal statutory provisions actually tells us that the federal taxation of air transportation was not meant to nullify all state and local taxes related thereto. And if anything more may be gleaned from the enumerated exemptions in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513(b), it is that the primary revenue sources of the states have been placed beyond the preemptive reach of \u00a7 1513(a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Since an inference of a pervasive federal scheme or a dominant federal interest barring the collection of all state taxes touching air transportation cannot be drawn from the relevant statutory language, we consider whether \u201cthe object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it. . . reveal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>... [a] purpose\u201d to cause state tax laws such as HRS \u00a7 239-6 to be without effect. <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., supra, </em>331 U.S. at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The legislative history previously discussed confirms that the object of the pertinent provisions of the Airport Development Acceleration Act of 1973 was to protect the primary sources from which the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970 sought revenue. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. </em>These were, of course, the \u201c[t]icket taxes on passengers and shippers ... imposed directly on the .. . passenger and freight users of the commercial sector of the aviation system.\u201d <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra. See also </em>note 9 <em>supra </em>and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4261 and 4271. The history further indicates a wellspring of annoyance contributing to the legislative action was the levy of \u201chead\u201d taxes on airline passengers by thirty-one state and local jurisdictions. S. Rep. 93-12, <em>supra, </em>at 21, [1973] U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. NEWS, <em>supra, </em>at 1450.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The wrath of Congress was undoubtedly directed at an unpopular tax which \u201cbrings on confusion, delay, anger and resentment and cuts against the grain of the traditional American right to travel among the States unburdened by travel taxes.\u201d S. Rep. 93-12, <em>supra, </em>at 17, [1973] U.S. CODE CONG. &amp; AD. <em>NEWS, supra, </em>at 1446. But more significantly, these user charges also tapped the very sources of revenue that Congress had.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The State law, which antedates the Airport and Airway Revenue Act of 1970, imposes a tax on public service companies rather than the users of their services. The legislature has deemed the State levy \u201ca means of taxing the personal property of the airline or other carrier, tangible and intangible, including going concern value.\u201d HRS \u00a7 239-6. We would not quarrel with this legislative characterization; the tax has some attributes of a property tax. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>infra. </em>As our Territorial predecessors concluded, there is ample legal support for avoiding \u201cthe difficulties encountered in <em>ad valorem </em>assessments of the real and personal property of utilities ... by substituting a tax upon gross incomes from utilities from utility business, upon net income from the same source or both.\u201d <em>Hawaii Consolidated Railway v.

First, extensive administrative experience is available from the present collection of the 5-percent passenger tax, and the collection of the additional 3 percent is merely a matter of a change in computation on the passenger\u2019s ticket from 5 percent to 8 percent (also, before 1958, a 3-percent tax was imposed on domestic freight by rail, motor vehicle, water, and air transportation). Second, a tax upon the value of a ticket or waybill will grow not only as air traffic increases in volume but also as prices rise. Third, a ticket tax is geared to charge an equitable tax related to the distance traveled and the cost per mile of air operation, since ticket prices for short flights are more per mile than long-line flights and the tax is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>proportional to the price of the ticket. Ticket taxes on passengers and shippers are therefore an efficient and equitable user charge imposed directly on the ultimate passenger and freight users of the commercial sector of the aviation system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">H.

But the two grants are not, it is conceived, similar in their terms or their nature. Although many of the powers formerly exercised by the States, are transferred to the government of the Union, yet the State governments remain, and constitute a most important part of our system. The power of taxation is indispensable to their existence, and is a power which, in its own nature, is capable of residing in, and being exercised by, different authorities, at the same time. We are accustomed to see it placed, for different purposes, in different hands. Taxation is the simple operation of taking small portions from a perpetually accumulating mass, susceptible of almost infinite division; and a power in one to take what is necessary for certain purposes, is not, in its nature, incompatible with a power in another to take what is necessary for other purposes. Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes, &amp; c., to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence [sic] and general welfare of the United States. This does not interfere with the power of the States to tax for the support of their own governments; nor is the exercise of that power by the States, an exercise of any portion of the power that is granted to the United States. In imposing taxes for State purposes, they are not doing what Congress is empowered to do. Congress is not empowered to tax for those purposes which are within the exclusive province of the States. When, then, each government exercises the power of taxation, neither is exercising the power of the other. But, when a State proceeds to regulate commerce with foreign nations, or among the several States, it is exercising the very power that is granted to Congress, and is doing the very thing which Congress is authorized to do. There is no analogy, then, between the power of taxation and the power of regulating commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Gibbons v.
