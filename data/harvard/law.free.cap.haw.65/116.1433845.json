The court below held the statute to be overly broad in contravention of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The court below also, apparently, held the statute to be unconstitutional because it did not meet the tests laid down <em>in Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S. Ct. 2607, 37 L. Ed.2d 419 (1973), for obscenity. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">Both grounds upon which the court below relied were dealt with in depth by the Supreme Court of the United States on July 2,1982 <em>in New York v. Ferber, </em>No. 81-55, 50 U.S.L.W. 5077, which reversed a similar order entered in New York with respect to a similar statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>As to appellee\u2019s argument that the \u201cobscenity\u201d standards of <em>Miller, supra, </em>are applicable, the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Ferber, supra, </em>pointed out that the state\u2019s overriding interest in preventing child abuse makes the test of obscenity inapplicable in cases involving the distribution of material depicting children engaging in sexual conduct. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We turn then to the contention that the statute is \u201coverbroad.\u201d Section 707-751, HRS, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\"><em>Promoting child abuse in the second degree. </em>(1) A person commits the offense of promoting child abuse in the second degree if, knowing or having reason to know its character and content, the person disseminates any material which employs, uses, or otherwise contains a minor engaging in or assisting others to engage in sexual conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">(2) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">\u201cDisseminate\u201d means to publish, sell, distribute, transmit, exhibit, or present material or to offer or agree to do the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">\u201cMaterial\u201d means any printed matter, visual representation, or sound recording, and includes but is not limited to books, magazines, motion picture films, pamphlets, newspapers, pictures, photographs, and tape or wire recordings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">\u201cMinor\u201d means any person less than sixteen years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">\u201cSexual conduct\u201d means acts of masturbation, homosexuality, lesbianism, bestiality, sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, or sadomasochistic abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">\u201cSadomasochistic abuse\u201d means flagellation or torture by or upon a person as an act of sexual stimulation or gratification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-13\">(3) The fact that a person engaged in the conduct specified by this section is prima facie evidence that the person engaged in that conduct with knowledge of the character and content of the material. The fact that the person who was employed, used, or otherwise contained in the material was at that time, a minor, is prima facie evidence that the defendant knew the person to be a minor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-14\">(4) Promoting child abuse in the second degree is a class C felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">We note that the definition of \u201csexual conduct\u201d above is narrower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>than the New York statute in <em>Ferber, supra, </em>which forbad \u201csimulated\u201d sexual conduct and also \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals,\u201d neither of which are mentioned in Hawaii\u2019s statutory definition of \u201csexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AWh\"><em>Nathan Aipa (ArthurE. Ross </em>on the opening brief), Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A7-\"><em>Winston Mirikitani (Reinhard Mohr </em>with him on the brief, <em>Mirikitani, Alexander-Taylor </em>\u00a3s? <em>Mohr </em>of counsel) for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Under our statute, the material disseminated must employ, use or otherwise contain, a minor engaging in, or assisting others to engage in \u201csexual conduct.\u201d It thus applies, not to descriptions of minors engaging in \u201csexual conduct,\u201d but to material, such as the pictures which form State\u2019s Exhibit B in the record in this case, depicting minors actually engaging or assisting others to engage in \u201csexual conduct.\u201d Our statute, clearly, is no broader than that upheld as not being violative of the First Amendment by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Ferber.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">As to any claim of unconstitutionality under the Constitution of the State of Hawaii, w\u00e9 see no difference between the State and Federal Constitutions in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Accordingly, the order dismissing the indictment below is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
