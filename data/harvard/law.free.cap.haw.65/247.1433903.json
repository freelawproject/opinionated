The trial judge entered an order confirming the award over the objections of appellants, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>claimed that the arbitrator\u2019s award should be vacated under HRS \u00a7\u00a7 658-8 and 658-9. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This dispute arose out of lessees\u2019 (Appellants Harter and Chun) use of the commercial leasehold. Landlord (Appellee Coral Kingdom) claimed that the storefront used by lessees was not included in the lease, and instituted summary proceedings. These proceedings were stayed, pursuant to court order, pending arbitration because the lease provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">[i]f any dispute arises under this Agreement, the same shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time the dispute arises, and judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Landlord submitted a demand for arbitration in September, 1979.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The American Arbitration Association acknowledged receipt of landlord\u2019s demand to all parties, and enclosed a list of possible arbitrators and dates so that the parties could indicate their choices. Only the attorney for landlord responded to this request. The Association subsequently sent the attorneys for landlord and lessees a notice of prehearing, set for March 7, 1980, on January 16, 1980. The attorney for lessees denies having received such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Thus, on March 7,1980, the prehearing was attended by only the arbitrator and attorney for landlord. After waiting 20 minutes for lessees\u2019 attorney, the arbitrator phoned him, and was informed that the attorney had left for the day. The arbitrator left his name and phone number, then proceeded to hear landlord\u2019s statement of the case. The arbitrator sent lessees\u2019 attorney a notice of the scheduled hearing, set for March 14, 1980, on the first working day following the prehearing, March 10, 1980. Lessees\u2019 attorney, however, failed to receive the notice until March 13, 1980, and actually opened the letter after working hours, March 14,1980. The arbitrator received landlord\u2019s Verified Complaint (which included Exhhibit A, the lease agreement) and landlord\u2019s sworn testimony at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Despite the absence of respondents (lessees) and their attorney, the arbitrator concluded that the claimant had presented a prima facie case, and issued his decision and award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Lessees\u2019 attorney requested a rehearing the first working day following the hearing, claiming he did not receive notice of the hearing scheduled for March 14, 1980 until after the hearing was concluded because he was involved in a trial. The arbitrator and the Association denied the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Coral Kingdom subsequently moved the First Circuit Court for an order confirming the arbitration award. Lessees, through newly retained attorneys, moved to vacate the award under HRS \u00a7 658-9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Harter asserts error in that (1) the arbitrator decided a matter beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement and (2) inadequate notice and denial of the opportunity to be heard rendered the award void or, alternatively, failure to provide reasonable notice constituted misconduct. Chun asserts error in that (1) the arbitrator failed to postpone the hearing where sufficient cause was shown; (2) the arbitrator\u2019s conduct severely prejudiced Chun; and (3) the arbitrator imperfectly executed his powers by violating the notice requirements, in not considering reopening the hearing, and by communicating directly with an adverse party. The court confirmed the award. The lease provision regarding arbitration clearly provided that the dispute be settled <em>\u201cin accordance with the rules </em>of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aqx\"><em>Michael T. I. Kim </em>and <em>Glenn S. Takabuki (Hong, Sato &amp; Takabuki </em>of counsel) on the brief for appellants, J. C. Pacific Jewelry and Jeanie Chun.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Arbitration, as a quasi-judicial proceeding, includes notions of due process. The Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association thus requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">\u00a7 20. TIME AND PLACE \u2014 The Arbitrator shall fix the time and place of hearing. <em>The AAA shall mail to each party notice thereofat least five days in advance, </em>unless the parties by mutual agreement waive such notice or modify the terms thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">In this case, the Association did not mail the lessees notice of the hearing five days in advance, and the appellants did not waive that notice. The record shows that they were actually prejudiced by the lack of the five-day notice. The arbitrator, therefore, violated \u00a7 658-9(3), HRS, in refusing lessees a hearing after their failure to receive notice was called to his attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATIe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>Linda M.

Both Harter and Chun undertook to display merchandise in the common area fronting their stores and this was done without authority or right and without being willing to pay extra rent for such space as was offered by the landlord. The Arbitrator finds no legal basis for defendants\u2019 actions and rules that their continued use of the extra area after notice by the landlord to either cease its use or pay the stated rent amounted to an implied rental of such space as [sic] such rates. Based thereon, the Arbitrator orders:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(a) That Harter owes plaintiff back rent in the sum of $3750.00 representing rental at the rate of $375.00 per month from May 1,1979, to and through February 29, 1980, together with statutory attorney commissions and costs, and also that plaintiff has the right to have Harter cease and desist from further use of such extra space.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-10\">(b) That Chun owes plaintiff back rent in the sum of $4,480.00 representing rental at the rate of $448.00 per month from May 1,1979, to and through February 29, 1980, together with statutory attorney commissions and costs, and also that plaintiff has the right to have Chun cease and desist from further use of such extra space....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\"> \u00a7 658-9 <em>Vacating award. </em>In any of the following cases, the court may make an order vacating the award, upon the application of any party to the arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or.undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-13\">(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or any of them;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-14\">(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct, in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence, pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior, by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-15\">(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>them, that a mutual, final and definite award, upon the subject matter submitted, was not made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">Where an award is vacated and the time, within which the agreement required the award to be made, has not expired, the court may in its discretion direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.
