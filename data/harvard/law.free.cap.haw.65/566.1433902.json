(Bacchus, Paradise, Eagle, and McKesson respectively, the taxpayers collectively) challenge, on constitutional grounds, the levy of excise taxes on the sale or use of liquor pursuant to HRS \u00a7 244-4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They assert the statute in question runs afoul of the Equal Protection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Import-Export,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Commerce Clauses<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the United States Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Hawaii Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Though we have carefully scrutinized the statute with the cited constitutional provisions in mind, we discern no infirmities in HRS \u00a7 244-4. We therefore affirm the Tax Appeal Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The Hawaii Liquor Tax, HRS Chapter 244, imposes a levy on the sale or use of alcoholic beverages amounting to twenty percent of the wholesale price of the liquor sold or used, which essentially is an excise levied on the first sale of liquor within the State of Hawaii. <em>See </em>note 1 <em>supra. </em>At its inception, the tax was one imposed on retailers, and the amount of the levy was six percent of the retail price. S.L.H. 1939, c. 222, \u00a7 5. But its incidence has since been shifted to wholesalers and the rate has been raised to twenty percent of the wholesale price.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Limited exemptions from the tax have been approved periodically by the legislature; transactions involving okolehao<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>\u201c[a]ny fruit wine manufactured in the State from products grown in the State\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were thus free of taxation during the relevant period. This aspect of the Hawaii Liquor Tax has been challenged by the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Bacchus, Paradise,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and Eagle are Hawaii corporations licensed to engage in the wholesaling of liquor; McKesson is a Maryland corporation authorized to do business in Hawaii, also licensed as a wholesale liquor dealer under applicable liquor control laws. <em>See </em>HRS Chapter 281. Bacchus initially protested the assessment of excise taxes on its sale or use of alcoholic beverages by a letter directed to the State Director of Taxation on May 30, 1979. It subsequently filed a complaint pursuant to HRS \u00a7 40-35,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> seeking a refund of taxes paid during the period between December 1977 and May 1979. Paradise, Eagle, and McKesson quickly followed Bacchus\u2019 lead with their letters of protest to the Director and refund suits.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The taxpayers\u2019 complaints averred that HRS \u00a7 244-4 contravened the Import-Export and Commerce Clauses of the federal constitution because the statute discriminated in favor of locally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>produced liquor by providing exemptions for sales and uses of okolehao and fruit wine brewed in Hawaii from locally grown products. The cases were consolidated for trial and disposition by agreement of all the parties and submitted to the Tax Appeal Court for decision on Stipulations of Facts. The court ruled the tax is \u201ca valid State tax,\u201d and timely appeals to this court were filed by the taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Focusing on the allegations of unconstitutionality advanced by the taxpayers, we first consider their claim that the favored treatment of okolehao and locally produced fruit wine denies them equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">We recognize, of course, that the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause condition the exercise of a state\u2019s power of taxation. <em>Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania, </em>134 U.S. 232 (1890). Still, \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to compel the State to adopt an iron rule of equal taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237. For such a construction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5W\">would not only supersede all those constitutional provisions and laws of some of the States, whose object is to secure equality of taxation, and which are usually accompanied with qualifications deemed material; but it would render nugatory those discriminations which the best interests of society require; which are necessary for the encouragement of needed and useful industries, and the discouragement of intemperance and vice; and which every State, in one form or another, deems it expedient to adopt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-9\"><em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[i]t has ... been pointed out that in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.\u201d <em>Madden v. Kentucky, </em>309 U.S. 83, 88 (1940) (footnote omitted). And \u201c[t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">The legislative arrangement in question, the taxpayers claim, breaches the equal protection guaranty because of its favored treatment of transactions involving okolehao and pineapple wine. But the statute does not establish a classificatory scheme that disfavors any of the taxpayers \u2014 all wholesalers of liquor distributing aleo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>holic beverages in Hawaii are subject to taxation thereunder in similar fashion. Bacchus, Paradise, and Eagle enjoy no advantage over McKesson, a Maryland corporation, by reason of their incorporation under Hawaii law since their transactions are taxed at the same rate McKesson\u2019s are.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The taxpayers nonetheless contend <em>Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, </em>358 U.S. 522 (1959), and <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, </em>337 U.S. 562 (1949), sustain their thesis that the necessary equality of treatment is absent. To be sure, the cases support a proposition that a state tax expressly favoring residents over nonresidents does not pass constitutional muster. Yet we think the cited cases do not boost the taxpayers\u2019 cause here; they reinforce instead the validity of the Hawaii Liquor Tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">In <em>Wheeling Steel, </em>the Court struck down provisions of Ohio\u2019s ad valorem property tax law that discriminated against foreign corporations by taxing their accounts receivables arising from business transacted within the State but not the property of similar nature owned by residents and domestic corporations. The inequality to which the foreign corporations were subjected was premised solely on the residence of the owners of the accounts receivables.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And the Court did not consider the declared purpose of the statute to proffer a scheme of reciprocity in the taxation of such property to other states a redeeming feature. <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, </em>337 U.S. at 572-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>In Allied Stores, </em>Ohio\u2019s levy of an ad valorem property tax on the contents of warehouses was upheld despite an exemption of merchandise belonging to nonresidents and being held \u201c \u2018in a storage warehouse for storage only\u2019.\u201d The preferred status accorded merchandise owned by nonresidents, the Court held, did not deny Ohio residents equal protection; it found the purpose and policy of the State Legislature could reasonably have been to encourage nonresidents to construct or lease warehouses in Ohio and thereby benefit the State\u2019s economy. <em>Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, </em>358 U.S. at 528-29. Thus it concluded the questioned proviso was neither invidious nor palpably arbitrary, and ruled the statute did not deny equal protection to Ohio residents despite the discriminatory classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The cited cases therefore confirm that the Court does not countenance the unequal treatment of taxpayers based solely on state residence, <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. v. Glander, </em>337 U.S. at 572; but if the classification rests upon some reasonable consideration of difference or policy, there is no denial of equal protection. <em>Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, </em>358 U.S. at 527-28. On its face, the Hawaii law applies equally to all wholesalers; the taxpayers, however, assert the classification in question carries a discriminatory result. We thus proceed to an examination of the exemption from excise taxation of transactions involving okolehao and pineapple wine to determine whether the exemption is rationally related to the achievement of a valid legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">C,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">In deciding whether the challenged classification meets this test of rational relationship, we are compelled to answer two questions: \u201c(1) Does the challenged legislation have a legitimate purpose? and (2) Was it reasonable for the lawmakers to believe that use of the challenged classification would promote that purpose? See <em>Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S., at 461-463; <em>Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 97-98 (1979).\u201d <em>Western </em>&amp; <em>Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, </em>451 U.S. 648, 668 (1981). <em>Shibuya v. Architects Hawaii, Ltd., </em>65 Haw. 26, 35, 647 P.2d 276, 283 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">The legislature\u2019s reason for exempting \u201cti root okolehao\u201d from the \u201calcohol tax\u201d was to \u201cencourage and promote the establishment of a new industry,\u201d S.L.H. 1960, c. 26; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 87, in 1960 Senate Journal, at 224, and the exemption of \u201cfruit wine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>manufactured in the State from products grown in the State\u201d was intended \u201cto help\u201d in stimulating \u201cthe local fruit wine industry.\u201d S.L.H. 1976, c. 39; Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 408-76, in 1976 Senate Journal, at 1056.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> No one could quarrel with the proposition that the promotion of domestic industry is a legitimate state purpose. <em>See Western </em>&amp; <em>Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, </em>451 U.S. at <em>671; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., </em>397 U.S. 137, 143 (1970); <em>Parker v. Brown, </em>317 U.S. 341, 363-67 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">We likewise entertain no doubt that the classification satisfies the second part of the applicable test, for the pertinent inquiry here is only whether the \u201cLegislature <em>rationally could have believed </em>that the. . . [classification] would promote its objective.\u201d <em>Western </em>&amp; <em>Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, </em>451 U.S. at 672 (citations omitted) (emphasis in the original). The lawmakers are under no obligation \u201cto convince the courts of the correctness of their legislative judgments. Rather, \u2018those challenging the legislative judgment must convince the court that the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based could not reasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental decisionmaker.\u2019 <em>Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S., at 111.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. at 464. The taxpayers have not met their burden in this regard. The legislature could rationally have believed the exemption would promote its objective, and nothing has been presented to controvert this.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The taxpayers\u2019 equal protection claim also encompasses a putative breach of the State counterpart of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Compare </em>U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1 and Hawaii Const, art. 1, \u00a7 5. In passing on an earlier taxpayer challenge of our tax laws premised on an alleged violation of the foregoing State constitutional provision, we structured our analysis on Supreme Court precedent, particularly <em>Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., </em>410 U.S. 356, 359 (1973). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number><em>See In re Simpson Manor, Inc., </em>57 Haw. 1, 548 P.2d 246 (1976). And <em>Lehnhausen </em>was quoted to the following effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u2018 \u201c[I]n taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.\u201d. .. \u201cThe burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative <em>every conceivable basis </em>which might support it.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMy\"><em>id. </em>at 8-9, 548 P.2d at 251 (citation omitted) (emphasis in the original). The claim there was rejected because the taxpayer had \u201cfailed to meet its burden\u201d; we perceive no reason to regard the present challenge more favorably. <em>Id. </em>The taxpayers have not even attempted to negative the declared basis for enacting the exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Having found no denial of equal protection, we turn to the assertion that the Hawaii Liquor Tax contravenes the Import-Export Clause of the federal constitution. The taxpayers contend that HRS \u00a7 244-4 is discriminatory on its face and thus violative of the clause because of the exemption of transactions involving locally produced okolehao and fruit wine. They further assert the excise tax is actually a prohibited import duty since it is levied on wholesale value, which in the case of liquor of foreign origin perforce includes the amount of the duty levied by the federal government and transportation costs. This, they maintain, results in a disproportionate State levy on liquor of foreign origin. They also claim the rate at which the tax is applied deters the consumption of such liquor and indirectly deprives the federal government of revenue. The precepts enunciated in <em>Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, </em>423 U.S. 276 (1976), and ratified by <em>Washington Revenue Department v. Stevedoring Association, </em>435 U.S. 734 (1978), in the taxpayers\u2019 view, proscribe the imposition of the tax. We do not read the Import-Export Clause and <em>Michelin </em>to have such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">The Import-Export Clause commits \u201csole power to lay imposts and duties on imports in the Federal Government, with no concurrent state power.\u201d <em>Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, </em>423 U.S. at 285. But \u201cthe term \u2018Impost or Duty\u2019 is not self-defining and does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>necessarily encompass all taxes.\u201d <em>Washington Revenue Department v. Stevedoring Association, </em>435 U.S. at 759. The foregoing cases give us examples of what is not encompassed therein. In the former, the Court held Georgia\u2019s levy of a general ad valorem property tax on Michelin\u2019s inventory of imported tires and tubes stored in a Georgia warehouse was not interdicted by the Import-Export Clause. <em>Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, </em>423 U.S. at 302. And in <em>Washington Revenue Department, </em>the application of Washington\u2019s business and occupation tax to stevedoring was approved, even though it reached services provided within the State \u201cto imports, exports, and other goods.\u201d <em>Washington Revenue Department v. Stevedoring Association, </em>435 U.S. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In reaching these decisions, the Court \u201cexamined whether the exaction offended any of the three policy considerations leading to the presence of the Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u2018The Framers of the Constitution thus sought to alleviate three main concerns ... : the Federal Government must speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments, and tariffs, which might affect foreign relations, could not be implemented by the States consistently with that exclusive power; import revenues were to. be the major source of revenue of the Federal Government and should not be diverted to the States; and harmony among the States might be disturbed unless seaboard States, with their crucial ports of entry, were prohibited from levying taxes on citizens of other States by taxing goods merely flowing through their ports to the other States not situated as favorably geographically.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\"><em>Washington Revenue Department v. Stevedoring Association, </em>435 U.S. at 752-53 (quoting <em>Michelin Tire Co. v. Wages, </em>423 U.S. at 285-86) (footnotes omitted). Our task then is to scrutinize HRS \u00a7 244-4 in the light of the concerns that, in the Court\u2019s opinion, explain the presence of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">HRS \u00a7 244-4 provides that \u201c[e]very person who sells or uses any liquor . .. [not previously taxed thereunder] shall pay an excise tax ... equal to twenty per cent of the wholesale price of the liquor so sold or used.\u201d As the tax is usually imposed on the person who engages in the first sale or use of liquor in the State and is measured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>by wholesale value, it is in effect an excise levied on wholesalers. In this sense, it resembles the Washington business and occupation tax that was deemed a permitted tax, rather than a prohibited import duty, by the Court. The taxpayers, however, claim an objectionable feature, the exemption of okolehao and fruit wine, causes it to transgress the first two policy considerations underlying the Import-Export Clause. We do not find their argument convincing, for like the Georgia property tax and the Washington business and occupation tax, the Hawaii Liquor Tax offends none of the policy considerations delineated by the Court in <em>Michelin </em>and <em>Washington Revenue Department.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Hawaii\u2019s tax on wholesaling activity applies to all liquor wholesalers engaged in business in the State. It touches all local sales and uses of liquor produced in foreign countries, in the mainland States, and in Hawaii, with the exception of okolehao and pineapple wine.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> There is absolutely no indication that it has been applied selectively to discourage imports in a manner inconsistent with foreign policy. Nor is there a scintilla of evidence that it has the effect of a protective tariff or that it has any substantial indirect effect on the demand for imported liquor. And no reason whatsoever to consider the limited exemption a threat to the federal treasury appears.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Michelin </em>and <em>Washington Revenue Department </em>thus sustain a conclusion that the tax in question is not a prohibited import duty. <em>See </em>note 14 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Though we have concluded the Hawaii Liquor Tax infringes neither the Equal Protection Clause nor the Import-Export Clause, whether it \u201cfalls short of the substantially even-handed treatment demanded by the Commerce Clause\u201d remains for decision. <em>Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission, </em>429 U.S. 318, 332 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">\u201cIn reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes.. . [the Court\u2019s objective] has . . . been to \u2018establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry\u2019 focusing on \u2018the practical effect of a challenged tax.\u2019 <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. 425, 443 (1980).\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, </em>453 U.S. 609, 615 (1981). The method of inquiry presently favored by the Court is the four-part test described in <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, </em>430 U.S. 274 (1977). \u201cUnder that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it \u2018is applied to an activity with a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.\u2019 430 U.S., at 279.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, </em>453 U.S. at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The taxpayers do not dispute that the Hawaii Liquor Tax satisfies the first and fourth prongs of the test, for the activity subject to taxation is the wholesaling of liquor in Hawaii and the revenues derived are for the support of general governmental services. The tax is challenged on grounds that it does not meet the test\u2019s second and third requisites, <em>i.e., </em>it is discriminatory and not fairly apportioned. But we are also unable to perceive any basis to seriously consider the taxpayers\u2019 assertion that the tax is not fairly apportioned since they agree it is assessed only on intrastate sales and uses of liquor. It has no extraterritorial effect and the State does not seek thereby to obtain a share of a taxpayer\u2019s net income derived from an interstate enterprise. Nor is there a possibility that it will subject \u201cinterstate business to a burden of duplicative taxation that an intrastate taxpayer would not bear.\u201d <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, </em>445 U.S. at 443. No issue related to fair apportionment is extant, and our examination of the tax centers on whether it discriminates against interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In our analysis of the equal protection claim, we discerned no disparate treatment of taxpayers. For Bacchus, Paradise, and Eagle gain nothing over a foreign corporation because of their incorporation under Hawaii law. That McKesson is a Maryland corporation and engaged in business elsewhere plays no part in fixing its liability under HRS \u00a7 244-4. The corporation presumably is also free to engage in the wholesaling of okolehao and pineapple wine if it has reason to believe this will relieve its tax burden.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We detect no discrimination against Bacchus, Paradise, Eagle, McKesson, or interstate commerce under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The taxpayers nonetheless <em>argue Maryland v. Louisiana, </em>451 U.S. 725 (1981), and its precursors preclude the validation of HRS \u00a7 244-4. <em>Maryland </em>was an original action brought in the Supreme Court by several states and the federal government, challenging the Louisiana First-Use Tax on natural gas on grounds that it contravened the Supremacy and Commerce Clauses. We are, of course, mindful of the following precepts of \u201cCommerce Clause jurisprudence\u201d that were reiterated by the Court there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">One of the fundamental principles of Commerce Clause jurisprudence is that no State, consistent with the Commerce Clause, may \u2018impose a tax which discriminates against interstate commerce ... by providing a direct commercial advantage to local business.\u2019 <em>Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, </em>358 U.S. 450, 458 (1959). See <em>Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>429 U.S. 318, 329 (1977). This antidiscrimination principle \u2018follows inexorably from the basic purpose of the Clause\u2019 to prohibit the multiplication of preferential trade areas destructive of the free commerce anticipated by the Constitution. <em>Boston Stock Exchange, supra. </em>See <em>Dean Milk Co. v. [City of] Madison, </em>340 U.S. 349, 356 (1951).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 754, and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">A state tax must be assessed in light of its actual effect considered in conjunction with other provisions of the State\u2019s tax scheme. \u2018In each case it is our duty to determine whether the statute under attack, whatever its name may be, will in its practical operation work discrimination against interstate commerce.\u2019 <em>Best &amp; Co. v. Maxwell, </em>311 U.S. 454, 455-456 (1940). See <em>Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v. Reily, </em>373 U.S. 64, 69 (1963); <em>Gregg Dyeing Co. v. Query, </em>286 U.S. 472, 478-480 (1932). In this case, the Louisiana First-Use Tax unquestionably discriminates against interstate commerce in favor of local interests as the necessary result of various tax credits and exclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">Yet, Hawaii\u2019s excise on intrastate sales and uses of liquor can hardly be likened to Louisiana\u2019s tax on the \u201cfirst-use\u201d of any natural gas brought into the state without being taxed previously by another state or the federal government. The primary impact of that levy was. on gas produced in the Outer Continental Shelf and piped to processing plants in Louisiana. Some of this gas was sold to Louisiana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>consumers, but most of it was eventually sold to out-of-state consumers. Louisiana consumers for the most part were not burdened with the levy due to exemptions and credits provided by State law, but the tax applied uniformly to gas moving out of the state. <em>Id. </em>at 731-33. The Court found the \u201cFirst-Use Tax, while imposed on the pipeline companies,.... [was] clearly intended to be passed on to the ultimate consumer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736. And it struck down a scheme of taxation that \u201cresulted in Louisiana customers being \u2018protected in whole or in part from the incidence of the tax which is passed on to consumers out of the State.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758. Unlike the situation in <em>Maryland v. Louisiana, supra, </em>the incidence of the tax here is on wholesalers of liquor in Hawaii and the ultimate burden is borne by consumers in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Nor can HRS \u00a7 244-4 be equated with the New York statute imposing a transfer tax on securities transactions which was invalidated by the Court in <em>Boston Stock Exchange v.

Reily, supra, </em>where the taxpayer was engaged in servicing oil wells in Louisiana and several other oil-producing states and the specialized servicing equipment it had assembled in Oklahoma and used in its Louisiana operation was subjected to use taxation by Louisiana, which applied the tax to the value of labor expended and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>shop overhead incurred in assembling the equipment. The State conceded this cost factor would not have been subject to taxation if the taxpayer had assembled the equipment in Louisiana rather than in Oklahoma. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court logically concluded a condition precedent for a valid state tax, the even-handed treatment of in-state and out-of-state taxpayers, had not been met. <em>Id. </em>at 70.

As a general tax applicable to all property in the State, it could not have been used to create special protective tariffs and could not have been applied selectively to encourage or discourage importation in a manner inconsistent with federal policy. Further, the tax deprived the Federal Government of no revenues to which it was entitled. The exaction merely paid for services, such as fire and police protection, supplied by the local government. Although the tax would increase the cost of the imports to consumers, its effect on the demand for Michelin tubes and tires was insubstantial. The tax, therefore, would not significantly diminish the number of imports on which the Federal Government could levy import duties and would not deprive it of income indirectly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Washington Revenue Department v. Stevedoring Association, 435 U.S. at 753 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">And its relevant conclusions with respect to the Washington tax were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">A similar approach demonstrates that the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring threatens no Import-Export Clause policy. First, the tax does not restrain the ability of the Federal Government to conduct foreign policy. As a general business tax that applies to virtually all businesses in the State, it has not created any special protective tariff. The assessments in this case are only upon business conducted entirely within Washington. No foreign business or vessel is taxed. Respondents, therefore, have demonstrated no impediment posed by the tax upon the regulation of foreign trade by the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">Second, the effect of the Washington tax on federal import revenues is identical to the effect in <em>Michelin. </em>The tax merely compensates the Stale for services and protection extended by Washington to the stevedoring business. Any indirect effect on the demand for imported goods because of the tax on the value of loading and unloading them from their ships is even less substantial than the effect of the direct ad valorem property tax on the imported goods themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACxj\"><em>Id. </em>at 754.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b594-12\"> Okolehao and pineapple wine are not the only alcoholic beverages produced in Hawaii.

First, transactions by nonresidents of New York are afforded a 50% reduction (\u2018nonresident reduction\u2019) in the rate of tax when the transaction involves an in-state sale. Taxable transactions by residents (regardless of where the sale is made) and by nonresidents selling outside the State do not benefit from the rate decrease. Second, \u00a7 270-a limits the total tax liability of any taxpayer (resident or nonresident) to $350 (maximum tax) for a single transaction when it involves a New York sale. If a sale is made out-of-State, the \u00a7 270 tax rate applies to an in-state transfer (or other taxable event) without limitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Boston Stock Exchange v.
