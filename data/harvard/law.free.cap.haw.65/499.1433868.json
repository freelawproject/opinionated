Appellant AMFAC, INC. (taxpayer) argues that these questions must be an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>swered in the affirmative in view of the paramount objective of our real property tax law to tax property according to its fair market value. Conversely, the director argues, and the tax appeal court agreed, that exclusive application of the replacement cost method is mandated by HRS \u00a7 246-10(g) (1976). We interpret the relevant statutory language to permit the utilization of any method of valuation which would contribute to the determination of the fair market value of structures, but also find that the director\u2019s failure to consider all available methods does not necessarily provide the basis for an adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">In this action taxpayer AMFAC contests real property tax assessments made against the structures known.as the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel and Holiday Isle. Hotel for the tax year 1975-1976. These assessments were affirmed in actions before the Board of Review of the first taxation district, and the cases were subsequently consolidated in the tax appeal court where a separate trial was had on the legal issues relating to the method of valuation employed by the director.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court rendered a decision affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the director\u2019s exclusive consideration and use of the replacement cost method of valuation in determining the fair market value of the buildings. It supported this finding with the conclusion that the director was statutorily bound to the exclusive use of this method. Taxpayer now alleges that the tax appeal court erred in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Under HRS ch. 246 (1976), the statute applicable to this action,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> responsibility for the valuation and assessment of property for the purposes of real property taxation rested with the state director of taxation. Section 246-10, HRS (1976) required the director to determine annually <em>\u201cthefair market value </em>of all taxable real property\u201d (emphasis added) for the purposes of levying such taxes with buildings to be valued separately from all other real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">As to the methods to be utilized in making these valuations, the statute\u2019s initial mandate was simply that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">All property shall be valued by appropriate systematic methods so selected and applied as to obtain, as far as possible, uniform and equalized assessments throughout the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">HRS \u00a7 246-10(b). It subsequently provided that in valuing land, other than land classified and used for agriculture, consideration was to be given to an extensive number of enumerated factors, including \u201cselling prices and income.\u201d HRS \u00a7 246-10(f)(l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>respect to valuing buildings, it provided merely that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">(g) Buildings shall be valued each year upon the basis of the cost of replacement less depreciation, if any. Age, condition and utility or obsolescence shall be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">HRS \u00a7 246-10(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The director contends that the proper interpretation of subsection 246-10(g) is to mandate the exclusive application of the replacement cost method of valuing buildings so that he is entirely without discretion to consider or utilize alternative modes of valuation. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">The \u201cultimate purpose of valuation, whether in eminent domain or tax ... proceedings is to arrive at a fair and realistic value of the property involved.\u201d <em>Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Kiernan, </em>42 N.Y.2d 236, 242, 397 N.Y.S.2d 718, 723, 366 N.E.2d 808 (1977). Our statutory scheme of real property taxation adopts this principle by identifying \u201cfair market value\u201d as the relevant measure of the value of property. And we have previously defined \u201cmarket value\u201d as \u201cthe value in money of any property for which that property would sell on the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer.\u201d <em>In re Puna Sugar Co., </em>56 Haw. 621, 624, 547 P.2d 2, 4 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">In determining fair market value, thus understood, the replacement cost method has been viewed by some to be the least favored means of valuation, <em>see, e.g., Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Co. v. Kiernan, supra; Chrysler Corp. v. State Property Tax Appeal Board, </em>69 Ill. App.3d 207, 387 N.E.2d 351 (1979), and has in fact been completely eliminated as a valid consideration in valuation by at least one jurisdiction. <em>In re Johnstown Assoc., </em>431 A.2d 932 (Pa. 1981). This is because the results of the method \u201crarely, if ever would determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the value at a public sale\u201d insofar as it fails to take into account, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">the particular property; the character of the work done and materials furnished in the construction of the building; its present condition of repair or disrepair; the wisdom or unwisdom of its location . . .; its modernity and adaptability to [its] purpose; the likelihood of competition with other and better buildings; and whether the property itself and the neighborhood in which it is situated are likely to increase or decrease in value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\"><em>Appeal of Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>161 A. 303, 304 (Pa. 1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Nevertheless, under the director\u2019s position the ascertainment of fair market value with respect to buildings would be limited to that amount which is yielded by the replacement cost method of valuation, regardless of the degree to which that figure reflects the realities of the marketplace. The director argues that this result was intended by the legislature in order to \u201cfurther assure that a uniform and equal assessment shall be achieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The legislature however appears to have been desirous of accommodating the above mentioned limitations in the replacement cost method by also requiring that in the valuation of buildings \u201c[a]ge, condition and utility or obsolescence shall be considered.\u201d In the absence of specificity as to the methods by which these factors are to be taken into account, we conclude that by this language the legislature intended that the director be permitted to consider and potentially utilize any means which most appropriately reflect consideration of these factors. These would include alternative modes of valuing buildings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>For to hold otherwise would mean that in determining the fair market value of a structure the director would be required to ignore a contemporaneous arms length sale of the property \u2014 \u201cthe best evidence of true value.\u201d <em>Conalco Inc. v. Monroe County Bd. of Revision, </em>50 Ohio St. 2d 129, 363 N.E.2d 722, 723 (1977). And, as in this case, he would be required to ignore figures produced by the capitalization of income, arguably \u201can acceptable and, in the absence of market data, a preferred method of valuing rental property for property tax purposes.\u201d <em>G.R.F. Inc. v. Bd. of Assessors of City of Nassau, </em>41 N.Y.2d 512, 513, 362 N.E.2d 597, 598 (1977). We cannot believe that the legislature, in the interests of uniformity, could have intended to categorically prohibit the consideration of such indications of a building\u2019s condition and utility. We therefore conclude that the director may properly utilize them in determining fair market value as part of his consideration of the enumerated factors found in section 246-10(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">We turn next to the question whether the director\u2019s failure to consider alternative means of valuation necessarily constitutes the basis for an adjustment of an assessment. In this regard, HRS \u00a7 232-3(2) (1976) provides that no assessment shall be lowered on appeal unless there is shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">(2) Lack of uniformity or inequality, brought about by illegality of the methods used or error in the application of the methods to the property involved,. . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Taxpayer contends that the director\u2019s failure to consider and utilize alternative methods of valuation necessarily constitutes such an \u201cillegality of methods.\u201d While we agree that this may be demonstrated to be the case in some circumstances, we do not find this to be so as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">In our discussion above we found that pursuant to HRS \u00a7 246-10(g) the replacement cost method of valuation has been identified as the primary means of valuation of buildings, but that other methods of valuation may be utilized pursuant to the director\u2019s duty to consider a structure\u2019s \u201cage, condition, utility or obsolescence.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The legality of the use of the replacement cost method to the exclusion of all others will therefore turn on whether the director\u2019s actions constituted a failure to accommodate these delineated factors. Thus, if it can be demonstrated that the enumerated factors are not accurately reflected in the valuation resulting from the principal method\u2019s application and that consideration or utilization of the results of other methods would better reflect these factors, then the method applied could indeed be determined to be \u201cillegal\u201d since it failed to accommodate the legislature\u2019s requirements. The burden of demonstrating such illegality would of course fall upon the taxpayer and any evidence relevant to such proof would be admissible.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AAN\"><em>C.
