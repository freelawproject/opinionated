We chose to review this ruling because of the discrepancy between the appellate court\u2019s reading of HRS \u00a7\u00a7 386-89(c) and 386-54<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Director\u2019s implementation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the same provisions. Having reviewed the record and the pertinent statutory provisions, we set aside the decision of the appellate court and affirm the decision of the Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The claimant sustained an injury to his low back on April 9,1974 while shoveling rock and soil at the Kukui Plaza construction site in the course of his employment with Employer-appellant Swinerton and Walberg Co. (Swinerton). The formal filing of a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits by Treloar was obviated by the acknowledgment of liability for the work injury by Swinerton\u2019s insurance carrier, Insurance carrier-appellant Industrial Indemnity Co. (Industrial). Subsequently, however, Industrial questioned the duration of claimant\u2019s temporary total disability for work. And at a hearing conducted on January 25,1975 by a hearings officer of the Disability Compensation Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, it was determined that the claimant had suffered a compensable work injury, he became totally disabled for work from April 9, 1974, and he continued to be so disabled at the time of the hearing. A decision and order reflecting the foregoing findings and reciting the claimant\u2019s entitlement to the benefits provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law was issued by the Director on March 25, 1975. The employer was further directed to pay claimant weekly compensation for temporary total disability from April 10,1974 until \u201csuch time as is determined by the Director that such disability has ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">A hearing to determine permanent disability was conducted on November 17, 1975. In the course thereof it was agreed among claimant, Industrial\u2019s representative, and the hearings officer that the claimant\u2019s temporary total disability had come to an end on July 31,1975. On the basis of medical evidence in the form of physicians\u2019 reports and other evidence, the hearings officer found the claimant was permanently and partially disabled as a result of his work injury and the extent of his disability was twenty-five percent of the whole man. A decision and order reflecting the foregoing findings was issued by the Director on November 21,1975. It further recited the claimant\u2019s entitlement to periodic benefit payments for seventy-eight weeks commencing August 1, 1975, on account of the perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>nent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The claimant, however, immediately sought the Director\u2019s approval of a commutation of the then unpaid periodic benefit payments into a lump sum pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-54. The application, also filed on November 21, 1975, was submitted on a form, WC-12, specifically prepared by the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations to facilitate the administration of the provisions of HRS \u00a7 386-54. The commutation request was approved on the same day, and on November 24, 1975, Treloar received $6,679.49 in a single payment in lieu of $7,023.22 that otherwise would have been paid through weekly payments of $112.50 extending over a period of sixty-two weeks. The application denoted the claimant\u2019s understanding that he would \u201cnot be able to reopen this case for the period of commutation.\u201d The order approving commutation expressly provided that \u201c[p]ayment of the [lump] sum . . . [would] relieve the employer of his liability to pay future periodic payments totalling $7,023.22.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Approximately two years later Treloar, who then resided on the mainland, sought a reopening of the compensation case on the ground of a change in his physical condition, submitting a written opinion from a physician that a change had probably occurred. The request to reopen the case pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) was granted, and a hearing was conducted on June 5,1978 \u201cto determine further liability and other issues as appropriate.\u201d Treloar, appearing through counsel, submitted an affidavit attesting his inability to engage in gainful labor and other documentary evidence in support of the claim that his physical condition had worsened to a point of total disability. After reviewing the foregoing evidence and other ' medical reports, the hearings officer found the claimant had again become totally disabled for work on December 2, 1977. And by order of the Director issued on August 15, 1978, Swinerton was directed to pay Treloar \u201cweekly compensation of $112.50 for total disability for work from December 2, 1977 and terminating at such time .. . that such disability has ended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Swinerton and Industrial appealed the decision to the Board, where the case was submitted for decision primarily on the record made below and memoranda filed by the parties. The \u201cbasic questions\u201d posed for Board determination, as stated by counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Swinerton and Industrial in his memorandum, were \u201cwhether Claimant claimed and showed his current PPD (permanent partial disability) is in excess of the 25% of the whole man awarded in 1975 and makes him totally disabled, and whether the same was caused by the industrial accident.\u201d Counsel argued Treloar had failed to sustain his burden in both respects.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the Board concluded otherwise, and affirmed the Director\u2019s decision and order of August 15, 1978. A further appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On this appeal, Swinerton and Industrial raised two new arguments: that HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) prevented the reopening of Treloar\u2019s claim because the prior award of permanent partial disability benefits had been commuted to a single payment and discharged pursuant to HRS \u00a7 386-54 and that the decision of the Appeals Board was invalid because it had been rendered without the participation of the Board\u2019s chairman.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The appellate court reversed the Appeals Board, finding it \u201cundisputed in the record that the employer\u2019s liability for compensation had been discharged by payment of a lump sum in accordance with \u00a7 386-54.\u201d <em>Treloar v. Swinerton </em>&amp; <em>Walberg Co., </em>3 Haw. App. 41, 42, 641 P.2d 327, 327 (1982). The court concluded the prior commutation of the award was \u201cdispositive of this appeal since the last sentence of \u00a7 386-89(c), HRS, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">This subsection shall not apply when the employer\u2019s liability for compensation has been discharged in whole by the payment of a lump sum in accordance with section 386-54.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 41, 641 P.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">\u201c[0]ur primary duty [in interpreting and applying statutes] is to ascertain the intention of the legislature and to implement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>intention to the fullest degree. <em>Keller v. Thompson, </em>56 Haw. 183, 189, 532 P.2d 664, 669 (1975).\u201d <em>Black Construction Co. v. Agsalud, </em>64 Haw. 274, 283, 639 P.2d 1088, 1094 (1982). Legislative intent, we have recognized, \u201cis to be obtained primarily from the language used in a statute.\u201d <em>In re Castro, </em>44 Haw. 455, 458, 355 P.2d 46, 49 (1960). <em>See also In re Hawaiian Telephone Co., </em>61 Haw. 572, 577, 608 P.2d 383, 387 (1980); <em>Territory v. Fasi, </em>40 Haw. 478, 484 (1954); <em>County of Kauai v. McGonagle, </em>33 Haw. 915, 920 (1936). \u201cBut we have rejected an approach to statutory construction which limits us to the words of a <em>statute,\u201d Dependents of Crawford v. Financial Plaza Contractors, </em>64 Haw. 415, 420, 643 P.2d 48, 52 (1982), for \u201c[w]hen aid to construction of the meaning of words, as used in the statute, is available, there certainly can be no \u2018rule of law\u2019 which forbids its use, however clear the words may appear on \u2018superficial examination.\u2019\u201d <em>Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group, </em>426 U.S. 1, 10 (1976) (quoting <em>United States v. American Trucking Associations, </em>310 U.S. 534, 543-44 (1940) (footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">With these precepts in mind, we begin our analysis by noting HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) must be read in tandem with HRS \u00a7 386-54 because the last sentence of the former stipulates that its provisions \u201cshall not apply when the employer\u2019s liability for compensation has been discharged in whole by the payment ofa lump sum in accordance with\u201d the latter. At first glance, the sentence may give an appearance of disallowing a reopening whenever an employer\u2019s obligation under a commuted award has been met. But an examination of the relevant provisions discloses that reopenings are proscribed only when an employer\u2019s liability for compensation has been <em>discharged in whole </em>in accord with \u00a7 386-54, which does not tell us exactly when this occurs. Hence, the pertinent statutory language is open to more than one interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Swinerton and Industrial naturally urge the adoption of the appellate court\u2019s view that the approved payment in a lump sum of the outstanding balance of the employer\u2019s liability for weekly income and indemnity benefits related to an existing condition constitutes a discharge in whole of its liability for compensation. Treloar asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the payment of a commuted award for permanent partial disability does not serve to discharge the liability in whole; in his view it only satisfies the employer\u2019s obligation in part, that part which was subjected to commutation. He purports to find support for this proposition in the language of \u00a7 386-54 to the effect that such payment discharges liability \u201cfor the corresponding income and indemnity benefits.\u201d Thus he claims HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) does not preclude the reopening of a case thereafter if a change in physical condition or a mistake in fact related thereto can be demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">We turn in our quest for intended meaning to an obvious extrinsic aid to construction, the legislative history of HRS \u00a7 386-89(c). <em>See Dependents of Crawford v. Financial Plaza Contractors, supra, </em>64 Haw. at 421-23, 643 P.2d at 52-53; <em>In re Estate of Spencer, </em>60 Haw. 497, 501, 591 P.2d 611, 614 (1979). We learn therefrom that the last sentence of the relevant section, then R.L.H. 1955, as amended, \u00a7 97-98, formerly read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">This paragraph shall not apply when the employer\u2019s liability for compensation has been discharged in whole <em>or in part </em>by the payment of a lump sum in accordance with the provisions of section 97-53.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">(Emphasis added). But in 1965, the words \u201cor in part\u201d were stricken in order to \u201celiminate the unfair consequences of the present language by making it clear that a partial commutation would not preclude a future reopening, if warranted.\u201d Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 866, in 1965 House Journal, at 761. The legislative committee reports on the relevant measure, S. B. No. 762, are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Not surprisingly, the opposing parties both cite the committee reports as enhancing their positions. For we cannot say the assertions of Swinerton and Industrial in this regard are entirely without substance; the House report contains language that can be read as supporting reopenings only where \u201cthe employee continues to receive periodic payments\u201d after the commuted sum has been paid. Yet we would have to agree with claimant that the tenor of the legislative reports and the particular expressions of intent lend greater support to his position. It would be difficult, for example, to disregard legislative sentiment to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">If he has completely \u201clump summed\u201d out and gotten everything he was entitled to, then it would only be fair to bar him from reopening his claim. But if he only received a partial commu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>tation, for instance to fix a leaking roof, it would be grossly unfair to thereafter bar him from ever reopening his case no matter how meritorious a reopening might be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 866, <em>supra. </em>That reopenings are precluded only where an injured worker\u2019s claim for periodic benefits has been \u201ccompletely \u2018lump summed\u2019 out and [he has] gotten everything he was entitled to\u201d would consequently be a fair construction of the sentence in question. But as the relevant history is not entirely free of ambiguity, we do not rest this conclusion on our reading of the committee reports alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">In a previous search for statutory meaning, we observed there</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">is a well established rule of statutory construction that, where an administrative agency is charged with the responsibility of carrying out the mandate of a statute which contains words of broad and indefinite meaning, courts accord persuasive weight to administrative construction and follow the same, unless the construction is palpably erroneous. <em>Estrin v. Moss, </em>221 Tenn. 657, 430 S.W.2d 345 (1968); <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1 (1965); <em>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, </em>288 U.S. 294 (1933).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\"><em>Waikiki Resort Hotel v. City County, </em>63 Haw. 222, 242-43, 624 P.2d 1353, 1368 (1981). We further found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-11\">that administrative practice, consistent and generally unchallenged, will not be overturned except for very cogent reasons if the scope of the command is indefinite and doubtful. . .. The practice has peculiar weight when it involves a contemporaneous construction of a statute by the men charged with the responsibility of setting its machinery in motion, of making the parts work efficiently and smoothly while they are yet untried and new.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AW0\"><em>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. v. United States, supra, </em>288 U.S. at 315 (citations omitted) (quoted in <em>Waikiki Resort Hotel v. City &amp; County, supra, </em>63 Haw. at 243, 624 P.2d at 1368).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (the department) is charged with the responsibility of carrying out the mandate of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. Under the department\u2019s construction of HRS \u00a7 386-54, the payment of a commuted sum for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>permanent partial disability only relieves the employer of liability for periodic benefits during a given period, the period it would have been obliged to make payments had the commutation not been allowed. And the injured worker is precluded from seeking such benefits for the same period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No discharge in whole of the employer\u2019s compensation liability is deemed to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We do not find the foregoing administrative construction, which is reflected in the Director\u2019s ruling on Treloar\u2019s request to reopen his case after the passage of two years and in the practice form expressly developed by the department for the processing of such requests, to be palpably erroneous. To the contrary, we find there is much to recommend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The construction is consistent with the beneficent and liberal purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. \u201c[S]ince <em>Re Ichijiro Ikoma, </em>23 Haw. 291, 295, 296 (1916), the first case in which this court addressed Hawaii\u2019s then-new workers\u2019 compensation statute, we have considered questions of construing that law with firm recognition of the humanitarian purpose for which it was enacted.\u201d <em>Dependents of Crawford v. Financial Plaza Contractors, supra, </em>64 Haw. at 421, 643 P.2d at 52. <em>See e.g., Lawhead v. United Airlines, </em>59 Haw. 551, 559-60,584 P.2d 119, <em>124-25 (1978); De Fries v. Association of Owners, </em>57 Haw. 296, 303-04, 555 P.2d 855, 860 (1976); <em>Kepa v. Hawaii Welding Co., </em>56 Haw. 544, 549, 545 P.2d 687, 691 (1976); <em>Akamine v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Hawaiian Packing &amp; Crating Co., </em>53 Haw. 406, 409, 495 P.2d 1164, 1166 (1972). We should expect no less of the administrative agency charged with the direct responsibility of carrying out its mandate. Furthermore, the Director\u2019s application of HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) is consonant with the legislative intent to \u201celiminate the unfair consequences\u201d of foreclosing reopenings after partial commutations. Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 866, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We earlier said a fair construction of the last sentence of HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) would only prevent a reopening when an injured worker\u2019s claim for periodic benefits has been \u201ccompletely \u2018lump summed\u2019 out,\u201d but did not state when such event might occur. We would say a dear instance where \u201cthe employer\u2019s liability for compensation has been discharged in whole by the payment of a lump sum\u201d would be a case in which a commutation of a permanent total disability award has been effected. For then, the commutation document would denote the claimant had received \u201ceverything he was entitled to\u201d in periodic benefit payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">But in Treloar\u2019s case, both he and Industrial were mindful that the lump sum was in lieu of benefit payments covering a period of sixty-two weeks and that a reopening was precluded for the same period. The document reflecting the transaction did not indicate in any way that he was receiving everything he was entitled to; it implicitly sanctioned a possible reopening of the case for the payment of further benefits after the \u201cperiod of commutation.\u201d He was not \u201ccompletely \u2018lump summed\u2019 out,\u201d and the employer\u2019s liability for compensation was not \u201cdischarged in whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is reversed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From our review of the record, we also conclude there was sufficient evidence of a change in condition to sustain a reopening.

Payment of such lump sums discharges the employer of his liability for the corresponding income and indemnity benefits, that is for a partial payment, the liability is only discharged <em>pro tanto. </em>Oftentimes it happens that an injured employee needs a lump sum for an emergency, such as reroofing his house to keep the rain out, and the director approves this and the employee continues to receive periodic payments, sometimes for a substantial balance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">The present effect of the language in Section 97-98, last sentence, however, is to bar an employee from ever reopening his claim on a showing of change in, or a mistake in a determination of fact related to, the physical condition of the injured employee, if he has ever received any partial lump sum payment, no matter how small. If he has completely \u201clump summed\u201d out and gotten everything he was entitled to, then it would only be fair to bar him from reopening his claim. But if he only received a partial commutation, for instance to fix a leaking roof, it would be grossly unfair to thereafter bar him from ever reopening his case no matter how meritorious a reopening might be. It is believed the drafters of the present language did not intend this effect. The proposed bill would eliminate the unfair consequences of the present language by making it clear that a partial commutation would not preclude a future reopening, if warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Hse. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 866, supra, at 761 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b441-7\"> As noted earlier, the department has developed a practice and procedure form, designated as WC-12, to facilitate the administration of HRS \u00a7 386-54. That portion of the form covering a claimant\u2019s understanding of the effect of a commutation reads: I understand that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">1. The requested amount equals the present value of future periodic payments totalling $_at <em>4% </em>true discount compunded [sic] annually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">2. The acceptance of the requested amount will relieve the employer of his liability to pay future period [sic] payments totalling $- for _weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">3. I will not be able to reopen this case for the period of commutation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzZH\">And the part of the form covering the approval of the requested commutation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4T6\">The above request for commutation is approved. Payment of the sum will relieve the employer of his liability to pay future periodic payments totalling $--</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\"> A possible alternative ground for reversing the appellate court\u2019s decision with regard to the issue of the applicability of the last sentence of HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) to this case is the apparent improper raising of the issue on appeal by Swinerton and Industrial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">\u201c(T]he general rule that an appellate court will consider only such questions as were raised and reserved in the lower court applies on review by courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>administrative determinations so as to preclude from consideration questions or issues which were not raised in administrative proceedings. <em>Petition of Village Board of Wheatland, </em>77 N.D. 194, 42 N.W.2d 321 (1950).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Waikiki Resort Hotel v. City &amp; County, <em>supra, </em>63 Haw. at 250, 624 P.2d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The record clearly shows that Swinerton and Industrial did not raise or reserve the issue of commutation and its effect on the reopening of a workers\u2019 compensation case in the Appeals Board hearing in the instant case. Hence, we could have concluded that Swinerton and Industrial were precluded from raising this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
