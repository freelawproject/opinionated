(Habilitat or the taxpayer), a Hawaii non-, profit corporation, appeals from a decision and order of the Tax Appeal Court upholding the assessment by the Director of Taxation of general excise taxes on the gross income derived from certain of its activities and of use taxes on goods it ordered from out-of-state suppliers for subsequent delivery to other persons in Hawaii. It claims the gross income in question is exempt from taxation pursuant to several provisions of HRS Chapter 237 and its ordering of goods for delivery to others in Hawaii did not subject it to taxation pursuant to HRS \u00a7 238-2(1). From a review of the record, we are convinced that the gross income in question for the fiscal years ending in June of 1974, 1975, and 1976, except for the \u201crent\u201d received from Habilitat\u2019s residents and staff, was properly taxed and that the purchases from out-of-state suppliers were subject to the use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">Habilitat\u2019s primary activity is rehabilitation; it maintains a residential program to foster the rehabilitation of persons with character disorders, including those induced or complicated by drug or alcohol abuse. It is exempted from the payment of federal income taxes as a charitable and educational organization within the purview of \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It has also been recognized by the Director of Taxation since 1977 as an exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>organization for purposes of the general excise tax law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Habilitat\u2019s operation is funded from various sources, including government grants, food stamps, the Aloha United Fund, interest and dividend income, and activities conducted by the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The present controversy arose on October 11, 1977 when the Director of Taxation served a Notice of Assessment of Additional General Excise and Use Taxes for the fiscal years ending June 1974, June 1975, and June 1976 on the taxpayer, whereby general excise taxes in the sum of $39,799.91 in addition to taxes theretofore paid for those years were assessed and use taxes in the sum of $3,647.87 for the same period were assessed. The notice also included assessments of penalties and interest in addition to the unpaid taxes. The excise taxes were levied on gross income derived by the taxpayer from the following activities and sources:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(1) Retailing \u2014 gross income derived from Habilitat\u2019s sales of tangible personal property such as \u201cadvertising specialty items\u201d, wood products, candles, cookbooks, donated goods, matches, and posters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">(2) Services \u2014 gross income derived from the performance of work on construction projects, painting and repair jobs, and landscaping jobs by the residents of Habilitat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">(3) Rentals \u2014 gross income derived from Habilitat\u2019s operation of various housing accommodations for its residents and staff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">(4) Interest \u2014 interest received by Habilitat pursuant to an agreement of sale covering certain real property located in Kaneohe, Hawaii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">(5) Other sources \u2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">(a) Benefit concerts \u2014 gross income derived from benefit concerts conducted on Habilitat\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(b) Speaking engagements \u2014 gross income derived from the speaking engagements of Habilitat\u2019s founder before various community groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">(c) Consultant fees \u2014 gross income derived from the American Alcoholic Treatment Facility in Honolulu in payment for Habilitat\u2019s assistance in the former\u2019s rehabilitation program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">(d) Vending machines \u2014 gross income derived from the operation of vending machines located on Habilitat\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">(e) Film income \u2014 gross income derived from the public showing of a film produced by Habilitat, \u201cStory of Survival\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The use taxes were levied on the \u201cpurchases\u201d by Habilitat of \u201cadvertising specialty items\u201d from out-of-state suppliers for delivery to other persons in Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Habilitat paid the assessed taxes, penalties, and interest under protest and sought relief from the Tax Appeal Court. The assessments were adjusted in the course of the appeals, resulting in revised assessments of $16,774.36 on account of general excise taxes and $2,307.84 on account of use taxes, together with penalties and interest thereon. The court sustained the revised assessments and entered judgment in favor of the Director of Taxation for the adjusted sums. The taxpayer\u2019s appeal to this court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">The dispositive questions on the levy of additional excise taxes are whether the receipts in question were from activities of Habilitat exempted from excise taxation pursuant to HRS \u00a7 237-23(b) or whether the receipts were from activities with a primary purpose of producing income, \u201ceven though the income is to be used for or in furtherance of the exempt activities.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A further issue in this regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>is whether some of the receipts were gifts rather than taxable gross income. The issue relative to the use tax law is whether Habilitat engaged in taxable transactions when it ordered items of personal property from out-of-state suppliers for direct delivery to persons in Hawaii.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The general excise tax, the State\u2019s principal source of governmental revenues, is \u201cimposed upon entrepreneurs for the privilege of doing business.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, </em>63 Haw. 199, 202, 624 P.2d 1346, 1349(1981). It \u201capplies at all levels of economic activity from production or manufacturing to retailing ... and to virtually all goods and services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[i]ts inherent pervasiveness ... is mitigated by limited categories of exemptions ... provided for certain persons or entities, certain activities, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>described transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202-03, 625 P.2d at 1349.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among these is the exemption provided by HRS \u00a7 237-23(b) for the gross income derived from the charitable, educational, communal, or social welfare activities of an entity organized and operated exclusively for charitable or educational purposes. The exemption, however, does not extend to the proceeds of any activity designed to produce income, even if such receipts are thereafter employed to further the organization\u2019s altruistic goals. It applies only where the primary purpose of the particular activity is not to produce income and the activity is also a primary reason for the organization\u2019s existence. <em>Id. </em>at 208-09, 624 P.2d at 1352-53; <em>The Oceania Foundation v. Kondo, </em>53 Haw. 1, 5-6, 486 P.2d 396, 398 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Habilitat argues the gross income generated by the sales of tangible personal property and the performance of work on construction and landscaping jobs by its residents falls within the foregoing exempt category because the activities are expressly designed to aid in the rehabilitation of the alienated individuals who are the beneficiaries of its program. The development of economic self-reliance, it claims, is vital to the program Habilitat has fostered. This factor, it says, distinguishes the activities in question from the situation where a private school whose educational activities have been exempted from taxation pursuant to HRS \u00a7 237-23 sponsored a fund-raising carnival. The argument is not without appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Yet, it cannot be denied that the activities have a primary purpose of producing income for Habilitat\u2019s operation. And where the object of economic gain predominates, the activity does not meet the exemptive test propounded by. <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, </em>despite an integration of the economic activity with the purpose for which the entity was organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">The thesis advanced above is reiterated to support the taxpayer\u2019s position that the payments received in the form of \u201crent\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Habilitat\u2019s residents and staff are not subject to taxation. But here, the argument supports the claim of exemption \u2014 a residential setting where stringent rules of conduct are enforceable forms the core of Habilitat\u2019s program.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Some of the receipts in question consist of a portion of the welfare benefits received from the State Department of Social Services and Housing (DSSH) to cover food, housing, and other needs of participants in the program. In the initial phase of an individual\u2019s rehabilitative process none of the payments received from the DSSH on his account is allocated to \u201crent\u201d, and no issue has been raised about these payments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But as he progresses through the program, part of the payments received from the DSSH on his behalf is allocated to cover housing and designated for bookkeeping purposes as \u201crent\u201d received from him. The taxpayer objects to the assessment of excise taxes on the portion of the payments designated as \u201crent\u201d. For the designation, it claims, is only intended \u201cto promote a recognition by the residents that they will have to be responsible for such expenses once they leave the program, and to assist. . . [Habilitat] in analyzing the costs of ... its program.\u201d <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, supra, </em>definitely supports the taxpayer\u2019s position here.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The \u201crent\u201d received from some of Habilitat\u2019s employees is also at issue. The persons to whom such payments are attributed, though technically employe\u00e9s, are participants in the program whose rehabilitation is considered nearly complete. They remain as residents of Habilitat, continue to participate in the program, and assist other residents who are still in the early phases of rehabilitation. They receive salaries from which they pay set amounts to help defray the cost of housing them at Habilitat.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The monthly \u201crent\u201d for one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>these persons is equivalent to the sum allocated for housing an individual in the category described earlier. <em>In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church </em>likewise aids the taxpayer\u2019s cause here.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The transactions at issue did not have a primary purpose to produce income; the parties have agreed that \u201c[n]o profit was made by... [Habilitat ] in connection with these rentals.\u201d <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>The sums credited as \u201crent\u201d here are, in our opinion, analogous to the monthly service fees received from the elderly residents of the retirement residence operated by the Central Union Church which were \u201capplied to cover operating costs\u201d there. <em>See In re Tax Appeal of Central Union Church, supra, </em>63 Haw. at 209, 624 P.2d at 1353.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEL\">That these receipts flow from the operation of . . . [Habilitat] itself rather than from another activity with a different purpose is obvious. Nor is there any question that the primary, if not the exclusive, purpose of the relevant transactions is to further ... [Habilitat\u2019s] objective of providing housing and other services for . . . [the participants in its rehabilitation program], and not to produce \u201cincome\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-7\"><em>Id. </em>HRS \u00a7 237-23 (b) thus frees the receipts in question from the levy of excise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">But the Director of Taxation raises still another possible barrier, a procedural one, to the allowance of the claim of exemption. He apprises us of the taxpayer\u2019s failure to comply with the provisions of HRS \u00a7 237-23(b) (1) which make annual registration as an exempt organization a prerequisite for exempt status, and maintains the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>neglect is fatal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are of course mindful that statutory directives of this nature are generally regarded as mandatory. <em>Perry v. Planning Commission, </em>62 Haw. 666, 678-79, 619 P.2d 95, 104 (1980); 2A C. Sands, <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 57.19, at 445 (4th ed. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The Stipulation of Facts upon which the taxpayer\u2019s appeal to the Tax Appeal Court was determined nevertheless states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ5\">Appellant has also requested and received approval from the Department of Taxation of the State of Hawaii, of its exemption from the payment of general excise taxes under the provisions of Section 237-23, Hawaii Revised Statutes, as amended, for the period beginning January 1, 1971 and ending June 30, 1978. Copies of Appellant\u2019s Application for Exemption and of the letter from the Department of Taxation of the State of Hawaii dated September 7, 1977 confirming this exemption are attached hereto as Exhibits 5 and 6\u00a1 respectively,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARI\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">For purposes of this tax appeal, the statements made in this Stipulation of Facts may be accepted as fact, and the Exhibits referred to herein and attached hereto may be treated as authentic and true copies of the originals thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We cannot ignore the \u201cfact\u201d that the taxpayer has \u201creceived approval from the Department of Taxation\u201d of its exempt status \u201cfor the period beginning January 1,1971 and ending June 30,1978,\u2019\u2019which covers the fiscal years implicated in the appeal, notwithstanding the alleged neglect. The cited impediment, we must conclude, has been removed by agreement of the Department of Taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The taxpayer next posits a claim that interest payments received in 1975 and 1976 from the sale of real property under an agreement of sale are not subject to excise taxes. The proposition advanced here is that the transaction did not give rise to excise tax liability because Habilitat \u201cis not and has not been engaged in \u2018business\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>The tax scheme established by HRS Chapter 237, however, levies charges on economic activity, whether carried on by one engaged in \u201cbusiness\u201d or by an organization with charitable aims. The legislature, as we have seen, has been most niggardly in meting out exemptions therefrom. And the interest payments received from the sale of real property are definitely not exempt, though the recipient may be an exempt organization within the meaning of HRS \u00a7 237-23(a) (6). For \u201cgross income\u201d as defined by HRS \u00a7 237-3 specifically covers interest, and the transaction had a purpose of producing income. While the section further provides that \u201cgross income\u201d does not include \u201cgross receipts.. . from the sale of land in fee simple,\u201d we have previously ruled that interest payments do not fall within this exclusion. <em>Hawaiian Beaches, Inc. v. Kondo, </em>52 Haw. 279, 282, 474 P.2d 538, 540 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Habilitat\u2019s theses regarding the gross income from \u201cother sources\u201d \u2014 benefit concerts, speaking engagements, consultation services, vending machines, and the showing of a film \u2014 are essentially those expounded earlier. Since the performers at the benefit concerts contributed their services, it further claims the receipts derived therefrom were actually \u201cgifts\u201d. It likewise views the gross income from the sale of donated items in a category discussed earlier as \u201cgifts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">We experience no difficulty in concluding the activities here had a primary purpose of generating income for use in Habilitat\u2019s program, although the speaking engagements and the furnishing of consultant services also furthered educational objectives. We also find the contentions that the receipts from the benefit concerts and the sale of the donated items were non-taxable donations lack merit.. As the tickets and the items in question were sold with economic gain as the object, what was received by Habilitat from the sales was taxable. Thus, all of the gross income from \u201cother sources\u201d was properly taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Having disposed of the excise tax issues we focus on the remaining question that warrants discussion, whether Habilitat\u2019s ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>of items from out-of-state suppliers for direct delivery to persons in Hawaii were transactions subject to HRS Chapter 238, the Use Tax Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">HRS \u00a7 238-2 imposes a levy \u201con the use in this State of tangible personal property which is imported, or purchased from an unlicensed seller, for use in this State.\u201d The tax buttresses the general excise tax as it is designed to prevent the avoidance of excise taxes through direct purchases from the mainland.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Its ultimate purpose is to remove the competitive advantage an out-of-state wholesaler or retailer would otherwise have over a seller subject to the payment of State excise taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">At issue are the transactions where residents of Habilitat solicited orders for \u201cadvertising specialty items\u201d for direct delivery to others by mainland suppliers. The items in question \u201cconsist of various products which are embossed with the name[s] of the businesses to whom these products are sold.\u201d The Stipulation of Facts presented to the Tax Appeal Court contained the following resume of a typical transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">A sales order is prepared by the salespersons [sic] at the time of the sale and transmitted to Appellant's office in Hawaii. A purchase order is then issued to the mainland suppliers. (Arthur Salm of Minneapolis, Missouri and HIT Corporation of New York), who then transmit the goods ordered directly to the purchaser.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"A8q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>Wesley H. Sakai, Jr. (Jay M. Fidell </em>with him on the briefs; <em>EdwardR.

Bruce Honda (Harriet Yoshida Lewis </em>on the brief), Deputy Attorneys General, for appellee, Department of Taxation.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The taxpayer does not deny it caused the \u201cadvertising specialty items\u201d to be imported. But it maintains this affords no basis for the assessment of use taxes because it neither possessed nor used the items. In its view, the ordering of the articles constituted \u201cmere importation without \u2018use\u2019.\u201d The statute, however, does not lend itself to the reading suggested by Habilitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">We noted earlier that the enactment of the use tax in 1965 was prompted in part by the \u201csubstantial volume of sales by unlicensed sellers to local buyers [that]... escape[d] taxation because such sales . .. [were] accomplished directly between buyer and seller without the services of an intermediary.\u201d <em>See </em>note 8 <em>supra. </em>We may thus assume the relevant measure was intended to seal what was perceived as an escape hatch. Read in this light, the language of HRS Chapter 238 leaves no doubt that the import of the articles was subject to the use tax, notwithstanding that the transactions were structured to effect direct delivery of the purchased items.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">HRS \u00a7 238-1 defines \u201cuse\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">any use, whether the use is of such nature as to cause the property to be appreciably consumed or not, or the keeping of the property for such use or for sale, and shall include the exercise of any right or power over tangible personal property incident to the ownership of that property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The statutory term thus covers the exercise of any right or power incident to the ownership of personal property. Habilitat exercised such right or power over the \u201cadvertising specialty items\u201d when it directed the unlicensed sellers to transmit the. purchased goods to persons who had ordered them from its residents. The transactions were clearly within the reach of the use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Although other issues are raised, we find that they do not warrant further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The decision of the Tax Appeal Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-13\"><em> </em>HRS \u00a7 237-23(a) (1976) read in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-14\">This chapter shall not apply to the following persons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-15\">(6) Corporations, associations, or societies organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, as well as that of operating senior citizens housing facilities qualifying for a loan under the laws of the United States as authorized by section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended by the Housing Act of 1961, the Senior Citizens Housing Act of 1962, the Housing Act of 1964, and the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 as well as that of operating a prepaid legal services plan.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\"> HRS \u00a7 237-23(b) (1976) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">(b) The exemptions enumerated in subsection (a)(6) to (9) shall apply only:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">(1) To those persons who shall have registered with the department of taxation on or before January 31 of each calendar year, or within one month after the commencement of business, by filing a written application for registration in such form as the department shall prescribe, and shall have paid for the registration an annual fee of $ 1, and shall have had the exemption allowed by the department or by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction upon appeal from any assessment resulting from disallowance of the exemption by the department; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">(2) To activities from which no profit inures to the benefit of any private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>stockholder or individual, except for death or other benefits to the members of fraternal societies; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am_O\">(3) T\u00f3 the fraternal, .religious, charitable, scientific, educational, communal, or social welfare activities of such persons, or to the activities of such hospitals, infirmaries, and sanitaria as such, and not to any activity the primary purpose of which is to produce income even though the income is to be used for or in furtherance of the exempt activities of such persons.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-11\"> HRS \u00a7 238-2(1) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-12\">Imposition of tax; exemptions.

However, the gold tags are classified as employees, and receive a salary out of which they pay their own expenses directly, including the cost of their housing in one of Appellant\u2019s residence facilities, and Appellant is not entitled to the welfare benefits and food stamps for these residents. Most of the gold tags have poor employment records, arid would thus have great difficulty in obtaining employment outside of Appellant\u2019s program. While living in these facilities, all residents continue to be bound by Appellant\u2019s strict rules and regulations regarding their activities, and continue to participate in Appellant\u2019s program of rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">c. The rental which each gold tag paid during the years in question was a flat sum which was established merely to help cover the cost to Appellant of operating these residence facilities.
