Certiorari was granted to permit a review of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision vacating the circuit court\u2019s order because we noted a possible discrepancy between the appellate court\u2019s ruling and our prior decision on the determination of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees within this context. Although we have examined the record closely, we are unable to detect an abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court, and reinstate its fee order.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Plaintiff-appellee R. G. Booker (Booker) was injured in a vehicular accident on August 2, 1978; a few days later he retained Appellant David N. Ingman (Ingman) to represent him in asserting a claim for damages resulting from the accident. The attorney filed a complaint on Booker\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit against Defendants-appellees Midpac Lumber Co., Ltd., Cesario R. Constantino, and Stewart Lai on August 11, 1978. A Statement of Readiness, an Order of Notice to Set Case for Trial, and a Pre-trial Statement were filed by Ingman on February 5,1979. Although the filing of a Statement of Readiness denoted that the case was ready for trial,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he had not engaged in any discovery or other preliminary proceedings authorized by the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Booker discharged Ingman on March 2,1979, and requested the attorney to submit a statement of costs and fees incurred for payment. Ingman was also asked to execute a formal withdrawal of counsel and to transmit the case files to Booker. The requests were not honored; instead, Ingman filed a Notice of Lien for Attorney\u2019s Fees on March 28, 1979. Booker thereupon filed a motion seeking the attorney\u2019s removal from the case by the circuit court. Ingman was removed from the case after a hearing conducted on April 18, 1979, and new counsel was substituted in his stead. He was further ordered to release the case files.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Rather than complying with this directive, Ingman moved for a reconsideration of the order for the release of the files. Booker responded with a Motion to Strike Lien and Determine Reasonable Attorneys Fees. The motion and counter-motion were heard on May 16, 1979, and the court denied Ingman\u2019s motion. But no definitive action was taken by the court on Booker\u2019s motion, as it was continued to another date for further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">When the matter was heard again on June 15, 1979, Ingman acknowledged <em>Carroll v. Miyashiro, </em>50 Haw. 413, 441 P.2d 638 (1968), was the controlling precedent. He argued our decision there supported his position that a fee equal to \u201cthe contract amount (one-third of the ultimate recovery from the suit) less the percentage of time that opposing counsel (Booker\u2019s new lawyer, Christopher McKenzie) puts in on the case,\u201d should be approved. The circuit court, however, indicated a disinclination to accept Ingman\u2019s viewpoint and queried him extensively about the actual hours expended on Booker\u2019s behalf. The attorney admitted he maintained no record of time spent but estimated he had devoted sixty to sixty-five hours to the case. The court, however, did not accept Ingman\u2019s \u201cguess\u201d, for in its opinion the pleadings and other documents in the file failed to substantiate this. And from a review thereof, it concluded twenty hours was a generous estimate of the time expended on the case. The court nevertheless allowed a fee in the sum of fifteen hundred dollars premised on twenty-five hours of work at an hourly rate of sixty dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Ingman appealed, and the appeal was assigned to the Intermediate Court of Appeals. The appellate court concluded \u201cthat the lower court manifestly abused its discretion when it explicitly refused to consider two factors relevant to its determination of Ing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>man\u2019s fee.\u201d <em>Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., </em>2 Haw. App. 569, 570, 636 P.2d 1359, 1361 (1981). In the appellate court\u2019s view <em>Carroll v. Miyashiro, supra, </em>decreed a consideration of the \u201ccontingency fee contract and the reasonably estimated value of the case.\u201d <em>Booker v. Midpac Lumber Co., supra, </em>at 573, 636 P.2d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Courts have generally held that a client has a right to discharge his attorney without cause, for they are mindful of the delicate and confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship and the baneful consequences of friction and distrust. S. Speiser, <em>Attorneys\u2019 Fees </em>\u00a7 4:24 (1973). They further agree the presence of a contingent fee agreement does not affect this right. But there is no general agreement on how the discharged attorney who was retained under such a contract should be compensated. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 4:32-:36.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">In some jurisdictions an attorney\u2019s discharge prior to the occurrence of the contingency \u201cis regarded as putting an end to the contract, so that his recovery of compensation, if any, must be upon quantum meruit for services actually rendered.\u201d In other jurisdictions the attorney \u201cis entided to recover as for constructive performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4:33. But the fee recoverable is often \u201ctheamount of the settlement or judgment ultimately realized, less a fair allowance for services and expenses not expended by the discharged attorney in performing the balance of the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4:34. There is, however,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">an increasing tendency to hold that an attorney employed on a condngent fee contract who is discharged without fault on his part before the happening of the contingency, is not, as a general rule, entitled to recover on the contract, but may recover merely on a quantum meruit the reasonable value of the services he rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4:36 (footnote omitted). <em>See also </em>Annot., 92 A.L.R.3d 690 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">As the litigants have observed, our prior involvement with the precise issue at hand has been confined to <em>Carroll v. Miyashiro, supra, </em>where the posture in which the case reached us obviated the necessity of a detailed discussion of the question. The conclusion there was also put in somewhat cryptic language; it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The amount of appellant\u2019s fee shall be determined by the circuit court, upon consideration of all relevant factors, at the time of, or prior to, the final disposition of plaintiffs case against the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">50 Haw. at 414, 441 P.2d at 639. That we regarded an attorney\u2019s discharge prior to the materialization of the relevant contingency \u201cas putting an end to the contract,\u201d however, is patent. For we pointedly left the determination of the attorney\u2019s compensation to the circuit court, with further discretion to decide what was reasonable under the circumstances even before the conclusion of the client\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The reference to the \u201cconsideration of all relevant factors\u201d of course required no elaboration, since we had discussed the pertinent guides for ascertaining the real value of an attorney\u2019s service shortly before then <em>in Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., </em>49 Haw. 241, 413 P.2d 242 (1966).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, our task here is to examine the circumstances under which the circuit court approved the fee to determine whether its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>exercise of discretion was consistent with the tenets enunciated in <em>Sharp.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Intermediate Court of Appeals concluded the circuit court\u2019s failure to consider \u201cthe contingency fee contract and the reasonably estimated value of the case\u201d in fixing the discharged attorney\u2019s fee constituted \u201ca manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d We do not doubt that the foregoing considerations may well be relevant and material to the determination of compensation where the attorney was retained under a contingent fee contract. Yet a review of the record convinces us that the circuit court\u2019s allowance of a fee primarily on the basis of time spent on the client\u2019s case was not necessarily error.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The transcript of the hearing to determine a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee substantiates the circuit court\u2019s appreciation of <em>Carroll v. Miyashiro </em>and its implications. The transcript further confirms the court\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to facilitate a meaningful consideration of the factors suggested in <em>Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc. </em>That the court sought in vain to elicit information from Ingman that might have supported the allowance of an attorney\u2019s fee on a broader basis is also a matter of record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The attorney nevertheless chose to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>solely on a purported contingent fee agreement,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> argued throughout the proceeding that <em>Carroll v. Miyashiro </em>supported his position, and neglected to produce concrete evidence to substantiate his claim of a fee premised on an adjusted percentage of the client\u2019s final recovery from the defendants. A misuse of discretionary authority cannot be imputed to the circuit court under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We said in <em>Sharp </em>that the \u201c[e]xercise of discretion by the trial judge will not be disturbed upon appellate review except for the abuse thereof\u2019 and that \u201c[t]his principle is applicable to a review of the reasonableness of an allowance or award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., supra, </em>49 Haw. at 244, 413 P.2d at 245.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At3\">\u201c[Discretion\u201d denotes the absence of a hard and fast rule. <em>The Styria v. Morgan, </em>186 U.S. 1, 9. When invoked as a guide to judicial action it means a sound discretion, that is to say, a discretion exercised not arbitrarily or wilfully, but with regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law, and directed by the reason and conscience of thejudge to a just result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX4\"><em>Langnes v. Green, </em>282 U.S. 531, 541 (1931) (quoted in <em>Cooke Trust Co. v. Edwards, </em>43 Haw. 226, 231 (1959)). We discern no unjust result here.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Where the efforts of an attorney who was employed under a contingent <em>fee </em>contract would have a tendency to advance the client\u2019s.claim or to enhance the possibility of a favorable result, we would also conclude the contract and the reasonably estimated value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>of the case should be considered in fixing a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee. For \u201cthe real value of the service\u201d encompasses \u201cthe benefits resulting to the client.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Hui Wahine, Inc., supra, </em>49 Haw. at 244-45, 413 P.2d at 245. But the circuit court in this instance perceived no reason to incorporate the foregoing considerations into its determination of a reasonable fee primarily because the attorney presented no grounds therefor.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aax\">. <em>D. N. Ingman, </em>pro se, Formerly attorney for plaintiff, appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AvG\"><em>Christopher P. McKenzie (McKenzie, Trecker &amp; Fritz, </em>of counsel) for plaintiff-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We emphasized in <em>Sharp, </em>that the considerations delineated therein are \u201cmere guides in ascertaining the real value of the service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 245, 413 P.2d at 246. Nor is there a requirement that each of them be taken into account in every case. The message in <em>Sharp </em>is that a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee is one that is fair to both attorney and client under the particular circumstances involved. And a contingent fee agreement, without more, is not good reason for boosting an attorney\u2019s compensation or denying him a fee that adequately compensates him for actual services performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The decision of the Intermediate Court of Appeals is reversed, and the order of the circuit court is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\"> Rule 12(b) of the Rules of the Circuit Courts of the State of Hawaii reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\"><em>Statement of Readiness Is a Prerequisite, </em>No action shall be placed on the ready calendar of civil cases unless there has been filed a \u201cStatement of Readiness\u201d, served as required by Rule 5 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, which shall set forth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-10\">(1) That the action is at issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">(2) That all necessary or proper preliminary proceedings allowed by statute and rule have been completed by all parties; or, if such proceedings have not been completed, either that there has been a reasonable opportunity to complete them, or that the parties do not intend to conduct them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">(3) That the action is ready for trial.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"><em> </em>Our full statement with respect to the guidelines reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">Comprehensive discussions of the numerous factors to be considered in determining a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee are to be found in Annotations in 143 A.L.R. 672 and 56 A.L.R.2d 13. Canon 12 of the Canons of Professional Ethics adopted by the American Bar Association has set up the following guidelines to be considered in determining the real value of the services performed by an attorney so as to be able to fix the reasonable compensation for such services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOEk\">\u201cIn determining the amount of the fee, it is proper to consider: (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved and the skill requisite properly to conduct the cause; (2) whether the acceptance of employment in the particular case will preclude the lawyer\u2019s appearance for others in cases likely to arise out of the transaction, and in which there is a reasonable expectation that otherwise he would be employed, or will involve the loss of other employment while employed in the particular case or antagonisms with other clients; (3) the customary charges of the Bar for similar services; (4) the amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the services; (5) the contingency or the certainty of the compensation; and (6) the character of the employment, whether casual or for an established and constant client. No one of these considerations in itself is controlling. They are mere guides in ascertaining the real value of the service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKl\">It closes with the admonition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">\u201cIn fixing fees it should never be forgotten that the profession is a branch of the administration of justice and not a mere money-getting trade.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">The Canons have been adopted as governing the conduct of the members of the Hawaii Bar by Rule 16(a) of this court. Canon 12 has been recognized as \u201cpersuasive\u201d in <em>Garden v. Riley, </em>116 W. Va. 723, 183 S.E. 46, 49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">49 Haw. at 244-45, 413 P.2d at 245-46.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> The circuit court made the following observations at about the midpoint of the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">The court tells me in that case you cite, both of you cited <em>[Carroll v. Miyashiro], </em>I determine it prior to determination of the case on all relevant facts. I\u2019m trying to determine what you did and what relevant facts there are. The only relevant fact you have thrown to me so far is there\u2019s a contingency contract. You answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t keep hours,\u201d but you estimate sixty - sixty-five hours. That\u2019s all I have before me. Then 1 look at the file, it supplements exactly what Mr. McKenzie has said. There\u2019s been no depositions taken, no interrogatories filed by you. There may have been answers filed by you, and the pleadings you filed to date are at best six pages total, period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Tr. of June 15, 1981, at 11. But all this was to no avail. And toward the close of the hearing, the court made these comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">You won\u2019t get it on any other basis I\u2019ll tell you now. Because the Supreme Court\u2014 so that the Supreme Court knows how I ruled on this case, I\u2019m trying to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>other relevant factors other than time. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do. I can\u2019t find any. When lawyers charge on time basis, on contingent basis, on the value of the services rendered, on the difficulty of it, on novelty, all these factors, but I don\u2019t find anything in this case justifying me to find novelty or value of work done for me to give you a fee on an hourly basis. And <em>I\u2019m trying to </em>double that <em>time </em>and I still can\u2019t come up with anything worth \u2014 I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to give you a fee, but you don\u2019t give me any basis for doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">The attorney\u2019s response to the foregoing was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">Well, but you\u2019re ignoring the basic thing, the contract that I had with my client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0I\"><em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b188-12\"> Although the attorney claimed he had a written agreement with the client, he failed to produce it even when the court requested him to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">DISSENTING OPINION OF</p>\n<author id=\"AMzZ\">LUM, J.</author>\n<judges id=\"AM-d\">WITH WHOM MENOR, J., JOINS</judges>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">It is easy to see why the majority decided to reverse the Intermediate Court of Appeals. The majority\u2019s perception of the facts is different from that of the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals examined the transcript covering the hearing held by the trial judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concluded, as I do, that the trial judge refused to consider the factor of the contingency nature of the contract and the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>estimated value of the case in the award of attorney\u2019s fee. The majority, however, concludes from reading the same transcript that Attorney Ingman failed to furnish supportive information for the court to consider these factors. I submit that the lack of supportive information goes to the weight of the appropriate relevant factors but is not justification to disregard completely the contingency nature of the contract and the reasonable estimated value of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">I also express concern about the majority\u2019s subscription to a principle of enhancement or advancement under a contingency contract as a precondition to the court\u2019s consideration of the contingency nature of the contract and the reasonable estimated value of the case. Such a requirement only muddles the situation and denies discretion, when in fact the majority is attempting to preserve it, since it gives absolute weight to one factor over the others.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-13\"> MR. INGMAN: Well, it\u2019s a rather complicated thing. I mean, the case is worth more than a hundred thousand, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">THE COURT: It doesn\u2019t matter what\u2019s the case worth. I want to know what you did. You keep going back to the contingency. I\u2019m not going to worry about contingency. I want to know what you did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
