Appellant State of Hawaii (\u201cState\u201d) argues that constitutional principles of double jeopardy posed no bar to further prosecution, and that the trial court abused what the State agrees was the court\u2019s inherent power to preclude further prosecution in such circumstances. While the double jeopardy proscriptions of our federal and state constitutions did not themselves bar continued prosecution, we affirm because we do not view the trial court\u2019s action to have been an unjustified exercise of implicit powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-18\">On July 31, 1979, Gilbert Masaru Moriwake was indicted for manslaughter. The indictment charged that \u201c[o]n or about the 12th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>day of May, 1979, in the City &amp; County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii,. . . [Moriwake] did recklessly cause the death of Ruby Scanlan by beating her [with his hands and feet], thereby [violating HRS \u00a7 707-702(1 )(a) (1976)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">A three-day jury trial was had in February 1980. Moriwake apparently did not deny the homicide, but instead defended against the manslaughter charge on the ground that his state of mind with regard to Scanlan\u2019s death did not constitute recklessness due to extreme intoxication at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Following approximately ten hours of deliberation on the charge, the jury informed the judge that it could not reach a verdict. The judge, after questioning the jury regarding whether and how the deadlock might be broken, concluded that the jury was at an impasse and declared a mistrial <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Three months later, Moriwake was again brought to trial for manslaughter. Although before a different judge and jury, the three day jury trial was essentially the same as the first trial with regard to the evidence presented, the witnesses testifying and the legal theories argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Four communications from the jury to the judge during the jury\u2019s subsequent deliberation on the charge reflected its inability to reach a verdict. After rereading instructions, providing the jury with copies of certain instructions and questioning the jury, the judge concluded that the jury was at a impasse and declared a mistrial <em>sua </em>sponte..</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Soon thereafter, Moriwake moved that his indictment for manslaughter be dismissed. In an order filed July 22,1980, the trial court granted Moriwake\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order does not set forth the bases for the trial court\u2019s decision, but the transcript of the hearing on Moriwake\u2019s motion includes the following statement by the judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-10\">There have been two trials in this case entailing essentially the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>same evidence. And if there were a third trial, virtually the same evidence would very likely be presented. Both of these previous instances, there were hung juries. And the court feels that under the circumstances of this case, a third trial would pose an undue emotional, personal and financial hardship on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">Of course, if this were a situation entailing, say, murder for hire or a criminal situation, then it would be an element against dismissal. But, as the trial has indicated, [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] this entailed certain, shall we say, mitigating circumstances that were not indicative of criminal propensity as in the case, say, of murder or a criminal situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The State subsequently brought this appeal from the dismissal of the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">We view this case as involving the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">(1) Was further prosecution of Moriwake barred by constitutional proscriptions of double jeopardy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">(2) Did the trial court possess discretion to dismiss the indictment, and, if so, was such discretion properly exercised?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">Turning first to the double jeopardy issue, we begin with our federal constitution\u2019s ban against the subjection of any person \u201cfor the same offense to be twice putinjeopardyoflifeorlimb....\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. This injunction has been made applicable to the states. <em>Benton v. Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 793-96 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">The principle embodied in the clause has a \u201cprimary purpose. . . akin to that served by the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel \u2014 to preserve the finality of judgments.\u201d <em>Crist v. Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 33 (1978). But equally if not more important, it stands for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>the following proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Green v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957). <em>Accord: United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971) (plurality opinion); and <em>Arizona v. Washington, </em>434 U.S. 497, 503-04 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The prohibition against double jeopardy is not implicated until jeopardy has \u201cattached.\u201d <em>Serfass v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 377, 388 (1975). To prevent the consequences to a defendant of endless prosecution as well as to give effect to a defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal,\u201d <em>Wade v. Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949), such attachment need not await actual conviction or acquittal. More specifically, in a jury trial jeopardy attaches once the jury is empaneled and sworn, <em>Downum v. United States, </em>372 U.S. 734 (1963), and this rule has specifically been made applicable to the states. <em>Crist v. Bretz, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 37-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">However, even if jeopardy may generally attach prior to judgment, reprosecution is not <em>perse </em>precluded if a trial is aborted. This was the holding in the seminal case of <em>United States v. Perez, </em>22 U.S. 579 (1824), in which the Court stated the rule that principles of double jeopardy pose no bar to reprosecution after discharge of a jury if there was a \u201cmanifest necessity for.. . [such discharge], or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The rule has remained applicable because of a continuing recognition that \u201ca mechanical rule prohibiting retrial whenever circumstances compel the discharge of a jury. . . would be too high a price to pay for the added assurance of personal security and free<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>dom from government harassment which such a mechanical rule would provide.\u201d <em>United States v. Jorn, supra, </em>400 U.S. at 480. Stated differently:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">Because of the variety of circumstances that may make it necessary to discharge a jury before a trial is concluded, and because those circumstances do not invariably create unfairness to the accused, his valued right to have the trial be concluded by a particular tribunal is sometimes subordinate to the public interest in affording the prosecutor one full and fair opportunity to present his evidence to an impartial jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>Arizona v. Washington, supra, 434 </em>U.S. at 505. <em>Accord: Wade v. Hunter, supra </em>(defendant\u2019s right to complete trial with chosen jury \u201cmust in some instances be subordinated to the public\u2019s interest in fair trials designed to end in just judgments.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Which of the \u201cvariety of circumstances\u201d resulting in mistrial declarations rise to the level of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d so as to allow reprosecution has been the subject of much discussion. <em>See generally </em>Schulhofer, <em>Jeopardy and Mistrials, </em>125 U. Pa. L. Rev. 449 (1977). But what is generally not in dispute is that a mistrial ordered <em>sua sponte </em>because of a true inability of the jury to agree upon a verdict represents the \u201cclassic example\u201d of manifest necessity. <em>Gori v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 364, 370-71 (1961) (Douglas, J., dissenting); <em>Downum v. United States, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 735-36. And in reviewing hung jury mistrial declarations in the double jeopardy context, appellate courts are counselled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">[I]n this situation there are especially compelling reasons for allowing the trial judge to exercise broad discretion in deciding whether or not \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d justifies a discharge of the jury. On the one hand, if he discharges the jury when further deliberations may produce a fair verdict, the defendant is deprived of his \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d But if he fails to discharge a jury which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>unable to reach a verdict after protracted and exhausting deliberations, there exists a significant risk that a verdict may result from pressures inherent in the situation rather than the considered judgment of all the jurors. . . . The trial judge\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial when he considers the jury deadlocked is therefore accorded great deference by a reviewing court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aka\"><em>Arizona v. Washington, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 509-10.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We applied the federal scheme in <em>State v. Pulawa, </em>58 Haw 377, 569 P.2d 900 (1977), <em>State v. Mayo, </em>62 Haw. 108, 612 P.2d 107 (1980),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Martin, </em>62 Haw. 364, 616 P.2d 193 (1980).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>again doing so here,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we think it clear from the record that the reasons for which mistrials were declared in both prosecutions constituted \u201cclassic examples\u201d of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d: a true inability on the part of the jury to reach a verdict after diligent effort by the trial court to encourage a \u201cconsidered judgment.\u201d Accordingly, our federal constitution\u2019s double jeopardy proscription, as heretofore interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, did not mandate dismissal of Moriwake\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We also think this conclusion to be consistent with the double jeopardy bar set forth in our own constitution.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are fully cognizant that greater protection may be afforded criminal defendants under our state proscription than the minimum safeguards we must implement under the federal bar. <em>See generally: State v. Huelsman, </em>60 Haw. 71, 88, 588 P.2d 394, 405 (1978) (state constitution guarantees against deprivation of liberty without due process not necessarily limited to those provided under analogous provisions of federal constitution); <em>Huihui v. Shimada, </em>64 Haw. 527, 531, 644 P.2d 968, 971 (1982). However, we do not view this as an appropriate case in which to address the question.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We next consider whether our trial courts have the power to dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>an indictment with prejudice and over the objection of the prosecuting attorney. Within the bounds of duly exercised discretion, we think that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Our constitution vests the \u201cjudicial power of the State\u201d in the courts. Haw. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 1. Nowhere in that document is the exact nature of the \u201cjudicial power\u201d defined, and we agree that the \u201cessentially inherent or implied powers of the court are by their nature impracticable if not impossible of all-inclusive enumeration.\u201d <em>People v. Sidener, </em>25 Cal. Rptr. 697, 705, 375 P.2d 641, 649 (Cal. 1962) (Schauer, J., dissenting), <em>overruled in People v. Tenorio, </em>89 Cal. Rptr. 249, 250, 473 P.2d 993, 994 (Cal. 1970). But speaking generally, the \u201cinherent power of the court is the power to protect itself; the power to administer justice whether any previous form of remedy has been granted or not; the power to promulgate rules for its practice; and the power to provide process where none <em>exists.\u201d In re Bruen, </em>172 P.1152, 1153 (Wash. 1918).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">That aspect of the judicial power which seeks to \u201cadminister justice\u201d is properly invoked when a trial court <em>sua sponte </em>dismisses an indictment with prejudice following the declaration of one or more mistrials because of genuinely deadlocked juries, even though the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are not yet implicated.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In so stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ing, we are cognizant of the deference to be accorded the prosecuting attorney with regard to criminal proceedings, but such deference is not without bounds. As stated elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Society has a strong interest in punishing criminal conduct. But society also has an interest in protecting the integrity of the judicial process and in ensuring fairness to defendants injudicial proceedings. Where those fundamental interests are threatened, the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of the prosecutor must be subject to the power and responsibility of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-7\"><em>State v. Braunsdorf, </em>297 N.W.2d 808, 817 (Wis. 1980) (Day, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In considering whether such power and responsibility were properly exercised, we in turn will accord deference to the conclusion of the trial court for much the same reason that we will seldom question the propriety of a hung jury mistrial declaration. <em>See Arizona v. Washington, supra, </em>434 U.S. at 509-10. But we think that the magnitude of the respective interests of society and of criminal defendants which are implicated in this area of the law requires that we more fully delineate the parameters within which this discretion is properly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Simply put, \u201c[i]t is a matter of balancing the interest of the state against fundamental fairness to a defendant with the added ingredient of the orderly functioning of the court system.\u201d <em>State v. Braunsdorf, supra, </em>297 N.W.2d at 817. The factors which the trial court should consider in undertaking this balance include the following: (1) the severity of the offense charged; (2) the number of prior mistrials and the circumstances of the jury deliberation therein, so far as is known; (3) the character of prior trials in terms of length, complexity and similarity of evidence presented; (4) the likelihood of any substantial difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed; (5) the trial court\u2019s own evaluation of relative case strength; and (6) the professional conduct and diligence of respective counsel, particularly that of the prosecuting attorney. <em>Cf. State v. Lundeen, </em>297</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>N.W,2d 232, 236 (Iowa App. 1980) (list of twelve \u201crelevant considerations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Without suggesting that trial courts are not free, within the bounds of properly exercised discretion, to differ, we proffer that in most cases, serious consideration be given to dismissing an indictment with prejudice after a second hung jury mistrial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Again, this is not to say that the preclusion of even a second trial or the allowance of a third or even more trials would not be appropriate in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In this case, two full, nearly identical trials on a serious charge were held, following which two separate juries were unable to reach a verdict despite sound judicial efforts to encourage a \u201cconsidered judgment.\u201d There was no indication that a third trial would proceed in a manner any different than did the previous two. Considering this and other evidence in the record, we do not perceive the trial court to have abused its discretion in.dismissing the indictment of Moriwake.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b74-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Lawrence R.

They are to exercise a sound discretion on the subject; and it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere. To be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sure, the power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes; and in capital cases especially, courts should be extremely careful how they interfere with any of the chances of life, in favor of the prisoner.

A judge may summon the jury to inquire into the status of its deliberations or may follow instead the more cautious procedure of waiting until the jury takes the initiative. The judge may question the foreperson or may poll the other jurors as well. A jury\u2019s firm statement of deadlock may be accepted by the judge or further deliberations may instead be required, with or without additional instructions relating to elements in the case, the burden of proof, or the nature of the unanimity requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Schulhofer, <em>Jeopardy </em>&amp; <em>Mistrials, supra, </em>125 U.

Penal P. 12(e), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]here factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the [trial] court shall state its essential findings on the record.\u201d It is true in this case that the trial court did briefly state at the hearing on Moriwake\u2019s dismissal motion the reasons for its decision, and that such statements were transcribed and are part of the record. It is also true that the record is adequate for us to reach an informed conclusion. But in light of what we believe must be our conscientious review of such records to assure the proper exercise of trial discretion, we think it incumbent upon trial courts to express their factual findings in a more formal manner, <em>i.e., </em>in writing. \u201cBecause of the nature of criminal proceedings, and because they are in the interests and for the protection of the public, there is a sound basis in public policy for requiring the judge who assumes the serious responsibility of dismissing a case to set forth his reasons for doing so in order that all-may know what invokes the court\u2019s discretion and whether its action is justified.\u201d Salt Lake City v. Hanson, 425 P.2d 773, 775 (Utah 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
