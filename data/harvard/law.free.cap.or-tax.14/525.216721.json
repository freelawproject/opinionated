BYERS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">In all of these appeals, Defendants (taxpayers) challenge their 1997-98 maximum assessed value (MAV). In each case, the magistrate held that Article XI, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, allows a taxpayer to show a lesser 1995-96 real market value when contesting their 1997-98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>MAV. The Multnomah County Assessor appealed each Decision to the Regular Division of this court, and the Department of Revenue has intervened. There is no dispute of material fact. Therefore, all of the appeals have been consolidated for decision and submitted to the court on cross motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In all of the cases, the subject property is taxpayer\u2019s personal residence. In all of the cases except one, taxpayers purchased the property <em>after </em>July 1,1995, for an amount less than the real market value shown on the July 1,1995, assessment roll. All of these taxpayers were successful in the Magistrate Division in establishing that their property\u2019s real market value for the tax year beginning July 1, 1996, was less than the assessed value for the 1995-96 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">One set of taxpayers, the Schaafs, owned their property since 1993, but were unaware that its real market value was less than its assessed value until they refinanced their home. The refinancing appraisal indicated that the real market value in 1996 was less than the amount shown on the 1995-96 tax roll. Through evidence submitted at the board of property tax appeals, the Schaafs established that the real market value of their property was less in 1996 than was shown on the 1995-96 tax roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In short, for the reasons indicated, none of the taxpayers appealed in 1995 to contest their real market value. However, all of the taxpayers appealed their July 1, 1997, MAV. All of the taxpayers contend that they now have a right to prove that the 1995-96 real market value on the tax roll was excessive and therefore their MAV for 1997-98 is less.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Does Article XI, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, permit a taxpayer to challenge the real market value shown on the tax roll for 1995-96 in contesting the property\u2019s MAV for the tax year beginning July 1,1997?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">This court\u2019s responsibility is to construe section 11 consistent with the intent of the voters who adopted the measure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201cIn interpreting a constitutional provision adopted through the initiative process, our task is to discern the intent of the voters. The best evidence of the voters\u2019 intent is the text of the provision itself.\u201d <em>Roseburg School Dist. v. City of Roseburg, </em>316 Or 374, 378, 851 P2d 595 (1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Under principles enunciated by the Oregon Supreme Court, this court begins its search for the intent of the people by considering the text and context of the law. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). If careful analysis of the text and context does not reveal a clear intent, then the court may consider legislative history or historical circumstances. As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Coultas v. City of Sutherlin, </em>318 Or 584, 590, 871 P2d 465 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cIt is an unusual case in which the text and context of a constitutional provision reflect the intent of the voters so clearly that no alternative reading of the provision is possible. Ordinarily, this court will examine the history of a constitutional provision if there is a plausible alternative reading presented to the court.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Article XI, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, was adopted by the people at a special election held in May 1997. Section 11 imposes an overall limitation on property taxes by establishing a MAV for each unit of property and establishing a permanent tax rate. Two paragraphs, paragraph (a) and (g), of section 11(1) directly bear upon the issue before the court. Paragraph (a) of section 11(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201c* * * For the tax year beginning July 1,1997, each unit of property in this state shall have a maximum assessed value for ad valorem property tax purposes that does not exceed the property\u2019s <em>real market value for the tax year </em>beginning July 1,1995, reduced by 10 percent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>This court has recently construed \u201ceach unit of property\u201d to mean each assessable unit of property. Oregon\u2019s property tax system has long provided for separate assessments of land, improvements, and personal property. Accordingly, the com\u00ed; has concluded that each category constitutes a \u201cunit of property\u201d that has its own real market value, assessed value, and MAV. <em>See Taylor v. Clackamas County Assessor (I), </em>14 OTR 504, 509 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Taxpayers contend that the words \u201creal market value\u201d in paragraph (a) mean just that, the real market value of the property, not its assessed value. They point out that assessors\u2019 estimates of value are not the same thing as real market value. In opposition, Plaintiff and Intervenor contend that paragraph (a) is referring to the real market value as shown on the tax and assessment roll as of July 1,1995. Taxpayers respond that if the voters had intended or meant the real market value shown on the roll, then they would have so stated. This latter point is not necessarily true as seen in <em>Cascade Steel Rolling Mills, Inc. v. Dept. of </em>Rev., 13 OTR 252, 257 (1995), a case cited by taxpayers in support of their Petition. In that case, this court held that when the legislature specified \u201creal market value\u201d in ORS 309.100, it must have intended the assessor\u2019s \u201cestimate\u201d of real market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Taxpayers\u2019 arguments have facile appeal, but do not hold up upon close examination. The words \u201creal market value\u201d in paragraph (a) are immediately followed by the words \u201cfor the tax year.\u201d These latter words modify or identify which real market value is to be used. They appear to refer to the value that was used for purposes of assessment and taxation. While it is possible that the voters intended to refer to the property\u2019s actual real market value during the tax year, it is unlikely. Such an abstract meaning would have no direct relationship with the property tax system. Trying to force the meaning down that path leads to a numberless nowhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">If the court assumes that section ll(l)(a) does not refer to the real market value shown on the roll, then the next question must be: Where does the number come from? Certainly section 11 recognizes that property taxes must be administered. If a MAV is to be established, then the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>market value for every parcel of property as of July 1, 1995, must be ascertained. There are only a limited number of possibilities: (1) sale of the subject properties, (2) government appraisals, (3) taxpayer appraisals, and (4) existing property tax records.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">By May 1997 when the voters passed Measure 50, they knew that every parcel of property in Oregon had not sold on July 1, 1995. It is only slightly less ludicrous to consider whether the voters intended assessors or taxpayers to assess every parcel of property. That leaves only one explanation: the words \u201creal market value\u201d in paragraph (a) were intended to refer to the amount shown as the real market value on the assessment and .tax roll for July 1, 1995. That view is consistent with the administrative needs of the property tax system. The assessors of each county were required to compute a MAV for every parcel of property. That was feasible only by using the real market value from the July 1, 1995, assessment and tax roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The second paragraph directly bearing upon the issue before the court, paragraph (g) of section 11(1), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u201cThere shall not be a reappraisal of the <em>real market value used </em>in the tax year beginning July 1, 1995, for purposes of determining the property\u2019s maximum assessed value under paragraph (a) of this subsection.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The specific terms used in context are sufficiently ill-fitted so as to create ambiguities and questions. The word \u201creappraisal\u201d does not fit well with the words \u201creal market value.\u201d \u201cValue\u201d is not a usual object of the word \u201cappraisal.\u201d In this context, value is not appraised, property is appraised. Probably what the voters intended to say is that there shall not be a reappraisal of the property\u2019s real market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Section ll(l)(g) specifies that the real market value in question is that which was \u201cused\u201d in the tax year beginning July 1, 1995. The common, ordinary meaning of the word \u201cused,\u201d is that it was applied to accomplish something. To be \u201cused in the tax year beginning July 1, 1995,\u201d suggests that the real market value was employed in some fashion in that year. The most obvious and common use was the real market <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>value on the assessment roll. That would be a clear, exact number. It would also be a number assessors could use to calculate MAV for the 1997-98 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Whatever the \u201cactual\u201d real market value of each property was in 1995, only the real market value on the assessment and tax roll was \u201cused\u201d for that tax year. The value that taxpayers assert, even though supported by evidence, was not the value \u201cused\u201d either by them or by the assessor for the 1995-96 tax year. Consequently, the voters must have intended the words \u201creal market value\u201d to refer to the real market value shown on the tax and assessment roll for 1995-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Because paragraph (g) refers to paragraph (a), the two paragraphs may be read together for their collective meaning. It should be apparent that there would be no point in prohibiting a <em>reappraisal </em>unless property has been previously appraised. To prohibit a reappraisal is a direction that the prior appraisal shall not be disturbed or overturned. The only \u201cappraisal\u201d that would have applied to every parcel of property in Oregon would have been property tax appraisals. Therefore, the real market value in paragraph (g) must be the value that was \u201cused\u201d as described in paragraph (a) \u201cfor the tax year.\u201d Both paragraphs contemplate a real market value that was employed in administering the property tax system for the tax year beginning July 1,1995. Any \u201cactual\u201d real market value as contended for by taxpayers would not have been used or necessarily been \u201cfor the tax year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Contrary to taxpayers\u2019 assertions, the court concludes that the voters intended to refer to the real market value on the assessment and tax roll precisely because it did provide certainty. By the spring of 1997 there would have been few properties whose real market value was still in question. It is significant that the voters selected July 1, 1995. That date became the starting point for all future calculations of MAV and is significant because section 11 also requires the establishment of permanent tax rates. Establishing permanent tax rates suggests the need for certainty in the calculation of those rates. Allowing property owners to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>appeal and change the real market value used for the 1995-96 tax year is inconsistent with the establishment of permanent tax rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Because the concept of MAV in paragraph (a) is unusual and the phrasing in paragraph (g) raises questions, the court has considered the legislative history of section 11. As observed in <em>Taylor (I):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cThis section had an unusual beginning. By initiative Measure 47, adopted at the November 1996 general election, Oregon voters enacted a constitutional amendment limiting property taxes. However, after studying that amendment for the purpose of enacting conforming and implementing legislation, the legislature concluded that Measure 47 presented too many legal questions, unattended consequences, and difficulties. It therefore drafted a revised Measure 47, and referred the revised measure to the people as Measure 50. At a special election in May 1997, the voters adopted Measure 50, thereby repealing Measure 47.\u201d <em>Taylor (I), </em>14 OTR 504, 506-07 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Measure 47 was a direct hmitation on the amount of property taxes that could be imposed. Measure 50 (section 11) took a different route to accomplish the same thing. It limited the assessed value of property <em>and </em>established a permanent tax rate. The Explanatory Statement furnished by the legislature that drafted Measure 50 and contained in the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cReduces the maximum assessed value of property for the 1997-1998 tax year to 90 percent of the <em>property\u2019s assessed value </em>for the 1995-1996 tax year.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">As of July 1,1995, ORS 308.232 required property to be assessed at 100 percent of its real market value. Thus, the explanation in the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet indicating that the MAV would be reduced to 90 percent of the property\u2019s \u201cassessed value\u201d for the 1995-96 tax year would be understood to refer to the property\u2019s real market value used for that year. More important, there is no language anywhere in the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet that suggests that the foundation or starting number for calculating MAV could be appealed or changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Taxpayers make other arguments, which the court finds unpersuasive. They argue that section ll(l)(g) is a restriction only on the assessor \u2014 that the voters would not restrict their own rights of appeal. Making assumptions about what the voters intended in these circumstances is mere speculation in the absence of any language in the constitution addressing appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">As noted above, Measure 50 was intended to accomplish the same thing as Measure 47, which is to limit property taxes. What the voters may have understood with regard to how the assessed value of property affects the permanency of the tax rate is unknown. There is no mention of rights of appeals in section 11 or the Voters\u2019 Pamphlet. Consequently, it is just as likely the voters believed that by using the July 1, 1995, value, less 10 percent, there was no need for anyone to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The greatest obstacle faced by taxpayers is the language of section ll(l)(g) itself. The prohibition against reappraisal is unconditioned and unlimited. It proscribes any reappraisal. Whether real market value refers to \u201cactual\u201d or assessed, a reappraisal is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Paragraph (g) is clearly intended to prevent going back in history and revising each property\u2019s MAV starting point. To allow taxpayers to challenge their 1995 real market value would make paragraph (g) of no effect. By selecting a real market value as of July 1,1995, almost two years earlier, the voters provided a margin of time that, in a general sense, would have assured a higher value in 1997. By specifying \u201cless 10 percent,\u201d the voters established an additional margin so that all voters might feel comfortable that the starting point for calculating MAV would be at least less than the real market value in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Based upon the above analysis, the court concludes that taxpayers appealing their July 1, 1997, MAV may not challenge the real market value shown on the tax roll for July 1,1995.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The court recognizes that in one sense MAV is somewhat artificial or arbitrary. That is inherent in the overall scheme of section 11. The concept may, over time, result in various degrees of nonuniformity in the property tax system. Section 11(18) contemplates this and excuses itself from complying with other constitutional provisions requiring uniformity, specifically Article IX, section 1, and Article I, section 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Having resolved the issue before the court; now, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">IT IS ORDERED that Plaintiffs and Intervenor\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, and</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Defendants\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment are denied. Costs to neither party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-10\"> Consolidation allowed taxpayers to pool their resources and employ an experienced attorney who has excellently presented legal arguments on difficult constitutional questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\"> \u201cThe constitution derives its force and effect from the people who ratified it and not from the proceedings of the convention where it was framed * * <em>Monaghan v.
