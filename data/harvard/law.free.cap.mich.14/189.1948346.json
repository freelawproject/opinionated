Evidence was given of the offence complained of. The plaintiff also showed by her that some years before there had been an illicit connection between the same parties. On cross-examination she was asked whether she had not been engaged to one John Sly, which she denied. She also denied admitting to Hial Sly that she had been engaged to John Sly. Defendant Fisher then offered to show by his mother, Lydia Fishei*, that in 1860 and 1861 Sarah Hood told her she was keeping company with and engaged to John Sly, and that John Sly in 1861 brought Sarah to Avitness\u2019 house. This testimony was excluded, and exception Avas taken ro the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">We can perceive no possible ground on Avhich such evidence was admissible.
