Campau v. The City of Detroit.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-5\"><em>Charter of Detroit. Opening streets. </em>A resolution for the opening of a street can properly require an apportionment of the damages among the premises benefilted only in those cases in which such apportionment can be made under the Charter. But in the case of opening a street the Charter expressly provides that the damages shall be payable out of the City Treasury, and the means therefor raised with the general city taxes.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-6\"><em>Service of notice of the resolution. </em>The Charter requires the notice tobe served \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d and return to be made at least six days before the time appointed for hearing. The resolution in this case was adopted August 8th, the hearing was fixed for September 18th, and the notice was served on the last of the parties September 9th. The return appearing to be made within the time required, and nothing appearing to show that an earlier notice was practicable, it was held that no question of law could arise in respect to it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-7\"><em>Constitutional law. </em>Section 2 of Art. 18 of the Constitution requires a jury of twelve freeholders to determine the necessity of taking private property for public use, and the compensation therefor; and Section 15 of Art. 15 requires a jury in all cases where property is taken for public improvements in cities and villages. In 1859 an addition was made to Section 2 of Art. 18, exempting \u201c the action of commissioners of highways\u201d from its operation. <em>Held, </em>that this amendment cannot be held to include the municipal authorities of cities under the designation of \u201chighway commissioners.\u201d The amendment designates certain officers, and it is not to be extended, by construction, to others on the ground, simply, that the duties performed by them are analogous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-8\"><em>An act providing for a jury of six void. Waiver. </em>The Legislature of 1865 enacted an amendment to the Charter of the City of Detroit, by reducing the number of jurors to be summoned in a street-opening case to twelve, and the number to be sworn as jurors to six. These amendments were held to be unconstitutional and void; and in the present case, the Common Council having treated them as void, and acted upon the original provisions of the Charter, their action was sustained by the Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-9\">The parties cannot be held to waive the objection to a jury of six by not objecting; the provision is one for taking private property <em>in invitum, </em>and if it has no validity for that purpose, it cannot be important to consider whether the parties might consent to such a proceeding.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-10\"><em>Sections constituting apart of oneporoceeding construed together. </em>It was contended that sections 5 and 6, as amended, may stand, even if the provision for a jury of six is unconstitutional, since they provide for summoning twelve persons, and would be consistent with other provisions by which the whole number should be required to serve on the jury. <em>Held, </em>that these different provisions relate to the same subject matter, and provide the successive steps to be taken in perfecting a single proceeding, and must therefore stand <em>together. </em>\u2014 Groesbeck <em>v. Seeley, </em>13 <em>Mich. </em>329.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b276-11\"><em>Depeal, not effected by an unconstitutional provision. </em>Although the amendments cover the ground of the former provisions of the Charter, and there is at the conclusion of the amendatory act, which contains many other provisions, a clause repealing all acts and-parts of acts inconsistent with its provisions, any portion of this latter act which is unconstitutional and void must be considered as a nullity, and cannot, therefore, on the ground of inconsistency, repeal any part of the former law. Nothing can come in conflict with a nullity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Repeal. Legislative intent. </em>It is competent for tlie legislature, in tlie same act, to repeal any former one within its purview, although every other provision in the repealing act was unconstitutional. The question is one of legislative intent, ancl it is only requisite that words should he used which show an intent to repeal, irrespective of the unconstitutional portions. In this case, it is not claimed that the repeal is accomplished without making use of the void provisions for the purpose.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Heard April 25th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AV0\"><em>Decided May </em>1st.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">This was a common law <em>certiorari </em>to the Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit, to remove the proceedings connected with the opening and extending of Russell street, in the City of Detroit, to this Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-7\">The folloAving facts were agreed upon, as being the only ones necessary to present the questions to be raised:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-8\">The plaintiff is one of the heirs of Joseph Campau, deceased; the owners in fee of the property.

This is a fundamental and jurisdictional defect. The resolution was the foundation of the jurisdiction of the Court, and if it were substantially defective, the Court never acquired jurisdiction, and the proceedings are void. \u2014 2 <em>Doug.

There is no law authorizing the assessment of the damages by a jury of twelve persons. It will not be denied that the right to take private property for public uses can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>exercised only by the Legislature, and in sucb mode as the legislative authority may prescribe. \u2014 2 <em>Kent's Com., </em>339, 340, <em>and notes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">The charter of the city provided for this being done by a jury of twelve persons, in regard to opening streets.\u2014 <em>Chapter </em>VII, <em>L. of 1857, p. </em>119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">The Legislature having provided this specific mode, saw fit in 1865 to alter it, substituting six jurors for twelve, and declaring that \u201c all acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act are <em>repealed.\u201d </em>\u2014 L. <em>of </em>1865, <em>p. </em>680 <em>to </em>683.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">4. Conceding, for the present, that the Legislature had no right (under <em>sec. </em>2 <em>of art. </em>18 <em>of the Constitution), </em>to provide for taking private property for public use by the verdict of less than twelve jurors, yet they had a clear right to repeal the former law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">This they have done, and so far their action is valid. The result is that there is no valid mode provided for the compulsory taking of property in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-9\">A party may waive the constitutional right to a jury of twelve persons, (1st <em>Abbott's Dig. p. </em>641, \u00a7 25), and so far, the act of 1865 may be carried into effect. The remedy for this state of things rests with the Legislature, and not with the Courts. If the Legislature intended to repeal their former enactment, so far their action is valid. If they failed to substitute valid provisions, so far their action cannot be enforced. \u2014 1 <em>Mich. </em>118 ; 3 <em>A. K.

But it is not conceded that the Legislature had no constitutional right to make this change, because,</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-11\"><em>a. </em>The second section of article 18 of the Constitution was amended in 1859, <em>(L. of </em>1859, <em>p. </em>1102), declaring that it should not apply to highway commissioners in the official discharge of their duties as such.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-12\"><em>b. </em>In cities and villages the coiporate authorities represent highway <em>commissioners. </em>\u2014 L. <em>of </em>1858, <em>p. </em>38, &amp;c.

It is contended that the resolution of the Council did not state that the jury were to apportion and assess the damages &amp;c., upon the lots benefitted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-9\">No assessment could be made upon lots benefitted by the opening of a street. The damages caused by such opening are paid by the city out of a general fund raised for that purpose.\u2014 <em>Chart. </em>\u00a7 11, p. 74.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-10\">In the case of alleys, it is different. In these cases the damages are assessed upon and paid by the adjacent lots.\u2014 <em>Chart. </em>\u00a7 12, <em>p. </em>75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-11\">Section two, relied upon by plaintiff in error, refers back to section one, which refers to the opening of both streets and alleys. In the case of an alley, the clause is properly inserted, as the \"jury do, in fact, assess &amp;c.; but it would be simply absurd to insert it in the case of a street, when the jury could not assess. The clause in question was intended to apply only to alleys.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-12\">2. The notices were served six days previous to the time appointed for the hearing, and this complies with the Charter. \u2014\u00a7 3, <em>p. </em>71.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-13\">3. The jurors were drawn in compliance with the Charter, as revised in 1861. \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6, 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>In 1865 these sections were amended, by striking out the words \u201c twenty-four \u201d and \u201c twelve,\u201d and inserting the words \u201ctwelve\u201d and \u201csix.\u201d The sections, thus amended, were <em>re-enacted. </em>\u2014 L. of 1865, p. 680 <em>and </em>681.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">This act reads as an amendatory one, and embraces other legal and valid amendments to the charter. The last section of the act is <em>{p. </em>683): \u201cAll acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">It is quite clear that the intent of the amendments to said sections 5, 6 and 9, was to reduce the number of jurors one-half, and thus reduce the expense of street openings. It is equally clear that such an amendment was unconstitutional.\u2014 See <em>Const. Art. </em>18, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-7\">The sole question arising under this point is, were the original sections repealed by this act, or, the amendments being unconstitutional and void, does the act of 1865 stand as if these amendments were not therein contained?</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\"><em>a. </em>It is perfectly evident that the intent was merely to amend, and not to absolute repeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\"><em>b. </em>The Legislature could not be presumed to intend a law which, failing, would annul the power to open streets; and the intent must govern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-10\"><em>o. </em>A law may have some constitutional and some unconstitutional sections, and in such case, if they can be separated, the former are 'disregarded, and the latter enforced. In such case, the law is to be construed as if the unconstitutional sections never were inserted. In the present case, the constitutional provisions of 1861 were not repealed by the act of 1865, with unconstitutional amendments. \u2014 2 <em>Blackf. </em>10; 3 R. <em>I. </em>33, 64; 2 <em>Iowa, </em>165; 10 <em>Mich. </em>250, 253; 1 <em>Doug.

The resolution can properly require an apportionment of the damages among the premises benefitted, only in those cases in which such apportionment can actually be made under the Charter. But in the case of opening a street the Charter expressly provides that the damages shall be payable out of the city treasury, and the means therefor raised with the general city taxes.\u2014 <em>Charter, ch. </em>7, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Nor can the proceedings be held void because notice of the resolution was not served earlier. The resolution was adopted August 8th, and the hearing fixed for September 18th. Notice was served on the last of the parties September 9th. The Charter requires it to be served \u201c as soon as practicable,\u201d and return to be made at least six days before the time appointed for the hearing. There is nothing before us to show that an earlier notice was practicable in this case, and no question of law can therefore arise in respect to it. The return appears to have been made within the time required. The principle question in the case is, whether there is now any provision of law under which streets can be opened in the City of Detroit. The question arises upon legislation which is supposed to be unconstitutional. The Constitution, <em>Art. </em>18, \u00a7 2, requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c when private property is taken for the use or benefit of the public, the necessity for using such property, and the just compensation to be made therefor, except when to be made by the State, shall be ascertained by a jury of twelve freeholders, or by commissioners, etc.\u201d Another section requires a jury in all'cases where property is taken for public improvements in cities and villages. <em>Art. </em>15, \u00a7 15. An addition was made to this section, 2 of <em>Art. </em>18, by amendment submitted to the people by the Legislature of 185 9, which exempted \u201c the action of commissioners of highways, in the official discharge of their duty as highway commissioners,\u201d from its operation. This amendment cannot be held to include the municijjal authorities of cities under the designation of \u201c highway commissioners.\u201d The amendment plainly refers to the officers designated elseAvhere in the constitution and statutes by that name, and Ave are not warranted in extending it to include-other officers or authorities on the ground, simply, that the duties performed by them are analogous. The question under the Constitution is therefore the same since the amendment, as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Charter of 1857, <em>oh. </em>7, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 6, required the summoning of twenty-four persons in these cases, of whom twelve should be sworn as jurors. \u2014 \u00a7 9. But the Legislature of 1865 attempted to amend these three sections by reducing the number to be summoned to twelve, and the number to be SAVorn as jurors to six. The Common Council have treated these amendments as void. It is suggested for the plaintiff in error that they may all be sustained, on the ground that parties may waive their constitutional right to a jury of tAyelve, and whenever they do so, the verdict of six Avill be valid; but the provision is one for the taking of private property <em>in </em>invitum, and if it has no Aridity for that purpose, it cannot be important to consider whether parties might not laAvfully consent that their property be taken in. the mode which it undertook to establish. We think the Common Council correct in treating the provision for a jury of six as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>But it is further argued that sections five and six, as amended, may stand, even if the provision for a jury of six is unconstitutional; since those sections provide for summoning twelve persons, and would be consistent with other provisions by which the whole number should be required to serve on the jury. Whether the amended sections five and six, can stand by themselves, if the ninth fails, must depend upon whether by the amendatory law it is apparent that the Legislature intended them as inseparable parts of the same system, mutually dependent upon each other. Of this we think there is not the least doubt. The former provisions required the summoning of twice the number to be sworn, and the only change here made is in reducing the number of each one half. A single section of the Act of 1865 attempts to amend all three of these; and we know of no principle which would warrant us in selecting out portions of the section to stand unaffected by the constitutional infirmity of the remainder, Avhen all parts relate to the same subject matter, and provide the successive steps to be taken in perfecting a single proceeding. \u2014 See <em>Quinlon v. Rogers, </em>12 <em>Mich. </em>168; <em>Groesbeck v. </em>Seeley, 13 <em>Id. </em>329.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It only remains to consider whether the amendatory section being found invalid, the original provisions remain in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Act of 1865 contained many other provisions, the validity of which is not disputed, so far as we are informed; and the last section repeals all acts and parts of acts inconsistent Avith its provisions. The plaintiff in error contends that, even if the sections which relate to a jury are invalid, the last section must still have the effect to repeal the original sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">If the repealing clause had in express terms repealed certain acts and parts of acts byname, and the act had then gone further, and attempted to substitute unconstitutional provisions, the argument which has been made would be more plausible than it seems to us now. But the repealing clause here in question is distributive in its application to each section of the act, and neither in words, nor in apparent design undertakes to repeal any acts or parts of acts, except those which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>come in conflict with the provisions it attempts to substitute. The repeal was simply to displace all conflicting provisions, so that these could have full effect. But nothing can come in conflict with a nullity, and nothing is therefore repealed by this act on the ground solely of its being inconsistent with a section of this law which is entirely unconstitutional and void.\u2014<em>Sullivan v. Adams, </em>3 <em>Gray, 476; Shepardson v. Milwaukee and Beloit R. R. Co., </em>6 <em>Wis. </em>605 <em>; State v. Judge of County Court, </em>11 <em>Id. 50 ; Tims v.

Thompson, 3 A. </em>K. <em>Marsh, </em>70, is too blindly reported to enable us to determine whether it conflicts with the cases cited, and we have not the statute there in question before us, so that we may see in what terms the repeal was made; but if the decision is what is claimed for it, it stands by itself, and we are unable to yield it our assent. But as reported it does not necessarily go to that extent; and we quite agree with the learned Judge that it is competent for the Legislature in the same act to repeal any former one within its purview, although every other provision in the repealing act was unconstitutional. The question is one of legislative 'intent, and it is only requisite that words should be used which show an intent to repeal, irrespective of the unconstitutional portions. In this case it is not claimed that the repeal is accomplished without making use' of the void provisions for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">We are therefore satisfied that the provisions for juries as they stood before the Act of 1865, remain unaffected by that act, and the proceedings must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
