Said Howe, jointly with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>said Bridgman, then, before, and afterwards, using the property as a servant of said Warren Wheeler, who paid no attention to such arrangement, and continued in full use and possession of the property for five months thereafter, when Noah Gibson, who had a mortgage on the land aforesaid for $5j000, and interest from April, 1856, having obtained a decree in the United States Circuit Court for the foreclosure of said mortgage and sale of said real estate, and being about to proceed to sale, said Wheeler ceased to interfere personally with the property, and left the same in possession of said Joseph W.

May 2d, 1860, the plaintiff in error, David Bacon, acting jointly with Bridgman and the other plaintiffs in error, is alleged to have taken the property described in the declaration from Joseph W. Howe, there being at no time any removal of said property. September 6th, 1860, Warren Wheeler commenced an action of trespass in the United States Court against the defendant in error; his declaration naming the property described in the aforesaid declaration of the defendant in error, and much other property, but omitting the locomotive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>April 22d, 1861, the defendant in error commenced his aforesaid action of trespass in the Berrien Circuit Court against the plaintiff in error. June, 1863, Warren Wheeler recovered judgment in his aforesaid action of trespass, in the United States Court, against George Kimmel, the defendant in error, and the judgment was afterwards paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">George Kimmel, defendant in error, having obtained an order in Berrien Circuit Court setting aside the levy and sale in said attachment suit, filed his affidavit in January, 1864, stating that the judgment in said attachment suit was in no part satisfied, and obtained an order for a new execution for the whole amount of said judgment in the attachment suit aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">The plaintiff in error requested the court to charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">1st. That, by the terms of the chattel mortgage from the Howes and Bridgman to Wheeler, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, the property therein described was not subject to attachment, or to levy and sale on execution issued, on the judgment rendered in Berrien Circuit Court in favor of plaintiff against said mortgagors, and which the plaintiff .has offered in evidence; and such pretended levy and sale, offered in evidence by plaintiff, was illegal and void, and plaintiff thereby acquired no title to any of such property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">2d. That, it appearing in evidence that the said plaintiff, in January, 1864, or about that time, caused the said illegal levy and return made by the sheriff on the said execution, before then issued on said judgment, to be set aside by the said Circuit Court and held for naught, he, the said plaintiff, can have or claim no title to said property through or by means of said levy or sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-9\">3d. That the judgment in favor of Wheeler v. Kimmel, purporting to have been rendered in the United States Circuit Court at Detroit, in June, 1863, .and which the plaintiff has given in evidence in this suit, cannot avail the plaintiff to give him title by relation back to the time of the alleged trespass, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>and prior to the commencement of this suit, so as to enable him to maintain this action for trespass against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">Which requests were refused and exceptions taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">Judgment was rendered for plaintiff below for $1890.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-7\"><em>E </em>and <em>D. </em>Bacon, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-8\">1.

Because the evidence shows that said proceedings were, on motion of defendant in error, set aside and held fo,r naught by the court below; and George Kimmel\u2019s affidavit to obtain a new execution in the attachment suit is a sworn disclaimer of all title to the property in question.\u20141 Cowen, <em>71</em>1, 622; 1 <em>Mich. </em>105; 2 <em>Caines, </em>61; 2 <em>Hammond, </em>395; 1 <em>Dana, </em>419; 4 <em>Mass. </em>99; 2 <em>Aikens, </em>299; 23 <em>Pick. </em>465; 3 <em>Hill, </em>371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-10\">3. The record of Warren Wheeler\u2019s proceedings in the action of trespass in the United States Court, through which the plaintiff claims title, was inadmissible and useless in evidence; the judgment being long subsequent to the commencement of this suit. \u2014 5 <em>Johns. </em>54 ; 6 <em>Id. </em>44; 2 <em>B.

The application was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>after Kimmel had paid the judgment in the United States Court, and made under section 4482 of Comp. Laws.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b206-5\">Christiancy J.</author>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The plaintiff below (defendant in error,) failed to establish any right of recovery in this action of trespass against the defendants. He based his claims upon two grounds, not very consistent with each other: <em>First, </em>The levy and sale under the attachment in a suit brought by himself against the two Howes and Bridgman, which could give him no right of property or possession, if the defendant in the attachment had none: <em>Second, </em>Upon the judgment obtained by Wheeler against himself in the United States Court for the trespass, in taking the same property, and his satisfaction of that judgment, which he claims had the effect to vest the property in himself; a result which could only follow from the ownership of the property by Wheeler, at the very time when it must have been owned by the Howes and Bridgman, to maintain his right under the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">But without reference to the inconsistency of these two grounds \u2014 upon which we do not rest our opinion \u2014 it is sufficient for the decision of this cause that he fails to show any right of recovery upon either.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The attachment, levy, and sale to the plaintiff could vest in him no right to the property, nor tend in any degree to support his action, for two reasons, either of which is sufficient: <em>First, </em>The attachment suit was against the two Howes and Bridgman; and, at the time the property was taken uj&gt;on the attachment it was in possession of Wheeler under the chattel mortgage, previously executed to him by them, the time of payment having expired, and the mortgage, by its terms, become absolute; and it continued in his possession\" under the mortgage up to the time of sale. The property, therefore, was not subject to attachment or sale in the suit against the Howes and Bridgman, the mortgagors.\u2014<em>Tannahill v. Tuttle, </em>3 <em>Mich. </em>104; <em>Eggleston v. Mundy, </em>4 <em>Mich. </em>295.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>But, <em>Second, </em>Had there been no mortgage in the case, and the attachment and sale had been valid, the subsequent order of the court in the attachment suit, granted upon the plaintiff\u2019s own affidavit and motion, setting aside the levy and sheriff\u2019s return of sale, and giving a new execution, on the ground that the property did not belong to the defendants in the attachment, Avould effectually bar any claim of the plaintiff to the property or possession acquired by the attachment and sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As to the second ground upon which the plaintiff sought to maintain his action, the judgment against himself in favor of Wheeler, in an action of trespass for taking and carrying away the same property, and the satisfaction of that judgment, we think it equally unavailable against these defendants in an action of trespass, whatever might have been its effect in an action of trover.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Admitting, for the purposes of this case, that the recovery of that judgment by Wheeler and its satisfaction by the plaintiff had the effect, as between them, to vest the right- of property and the possession in the plaintiff; and that, as between them, it related back so as to perfect the plaintiff\u2019s title from the time of the trespass for which that judgment was obtained, still it could not affect the defendants in this suit so as to make them trespassers as against the plaintiff, as the declaration was for a taking which occurred more than two years before that judgment was obtained. There is no evidence in the case tending to show that at any time during the period covered by the declaration, or for two' years after this suit was commenced, the plaintiff had any right whatever to the property or its possession, nor tending to show that in obtaining the possession of the property the defendants were guilty of a trespass against any one, much less against the plaintiff. And whatever effect the recovery and satisfaction of Wheeler\u2019s judgment against the plaintiff may have had, as between them, by relation back, it cannot by such relation make the defendants trespassers for acts which did not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>trespass as against tbe plaintiff at tbe time tbey were com<em>mitted. </em>\u2014 Liford's <em>Case, 11 Coke, </em>51; <em>Menvill's Case, </em>13 <em>Coke, </em>21; <em>Case v.
