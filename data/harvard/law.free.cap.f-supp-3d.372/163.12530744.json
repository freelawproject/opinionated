INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this action, the plaintiffs, each of whom is a qualified participant in the Defendant American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. Hourly-Rate Associates Pension Plan (\"the Plan\"), allege that Defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    etseq.\n   </em>\n   by reducing their pension payments due under the Plan by the amount of certain workers' compensation payments they received. They also assert related causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before this Court are the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. (Docket Nos. 61, 62.) For the reasons that follow, the motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The plaintiffs were all members of The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (\"UAW\") at the time they retired from Defendant American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. (\"American Axle\"). (Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts Not in Genuine Dispute (\"Plaintiffs' Statement\"), Docket No. 62-9, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 46.) Some plaintiffs previously worked for General Motors Corporation (\"GM\") before continuing on with American Axle after it bought two of GM's plants in March 1994-Bellere, Brandon, Czech, Glover, Jaroszewski, Lichtenthal, LoGrasso, McDonell, Schalberg, Short, and Wise-while the others worked only for American Axle after its purchase of the plants-Jarosz, Archambault, Dixon, Higgins, Kendzierski, Osborne, Osika, Perkovich, Santana, Severino, Stowell, and Ziolkowski.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 45; Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"Defendants' Statement\"), Docket No. 61-68, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 12, 17, 18, 23, 32, 50, 61, 68, 75, 76, 82, 87, 88, 95, 101, 111, 121, 122, 127, 128, 133, 134, 139, 140, 147, 152, 153, 158, 167, 168, 176, 177.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both GM and American Axle provided pension plans to their employees negotiated as part of various collective bargaining agreements. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-12; Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts Not in Genuine Dispute (\"Defendants' Response\"), Docket No. 66-1, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4-12.) While the parties disagree as to the relevance and impact of those agreements (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), they agree that the pension plan at issue here is the \"Restatement of the American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. Hourly-Rate Associates Pension Plan\" (again, \"the Plan\"), which is found in the record at docket numbers 61-4 and 61-5. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 13; Defendants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 21.) The parties further agree that the language of the Plan provision at issue-Deductions for Workers Compensation-has not changed throughout the various agreements between American Axle and the UAW between 1994 and 2008. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14-16, 25; Defendants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14-16, 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There is no dispute that the Plan is an employee pension benefit and defined benefit plan under ERISA. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 1; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 43.) American Axle has been the sponsor and administrator of the Plan since 1994. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3; Plaintiffs' Statement of Disputed Facts (\"Plaintiffs' Response\"), Docket No. 65-1, \u00b6 3; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 27, 44; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 27.) American Axle delegated day-to-day administration of the Plan to GM from 1994 to 1997, after which it undertook direct administration of the Plan itself. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 27; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   American Axle administers the Plan through a Management Benefits Committee (\"MBC\") and funds it with irrevocable contributions to a trust fund, which is managed by a third-party trustee-SEI Private Trust Company. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; Plaintiffs' Response, \u00b6 4; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 22; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 22.) The MBC is comprised of American Axle executives. (Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Statement, \u00b6 22; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Plan vests the MBC with\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   discretionary authority to determine all questions arising in the administration, application and interpretation of the Plan including the authority to correct any defect or reconcile any inconsistency or ambiguity in the Plan and the authority to determine a Participant's, beneficiary's or other individual's right to participate in the Plan, eligibility to receive a benefit from the Plan, and the amount of that benefit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 4; Plaintiffs' Response, \u00b6 4; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 22; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At issue is the provision of the Plan that governs how receipt of workers' compensation payments affects monthly benefits payable under the Plan. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 17; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 17.) That provision provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Deductions for Workers Compensation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . In determining the monthly benefits payable under this Plan, a deduction shall be made unless prohibited by law, equivalent to all or any part of Workers Compensation (including compromise or redemption settlements) payable to such associate by reason of any law of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof, which has been or shall be enacted, provided that such deductions shall be to the extent that such Workers Compensation has been provided by premiums, taxes or other payments paid by or at the expense of the Corporation, except that no deduction shall be made for the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (a) Workers Compensation payments specifically allocated for hospitalization or medical expenses, fixed statutory payments for the loss of any bodily member, or 100% loss of use of any bodily member, or payments for loss of industrial vision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (b) Compromise or redemption settlements payable prior to the date monthly pension benefits first become payable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (c) Workers Compensation payments paid under a claim filed not later than two years after the breaking of seniority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The parties agree that for purposes of subsection (c), retirement constitutes a break of seniority under the Plan. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 18; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Decision to Deduct Workers' Compensation Payments from Pension Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Each plaintiff filed a workers' compensation claim before they retired from American Axle. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 47.) And each plaintiff, at one point or another, received his or her resulting workers' compensation payments and his or her pension payments simultaneously without any offset. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In December 2005, Plaintiff Susan Wise began receiving monthly pension payments under the Plan. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 190.) At that same time, Wise was also receiving workers' compensation payments from a claim that she filed before she retired from American Axle. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 185.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   About seven months later, on July 10, 2006, American Axle sent Wise a letter indicating that it would begin offsetting her monthly pension payment by the full amount of her monthly workers' compensation payment in line with the \"Deductions for Workers Compensation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   provision set forth above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 191; Letter to Susan Wise, Docket No. 61-37.) The letter did not inform Wise of her right to appeal American Axle's decision or describe the available appeal procedures. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 30; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 30; Letter to Susan Wise, Docket No. 61-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Because Wise's monthly workers' compensation payment exceeded her monthly pension payment, she received no pension payments under the Plan, but she continued to receive all other benefits available to her, such as health, dental, vision, and life insurance. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 191, 192.) When Wise's workers' compensation case was closed in 2007 and she stopped receiving monthly workers' compensation payments, American Axle reinstated the full amount of her monthly pension payments under the Plan. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 193, 194; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a result of Wise's case, the UAW became aware in August 2006 that American Axle was interpreting the \"Deductions for Workers Compensation\" provision to require an offset for workers' compensation payments received from workers' compensation claims filed before a Plan participant retired. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 196.) Before that time, American Axle had never applied such an offset.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In early 2009, American Axle audited all Plan participants to identify those who were receiving monthly pension payments and workers' compensation payments from claims filed before their retirement (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , prior to the breaking of seniority). (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 197.) It then notified the UAW on March 12, 2009, that, effective April 1, 2009, it would begin offsetting pension payments in the amount of workers' compensation payments under the \"Deductions for Workers Compensation\" provision of the Plan. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thereafter, on March 23, 2009, American Axle sent letters to each plaintiff (and others) notifying them that, effective April 1, 2009, their pension payments under the Plan would be offset by the amount of any workers' compensation payments they received. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 199; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 35.) The letter sent to lead plaintiff Richard Jarosz is illustrative of the form letter American Axle sent to each plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   DEAR RICHARD JAROSZ:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   You have been identified as currently receiving Worker's Compensation benefits. This information was provided by the Workers Compensation Department and verified by Sedgwick that you are in receipt of such Workers Compensation benefits and are not currently receiving Extended Disability benefits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Per [sic] Article V Section 5.2 of the American Axle &amp; Manufacturing, Inc. Hourly-rate Associate Pension Plan reads in relevant part regarding\n   <em>\n    \"Deduction for Workers Compensation.[\"] In determining the monthly benefits payable under this Plan, a deduction shall be made ... equivalent to all or any part of Workers Compensation payable to such associate ... provided that such deductions shall be to the extent that such Workers Compensation has been provided by premiums, taxes or other payments paid by or at the expense of the Corporation ...\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Effective 4/1/2009, the full off-set of your Workers' Compensation was applied and\n   your AAM pension payment will be $ 0.00.

This converts to $ 1733.33 per month, which exceeds your gross AAM monthly pension benefit of $ 511.93.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Once you are no longer receiving Workers Compensation benefit payments, your monthly AAM pension benefits will be reinstated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   If you have any questions, you may contact Maureen Van Riper, Workers Compensation Manager, at (313) 758-4934.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Sincerely yours,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   AMERICAN AXLE &amp; MANUFACTURING, INC.DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ADMINISTRATION\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Letter to Richard Jarosz, Docket No. 61-7; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   These letters did not comply with the relevant provisions of \u00a7 8.9 (b) of the Plan, which provides that upon denial of a claim, American Axle must provide written or electronic notice of the following information, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (1) the specific reason or reasons for denial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (2) specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (3) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (4) an explanation of the Plan's claim review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures including a statement that the claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the claimant's claim for benefits;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (5) a statement of the claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502 (a) of the [ERISA] following an adverse benefit determination on review\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 37; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 37; Plan, Docket No. 61-5, p. 14\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Elizabeth Main wrote these letters (and Wise's letter) on American Axle's behalf. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 37; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 37; Deposition of Elizabeth Main (\"Main Dep.\"), Docket No. 62-4, pp. 83, 85.) At the time, Main worked for American Axle as a coordinator in its retirement plan services department. (Main Dep., Docket No. 62-4, p. 78.) Main admitted at her deposition that she omitted from the letters certain information required by \u00a7 8.9 (b) of the Plan to keep the letters \"short and succinct and to one page ... [because] [p]eople tend to read things if it's only one page.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 84, 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiffs' Administrative Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The UAW challenged American Axle's decision on Plaintiffs' behalf, arguing that workers' compensation payments received from claims filed before the breaking of seniority could not be used to offset pension payments due under the Plan because those claims were necessarily filed \"not later than two years after the breaking of seniority.\" (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 200;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 200; Letter from UAW to the Plan, Docket No. 61-40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The MBC considered the UAW's challenge as an appeal of its decision and denied it on November 9, 2009, explaining that, in its discretion under the Plan, it had \"determined that retirees that receive Workers Compensation payments from claims filed prior to the breaking of seniority shall have such payments offset from pension benefits payable under the Plan.\" (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 203; Letter from MBC to UAW, Docket No. 61-42.) American Axle then rejected the UAW's request for further administrative review. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 205, 206; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6 206; Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41; Defendants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 41; Letter from UAW to the Plan, Docket No. 61-43; Letter from American Axle to UAW, Docket No. 61-44.) All administrative review concluded by April 4, 2011. (Letter from American Axle to UAW, Docket No. 61-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs timely filed their civil suit under ERISA in this court on January 17, 2012. (Docket No. 1.) Defendants filed their answer on March 23, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 9.) This matter was then referred to the magistrate judge to conduct all pretrial proceedings. (Docket No. 11.) Upon the conclusion of proceedings before the magistrate judge, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on February 19, 2016. (Docket Nos. 61, 62). Briefing on the parties' motions, including supplemental briefing, concluded on July 1, 2016, at which time this Court reserved decision without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs assert four causes of action in their corrected complaint. First, they allege that Defendants violated ERISA by reducing their pension payments by the amount of certain workers' compensation payments they received. (Corrected Complaint, Docket No. 15, \u00b6\u00b6 204-216.) Second, they assert a promissory estoppel claim under ERISA. (Corrected Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 217-227.) Third, they allege that Defendants failed to provide a reasonable claims procedure under ERISA, entitling them to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. (Corrected Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 228-231.) And fourth, they seek equitable relief under ERISA in the form of a declaratory judgment. (Corrected Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 232-233.) Before moving to these claims, two general issues must be resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, as all parties have acknowledged in the record, Plaintiffs Dixon, Higgins, and Lichtenthal died during the pendency of this action. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 81, 100; Plaintiffs' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 81, 100; Defendants' Response, \u00b6 45.) When a party dies during the pendency of a civil action, Rule 25 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permits the court to substitute a proper party in the decedent's place if any non-extinguished claims remain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 25 (a). But the rule further requires that an action by or against any decedent must be dismissed if a motion to substitute a proper party is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, well more than 90 days have passed since the parties acknowledged the deaths of Dixon, Higgins, and Lichtenthal in the record and no substitution motions have been\n   filed. Consequently, the actions by Dixon, Higgins, and Lichtenthal will be dismissed under Rule 25 (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, Defendants maintain that six of the remaining plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -Brandon, Czech, McDonell, Short, Stowell, and Wise-signed releases at the time of their retirements that now bar their claims. (Memorandum of Law, Docket No. 61-69, pp. 26-28.) Indeed, Czech, McDonell, Short, and Stowell all signed identical \"General Release of All Claims\" documents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   General Releases, Docket Nos. 61-11, 61-23, 61-31, 61-33, while Wise and presumably Brandon\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   signed similar releases with similar terms,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Wise Release, Docket No. 61-36. But one important term found in both releases-a term not disclosed by Defendants in their Statement of Undisputed Facts (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 115, 163, 172, 188)-is that \"[t]his agreement does not waive any claims that arise after the date I separate from AAM under this Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   General Releases, Docket Nos. 61-11, 61-23, 61-31, 61-33; Wise Release, Docket No. 61-36.) Since the claims herein all arose after these plaintiffs separated from American Axle, these releases by their plain terms do not bar their claims. Consequently, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment against these plaintiffs on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With these two issues resolved, this Court moves to Plaintiffs' causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    A. General Legal Principles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

That provision again provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Deductions for Workers Compensation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . In determining the monthly benefits payable under this Plan, a deduction shall be made unless prohibited by law, equivalent to all or any part of Workers Compensation (including compromise or redemption settlements) payable to such associate by reason of any law of the United States, or any political subdivision thereof, which has been or shall be enacted, provided that such deductions shall be to the extent that such Workers Compensation has been provided by premiums, taxes or other payments paid by or at the expense of the Corporation, except that no deduction shall be made for the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (a) Workers Compensation payments specifically allocated for hospitalization or medical expenses, fixed statutory payments for the loss of any bodily member, or 100% loss of use of any bodily member, or payments for loss of industrial vision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (b) Compromise or redemption settlements payable prior to the date monthly pension benefits first become payable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (c) Workers Compensation payments paid under a claim filed not later\n   than two years after the breaking of seniority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   At issue is subsection (c). Plaintiffs contend that the language of subsection (c) is plain and unambiguous. They argue that on its face, subsection (c) provides that no deductions will apply for workers' compensation payments received from claims filed earlier than two years after a participant retires or otherwise breaks seniority. That is, two years after the breaking of seniority is a cut-off date: claims filed before that date are not subject to deductions; claims filed after that date are. Necessarily then, no deduction can be taken for workers' compensation payments received from a claim filed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the breaking of seniority (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , before retirement), because a claim filed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the breaking of seniority is indisputably filed earlier than two years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the breaking of seniority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendants are not convinced. They contend that the structure of this provision sets forth a general rule with three exceptions. The general rule requires that workers' compensation payments be deducted from pension payments: \"a deduction shall be made.\" According to Defendants, the purpose of this rule is to prevent American Axle from double-paying workers' compensation and pension payments: \"provided that such deductions shall be to the extent that such Workers Compensation has been provided by premiums, taxes or other payments paid by or at the expense of [American Axle].\" Defendants therefore maintain that subsection (c) must be read to except only workers' compensation payments paid under a claim filed after the breaking of seniority but not later than two years after that date. In other words, the breaking of seniority starts the two-year exception period. Defendants argue that to read subsection (c) otherwise as Plaintiffs suggest would have the exception swallow the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \"[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan is likely to turn on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Firestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n    489 U.S. at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031608\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/101/#p115\">\n    109 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Subsection (c) excepts \"Workers Compensation payments paid under a claim filed not later than two years after the breaking of seniority\" from the general rule that workers' compensation payments must be deducted from pension payments under the Plan. This exception is triggered by the timing of the workers' compensation claim, not the timing of the benefits received therefrom. In that regard, the provision clearly sets a single cut-off date for the claim: \"two years after the breaking of seniority.\" Workers' compensation payments received from claims filed before that date are not deducted; workers' compensation payments received from claims filed after that date are. This is the ordinary and popular understanding that a person of average intelligence and experience would reach.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Critchlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212699\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/246/#p256\">\n    378 F.3d at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Contrary to Defendants' argument, subsection (c) does not set forth an exception period with defined start and end dates. Defendants' construction-that subsection (c) sets a start date at the breaking of seniority and an end date at two years thereafter-requires reading into the provision terms that are simply not there. Subsection (c) does not read \"Workers Compensation payments paid under a claim filed\n   <em>\n    after the breaking of seniority but\n   </em>\n   not later than two years\n   <em>\n    thereafter.\n   </em>\n   \" This language would reflect the construction that Defendants advocate. But that is not how subsection (c) reads. It defines the exception period for filed workers' compensation claims as any time earlier than two years after the breaking of seniority: \"a claim filed not later than two years after the breaking of seniority.\" As such, it would include any workers' compensation claims filed before an individual's breaking of seniority or retirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Moreover, the plain language does not contravene what Defendants represent to be the purpose of the provision: to eliminate double-paying. This cannot be the sole purpose, because Defendants themselves concede that even under their construction, American Axle would double-pay if a participant filed a workers' compensation claim between the date he or she broke seniority and the date two years later. (Memorandum of Law, Docket No. 61-69, p. 24.) Thus, an exception period wherein double payment would occur is inherent in the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   So too, the exception in subsection (c) does not swallow the rule, because workers' compensation payments received from\n   claims filed later than two years after breaking seniority must be deducted from pension payments due under the Plan according to the general rule, thereby giving effect to both the general rule and the subsection (c) exception. While Defendants argue that no such workers' compensation payments would ever be received because there is a two-year statute of limitations on workplace-accident claims in New York,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Memorandum of Law, Docket No. 66, p. 24, nothing in the Plan supports the application of New York workers' compensation law to construe its terms. Even so, workplace accidents are not the only type of injuries for which workers can be compensated.

Crabill (\"Crabill Dep.\"), Docket No. 62-4, pp. 31, 36, 66.) The GM Plan contained the same workers' compensation deduction provision at issue here, which GM interpreted and administered consistent with this Court's findings above. (Plaintiffs' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26; Defendants' Response, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 26; Main Dep., Docket No. 62-4, pp. 79-80 (the American Axle plan was \"a mirror plan of the General Motors plan\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As GM's Director of Pension and Savings Plans Preston M.

If the claim was filed not later than two years after breaking of seniority, such as retirement, then we do not make deductions from pension benefits for workers compensation payable. The language does not tie to the resolution of the claim, lump sum settlements, etc. In your example below, the claim was filed prior to retirement. Therefore, the pension benefits are not reduced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   (Crabill Email, Docket No. 62-6, p. 4; Crabill Dep, Docket No. 62-4, pp. 2-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   GM administered its plan in line with this interpretation for more than 40 years and continues to do so. (Crabill Dep., Docket No. 62-4, p. 9.) And American Axle administered its Plan the same way until\n   2006, when it reduced Wise's pension payments. Yet even after Wise's case, American Axle continued to pay the other plaintiffs full pension benefits without offset until the 2009 audit, despite their continued receipt of workers' compensation payments. (Deposition of Karen Cimafranca, Docket No. 62-4, pp. 64-65.) Defendants offer no explanation for their changed interpretation of subsection (c) as reflected in Wise's case, or for their subsequent inconsistent interpretation and application of subsection (c) between 2006 and 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Put simply, until Defendants' change in interpretation, the Plan participants' settled expectations were that no deductions to their pension payments would be made for payments from workers' compensation claims filed anytime earlier than two years after their retirement, including before their retirement. Consequently, even if the language in subsection (c) could be viewed as ambiguous, it must be construed in Plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Accordingly, this Court finds that Plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment on their ERISA claim and that Defendants are not.

(Corrected Complaint, \u00b6 218.) The provision they rely on is as follow:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   GM's contract with [American Axle] will provide that [American Axle] will establish a new defined benefit pension plan (hereinafter referred to as the \"Replacement Pension Plan\"), effective as of the Effective Date of Sale, covering all transferred employees which, consistent with [American Axle's] obligations under the [American Axle]-UAW Agreement, will contain terms identical to the GM Pension Plan except for those provisions required to be changed as a result of a new Plan sponsor and the provisions addressed in this Memorandum. The intent of the parties is to provide transferred employees with benefits from the Replacement Plan and the GM Plan\n   which, apart from any difference that may result from future bargaining, in aggregate, will equal the benefits that would have been provided had the sale not occurred and the employees had continued working for GM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   (1994 MOU, Docket No. 62-3, pp. 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that under the GM plan, a deduction for workers' compensation payments received was made only for such payments received from workers' compensation claims made later than two years after retirement. (Corrected Complaint, \u00b6\u00b6 220, 221.) Thus, by offsetting Plaintiffs' pension payments by their workers' compensation payments received from workers' compensation claims filed before retirement, Defendants' breached this promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Defendants move for summary judgment on the basis that Plaintiffs cannot establish the required elements of a promissory estoppel claim. First, they maintain that the 1994 MOU was \"an agreement to agree\" that did not contain any enforceable promises. Second, they argue that even if the 1994 MOU contained an enforceable promise, there is no evidence that any of the plaintiffs knew about or relied on that promise. Finally, they contend that Plaintiffs cannot establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances. Plaintiffs' oppose Defendants' motion and advocate the opposite position: that they are entitled to summary judgment because they have established each of the five required elements of a promissory estoppel claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Having reviewed the parties' arguments and the record, this Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' promissory estoppel claim and that Plaintiffs are not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs' promissory estoppel claim is premised on the written 1994 MOU provision set forth above, which by its plain terms covers only \"transferred employees\"- those transferring at that time from GM's to American Axle's employ. (1994 MOU, Docket No. 62-3, pp. 88.) Thus, it covers only Bellere, Brandon, Czech, Glover, Jaroszewski, LoGrasso, McDonell, Schalberg, Short, and Wise. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 32, 50, 68, 82, 101, 111, 147, 158, and 184.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Plaintiffs' promissory estoppel claim suffers from two fatal flaws. First, even assuming that the provision at issue in the written 1994 MOU constituted an enforceable promise, there is insufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that any plaintiff relied on that promise. Plaintiffs have come forth with no evidence at all that any plaintiff ever saw, was familiar with, or relied on the written 1994 MOU. In fact, Plaintiffs Bellere, Brandon, Glover, and LoGrasso specifically admit that they never saw it. (Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 25, 34, 69, 102.) Thus, even assuming that the written 1994 MOU created an enforceable promise, Plaintiffs cannot establish that any plaintiff reviewed and relied on that promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The best Plaintiffs can muster is that some of the transferred plaintiffs attended a meeting in early 1994 where they may have been told by an unidentified individual that their benefits would not change (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 52,159) and that both transferred and non-transferred plaintiffs developed \"an understanding\" from what they heard or were told that the benefits at American Axle would be the same as they were at GM (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Affidavits, Docket Nos. 65-3-65-17, 65-19-65-21). But even assuming that these statements were actually made and constituted promises, \"oral promises are unenforceable under ERISA and therefore cannot vary the terms of an ERISA plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Perreca v.
