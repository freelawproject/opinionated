After President Trump assumed office, he issued an Executive Order announcing a policy of withholding federal grants from \"sanctuary jurisdictions,\" which was challenged by the City and County of San Francisco and the County of Santa Clara. I granted summary judgment to prevent the Executive Order from being enforced; the Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n   <em>\n    City and Cty. of San Francisco v.

These conditions required Byrne JAG applicants to provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") with \"access\" to correctional facilities for immigration enforcement purposes, \"notice\" of detainee release dates, and to certify compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . California and San Francisco sued the DOJ for withholding their fiscal year 2017 grant funds after they asserted compliance with the new conditions. I found that the challenged conditions were unlawful on multiple grounds and held that Section 1373 was unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528686\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/924/#p934\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 934 (N.D.

Cal. Nov. 20, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For fiscal year 2018, defendants Acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker and the Department of Justice (collectively, the \"DOJ\") continued to include essentially the same fiscal year 2017 challenged conditions as well as two other new conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The additional 2018 conditions require Byrne JAG recipients: (i) not to publicly disclose sensitive federal law enforcement information in an attempt to harbor or shield \"fugitives from justice\" or \"aliens\" in violation of federal immigration law (the \"nondisclosure condition\"); and (ii) to provide information about the applicant's laws and policies for purposes of assessing compliance with Section 1373 (the \"information condition\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   California and San Francisco have sued the DOJ challenging five conditions in the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG Program. The DOJ filed a partial motion to dismiss or a partial motion for summary judgment, seeking dismissal or judgment on California's and San Francisco's claims regarding the nondisclosure and information conditions. The DOJ has preserved its arguments on the access, notice, and certification conditions from the prior case on fiscal year 2017 funds, which apply to some of the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG funding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   California and San Francisco responded with their own motions for summary judgment. They seek declaratory relief that the challenged conditions are unconstitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Spending Clause of the United States Constitution and to enjoin the DOJ from enforcing the challenged conditions or withholding Byrne JAG funds based on those requirements. California also brings an Administrative Procedure Act claim and seeks mandamus relief compelling the DOJ to issue California its fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG awards without the challenged conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Only the nondisclosure condition raises a substantive concern that I have not addressed, and it fails for somewhat different reasons than the other conditions. Left to its core-that local jurisdictions should not publicize confidential federal law enforcement actions that are disclosed to local authorities to insure deconfliction and protect local law enforcement and residents-seems self-evident and reasonable. But DOJ did not leave it to its core, and instead larded it with broad-ranging, ambiguous language that would allow DOJ the discretion to coerce local jurisdictions to comply with its interpretation of the statutes in dispute in these cases. The exercise of such discretion is all the more suspect in light of the active litigation over immigration issues between California jurisdictions and the federal government, and the threat made by Administration officials to commence criminal prosecution of California officials who follow that sovereign's interpretation of the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , CA Request for Judicial Notice (\"RJN\"), Ex. F (DHS Secretary Nielsen confirming to the Senate Judiciary Committee that DOJ was \"reviewing what avenues might be available\" to bring criminal charges against elected officials abiding by sanctuary policies.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons discussed more fully below, I find that (i) the challenged conditions are ultra vires and violate the separation of powers, (ii) Section 1373 is unconstitutional, (iii) the Attorney General exceeds the Spending Clause in violation of the United States Constitution by imposing ambiguous challenged conditions in the fiscal year 2018 Byrne JAG Program, (iv) the conditions are arbitrary and capricious, (v) California is entitled to the mandamus relief it seeks, and (vi) a nationwide injunction is warranted but stayed. California's and San Francisco's motions for summary judgment are granted, and the DOJ's motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

This provision does not support a broad authority to place the challenged conditions on Byrne JAG grantees. California and San Francisco argue that this statutory provision was not\n   intended as empowering the DOJ to impose conditions, and instead was an instruction for the AAG to maintain bilateral communications or act as a point of contact with state and local governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The DOJ does not identify where in the statutory text Congress expressed its intent for maintaining liaison to amount to discretionary authority for creating conditions on state and local governments in the Byrne JAG Program. Instead, it merely defines \"liaison\" itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Oppo./Reply at 3 (citing Liaison, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liaison) (last visited Jan. 15, 2019) (defining liaison as \"a close bond or connection\" or \"a person who establishes and maintains communication for mutual understanding and cooperation.\"). It is too great a leap to conclude that because Congress imposed an obligation on the DOJ to \"maintain liaison,\" or maintain a close connection to \"Federal and State governments in matters relating to criminal justice,\" that it was intending to grant the DOJ broad authority to impose the challenged conditions over states and local governments receiving funds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2010102\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The structure of Section 10102 does not support the contention that \"maintain liaison\" in Section 10102(a)(2) provides more than a ministerial duty on the Attorney General to maintain communication with other Federal and State agencies.

The information condition may help determine if grantees can maintain liaison, as the DOJ argued at the hearing, but it was also intended to confirm compliance with conditions like the Section 1373 certification condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The nondisclosure condition raises a closer question. The DOJ asserts that the condition is concerned with protecting confidential federal law enforcement information and the liaison relationship between the federal and state or local partners. A narrow and unambiguous condition requiring jurisdictions to promise not to disclose imminent confidential federal criminal law enforcement operations in order to receive a law enforcement grant would be reasonable: the risk of harm to law enforcement officers and civilians would be significantly increased if lack of trust between federal and local partners caused the federal government not to disclose planned operations to their local counterparts. That would interfere with the ability to \"maintain liaison.\" California and San Francisco agreed at the hearing that the desire to maintain confidentiality is reasonable and that they would not intentionally\n   publicize confidential information concerning impending operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That said, the scope of the nondisclosure condition exceeds the narrow characterization offered by the DOJ, and it exceeds the ministerial duty to \"maintain liaison.\" The duty to \"maintain liaison ... in matters relating to criminal justice,\" however expansively one reads it, does not venture into immigration enforcement more broadly. Yet the nondisclosure condition focuses not only on preventing disclosures related to harboring \"fugitives of justice\" but applies to \"any alien.\" Further, it prohibits a \"direct or indirect attempt\" to harbor those individuals, as determined by the AAG. This language seeks the broadest coverage possible by its use of the term \"indirect attempt,\" which has no boundary. It would be interpreted by the AAG. Given the current tension between federal and local authorities, it does not require much imagination to think that the AAG today might well consider many parts of the \"sanctuary\" laws as indirect attempts to harbor \"aliens,\" despite rulings of courts around the country that have rejected DOJ's interpretations of its authority and the constitutionality of Section 1373.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The DOJ's interest in immigration enforcement is distinct from the criminal justice focus of the Byrne JAG Program.\n   <em>\n    City &amp; Cty. of San Francisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528686\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/349/924/#p934\">\n    349 F.Supp.3d at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Congress repealed the only requirement related to immigration that existed before, and it has failed to amend the Byrne JAG statute to add similar conditions since.\").

Yet in its APA argument, the DOJ contended that California Labor Code \u00a7 90.2(a), requiring employers to notify employees of records inspections by federal immigration authorities, was indicative of a larger problem in California in which undocumented employees are given an opportunity to leave before immigration officers detect them. Similar notice requirements are at issue with the K-12 Model Policies.

As set forth above, the nondisclosure condition is defective for different reasons. But those reasons are also applicable to jurisdictions throughout the country; no factual differences would cause a different legal conclusion. Accordingly, I grant the injunction in favor of plaintiffs but stay its nationwide scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
