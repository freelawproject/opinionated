Each party argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' sole claim: Union Pacific was negligent in the design, construction, inspection, and maintenance of the railroad embankment adjacent to Plaintiffs' subdivision. Having considered the parties' arguments, the evidence, and the relevant law, the Court finds that neither party has shown that it is entitled to summary judgment, and the motions should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a negligence case brought by owners of homes in the Arroyo Doble subdivision located in Manchaca, Texas (\"Arroyo Doble\" or the \"neighborhood\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl., Dkt. 42, at 2, 4-5). Arroyo Doble is bordered by two waterways: Bear Creek to the north and Onion Creek to the east. (Arroyo Doble Map, Dkt. 54-2, at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The creeks converge just northeast of the neighborhood. To the west, Arroyo Doble is bordered by an embankment of railroad tracks between Hosrethief Trail at milepost 190.92 and Bear Creek at milepost 191.39. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). These tracks form a section of a mainline railroad track owned by Union Pacific that runs through several counties in central Texas, including Travis County (the \"Austin Subdivision\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Austin Subdivision was built in 1881. (Union Pacific Track Profile, Dkt. 54-4). Because the tracks are elevated, there are no ditches or culverts alongside the tracks between mileposts 190.92 and 191.39. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Garcia Dep., Dkt. 54-14, at 16:10-21; Freeman Dep., Dkt. 54-25, at 25:14-24). But there are several drainage ditches throughout the Arroyo Doble property. One runs parallel to Union Pacific's tracks and the homes on the western border of the subdivision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ditch Easement, Dkt. 54-3, at 2-3). Another runs perpendicular to Union Pacific's tracks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Topographic Survey, Dkt. 54-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In recent years, this area has experienced a series of flooding events. In October 2013, there were two significant storms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meteorological Analysis, Dkt. 54-11, at 29). On October 13-14, 2013, a storm produced more than five inches of rain in one hour, correlating to a 325-year rainfall event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-25). The storm washed out a portion of Union Pacific's Austin Subdivision around milepost 191.3. (Incident Summ., Dkt. 54-7, at 2). The washout was described as a \"side wash,\" about ten feet long and four feet deep, though the parties dispute the extent to which the tracks were damaged. (Incident Rep., Dkt. 54-8, at 3; Lydick Dep., Dkt. 56-15, at 49:11-24). The washout was repaired by October 14, and the track was returned to service. (Incident Rep., Dkt. 54-8, at 3-4; Ashworth Rep., Dkt. 56-3, at 7). On October 30-31, 2013, another storm produced more than nine inches of rain over three hours, correlating to a 500-year rainfall event. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Meteorological Analysis, Dkt. 54-11, at 15-19). There is no evidence that the Austin Subdivision was affected during this storm. And although each storm was significant, there is no evidence that any property in the neighborhood was flooded as a result of either event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Two years later, on October 30, 2015, a record-setting storm hit the area, causing significant flooding throughout central Texas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KXAN Rep., Dkt. 54-28, at 1; Meteorological Analysis, Dkt. 54-11, at 7-11). Experts for both parties estimated that the October 30 storm correlated to at least a 250-year rainfall event. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Williams Assessment, Dkt. 54-10, at 5; Meteorological Analysis, Dkt. 54-11, at 8-9). During the storm, a flashflood warning was issued for Travis County, and Union Pacific sent track inspectors to inspect the Austin Subdivision. (Ashmore Dep., Dkt. 54-15, at 31:7-32:19; Castillo Dep., Dkt. 54-19, at 13:16-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due to the severity of the storm, the entire Austin Subdivision was taken out of service. (Ashmore Dep., Dkt. 54-15, at 31:19-24). Eventually, water levels overtopped most of the track adjacent to Arroyo Doble between milepost 191.39 (Bear Creek) and milepost 190.92 (Horsethief Trail). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CDM Smith Rep., Dkt. 54-6; Williams Dep., Dkt. 54-17, at 39:3-42:18). A portion of the track washed out,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and water flowed over the tracks and into Arroyo Doble, flooding some of the neighborhood and damaging homes in the process. (Williams Dep., Dkt. 54-17, at 39:3-42:18; Benedict Rep., Dkt. 54-26, at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Twenty-nine Arroyo Doble homeowners sued Union Pacific, alleging that it was negligent in its design, construction, inspection, and maintenance of the railroad embankment and ballast that aligns the neighborhood's western border. (2d Am. Compl., Dkt. 42, at 4-5). Plaintiffs allege that Union Pacific's negligence enabled the washout, caused the flood of the Arroyo Doble neighborhood, and damaged their homes and property as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff homeowners argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on both their negligence claim and Union Pacific's contributory negligence defense. (Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 56, at 3-4). Union Pacific argues that Plaintiffs' state-law negligence claim is preempted by the\n   Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 (\"ICCTA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Def.'s Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 63, at 3-8), and that Plaintiffs cannot establish the elements for their negligence claim because the October 2015 flood risk was not foreseeable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-14). Union Pacific also argues that there are material fact questions as to whether Plaintiffs contributed to the flooding, thus precluding summary judgment on its contributory negligence claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Negligence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that reasonable minds could not differ as to whether they have met each element for their negligence claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 56, at 4). Union Pacific disagrees. It argues that it did not owe a duty to Plaintiffs because the 2015 washout and resulting damage to the Arroyo Doble homes was not foreseeable. (Def.'s Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 63, at 9-10). Union Pacific also argues that there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether Union Pacific breached any duty owed to Plaintiffs and whether any alleged breach proximately caused the Plaintiffs' injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Assuming without deciding that a duty exists, Union Pacific has established the existence of a genuine issue for trial: whether the alleged breach of duty proximately caused Plaintiffs' injury.

(Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 56, at 10). In support of their claim, Plaintiffs offer a hydrology study by their expert hydrologist, Dr. Gerald Blackler (\"Blackler\"). (Blackler Study, Dkt. 56-2). Dr. Blackler's study relied on meteorological data produced by Union Pacific's meteorologist expert, Bryan Rappolt, the internal drainage design and maintenance guidelines and criteria for subdivisions, and the hydrologic modeling systems recommended by Union Pacific and industry standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4, 8-9, 11-12). Blackler's report sought to resolve the following question: \"What would be the extent of flooding after the October 30, 2015 storm event if [Union Pacific] had followed their standards, guidelines, and procedures for drainage design?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The study concluded that if the 100-year drainage design had been constructed before October 30, 2015, the Plaintiffs would have experienced either significantly reduced or no flooding. (Williams Rep., Dkt. 54-10, at 6). Plaintiffs conclude that \"[t]here is no evidence to contradict this result,\" (Pls.' Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 56, at\n   11), so they are entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   evidence that contradicts this result. In response to Plaintiffs' expert, Union Pacific presents the finding of its own expert, David Ashworth (\"Ashworth\"). (Def.'s Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 63, at 13). Ashworth disagrees that Blackler's proposed design would have reduced flooding; he says that Blackler failed to consider the runoff within the subdivision itself. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ashworth Rep., Dkt. 63-3, at 7-8; Blackler Dep., Dkt. 63-4, at 94:3-95:9). Union Pacific also argues that Blackler has no experience designing this type of drainage system for railroad embankments. (Def.'s Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 63, at 13 (citing Blackler Dep., Dkt. 63-4, at 31:9-22) ). Finally, Union Pacific argues that the 2013 washout did not require any track outage or loss of rail service, so the more substantial 2015 flood was not foreseeable. (Def.'s Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 63, at 13-14; Incident Rep., Dkt. 54-7; Incident Rep., Dkt. 54-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If Union Pacific's expert is believed, a reasonable juror could conclude that Blackler's design would not have reduced flooding in the area, and thus any alleged negligence by Union Pacific did not proximately cause the Plaintiffs' injury. Thus, the Court concludes that Union Pacific has met its burden to show that there is a genuine issue for trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec.

(Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 69, at 6-7 (citing Ashworth Report, Dkt. 69-2, at 10-11) ). Taken together, Union Pacific argues that these costs would be an unreasonable burden. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7). By contrast, Plaintiffs contend that the lack of drainage could be remedied at a reasonable cost, and so their claims do not unreasonably burden or interfere with railroad transportation. (Pls.' Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 64, at 14-15). As a result, Plaintiffs say their claims are not preempted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In essence, the parties offer competing visions for how Union Pacific could remedy any potential drainage issue, and different cost estimates to ensure adequate drainage. Plaintiffs' expert contends that his design would not unreasonably burden or interfere with rail transportation, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blackler Rep., Dkt. 54-10, at 7-9, 42-44), while Union Pacific's expert argues the opposite, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ashworth Rep., Dkt. 69-2, at 10-11). It is not clear, moreover, that Blackler's proposed solution is the only solution available. Additionally, although Union Pacific asserts that Blackler's proposed design would require the installation of culverts or a sufficient drainage system, Plaintiffs do not seek an injunction ordering Union Pacific to do so-they seek only monetary damages for their injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In light of these considerations, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims are more akin to the simple negligence claims that the Fifth Circuit has held are not preempted by federal law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Guild\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5717618\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/541/362/#p367\">\n    541 F.

In negligently excessive speed cases, the application of FRSA preemption is fairly straightforward. The federal government has imposed a speed limit for trains.

Compl., Dkt. 42, \u00b6 13). In their response, Plaintiffs clarified that they are not claiming that Union Pacific violated a federal standard of care. (Pls.' Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 64, at 5). Instead, Plaintiffs assert state law negligence claims based on violations of Union Pacific's internal standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In support of their claim, Plaintiffs argue that Union Pacific failed to comply with several Track Safety Standards, industry standards, and Union Pacific's internal rules. Union Pacific argues that \"the undisputed facts demonstrate\n   that Union Pacific complied with the maintenance obligations imposed by the Track Safety Standards at all times.\" (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Union Pacific fails to meet its burden to show that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' negligence claim. Although Union Pacific argues that it did not violate any duty under the Track Safety Standards, Plaintiffs have specifically named the source of Union Pacific's duty owed to them as \"a general duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to others.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 64, at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    El Chico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9970293\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/732/306/#p315\">\n    732 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   310-11 ) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Union Pacific does not argue whether it owed or breached this general duty. Instead, Union Pacific argues that because Plaintiffs' general-duty negligence claim is based on alleged violations of its internal standards and industry standards, it is preempted by federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 16-17; Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 69, at 2-8). But, as this Court concludes in this order, Plaintiffs' claims are not preempted. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section III.B.1). Union Pacific does not contest Plaintiffs' claims that it breached this general duty based on the internal and industry standards, or that breaching those standards proximately caused the flooding of Plaintiffs' homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, Union Pacific has not met its initial burden of \"informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 323,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 6, 19-20). There are three properties located directly on Onion Creek: (1) the Beasleys' property at 13010 Onion Creek Drive; (2) the Finneys' property at 13015 Stagecoach Way; and (3) the Herbins' property at 13007 Stagecoach Way. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207800\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/317/#p323\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Arroyo Doble Map, Dkt. 54-2, at 2). Union Pacific argues that these properties were flooded by waters from Onion Creek\n   and not as a result of the embankment. (Blackler Dep., Dkt. 54-16, at 147:22-148:22, 150:18-151:6). Union Pacific also notes that their properties were also flooded in October 2013 by waters from Onion Creek (Beasley Dep., Dkt. 54-20, at 16:17-17:22; Finney Dep., Dkt. 54-21, at 8:18-11:25; Finney Dep., Dkt. 54-22, at 8:13-10:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Blackler testified that it is highly unlikely that the washout of UPRR's embankment affected the properties. (Blackler Dep., Dkt. 54-16, 147:22-148:22, 150:18-151:6; Williams Dep., Dkt. 54-17, at 144:15-146:23, 152:6-14). As a result, Union Pacific argues that Plaintiffs cannot show that Union Pacific's alleged breach of duty proximately caused damages to these properties. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 19-20; Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 69, at 8-9). Plaintiffs offer no evidence, nor do they attempt to argue, that UPRR proximately caused flooding to these properties. In fact, Plaintiffs concede that under Blackler's modeling, the flooding of the Onion Creek homes belonging to the Beasleys, the Finneys, and the Herbins was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   caused by Union Pacific's failure to ensure sufficient drainage for the portion of its track adjacent to the Arroyo Doble neighborhood. (Pls.' Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 64, at 20-21). Thus, there is no dispute of any material fact regarding whether Plaintiffs can establish the proximate cause element for the Beasleys, the Finneys, or the Herbins. (Def.'s Reply Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 69, at 8). Accordingly, Union Pacific is entitled to summary judgment with respect to these plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. 42, at 5). But in their response to Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs specifically limit the scope of their complaint: they \"are not claiming that UPRR violated either a federal standard of care or an internal rule that was created pursuant to a federal regulation; Plaintiffs are claiming UPRR was negligent and UPRR's violations of its own internal standards provides evidentiary support for Plaintiffs' claims.\" (Dkt. 64, at 5;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20213.1\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20213.1\">\n     at 6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). As a result, the Court refrains from analyzing whether Union Pacific owed a duty under federal regulations or standards created pursuant to a regulation or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation, and whether it failed to act according to that duty.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020106\">\n     49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20106\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Union Pacific also argues it is entitled to summary judgment for the thirteen properties that would have flooded in October 2015 even if no railroad embankment existed. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 20; Williams Dep., Dkt. 54-17, at 140:7-142:17). Union Pacific relies on a hydraulic analysis of Plaintiffs' engineering expert, Dr. David Williams. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 54, at 20). Plaintiffs dispute the validity of the hypothetical scenario and point to Blackler's study to show that improved drainage alongside the embankment would have reduced flooding. (Pls.' Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 64, at 19-20). At best, there is a factual dispute regarding the degree to which Union Pacific's embankment contributed to the flooding of Plaintiffs' homes, so summary judgment for these thirteen properties is inappropriate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
