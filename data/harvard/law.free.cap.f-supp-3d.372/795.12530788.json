Section 2 of the Fair Sentencing Act increased the amount of cocaine base required to trigger a mandatory minimum of ten years from fifty grams to 280 grams. Sec. 2(a)(1), 124 Stat. at 2372;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)-(B) (2012). Applying the Fair Sentencing Act retroactively to Defendant, as directed by section 404 of the First Step Act, fifty grams of cocaine base is greater than twenty-eight grams but less than 280 grams, for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years with a mandatory four-year term of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B).

Under today's guidelines a quantity of 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine results in a base offense level of 32. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1). After a two-level enhancement for possession of a weapon and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, his final offense level is now 31. When combined with his criminal history category of V, Defendant's Guidelines range is now 168-210 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government in its resistance makes two arguments why Defendant is nonetheless not eligible for a sentence reduction under the First Step Act. First, that Supreme Court caselaw as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Apprendi v. New Jersey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n    570 U.S. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 108,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12699057\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/99/#p108\">\n    186 L.Ed.2d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), is not retroactive and therefore Defendant-who at sentencing was found responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine by a preponderance of the evidence-is subject to the enhanced mandatory minimum regardless of the drug quantities he pleaded guilty to.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 767 at 4. The First Step Act, however, applies to offenses and not conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 07-CR-245S (1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201054554\">\n    2019 WL 1054554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2019). Defendant's offense was conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A) (2006) as it then existed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 131. It is that offense that was affected by the Fair Sentencing Act, and that offense with which the First Step Act is concerned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Further, this argument rests on a misplaced equivalency with sentence reductions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), a narrow avenue limited by the U.S. Sentencing Commission through\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20994\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (o) and 994(u) and U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1B1.10. Such a reduction does not \"impose a new sentence in the usual sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    560 U.S. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). In contrast, section 404(b) of the First Step Act contains a broader grant of authority to \"impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\" were in effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alleyne\n   </em>\n   are binding on this Court for sentencings held today. That these procedural rules do not trigger a right to relief retroactively on collateral review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060279\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/568/#p574\">\n    810 F.3d 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574-75 (8th Cir. 2016), is distinct from whether they apply to proceedings independently authorized under the First Step Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, the Government argues that because Defendant's sentence was commuted by the President in 2016, Defendant no longer qualifies for relief within the meaning of the First Step Act. ECF No. 767 at 4-5. Although the Court is sensitive to the breadth of the Executive's clemency power, it is not infringed here. The executive clemency warrant specifically states that it commutes \"the total sentence of imprisonment\" but leaves \"intact and in effect for each named person the term of supervised release\n   <em>\n    imposed by the court\n   </em>\n   with all its conditions and all other components of each respective sentence.\" ECF No. 723 (emphasis added). In other words, the commutation changed the length of the term of imprisonment imposed but did not otherwise alter either the sentence or the crime of conviction. Defendant's offense of conviction remains a \"covered offense\"-a violation of the federal criminal law modified by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 committed before August 3, 2010-and this Court remains the \"court that imposed a sentence for [the] covered offense\" that is authorized to impose a new sentence under section 404 of the First Step Act. As a change in the sentence under the First Step Act does not purport to modify the commuted term of Defendant's sentence, or modify a condition added by the executive clemency warrant, the existence of a grant of clemency does not foreclose relief under the First Step Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biddle v. Perovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81252,1247951\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/274/480/\">\n    274 U.S. 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1247951\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/alaska-fed/5/359/\">\n    47 S.Ct. 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"81252\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/274/480/\">\n    71 L.Ed. 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927) (\"No one doubts that a reduction of the term of an imprisonment or the amount of a fine would limit the sentence effectively, on the one side, and, on the other, would leave the reduced term or fine valid and to be enforced.\"). Nor is the commutation \"the overturning of judgment of conviction by some other tribunal\" but \"[a]n executive action that mitigates or sets aside\n   <em>\n    punishment\n   </em>\n   for a crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon v.

In other words, the commutation \"shortened an existing sentence,\" it \"did not impose a new sentence\" that would place it outside the reach of the First Step Act.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But Defendant does not seek relief based on a prior version of his sentence. Instead, he seeks relief under the First Step Act for a sentence consistent with \"sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.\" He is eligible for relief even after his commutation, and his case is not moot. Nothing about the nature of the commutation prevents this Court's action when the commutation does not moot the legal issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201226856\">\n    2019 WL 1226856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (explaining commutation does not moot a First Step Act motion because \"there is relief available\" when a defendant \"has not yet served the remainder of his commuted sentence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Government also argues that, even if the governing law is such that Defendant is eligible for relief, this Court should exercise its discretion to deny a further reduction because the Government would have charged Defendant with the proper drug quantity had he been charged after the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act. ECF No. 767 at 5. The Court agrees with the Defendant that such a speculative claim is insufficient. Many things might have been different if this crime had been committed and charged years later or the Fair Sentencing Act had been passed years earlier, and the Court is unwilling to engage in a series of hypotheticals about what might have happened had aspects of the case been fundamentally altered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The First Step Act was passed by Congress, and signed by the President, in an effort to remedy the disproportionately harsh sentences imposed for crack cocaine offenses.

But a concurring opinion from another Circuit is not binding on this Court.
