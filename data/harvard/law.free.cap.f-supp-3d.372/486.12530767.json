BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-9\">The following facts are alleged in Plaintiff Consuelo Cervantes' Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), ECF No. 25, and, at this stage, are accepted by the Court as true. <em>See</em> <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">556 U.S. 662</extracted-citation>, 678, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">129 S.Ct. 1937</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">173 L.Ed.2d 868</extracted-citation> (2009). Plaintiff alleges she arrived at Defendant Providence Hospital at 6:59 a.m. on April 10, 2016, after Del Sol Hospital detected loops of bowel in a hernia but then told her \"to go to another hospital.\" SAC 2-3. Plaintiff alleges her blood pressure was low at 97/49 and her pulse rapid at 125 beats per minute, which are symptoms associated with shock. <em>Id.</em> at 3. A nurse categorized Plaintiff as a \"2\" on the Emergency Severity Index, meaning she had a \"high risk of deterioration, or a time-critical problem.\" <em>Id.</em> Given this categorization, Plaintiff asserts, Defendant's policy is to examine the patient on a frequent basis, and order several tests, including blood count, metabolic panel, blood sugar, and a CT scan, \"instantly or immediately.\" <em>Id.</em> at 5. Plaintiff claims a physician began an examination at 7:23 a.m. and never examined her again. <em>Id.</em> Further, even though Defendant possessed the capability to complete the tests within an hour, it did not. <em>Id.</em></p><p id=\"p-10\">At 12:36 p.m., about five and a half hours after Plaintiff arrived at the hospital, the physician ordered a CT scan. <em>Id.</em> The physician reviewed the results of the scan three hours later, at 3:41 p.m., which revealed \"air in the abdominal cavity and outside the intestines, fluid in the abdominal cavity outside the intestines, and a ventral hernia above the umbilical area containing loops of bowel.\" <em>Id.</em> at 5-6. Plaintiff then underwent surgery at 7:00 p.m. <em>Id.</em> at 6. She was admitted to intensive care for septic shock caused by necrotic and perforated bowel, and remained hospitalized from April 10, 2016, until May 19, 2016, when she was transferred to a rehabilitation center. <em>Id.</em> at 6-7.</p><p id=\"p-11\">Plaintiff filed suit in April 2018, and Defendant successfully moved to dismiss the first amended complaint. Order Granting Motion to Dismiss, October 29, 2018, ECF No. 20. This Court granted Defendant's motion to dismiss and allowed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint. <em>Id.</em> at 11. Plaintiff did so and claims Defendant's conduct violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (\"EMTALA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd (2017), by failing to \"appropriately screen Plaintiff to timely determine whether Plaintiff had an emergency medical condition\" because the hospital did not follow its own screening procedures. SAC 7. Defendant subsequently filed the instant Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that Plaintiff's EMTALA claim cannot succeed because, despite any alleged deviations from its screening procedure, she was admitted to the hospital and her emergency condition was identified.

Overview of EMTALA</strong></p><p id=\"p-19\">To prevent hospitals from rejecting, or \"dumping,\" indigent patients, Congress passed EMTALA and created specific duties for participating hospitals with emergency rooms. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd ; <em>Battle v. Mem'l Hosp. at Gulfport</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228037\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/544/#p557\">228 F.3d 544</extracted-citation>, 557 (5th Cir. 2000).

The Act, however, does not create a federal medical malpractice cause of action, and so neither does it set out a nationwide standard of care. <em>Marshall ex rel Marshall v. E. Carroll Par. Hosp.

The Act requires hospitals with emergency rooms to provide an \"appropriate medical screening within the capability of the hospital's emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(a). EMTALA does not define an \"appropriate medical screening examination,\" though it does specify the examination's purpose is to determine \"whether or not an emergency medical condition ... exists.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(a). What is \"appropriate\" in a given case depends upon the apparent severity of the symptoms and the capabilities of the hospital; that is, any screening examination must be \"reasonably calculated to determine whether or not an emergency condition exists.\" <em>Correa v.

This analysis gives deference to a hospital's own guidelines-since a hospital is required only to provide a screening that is within its capabilities-while ensuring hospitals do not employ invidious distinctions when applying their screening procedures. <em>See</em> <em>Guzman</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174046\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/637/464/#p481\">637 F.Supp.2d at 481-82</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-24\">Moreover, holding a hospital to its own screening procedures, even when a patient is later admitted, does not transform EMTALA into a federal malpractice statute.

But if tests A, B, and C are performed and the doctor evaluating the results draws an incorrect conclusion, a violation of EMTALA may not be established, but medical negligence may be.

Pa. 2018) (holding that patient's EMTALA screening-delay and negligence claims both survived though defendant hospital correctly diagnosed patient).</p><p id=\"p-31\">The cases which Defendant relies on to support the contention that correct diagnosis, admission, and treatment absolve hospitals of liability under EMTALA are unconvincing. First, Defendant relies <em>Benitez-Rodriguez v. Hospital Pavia Hato Rey, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3188050\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/588/210/\">588 F.Supp.2d 210</extracted-citation> (D.P.R. 2008) for the proposition that admission and treatment defeat a screening claim. Mot. 15. In <em>Benitez-Rodriguez</em> , the court dismissed the plaintiff's screening claim, reasoning it would \"border on the absurd to conclude that a hospital that has provided extensive emergency and inpatient care to an individual, failed to screen him or her as it would any other patient in his or her condition.\" <em>Benitez-Rodriguez</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3188050\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/588/210/\">588 F.Supp.2d at 216</extracted-citation>. The court adopted the logic of the Eleventh Circuit's decision in <em>Harry v. Marchant</em> , \"stating that admission precludes a stabilization claim\" and applied it to the plaintiff's screening claim. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3188050\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/588/210/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 215-16 (citing <em>Harry v.

But the Eleventh Circuit's task in <em>Harry II</em> was \"solely to determine the scope of EMTALA's stabilization requirement.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432319\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/767/#p769\">291 F.3d at 769</extracted-citation>. And it is clear that \"[t]he duty to appropriately screen is independent from the duty to stabilize.\" <em>Marrero</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9133136\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/253/179/#p195\">253 F.Supp.2d at 198</extracted-citation>. As the court in <em>Harry II</em> recognized, appropriate medical screenings are meant to \"guarantee patient entry into the medical system.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432319\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/767/#p769\">291 F.3d at 773</extracted-citation>. Moreover, \"[t]he essence of this requirement\" is that the screening policy \"be administered even-handedly.\" <em>Guzman</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4174046\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/637/464/#p481\">637 F.Supp.2d 464</extracted-citation> (citing <em>Correa</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413739\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/69/1184/#p1192\">69 F.3d at </extracted-citation>1192 ). Certainly, admission and treatment could tend to show the hospital treated the patient just as it would any other. Indeed, in <em>Benitez</em> , the plaintiff did not allege she was treated differently from other patients, only that the hospital erred in its initial diagnosis because of an inadequate screening. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3188050\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/588/210/\">588 F.Supp.2d at 216</extracted-citation>. But to the extent the <em>Benitez</em> court found eventual admission and treatment to be un-rebuttable proof of uniform treatment, the Court declines to follow that approach. Rather, the Court applies the Fifth Circuit's rule that disparate treatment supports an EMTALA screening claim. <em>See</em> <em>Fewins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12134491\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/662/327/#p331\">662 F.

Mot. 15. In <em>Harry v. Marchant</em> (\" <em>Harry I</em> \"), the Eleventh Circuit dismissed a screening claim. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11169597\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/1315/#p1319\">237 F.3d 1315</extracted-citation>, 1319 (11th Cir. 2001), <em>vacated, reh'g en banc</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9501649,9501636\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/1310/\">259 F.3d 1310</extracted-citation> (11th Cir. 2001), <em>reinstated in part on reh'g</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9432319\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/291/767/#p769\">291 F.3d 767</extracted-citation> (11th Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"496\" href=\"#p496\" id=\"p496\">*496</a>after the plaintiff's arrival to the hospital, she was correctly diagnosed with possible pulmonary embolism, but the hospital allegedly failed to perform a \"VQ scan\" because it required an isotope that was not in stock. <em>Id.</em> at 1316. Nonetheless, because the hospital admitted the patient after it \"conducted an initial screening examination and determined [the plaintiff] had an emergency condition, not with standing the lack of a VQ scan,\" the court concluded the allegations could not sustain a screening claim. <em>Id.</em> at 1319.</p><p id=\"p-33\">Similarly, in <em>Collins</em> , the Tenth Circuit granted the defendant hospital summary judgment because it provided an appropriate medical screening. <em>Collins v. DePaul Hosp.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">963 F.2d 303</extracted-citation>, 308 (10th Cir. 1992). The patient was unconscious when he arrived at the hospital. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\"> at 306</extracted-citation>. The hospital treated only his brain injury, failing to x-ray his hip to check for fractures. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Despite allegations that the delay in identifying his hip fracture caused harm, the court found the plaintiff's situation was \"<em>not</em> a case where the hospital failed to detect [his] emergency medical condition because of inappropriate screening procedures.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\"> at 308</extracted-citation>. Importantly though, the court did not read EMTALA to require identification of \"<em>all</em> of the emergency medical conditions.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 307 n.5. In addition, although it is unclear, it appears the court assumed the hospital was negligent, not that it violated its own standards: with no discussion of allegations of disparate treatment, the court assumed that \"ordinarily a person with [the plaintiff's] injuries would have had a hip X-ray upon his arrival.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 306 n.3.</p><p id=\"p-34\">In this case, rather than a quick diagnosis as in <em>Harry I</em> , Plaintiff alleges the identification of sepsis and necrotic bowel occurred more than eight hours after she was initially seen by a physician because Defendant failed to follow its screening policy. SAC 5-6; <em>see</em> <em>Harry I</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11169597\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/1315/#p1319\">237 F.3d at 1316</extracted-citation>. Further, it is unclear whether the court in <em>Collins</em> compared the hospital's actions to a reasonable standard of care or to its own policies, <em>see</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">963 F.2d at </extracted-citation>306 n.3, but here, Plaintiff specifically alleges Defendant failed to adhere to its own policies, SAC 5, 7. What is more, unlike in <em>Collins</em> , the allegations are not that Defendant failed to identify all of Plaintiff's medical emergencies, but that it did not identify any until Plaintiff's condition had already deteriorated to the point of causing \"numerous complications, including respiratory and renal failure.\" <em>Id.</em> at 6; <em>see</em> <em>Collins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297738\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/303/#p308\">963 F.2d at </extracted-citation>307 n.5. Because Plaintiff asserts straight forward allegations of disparate treatment premised on Defendant's failure to adhere to its screening guidelines, Plaintiff states a valid EMTALA screening claim, and Defendant's Motion is denied. <em>See</em> <em>Battle</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11228037\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/544/#p557\">228 F.3d at 557</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-35\"><strong>III. CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-36\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 22, is <strong>DENIED</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-37\"><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-40\">Defendant attached a medical treatment record to its motion to dismiss that it asserts would show Defendant provided Plaintiff with an appropriate medical screening. Mot. Ex. A. As the Court explained in its prior Order, the Court may consider documents attached to a motion to dismiss only if the documents are \"referred to in the plaintiff's complaint and are central to her claim.\" <em>See</em> Order Granting Motion to Dismiss 7; <em>Collins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236663\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/496/#p498\">224 F.3d at 498-99</extracted-citation>. The Court again does not consider the medical treatment record. Although the Complaint references the medical record, SAC 5, it is not central to Plaintiff's claims. <em>See</em> <em>Scanlan v. Tex. A &amp; M Univ.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096866\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/343/533/#p535\">343 F.3d 533</extracted-citation>, 535-39 (5th Cir. 2003). Unlike, for example, a contract in a contract dispute, considering the medical record would not \"dispose of the claim entirely\" because Plaintiff can cite other contradictory or contextualizing evidence. <em>See</em> <em>Crucci v. Seterus, Inc.</em> , No. EP-13-CV-317-KC, <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206146040\">2013 WL 6146040</extracted-citation>, at *6 (W.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2013). Accordingly, the Court does not consider the medical treatment record. <em>See</em> <em>Collins</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236663\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/496/#p498\">224 F.3d at 498-99</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-41\">Defendant also argues that as long as a medical screening examination begins promptly, any delays afterward do not give rise to liability. Mot. 12. Because the Court finds Plaintiff's complaint survives based on disparate treatment, it does not consider Defendant's delay argument.</p><p id=\"p-42\">Defendant, in relying on <em>Harry I</em> , did not indicate that the opinion has been vacated or explained the effect of the vacatur on the applicability of the decision. Mot. 15. Nevertheless, to the extent the opinion remains persuasive authority, the Court finds the present case distinguishable.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
