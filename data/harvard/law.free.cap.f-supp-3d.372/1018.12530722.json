For the reasons stated below, both motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff American Small Business League is a non-profit organization that\n   promotes the interests of small businesses. To that end, it focuses public attention on emerging issues for small businesses, reviews federal and state government policies and procedures to determine the potential impact on small businesses, and monitors federal contracts that are awarded to large corporations rather than to small businesses (Dkt. No. 1 \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Small Business Act mandates that the federal government encourage government contractors to subcontract to \"small disadvantaged businesses\" (\"SDB\"). Under regulations subsequently enacted to implement SDB goals, federal government contractors must submit a subcontracting plan as part of the bidding process for a potential contract award. And, defendant Department of Defense monitors contractor compliance with SDB goals (Buffler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Act normally requires prime contractors to submit \"Individual Subcontracting Plans\" for each contract to show how government contracts and subcontracts are awarded to small businesses. But in 1990, Congress passed the Test Program, thereby allowing certain large defense contractors to instead submit a single annual \"Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan\" for an entire plant, division, or company to identify all subcontract amounts awarded to small businesses on government contracts. Test Program participants must submit their Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan to the DOD each year for review and approval (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This action is related to a prior FOIA case,\n   <em>\n    American Small Business League v. Department of Defense\n   </em>\n   , Case No. C 14-02166 WHA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%206662427\">\n    2014 WL 6662427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.Cal. Nov. 23, 2014) (\"\n   <em>\n    ASBL I\n   </em>\n   \"). There, in August 2013, the same plaintiff requested Sikorsky's 2013 Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plan from the DOD pursuant to FOIA. The agency initially denied plaintiff's request on the basis that the requested document contained confidential commercial information and thus fell under FOIA's exemption under Section 552(b)(4). In March 2018, after years of litigation and a trip to our court of appeals, the government released the document over Sikorsky's objections (with the exception of limited redactions for private personal information under Section 552(b)(6) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As relevant to the instant motions, plaintiff now seeks GE Aviation's 2014 Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan. It also seeks all documents transmitted during\n   <em>\n    ASBL I\n   </em>\n   between the DOD or defendant Department of Justice and Lockheed Martin Corporation (including Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, a subsidiary of Lockheed) regarding the 2013 FOIA request, ASBL, Lloyd Chapman, the Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan Test Program (\"CSPTP\"), and the Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program (Dkt. No. 47 at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since plaintiff filed the instant action in March 2018, the government has produced responsive documents (along with\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indexes), subject to redactions (Dkt. No. 29 \u00b6 2). The government declared those redacted materials exempt under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)-(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties now cross-move for summary judgment on the government's redactions. The government moves to confirm the determinations of exemption (Dkt. No. 44). Plaintiff challenges the government's assertion of Exemptions 3-5 as follows (Dkt. No. 47 at 8; Olson Decl., Exh. D):\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) Redactions to GE's 2014 Comprehensive Subcontracting Plan pursuant to Exemption 4;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) Redactions to contractor past performance evaluations and Comprehensive Subcontracting Plans pursuant to Exemption 3 and 4; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (3) Redactions to communications between the government and Sikorsky's counsel during\n   <em>\n    ASBL I\n   </em>\n   pursuant to Exemption 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff also challenges the adequacy of the government's searches.

The government argues it conducted a reasonable search for relevant documents. This order agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the DOD and DOJ submitted declarations attesting to reasonable searches made pursuant to the parties' stipulated search plan for the relevant documents (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 29 \u00b6 5). Specifically, Mark Herrington (the DOD's associate deputy general counsel who oversees the DOD's FOIA litigation) explains how he and Janice Buffler (then associate director of the DOD Office of Small Business Programs)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   searched their files for documents transmitted between the DOD and Lockheed or Sikorsky for relevant documents. He further explains how the DOD searched the files of Tatia Bellamy-Vaughn and Lux Vazquez of the Defense Contract Management Agency, and Terry Sutherland - all pursuant to the stipulated agreement (Herrington Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6). Moreover, each of the attorneys at the DOJ involved in the\n   <em>\n    ASBL I\n   </em>\n   litigation also submitted declarations explaining how they searched their emails for responsive documents (Friday Decl. \u00b6 6; Kravitz Decl. \u00b6 8; London Decl. \u00b6 12; Simmons Decl. \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff counters that after notifying the government of an \"unexplained gap\" in the FOIA response, the government produced two more responsive documents not previously identified (Dkt. No. 47 at 10). The government explained that it had missed those documents due to an error \"in the de-duplicating process\" and an accidental deletion by one of the government's attorneys (Olson Decl., Exh. Y). The government also volunteered to conduct additional searches \"as quickly as [it] can\" to check for any other potential errors made during the de-duplicating process. Plaintiff further asserts that when it flagged an additional defect in the government's production, the government produced another document \"inadvertently marked as a duplicate\" one day before plaintiff's brief was due (but just two days after plaintiff raised the issue) (\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ). The government again volunteered to run another search. Plaintiff now complains of other potential gaps in the government's FOIA response and wonders aloud whether there are other documents the government's searches potentially missed (Dkt. No. 47 at 10-11). As such, it requests that the government (both the DOJ and DOD) be ordered to redo the entire search, specifically for \"deleted\" responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"[T]he failure to produce or identify a few isolated documents cannot by itself prove the searches inadequate.\"\n   <em>\n    Lahr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660814\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/569/964/#p973\">\n    569 F.3d at 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As our court of appeals has repeatedly stated, plaintiff was \"entitled to a reasonable search for records, not a perfect one. And a reasonable search is what [it] got.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332104\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/797/759/#p772\">\n    797 F.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (9th Cir. 2015). Here, the government readily acknowledged certain missing documents once notified by plaintiff and promptly took steps to address the errors, including voluntarily redoing its search for documents from custodians located within the United States Attorney's Office and offering ways of building in more time for plaintiff to respond if it felt prejudiced by the timing (Olson Decl., Exh. Y; London Suppl. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5; Second Herrington Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). This order finds that the government's submitted declarations establish that its searches were reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. Plaintiff's speculative claim of potentially missing documents fail to create a genuine dispute. And, to the extent there remains doubt regarding missing documents, the government has already volunteered to run relevant searches again (Dkt. No. 55 at 2). Accordingly, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment as to the adequacy of the government's search is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and the government's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The dispute therefore boils down to the precise scope of the provision, as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As an initial matter, the DOD failed to individually mark the redacted information as \"source selection information,\" as explicitly\n   required under the PIA (Dkt.

The government contends that post-contract performance evaluations play an informative role in awarding future procurement bids and therefore treats all performance evaluations as confidential \"source selection information\" (Buffler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13). In other words, according to the government, \"[a]ll evaluations have the unique characteristic of always being pre-decisional in nature\" and thus fall within the purview of the PIA (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The government's broad assertion that it can withhold the redacted information effectively\n   <em>\n    ad infinitum\n   </em>\n   , however, eviscerates any distinction between\n   <em>\n    pre\n   </em>\n   - and\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   -award of a contract - a distinction the PIA clearly contemplates - thereby rendering the statutory language \"before the award\" meaningless. Nor would such a blanket definition be \"information marked as 'source selection information' based on a\n   <em>\n    case-by-case\n   </em>\n   determination\" under Section 2101(7)(J).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Legal and Safety Employer Research, Inc. v.

Instead, the current record shows that the government applied Section 2101(7)(J) generally - stating simply \"Lockheed is a regular competitor for Federal contracts\" and speculating that release of its past performance details \"could\" affect the source selection process - rather than on a case-by-case basis, as the PIA requires (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 48 at 7; Buffler Suppl. Decl. \u00b6 4). Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the post-contract performance evaluations were specifically \"prepared for use\" by the government for the purpose of evaluating a specific bid or proposal to enter into a contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202101\">\n    41 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7).

Plaintiff counters with its own declaration by William Shook, an alleged government contracts expert, who states that because these companies' businesses rely heavily upon federal contracts, and because the plans are mandatory, \"noncompliance with\n   the requirements for the submission, negotiation, and performance of a small business subcontracting plan is not an option if [contractors] want to do business with the U.S. government\" (Shook Decl. \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the government further argues that disclosure would cause substantial competitive harm.

In short, there are a number of items in the record suggesting that DOJ may not have decided to partner with RIM in the BlackBerry litigation much before November 2005.
