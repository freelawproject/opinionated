[ECF No. 220 ]. Following limited discovery, briefing, and an evidentiary hearing on August 2 and 3, 2018, Judge Otazo-Reyes issued her report finding that Plaintiff has no standing and recommending that the Court dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (the \"Report\") [ECF No. 636 ]. Plaintiff has timely objected to the Report [ECF No. 646 ].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A.

According to the Amended Complaint, Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   conspired to deprive PDVSA of competitive prices for the sale and purchase of oil products and additives causing billions of dollars in damages. [ECF No. 12 ]. Based on these allegations, PDVSA has standing to bring the claims against Defendants. However, for reasons too speculative to address in this Order, PDVSA assigned its interest in the claims to Plaintiff PDVSA US Litigation Trust (\"Plaintiff\") via a Litigation Trust Agreement (the \"Trust Agreement\"). [ECF No. 517-4 ]. Without this assignment, Plaintiff has no standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Assignees, in general, may obtain Article III standing by virtue of a valid assignment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sprint Commc'n Co., L.P. v.

The assignment in this action, however, is of questionable authenticity and legality. Indeed, the very individuals who could testify as to the authenticity of their signatures on the Trust Agreement are unavailable, in part, due to political unrest in Venezuela.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, even if Plaintiff could authenticate the Trust Agreement, it violates New York's ban on champerty. Finally, the Venezuelan National Assembly has declared that the Trust Agreement is invalid and unconstitutional. This unequivocal declaration by the only governing body in Venezuela recognized by the United States, the questionable authority of the Venezuelan officials who signed the Trust Agreement, and the political unrest in Venezuela exemplify the problems with Plaintiff's purported standing. While the Court is mindful of the suffering of the people of Venezuela\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and severity of the allegations against Defendants, it cannot create standing where there is none.

Admissibility of the Trust\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court agrees with the Report's finding that the Trust Agreement is inadmissible. The Trust Agreement contains five signatures: (1) Alexis Arellano, the PDVSA Appointed Litigation Trustee; (2) Edward P. Swyer, a US Law Firm Appointed Litigation Trustee; (3) Vincent Andrews, a US Law Firm Appointed Litigation Trustee; (4) Nelson Mart\u00ednez, the former Venezuelan Petroleum Minister; and (5) Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz Pedroza, the Venezuelan Procurador General. Only Mr. Andrews and Mr. Swyer, the US Law Firm appointees, acknowledged their signatures on the Trust Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was unable to authenticate the other three signatures, including anyone with authority to take action on behalf of PDVSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Arellano never acknowledged his signature and never appeared for deposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just before the hearing, Plaintiff submitted an acknowledgement of signature and apostille for Mr. Pedroza. However, Defendants were not able to depose Mr. Pedroza because, according to Plaintiff, then President Maduro had restricted the travel of government officials. Because Defendants were not provided the opportunity to depose Mr. Pedroza as to his eleventh-hour acknowledgment, Judge Otazo-Reyes excluded it from consideration. Finally, at the hearing, Plaintiff attempted to introduce Mr. Martinez's alleged acknowledgement of his signature, signed on August 1, 2018, one day before the hearing. On Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   motion, Judge Otazo-Reyes excluded the acknowledgement as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff then tried to authenticate the signatures on the Trust Agreement via the testimony of George Carpinello, Plaintiff's counsel. Judge Otazo-Reyes properly precluded Mr. Carpinello from testifying.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Putman v.

Finally, Plaintiff endeavored to authenticate the signatures via a handwriting expert, Ruth Brayer. The Court agrees with the Report's finding that Ms. Brayer's proffered opinions do not meet\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   standards. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to establish the admissibility of the Trust Agreement. Without an admissible Trust Agreement, Plaintiff cannot establish its Article III standing and this action must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Sanctions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Judge Otazo-Reyes also excluded the Trust as a sanction for Plaintiff's failure to comply with standing discovery. While the Court acknowledges Plaintiff's repeated discovery violations, often followed by dubious excuses, it does not find that the violations warrant the extreme sanction of excluding the Trust Agreement. This issue, however, is moot, as the Court finds the Trust Agreement inadmissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Trust is Void under New York Law on Champerty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court agrees with the Report's finding that, even if it were admissible, the assignment in the Trust Agreement is void under New York law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   New York's champerty statute expressly prohibits the assignment of claims \"with the intent and for the primary purpose of bringing a law-suit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Justinian Capital SPC v.

Here, the \"primary purpose\" of the Trust Agreement \"is to facilitate the prosecution and resolution of the Assigned Actions and to liquidate the Liquidation Trust Assets with no objective to continue or engage in the conduct of a trade or business.\" [ECF No. 517-4 ]. Indeed, only 34% of any recovery goes to PDVSA. The remaining 66% is split between Plaintiff's lawyers, investigator, and financier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The clear purpose of the Trust Agreement was to bring this lawsuit - with\n   attorneys and investors as the primary beneficiaries. As a result, the Trust Agreement is void under New York law and cannot provide a basis for Plaintiff's standing to bring this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite the choice of law provision in the Trust Agreement, Plaintiff argues that New York law does not apply where the transferred claims are federal claims. This objection is without merit. Federal courts have applied New York's champerty ban to federal claims filed in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Koro Company, Inc. v.

Venezuelan Law and the Act of State Doctrine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Judge Otazo-Reyes, relying on the testimony of Professor Jose Ignacio Hernandez, found that the Trust Agreement was void under Venezuelan law because it was a \"public order obligation\" that could not be transferred to third parties. [ECF No. 570-2, \u00b6 85 ]. Plaintiff has now offered an untimely expert report to rebut Professor's Hernandez's opinions. In light of the Court's dispositive rulings as to the admissibility of the Trust Agreement and New York's champerty law, it declines to make a formal ruling on Venezuelan law. However, the Court notes that the National Assembly's declaration that the Trust Agreement is unconstitutional certainly lends credence to Judge Otazo-Reyes's recommendation. Indeed, if the Court were to hold otherwise, it would be ruling in direct contravention to a resolution by a foreign sovereign - likely in violation of the Act of State doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Act of State doctrine prevents courts from adjudicating an action where \"the relief sought or the defense interposed ... require[s] a court in the United States to declare invalid the official act of a foreign sovereign performed within its own territory.\"\n   <em>\n    W.S.

Subsequently, on January 23, 2019, the United States recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the Interim President of Venezuela and reaffirmed its recognition of the National Assembly as Venezuela's only legitimate branch of government.
