Local Rule 56.1 creates a procedure for presenting facts that a party contends are material at summary judgment. Specifically, Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) requires a party moving for summary judgment to submit \"a statement of material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine issue and that entitle the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Cracco v.

Ill. 2018) (Gottschall, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties also raise several evidentiary objections that need not be resolved because they do not concern alleged disputes that are material at summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526039\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1004/#p1019\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Spiegel raises a hearsay objection. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 47. EngageTel separately asks the court to strike several paragraphs of Spiegel's statement of additional facts on relevance grounds (\u00b6\u00b6 93, 98), hearsay grounds, and authentication grounds (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85, 90, 98, 99, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 117). To the extent necessary, the court makes relevance and materiality determinations\n   <em>\n    infra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Due to the numerous Local Rule 56.1 violations, the fact statements have become unwieldy and voluminous. For instance, defendants' response to paragraph 99 of Spiegel's statement of additional facts spans 18 pages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-35. Spiegel shares part of the blame for the length of the response, however, because he used 16 lettered sub-paragraphs in \u00b6 99 to skirt the 40-paragraph limit on his Local Rule 56.1(b)(3) statement of additional facts. Defendants are not immune to this method of ballooning the fact statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 19, 35 (breaking fact into four and five sub-paragraphs), ECF No. 170. Indeed, paragraph 35 is broken into 12 sub-paragraphs labeled (a) through (l). Given the needs of this case, the court considers these to be examples of excessive use of sub-paragraphing in violation of Local Rule 56.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benuzzi v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049099\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/652/#p655\">\n    647 F.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655-56 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"[W]hat is 'short' to one judge may be long to another, and a single judge's definition might reasonably vary from case to case.\");\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526039\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1004/#p1019\">\n    319 F.Supp.3d at 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court nevertheless exercises its discretion not to strike the fact statements. EngageTel urges the court to strike \u00b6\u00b6 110-20 of Spiegel's fact statement for exceeding the 40-paragraph limit. Those paragraphs, as well as several others, describe other alleged complaints and investigations the court concludes are not necessary to its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The court therefore need not attempt to determine the proper remedy for either party's use of excessive sub-paragraphing because the court can simply focus on the material facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The purpose of Local Rule 56.1 is \"to have the litigants present to the district court a clear, concise list of material facts that are central to the summary judgment determination.\"\n   <em>\n    Curtis v. Costco Wholesale Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363555\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/215/#p219\">\n    807 F.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219 (7th Cir. 2015). The fact statements here hardly further that purpose. Nevertheless, the material issues turn out to be relatively discrete, and so the court determines that the parties' best interests would be served by cutting through the thicket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Unless stated otherwise, the court sets forth the facts in the light most favorable to Spiegel, the nonmoving party.

Ill. Sept. 29, 2016), available at ECF No. 134. While many details have been added, the basic picture of the facts remains the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no dispute that Spiegel received unwanted phone calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 59-62, 66-75. During discovery, Spiegel identified 87 calls he received that he associates with EngageTel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Seven of the calls could not have come from the EngageTel-related phone numbers, however, and the date of an eighth call raises at least a factual dispute over whether it can be associated with EngageTel.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. Giving Spiegel the benefit of the doubt leaves approximately 81 calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The TCPA dispute here primarily concerns whether EngageTel's role subjects it to liability for those 81 calls. Understanding this dispute requires a close examination of the relationship among several people and companies involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Arash Akhavan (\"Akhavan\") (who has settled) used an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS) to place the calls Spiegel received. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 10, 15, 79. An entity referred to as \"Leads Direct\" owned and operated the ATDS Akhavan used to call Spiegel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.

This much is undisputed: Akhavan signed a master services agreement (using an alias) with EngageTel on October 12, 2012, and January 7, 2013. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.'

SUMF \u00b6 23 (citing Carlson Dep. 5:7-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to Carlson, EngageTel's virtual phone numbers facilitated his telemarketing clients' efforts to maintain their do-not-call lists by giving the called parties a number they could call and ask to be removed from the telemarketer's list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.

Resp. to Pl.'s Stmt. of Add'l Fact \u00b6 83. It is undisputed that EngageTel makes money from \"dip\" fees (i.e., the fraction of a cent generated when a customer uses one of its virtual phone numbers and another phone company looks up the Caller ID information). Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 30-31. EngageTel shares \"dip fee\" revenues with its customers, including Akhavan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37; Defs.'

The FCC 2015 Ruling Applies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   When briefing on the instant motion began, the parties disagreed about whether a 2015 declaratory ruling of the FCC,\n   <em>\n    In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2015 Declaratory Ruling)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    30 FCC Rcd. 7961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), controls. In its 2015 ruling the FCC, among other things, \"clarif[ied] who makes a call under the TCPA and is thus liable for any TCPA violations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    at 7978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FCC identified several factors to guide a \"totality of the circumstances\" inquiry as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   29. The intent of Congress, when it established the TCPA in 1991, was to protect consumers from the nuisance, invasion of privacy, cost, and inconvenience that autodialed and prerecorded calls generate. Congress found that consumers consider these kinds of calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy; that businesses also complain that these kinds of calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce; and that banning such calls, except when made for an emergency purpose or when the called party consents to receiving the call, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion. Congress therefore put the responsibility for compliance with the law directly on the party that \"makes\" or \"initiates\" automated and prerecorded message calls. As the Commission recognized in the\n   <em>\n    DISH Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   , neither the TCPA nor the Commission's rules define \"make\" or \"initiate,\" nor do they establish specific factors to be considered in determining who makes or initiates a call, but noted that \"initiate\" suggests some \"direct connection between a person or entity and the making of a call.\" In issuing the guidance that we provide today, we account for changes in calling technology that inure to the benefit of consumers while fulfilling the intent of Congress to prohibit nuisance calls that cause frustration and harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   30. Specifically, a \"direct connection between a person or entity and the making of a call\" can include \"tak[ing] the steps necessary to physically place a telephone call.\" It also can include being \"so involved in the placing of a specific telephone call\" as to be deemed to have initiated it. Thus, we look to the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the placing of a particular call to determine: 1) who took the steps necessary to physically place the call; and 2) whether another person or entity was so involved in placing the call as to be deemed to have initiated it, considering the goals and purposes of the TCPA. In discussing below how these standards apply in the context of factual circumstances presented in petitions before us, we identify factors that are relevant to the\n   <em>\n    DISH Declaratory Ruling\n   </em>\n   analysis. Depending upon the facts of each situation, these and other factors, such as the extent to which a person willfully enables fraudulent spoofing of telephone numbers or assists telemarketers in blocking Caller ID, by offering either functionality to clients, can be relevant in determining liability for TCPA violations. Similarly, whether a person who offers a calling platform service for the use of others has knowingly allowed its client(s) to use that platform for unlawful purposes may also be a factor in determining whether the platform provider is so involved in placing the calls as to be deemed to have initiated them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n    at 7979-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and internal quotations omitted).

Spiegel spent $ 70 for the phone equipment. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' SUMF \u00b6 72.
