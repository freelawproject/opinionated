Suddaby, Chief U.S. District Judge\n   Currently before the Court, in this employment discrimination action filed by Christine Gibson (\"Plaintiff\") against the New York State Office of Mental Health (\"NYSOMH\"), the Central New York Psychiatric Center (\"CNYPC\"), and John Doe(s) and Jane Doe(s) (collectively \"Defendants\"), are the following two motions: (1) Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second claim in her Amended Complaint, alleging that Defendants discriminated against her in matters related to employment in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"); and (2) Plaintiff's cross-motion to remand this action to state court. (Dkt. Nos. 35, 37.) For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted, and Plaintiff's cross-motion for remand is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. RELEVANT BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Generally, in her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that she worked as a Security Hospital Treatment Assailant (\"SHTA\") for NYSOMH and CNYPC, and was discriminated against because of her gender and age. (Dkt. No. 2 [Pl.'s Am. Compl.].) Following the Court's Decision and Order of April 24, 2018, and its Amended Decision and Order of August 13, 2018, two claims remain in this action: (1) Plaintiff's claim that Defendants willfully denied her request for leave to care for her daughter under the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") on or after February 28, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-22); and (2) Plaintiff's claim that Defendants discriminated against her in matters related to her employment because of her gender and age in violation of the NYSHRL (specifically, that Defendants denied her request for a hardship accommodation in the form of a shift change in order to allow her to care for her grandsons, of whom she became the legal custodian in October 2015, while granting hardship accommodations for younger male employees, including other SHTAs) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-13, 23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Parties' Briefing on Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendants' Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Generally, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's second claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, because she has failed to allege facts plausibly suggesting that she suffered an adverse employment action. (Dkt. No. 35, Attach. 4, at 3-7 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) More specifically, Defendants argue that the denial of a requested shift change does not constitute\n   an adverse employment action under governing law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) They argue that claims under the NYSHRL are analyzed under the same framework as federal discrimination claims raised pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), and that the Court has already dismissed Plaintiff's Title VII and ADEA claims in this action, for failure to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Generally, in her opposition to this motion, Plaintiff argues that she has alleged facts plausibly suggesting an adverse action by Defendants, in support of her second claim. (Dkt. No. 37, Attach. 2, at 7-10 [Pl.'s Opp. Mem. of Law].) She argues that courts have found that a shift change disrupting an employee's childcare might constitute an adverse action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.) She further argues that her second claim thus satisfies the pleading requirements at this early stage of the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Plaintiff alternatively requests that, should the Court find that she has not alleged sufficient facts to allege an adverse action, she be permitted an opportunity to further amend her Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendants' Reply Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Generally, Defendants assert three arguments in reply to Plaintiff's arguments. (Dkt. No. 38, at 3-5 [Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law].) First, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's reliance on cases in which an employer changed an employee's work schedule, and thereby interfered with existing childcare or other responsibilities, is misplaced. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) They argue that in this case, Plaintiff is alleging that only Defendants' failure to change her schedule is an adverse action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff's second claim does not allege facts plausibly suggesting that Defendants' refusal to grant her request for a shift change objectively caused a negative effect that would rise to the level of an adverse action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, Defendants reiterate their argument that the legal standard for an adverse action is the same under New York State law as it is under relevant federal law (such as Title VII and the ADEA), and assert that they have found no New York State court decisions holding that denial of a shift change request rises to the level of an adverse employment action under New York State law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Parties' Briefing on Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Remand to State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In her opposition memorandum of law, Plaintiff also submitted a cross-motion to remand this action to New York State Supreme Court. (Dkt. No. 37, Attach. 2, at 3-7 [Pl.'s Opp. Mem. of Law].) Generally, in support of her cross-motion, Plaintiff relies upon the doctrine that a federal court should refrain from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims when it has already dismissed the claims over which it had original jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Opposition Memorandum of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, in their opposition to this cross-motion, Defendants argue that this Court still has original jurisdiction over Plaintiff's first claim, which alleges a violation of a federal statute, the FMLA. (Dkt. No. 38, at 4-5 [Defs. Reply Mem. of Law].) Therefore, Defendants argue, there is no reason for this Court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state law claim, and Plaintiff's motion for\n   remand to state court should be denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. GENERAL LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Remand to State Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After a case has been removed from state court, a district court has a \"continuing obligation to satisfy [itself] that federal jurisdiction over the matter before [it] is proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Shantz v. Union-Endicott Central School Dist.\n   </em>\n   , 18-CV-1315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20330510\">\n    2019 WL 330510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D.N.Y.

Contemporary Classics of Beverly Hills\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9498274\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/259/123/#p126\">\n    259 F.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (2d Cir. 2001) (collecting cases). It has long been understood that a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), can be based on one or both of two grounds: (1) a challenge to the \"sufficiency of the pleading\" under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) ; or (2) a challenge to the legal cognizability of the claim.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v. Onondaga Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 211 nn. 15-16 (N.D.N.Y. 2008) (McAvoy, J.) (adopting Report-Recommendation on\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because such dismissals are often based on the first ground, some elaboration regarding that ground is appropriate. Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a pleading contain \"a\n   <em>\n    short and plain\n   </em>\n   statement of the claim\n   <em>\n    showing\n   </em>\n   that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) [emphasis added]. In the Court's view, this tension between permitting a \"short and plain statement\" and requiring that the statement \"show[ ]\" an entitlement to relief is often at the heart of misunderstandings that occur regarding the pleading standard established by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the one hand, the Supreme Court has long characterized the \"short and plain\" pleading standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) as \"simplified\" and \"liberal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   212 n.20 (citing Supreme Court case). On the other hand, the Supreme Court has held that, by requiring the above-described \"showing,\" the pleading standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires that the pleading contain a statement that \"give[s] the defendant\n   <em>\n    fair notice\n   </em>\n   of what the plaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   212 n.17 (citing Supreme Court cases) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Supreme Court has explained that such\n   <em>\n    fair notice\n   </em>\n   has the important purpose of \"enabl[ing] the adverse party to answer\n   and prepare for trial\" and \"facilitat[ing] a proper decision on the merits\" by the court.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565657\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/549/204/\">\n    549 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   212 n.18 (citing Supreme Court cases) ;\n   <em>\n    Rusyniak v.

(Dkt. No. 2, at \u00b6\u00b6 9-12 [Pl.'s Am. Compl.].) This allegation does not rise to the level of an adverse action under the NYSHRL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Therefore, the Court finds that Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's second claim should be granted. The only claim remaining in this action is Plaintiff's first claim, i.e., her claim that Defendants violated the FMLA when they willfully denied Plaintiff's request for leave to care for her daughter on or after February 28, 2013. (Dkt. No. 2, at \u00b6\u00b6 17-22 [Pl.'s Am. Compl.].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

(Dkt. No. 37, Attach. 2, at 11-12 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff made a similar request in response to Defendants' successful motion to dismiss her Title VII and ADEA claims. (Dkt. No. 13, Attach. 3, at 11.) The Court's Amended Decision and Order of August 13, 2008, set out the legal standards applicable to such a request. (Dkt. No. 33, at 16-18 [Am. Decision and Order, filed August 13, 2018].) Because the parties' motion papers demonstrate an accurate understanding of those relevant legal standards, the Court will not repeat them in this Decision and Order, which is intended primarily for the review of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In her request for leave to amend her second claim, Plaintiff has failed to provide any indication of how she would attempt to cure the pleading deficiencies discussed above in Part III.B of this Decision and Order, if granted leave to amend. Plaintiff has merely repeated the same vague allegations as in her Amended Complaint, i.e., that she required a shift change to accommodate her child care needs as a result of becoming custodian of her grandsons; she did not elaborate on what those obligations entailed or what hardships she faced as a result of her current shift. (Dkt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   No. 37, Attach. 2, at 7-11 [Pl.'s Opp'n Mem. of Law].) Moreover, the Court has been unable to find any cases from within the Second Circuit or from New York State courts holding that failure to grant a request for a shift change constitutes an adverse action. In fact, those cases that address the issue have held the opposite.
