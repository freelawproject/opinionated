Spears (\"Spears\"). The parties have thoroughly presented the facts and briefed the legal issues. Therefore, the Court declines to set this matter for oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LRCiv 7.2(f); 27A Fed.Proc., L.Ed. \u00a7 62:367 (March 2016) (\"A district court generally is not required to hold a hearing or oral argument before ruling on a motion.\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Spears attended the 2017 Festival of Books on the University of Arizona (\"UA\") campus mall (\"UA Mall\") on March 17, 2017. Within minutes of arriving on campus, \"booming sound amplification immersed Spears.\" Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") (Doc. 7, \u00b6 33). Spears put on his GoPro, amplification system, headset microphone, placed Gospel signs around a tree, held one Gospel sign, and began to speak at approximately 12:20 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Within seven minutes, Rebekah Salcedo (\"Salcedo\"), a UA \"First Amendment Monitor,\" approached and said, \"I'm going to ask you to turn off your microphone. The only sound permission for the Festival are the sound stages. You can certainly be here and talk with people but not with the microphone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35. She further stated, \"The permit for this weekend for the\n   sound stages were given to the sound stages. There is no permits for amplified sound[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. When Spears disagreed with \"Salcedo's arbitrary interpretation of the long-standing weekend UA policy allowing amplification being superseded by the presence of the Festival[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38, Salcedo replied, \"No, it is not arbitrary because the Festival of Books reserved the stage and the sound licenses for this weekend were given to the stages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39. The FAC alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   84. Though the UA admits that sound amplification is allowed on the weekends, they adopt a curious policy for banning all amplified speech from either UA students or the public during the Festival. In fact, no one without a permit can amplify sound during the Festival except those who are officially part of it: the authors, musicians, non-profits, vendors, etc.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   85. The UA accomplishes this permitting scheme through an ad hoc, unwritten and unnamed policy referred to as the \"sound amplification policy\" and is only applicable once a year during the Festival.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   86. Though UA officials refer to this vague policy when denying students and the public's first amendment right to amplify during the Festival, they cannot produce official documentation detailing precisely what this policy states-it does not exist except, perhaps, in a single section on a Mall form titled, \"The University of Arizona Commercial and Campus Use Activity Form.\"\n   <sup>\n    11\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <sup>\n    11\n   </sup>\n   https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9m1G5k2wXI6TDB6QzJaaW1uQnJPZ1hpSU5vajBuU2tYR0Jj[.] See middle of page 1, \"Sound Amplification?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FAC (Doc. 7, \u00b6\u00b6 84-86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dean of Students Kathy Adams Riester (\"Riester\") arrived several minutes later.

University of Arizona Police Department (\"UAPD\") Officer Ian Theel (\"Theel\") advised Spears that, if he continued to speak using amplification, he would face arrest if he failed to obey Riester. After Spears continued to speak using amplification, Spears was arrested. Spears was subsequently stripped of his possessions and placed in the police cruiser of UAPD Officer Picktrom (\"Picktrom\"). Picktrom transported Spears to the Pima County Adult Detention Center. Spears was held for nine hours. On March 28, 2018, Spears was found guilty of third-degree criminal trespass. Spears has appealed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On March 8, 2018, Spears filed a civil rights Complaint (Doc. 1) with this Court. On May 29, 2018, Spears filed his FAC (Doc. 7). The FAC lists the Arizona Board of Regents (\"ABOR\"), Brian Seastone (\"Seastone\") in his official capacity as\n   Chief of Police for the University, Greg Ewer (\"Ewer\"), individually and in his official capacity as police officer for the UAPD, Theel, individually and in his official capacity as police officer for the UAPD; Picktrom, individually and in his official capacity as police officer for the UAPD, Riester, individually and in her official capacity as Dean of Students for the UA, as Defendants. Spears alleges claims of Count I, violation of freedom of speech, Count II, violation of due process clause, Count III, violation of Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, Count IV, intentional infliction of emotional distress, Count V, abuse of process, Count VI, false light, Count VII, violation of Fourth Amendment - arrest without probable cause, and Count VIII, false arrest/false imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 5, 2018, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 27). Spears has filed a response (Doc. 31) and Defendants have filed a reply (Doc. 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 18, 2018, Spears filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. 35). Defendants have filed a response (Doc. 38) and Spears has filed a reply (Doc. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Requirement that Action State a Claim on Which Relief Can be Granted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants assert Spears has failed to state a claim against them. A complaint is to contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). A complaint must set forth a set of facts that serves to put defendants on notice as to the nature and basis of the claim(s).

The Court also considers that the Supreme Court has cited\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   for the traditional proposition that \"[s]pecific facts are not necessary [for a pleading that satisfies Rule 8(a)(2) ]; the statement need only 'give the defendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

The UA Policy states that \"amplified sound is restricted to prevent unreasonable interference with or disruption to normal Campus activities[.]\" MTD, Ex. A, \u00a7 J(1)(c). The normal Campus activities included a reserved space - in this case, the Festival of Books. Spears has alleged he was informed the reservation included the only permission to amplify sound.

Indeed, as pointed out by Defendants, if Spears is correct that any person could constitutionally use amplified speech at this special event, \"then that right would extend to everyone-that is, the University could not prohibit anyone who showed up with an amplifier from broadcasting their speech. With this premise, it does not take a great leap of the imagination to see the chaos that could ensue.\" MTD Reply (Doc. 34, p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Spears argues, however, that this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Gathright v.

In other words, it is not that the policy is vague, but that Spears and other non-Festival of Books affiliates, were not permitted to apply for a permit to amplify sound under the policy. This does not allege the policy is vague, but that Spears objects to the policy limiting permits to those affiliated with the Festival of Books. Although the FAC conclusorily alleges the UA Policy is vague and lacks \"sufficient objective standards to\n   curtail the discretion of UA officials and police officers, FAC (Doc. 7, \u00b6 198), the FAC does not allege facts to support these conclusory allegations.

In this case, the UA created a forum for the Festival of Books. Spears has not alleged that he was part of the Festival of Books organization.
