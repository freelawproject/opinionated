Pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, the Court (Tauro, J.) imposed a sentence of 180 months in prison. Baptiste now moves for a sentence reduction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2), which the Government opposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following the two-step approach to proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), I must first determine whether Baptiste is eligible for a sentence modification and the extent of the reduction authorized by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dillon v.

The Government does not contest that he is eligible for a sentence modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612221\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1765/#p1775\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1775,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612221\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1765/#p1775\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (holding that a defendant sentenced pursuant to a C-plea qualifies for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction if the\n   Guidelines range \"was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement\"). Under U.S.S.G. Amendment 782, his revised total offense level is 31. With a criminal history category of IV, his reduced guideline sentencing range is 151 to 188 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Second, I must consider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether \"the reduction ... is warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Dillon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    560 U.S. at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454872,3641961\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/817/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those factors include \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" and \"the need for the sentence imposed ... to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Under the application notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, I must also weigh the defendant's post-sentencing conduct. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In Baptiste's favor, many family members and friends have submitted letters demonstrating strong family and community support. He also has completed a number of drug abuse, psychological, educational, and other programs while in custody. He has accepted responsibility for his crimes and acknowledged his mistakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to Baptiste's motion, the Government raises a 2015 incident in which Baptiste was allegedly involved in an assault on a fellow inmate. Although Baptiste did not participate in the assault itself, the Government has provided evidence that he entered the cell after the assault took place to remove something and attempt to clean the cell in order to conceal the assault. Baptiste was charged with compounding a crime in connection with this incident. The charges were dismissed in 2017, though the Government contends this was not on the merits. Baptiste argues that the Court should not deny his motion based on this incident because the criminal charges were dismissed, he did not participate in the assault itself, and he was acquainted with the person who was assaulted. Additionally, he points to a 2016 Bureau of Prisons report that states that he \"consistently follows institutional rules and has remained incident report free.\" Dkt. No. 62-1 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the charges against Baptiste in connection with the 2015 incident were serious, they were dismissed. I therefore allow the motion to reduce his sentence. However, he does have disciplinary reports from December 2015 for possessing drugs or alcohol and from March 2017 for fighting. He is also serving a sentence for a crime involving gang violence and multiple firearms. In light of his disciplinary record and the serious nature of his conviction, a sentence at the low end of the new guideline range is inappropriate. I therefore\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the motion for reduction of sentence (Docket No. 48) and reduce his sentence to 162 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Baptiste's plea agreement contains a waiver of his right to seek a modified sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). The Government does not seek to enforce the waiver.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
