Together, they reflect the following relevant background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 29, 2014, shortly after 1:00 a.m., Robert Rodriguez was driving plaintiff home from the Haverstraw Marina. As they were driving, plaintiff, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, noticed two police cars, a truck and a patrol car. Sgt. Gould, who was in one of the police cars, saw Mr. Rodriguez behind the wheel and knew Rodriguez's driver's license had been suspended. Sgt. Gould verified Rodriguez's license was suspended and summoned other officers to the scene. Before the officers could perform a traffic stop, however, Rodriguez stopped his vehicle across the street from plaintiff's home and plaintiff got out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As plaintiff was crossing the street, Officer Ramos pulled up in a patrol car behind Rodriguez, activated his emergency lights, and got out of the car. Officer Ramos directed plaintiff to come back to Ramos's vehicle and put his hands on the hood. An officer frisked plaintiff but found nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rodriguez was arrested for aggravated unlicensed operation of a vehicle in the second degree. Several officers, including Sgt. Gould, searched Rodriguez's vehicle, and Sgt. Gould found a plastic bag containing cocaine inside the vehicle's front passenger side. An officer arrested plaintiff, performed a second frisk, and found a gravity knife in plaintiff's pocket. Police later found marijuana in plaintiff's possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Later that night, at the Haverstraw police station, Sgt. Gould put on Latex gloves and directed plaintiff to lower his pants and underwear. Sgt. Gould told plaintiff that he worked in narcotics and knew that \"guys like [plaintiff] like to stash drugs in their ass crack.\" (Pitcoff Decl. Ex. D (\"Pl. Mar. 22, 2018, Dep.\") at 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sgt. Gould spread plaintiff's buttocks with his hands, and as plaintiff described the search, Sgt. Gould performed a visual inspection and \"his finger penetrated\" plaintiff's rectum. (Pl. Mar. 22, 2018, Dep. at 64). At his deposition, plaintiff said he was not sure if Sgt. Gould \"grazed [that area] accidentally\" or if it was part of the search. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). Plaintiff also said that was the only time Sgt. Gould touched him in conducting the search. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the body cavity search, Sgt. Gould searched and returned plaintiff's clothing. Plaintiff put his clothing back on; he was then fingerprinted, photographed and transported to the Rockland County Jail. Plaintiff said that while he has been subject to more than ten strip searches at the Rockland County Jail, he had never been subject to a search while naked at the Haverstraw police station before the September 29 search. (Pl. Mar. 22, 2018, Dep. at 47-49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff was ultimately charged with felony criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20265.02\">\n    N.Y.

The search was not a visual body cavity search, because Sgt.

While officers found plaintiff walking away from a vehicle containing cocaine, and a subsequent search of plaintiff revealed marijuana and a gravity knife on his person, an arrest for a narcotics-related crime does not \"automatically give[ ] rise to reasonable suspicion that drugs are being carried in an arrestee's body cavities.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sarnicola v.
