Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Keith Liwanag (\"Liwanag\" or \"the defendant\") pled guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of a child. He coerced economically vulnerable women into engaging in sexually explicit conduct with young children in exchange for payments, and he recorded and distributed the content.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This serious offense is likely to cause continuing psychological and emotional damage to the women and children involved. The defendant will require considerable mental health treatment and rehabilitation so he can be a productive member of society. A lengthy prison sentence in which he faces immense challenges and dangerous conditions will do more harm than good. Nonetheless, because the offense to which the defendant pled guilty carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years, the court sentences him to that lengthy term of incarceration-15 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The defendant is sentenced to a 15-year term of imprisonment, the minimum mandated for this offense. This lengthy sentence will inevitably make it challenging for the defendant to reintegrate into society and lead a productive life upon release. He requires the benefit of mental health treatment and intensive rehabilitation, which is not well provided by endless years in prison. Upon his release from prison, Liwanag is likely to be immediately deported to the Philippines. There, he will probably face social and economic hardship because of the nature of his crime and the conditions there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The court has also considered the prison conditions the defendant will experience; since he will spend so many years in prison, the environment in which he will live and the treatment he will face must be considered in assessing total harm and benefits to the prisoner and society. His status as a sex offender will likely result in violent abuse from other inmates and isolation. Such conditions during a longer sentence would not serve rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Five years of supervised release are imposed. The main condition of release is that Liwanag not return to the United States. If the defendant is not deported for any reason following his discharge from prison, additional conditions of his supervised release include: (1) he is to comply with applicable state and/or federal sex offender registration requirements; (2) he is not to associate with minors under 18 years old without permission, subject to court-stated exceptions; (3) he shall inform any person with whom he cohabitates that has minor children of his sex offense and the prohibition against association with children; (4) he is not to contact the victims of his offense without permission of the Probation Department; (5) he is not to use an electronic device to access pornography; (6) he will allow the Probation Department to monitor his devices; (7) he will participate in mental health treatment programs as directed by the court and the Probation Department; and (8) he will allow a search of his home, place of employment, and other specified locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   No fines are being imposed since the defendant has no assets. There is a special assessment of $ 100. The defendant is subject to a forfeiture order and a restitution order requiring that he pay a total of\n   $ 18,000 to his victims who have requested payment for his abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Entry, Feb. 21, 2019, ECF No. 57; Final Order of Forfeiture, Feb. 25, 2019, ECF No. 55 (filed under seal); Order of Restitution, Feb. 25, 2019, ECF No. 56 (filed under seal).
