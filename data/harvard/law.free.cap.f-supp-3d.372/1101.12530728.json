Mr. Geisel wrote and illustrated the works at issue here:\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places You'll Go!\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <em>\n    How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Grinch\n   </em>\n   \"); and\n   <em>\n    The Sneetches and Other Stories\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Sneetches\n   </em>\n   \") (collectively, the \"Copyrighted Works\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-7. The Copyrighted Works are duly registered for copyright with the Copyright Office and all copyrights remain in force.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Although Mr. Geisel passed away in 1991, Plaintiff oversees a robust publishing program, working closely with its publishers to release anniversary editions, reissues in new formats or sizes, and updated editions of the iconic Dr. Seuss books, including the Copyrighted Works.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 128-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff also licenses authors and illustrators to publish additional works under the Dr. Seuss brand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 134-35. For example, Plaintiff's series\n   <em>\n    The Cat In The Hat Learning Library\n   </em>\n   includes books written and illustrated by other authors that are based upon and incorporate Mr. Geisel's works.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. This series includes titles such as\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Things You Can Do That Are Good For You!\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    There's No Place Like Space!\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Pets You Can Get! Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135. Plaintiff has also licensed the publication of several books that are derivative of the Copyrighted Works, including\n   <em>\n    Go!: Oh, Baby! Go, Baby!\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places I'll Go! By ME, Myself\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Oh, Baby, the Places You'll Go!\n   </em>\n   ; and\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places I've Been! Journal. Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142. These books continue the style of the original Dr. Seuss books, and Plaintiff provides close quality control to ensure\n   consistency of style and quality.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 129-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   While children may be the intended readers for many of Dr. Seuss' works, adults buy them, too, and Plaintiff therefore markets the works to both children and adults.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 146-49. Other Dr. Seuss works, including\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   , are also aimed at teenagers and adults, and are therefore marketed to both age groups.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 147-48. Additionally,\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   is a very popular gift for graduates, and is Plaintiff's best-selling book, and the perennial number one selling book on\n   <em>\n    The New York Times\n   </em>\n   Best Sellers list each spring during graduation season.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 141, 148.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff is not just a publisher; it is also in the entertainment business, licensing Dr. Seuss works for development of films, television, stage productions, theme parks, and museum exhibitions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138. Plaintiff also runs an extensive product licensing and merchandising program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 138-39, 144. In fact, in 2017, Plaintiff was named the top licensed book brand according to NPD, a market industry research firm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159. Importantly for purposes of this case, Plaintiff collaborates with other intellectual property holders on collaborations that combine Dr. Seuss' works with those holders' creations to develop new works and products that have combined appeal to larger audiences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 150-56. For example, Plaintiff and its partners have created\n   <em>\n    The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss\n   </em>\n   , a television and book series with The Jim Henson Company that featured \"muppetized\" Dr. Seuss characters;\n   <em>\n    Grinch Panda Pop\n   </em>\n   , a digital game that combines Jam City's Panda character with the Grinch character; Dr. Seuss Funko figurines, which combine Funko Inc.'s distinctive toy designs with Dr. Seuss characters; and a line of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons clothing combining Comme des Gar\u00e7ons' well-known heart design with\n   <em>\n    Grinch\n   </em>\n   artwork.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154-56. Many more collaborations are in the works.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff receives numerous offers from parties wishing to work with DSE on a collaboration or license Plaintiff's intellectual property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157. Plaintiff approaches these offers selectively, and when Plaintiff considers whether to pursue a collaboration with another intellectual property holder, it first carefully vets the collaborator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 130. If Plaintiff decides to move forward, it works extensively with the collaborator and maintains tight control over the work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129, 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Declaration of Tamar Duvdevani in Support of Pl.'s MSJ (\"Duvdevani Decl.\") Ex. 2, ECF No. 107-24, at 16:14-17:24. In May 2016, Mr. Gerrold suggested to Mr. Hauman that, \"if we could get a license, we should do a Star Trek Primer.\" SOF \u00b6 8. The original idea was to combine Star Trek themes with the pre-school book\n   <em>\n    Pat the Bunny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, although they also considered using\n   <em>\n    Fun with Dick &amp; Jane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Goodnight Moon\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    The Very Hungry Caterpillar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15, before finally settling on\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Templeton is an illustrator adept at copying other illustrators' styles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. In June 2016, Mr. Hauman invited Mr. Templeton to join the project, instructing Mr. Templeton that \"this would be Seuss-style [ (\n   <em>\n    Star Trek\n   </em>\n   : The Original Series) ] backgrounds,\" Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 25, ECF No. 107-39, at 423,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that \"we're\n   going to want the cover and at least a background art piece for promotions, as well as be able to use the cover for posters, mugs, and all the merchandise that will push this thing over the top.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 424. Mr. Templeton responded, \"Holy CRAP that's a cool idea. The title is like printing money. I'm totally in.\" SOF \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With the team in place, Defendants set out to create\n   <em>\n    Oh, the Places You'll Boldly Go!\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"). Although concerned about their project's legal risk, Mr. Gerrold and Mr. Hauman concluded that their proposed project would likely qualify as a \"parody\" of the source material and therefore constitute a fair use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 16-18, 23-24. Each of Mr. Templeton, Mr. Gerrold, and Mr. Hauman testified that he considered\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   a parody, a mash-up, and a transformative work.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 107-23, at 120:14-23; Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 2 at 68:7-8, 77:19-78; Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 3, ECF No. 107-25, at 75:23-76:11. They also did not anticipate that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   would compete with\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   or any other of the Copyrighted Works.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 2 at 43:3-45:1; Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 3 at 185:18-186:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But each Defendant also testified that he copied from the Copyrighted Works to create\n   <em>\n    Boldly.\n   </em>\n   SOF \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, 52-55, 57, 65. Indeed, Mr. Hauman scanned a copy of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   to Mr. Gerrold because he wanted to \"parallel [\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   ] as close as [he] c[ould].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Although Mr. Gerrold had written his first draft \"from scratch\" and without access to\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   , he later rewrote\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's text to more closely match\n   <em>\n    Go! Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Mr. Hauman created a side-by-side comparison of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   's and\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's text,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 57, to assist himself and Mr. Gerrold in their effort \"to parallel the structure of [\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   ].\" Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 2 at 95:7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Templeton testified as to his process for illustrating\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I would have the original book open to what I was looking at. I would rough out the positions the characters are in. After I was satisfied with the position that the characters are in being similar enough to evoke the original source material, I would render them as carefully as I could.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 1 at 171:3-9. For example, Mr. Templeton's illustration of one page took him about seven hours because he \"painstakingly attempted to make\" his illustration \"nearly identical\" in certain respects to one illustrated by Dr. Seuss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167:1-17. Mr. Hauman instructed Mr. Templeton to \"go closer to\"\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   , SOF \u00b6\u00b6 37, 49, 53, and Mr. Templeton later admitted, \"I did, in fact, slavishly copy from Seuss,\" to illustrate\n   <em>\n    Boldly. Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. This was because it was \"essential to the parody ... that people recognize the source material in poses since they WON'T be seeing the Grinch or the Whos or the Gox\" or any other character from Dr. Seuss, and Mr. Templeton was therefore \"concerned if we try to completely ignore everything about the source material the gags fall apart.\" Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 68, ECF No. 107-64, at 609.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants included two disclaimers on the copyright page of the unpublished, \"completed\" draft of\n   <em>\n    Boldly.\n   </em>\n   Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 31, ECF No. 115-11, at 452. The first read: \"This is a work of fair use, and is not associated with or endorsed by CBS Studio or Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The second disclaimer read, \"Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for 'fair use' for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, research, and parody.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The copyright page further attributes the copyright and trademarks in\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   to Mr. Gerrold and Mr. Templeton-not to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Mr. Frazier advised Mr. Hauman that, while ThinkGeek did not manufacture books, it could handle distribution for Boldly, but stated: \"It goes without saying you've got the license, though, right?\" Duvdevani Decl. Ex. 29, ECF No. 107-42, at 441. Mr. Hauman replied to Mr. Frazier, \"No license, this is straight parody fair use of both Seuss and Trek,\" but \"I realize this may complicate matters for you and cause you to pass\" and, \"if so, I completely understand and no hard feelings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   ThinkGeek eventually ordered 5,000 copies of\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   , if they could be printed and delivered in time for Christmas sales. SOF \u00b6 93. On July 19, 2016, Mr. Hauman wrote an e-mail to another third-party stating: \"[H]ad a conversation with the senior buyer for ThinkGeek, and we'll be selling them a lot of stuff.

Regarding Defendants' fair use defense, the Court found that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   is \"a highly transformative work that takes no more than necessary to accomplish its transformative purpose and will not impinge\n   on the original market for Plaintiff's underlying work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Although the Court declined to find that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   is a parody, the Court concluded that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"is no doubt transformative.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Acknowledging that Defendants did intend to profit from\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that the weight given Defendants' commercial purpose \"is slight given both the transformative nature of the work ... and the fact that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   does not supplant the market for\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   or the other relevant Dr. Seuss works.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court concluded that the creative nature of the Copyrighted Works weighed slightly in Plaintiff's favor,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, while the amount and substantiality of the Copyrighted Works Defendants used did \"not weigh against Defendants\" because\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   did not copy elements from\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and the other Copyrighted works \"in their entirety\" and did not \"copy more than is necessary to accomplish its transformative purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. Finally, accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, the Court concluded that the Court had to presume some degree of harm to Plaintiff's licensing opportunities, although \"this presumed harm is neutralized somewhat by the fact that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   does not substitute for the original and serves a different market function than Go!\" because \"\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's market relies on consumers who have already read and greatly appreciated\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and Dr. Seuss's other works, and who simultaneously have a strong working knowledge of the Star Trek series,\" rendering it \"unlikely that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   would severely impact the market for Dr. Seuss's works.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. \"Ultimately, given the procedural posture of this motion and near-perfect balancing of the factors, the Court\" denied Defendants' first motion as to fair use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to Plaintiff's trademark and unfair competition claims, the Court recognized that the\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   test was applicable,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-16, concluding that \"there is no question that Defendants' invocation of Plaintiff's alleged trademarks is relevant to\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   's artistic purpose,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, and that \"\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   does not explicitly mislead as to its source or contents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Nonetheless, the Court declined to grant Defendants' motion regarding Plaintiff's alleged trademark in\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   's title because Defendants failed to address Plaintiff's argument concerning confusingly similar titles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. The Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's trademark claims on nominative fair use grounds because Plaintiff failed to oppose Defendants' arguments on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Given the dismissal of Plaintiff's trademark claims, the Court also dismissed its unfair competition claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Nonetheless, the Court granted Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint regarding its trademark and unfair competition causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Based on Plaintiff's allegations, however, the Court concluded that there was \"potential harm to the market for Plaintiff's derivative works\" and that the factor favored Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As for Plaintiff's trademark and unfair competition claims, the Court concluded that the title of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   may be entitled to trademark protection,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, but that\n   \"Plaintiff's claimed general 'illustration style' is not protectable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. The Court therefore focused on Plaintiff's allegations concerning the use of the title of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and its font in analyzing Defendants' nominative fair use arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the Court determined that there was no descriptive substitute for the title of the book and it was necessary for\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   to use\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   's title,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, and that Defendants did \"nothing in conjunction with the use of the mark to suggest a sponsorship or endorsement by Plaintiff,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, the Court concluded that \"it was unnecessary for Defendants to use the distinctive font as used on\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   to communicate their message (i.e., that\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   is a mash-up of the\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and Star Trek universes).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.

This may be true, but there is a key distinction: in\n   <em>\n    Oracle\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants copied the 37 SE API packages wholesale, while in\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   \"the copied elements are always interspersed with original writing and illustrations that transform\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   's pages into repurposed,\n   <em>\n    Star-Trek\n   </em>\n   -centric ones.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38 at 8. Defendants did not copy verbatim text from\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   in writing\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   , nor did they replicate entire illustrations from\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   Although Defendants certainly borrowed from\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   -at times liberally-the elements borrowed were always adapted or transformed.

The Copyright Act defines a \"derivative work\" as \"a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright ... has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize ...

The Court need not resolve whether\n   <em>\n    Boldly\n   </em>\n   is a derivative work for purposes of Sections 101 and 106(2), however, because Plaintiff has overlooked the critical introductory clause to Section 106(2), which limits the \"exclusive right[ ]\" to prepare derivative works by, among other exceptions, the doctrine of fair use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   H.R.

Examining the cover of each work, for example, Plaintiff may claim copyright protection in the unique, rainbow-colored rings and tower on the cover of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, however, cannot claim copyright over\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   disc-shaped item tilted at a particular angle; to grant Plaintiff such broad protection would foreclose a photographer from taking a photo of the Space Needle just so, a result that is clearly untenable under-and antithetical to-copyright law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But that is essentially what Plaintiff attempts to do here. Instead of replicating Plaintiff's rainbow-ringed disc, Defendants drew a similarly-shaped but decidedly non-Seussian spacecraft-the USS Enterprise-at the same angle and placed a red-and-pink striped planet where the larger of two background discs appears on the original cover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Duvdevani Decl.

Here, by contrast, Defendants took discrete elements of the Copyrighted Works: cross-hatching, object placements, certain distinctive facial features, lines written in anapestic tetrameter. Yes, these are elements significant to the Copyrighted Works, but Defendants ultimately did not use Dr. Seuss' words, his character, or his universe. The Court therefore stands by its prior conclusion that Defendants took no more from the Copyrighted Works than was necessary for Defendants' purposes,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a \"mash-up\" of\n   <em>\n    Go!\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Star Trek\n   </em>\n   , and that, consequently, this factor does not weigh against Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   d.
