(\"Infosys\") and Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") under the False Claims Act. The suit alleges that the Defendants conspired to have two Indian nationals enter the United States on a business B-1 visa to provide training at Apple in violation of immigration laws. Krawitt instead insists that the two trainers ought to have obtained the more expensive and numerically-capped H1-B visas before entering the United States. Before the Court are Apple's motion to dismiss, ECF No. 84 (\"Mot.\"), and Infosys' motion to dismiss, ECF No. 85. Having considered the parties' submissions, the relevant law, and the record in this case, the Court GRANTS Apple's motion to dismiss with prejudice, and DENIES Infosys' motion to dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Infosys and Apple have different rationales for why the SAC should be dismissed. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Apple's motion, which Infosys joins, then denies Infosys' motion as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Apple advances four grounds on which to dismiss the SAC. First, Apple argues that the trainers' activities were permissible under their B-1 visas. Second, Apple asserts that Krawitt cannot establish scienter. Third, Apple contends that Krawitt fails to plead facts establishing the materiality of the invitation letters. Fourth, Apple posits that the SAC is specifically deficient as to Apple. The Court finds Apple's first two arguments dispositive, and need not address the remainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Trainers' Activities were Permissible under B-1 Visas\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, Apple argues that the two trainers' activities in the United States\n   were permissible under B-1 visas. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court's previous order dismissing Krawitt's claims relied upon a three-prong test developed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") for what constitutes business qualifying for a B-1 visa:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) [T]he alien clearly intends to maintain a foreign residence and domicile; (2) the principal place of business and the place where the profit predominantly accrues is in a foreign country; and (3) each business entry is clearly temporary in character, even if the nature of the business activity itself is not temporary and may be long continued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ECF No. 76 at 8;\n   <em>\n    Krawitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528137\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/958/#p964\">\n    342 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   964 (citing\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20824\">\n    11 I. &amp; N.

[,] one that preserves an appropriate tension between the bar to ordinary labor and the requirements of international business.\"); 9 Foreign Affairs Manual (\"FAM\") 402.2-5(A)(b) (\"It can be difficult to distinguish between appropriate B1 business activities, and activities that constitute skilled or unskilled labor in the United States that are not appropriate on B status.\"). However, the FAM praises\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   as still providing \"[t]he clearest legal definition\" of what constitutes business activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20217\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, in federal regulations, the Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have referred to\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   to define the scope of allowed business activities under a B-1 visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20Fed.%20Reg.%2058982\">\n    58 Fed.

These are the first and third prongs of the BIA test of what constitutes legitimate business activity under a B-1 visa. Thus, the Court turns to the second prong: where the principal place of business is, and where the profit predominantly accrues. The Court finds that the principal place of business and where profit predominately accrues is India, which satisfies the second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The instant case can be closely analogized to\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   , a Hong Kong suit manufacturer sent Hira to the United States to take customers' measurements for suits to be made in Hong Kong.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20824\">\n    11 I. &amp; N.

SAC at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 40. Though Apple did pay Infosys $ 50,000 under the Agile Contract for the training sessions, this money\n   <em>\n    did not\n   </em>\n   go directly to the two trainers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17 (\"Apple was paying Infosys $ 50,000 ....\"). The money went to Infosys.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Krawitt concedes that the two trainers in the instant case received \"\n   <em>\n    compensation from Infosys\n   </em>\n   ,\" meaning they were paid in India. SAC at \u00b6 17 (emphasis added). Curiously, the FAC also alleged that the trainers \"received compensation in the form of continued salary benefits\" from Infosys. ECF No. 37 at \u00b6 17. However, the SAC deleted any mention of \"continued salary benefits.\" Nonetheless, because the SAC alleges that the trainers were Infosys employees based in India who received compensation from Infosys, presumably as\n   continuing employees of Infosys, that is enough to show the trainers were paid in India.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole v.

Thus, Infosys' and the trainers' profits accrue overseas. This satisfies the BIA test's second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response, Krawitt first argues that there is a federal regulation that prohibits the trainers from coming to the United States under B-1 visas because the trainers were coming as part of a contractual agreement. Opp. at 4. Second, Krawitt asserts that\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   is not applicable to the instant case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Third, Krawitt argues that a Northern District of California court previously rejected\n   <em>\n    Matter of Hira\n   </em>\n   's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Int'l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsmen v.

Cal. 1985). Fourth, the SAC expands upon the FAC by alleging that the training consisted of \" 'paired training' in which both instructor and trainee take turns writing and revising computer code-which is exactly the sort of coding and programming work that the U.S. Government previously found unacceptable business activities when performed by holders of a B-1 visa.\" SAC at \u00b6 12. The Court finds Krawitt's arguments unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, Krawitt argues that the portion of the Code of Federal Regulations governing B-1 visas does not permit the trainers' activities in the United States. The regulation states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   The term \"business,\" as used in INA 101(a)(15)(B), refers to conventions, conferences, consultations and other legitimate activities of a commercial or professional nature. It does not include local employment or labor for hire .... An alien seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant for employment or labor pursuant to a contract or other prearrangement is required to qualify under the provisions of \u00a7 41.53 [specifying the requirements of an H-type visa].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.31\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Krawitt argues that because the trainers were entering pursuant to the Agile Contract, they were ineligible to enter the United States under B-1 visas because the regulation \"does not permit any work that is itself the subject of a contract or prearranged employment.\" Opp. at 5. However, Krawitt reads the regulation too narrowly, especially the portion about \"seeking to enter as a nonimmigrant ... pursuant to a contract or other prearrangement.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.31\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Numerous authoritative sources contradict Krawitt's reading of the regulation. The BIA has repeatedly held that foreigners entering pursuant to a contract or a prearrangement may be granted B-1 visas. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Matter of Camilleri\n   </em>\n   , the BIA permitted a Canadian citizen truck driver employed by a United States corporation to enter the United States on a B-1 visa to pick up loads in the United States and transport them back to Canada.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20441\">\n    17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 441-42 (BIA 1980).

Thus, there is ambiguity in the allowable uses of B-1 visas arising out of differences in interpretation of the relevant immigration laws and regulations. The ambiguity here is in Apple's and Infosys' favor. Apple and Infosys cannot be charged with knowledge or willful blindness to the correct uses of the B-1 visa because there is simply no exhaustive list or case law of all permissible activities under a B-1 visa.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2041.31\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 41.31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (\"The term 'business' ... refers to conventions conferences, consultations\n   <em>\n    and other legitimate activities of a commercial or professional nature\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added).).

Again, it is not clear from the text of the regulation that providing training is not a legitimate commercial or professional activity under a B-1 visa. As discussed above, providing training and supervision in the construction industry is allowable under a B-1 visa. There is no indication in the regulations that providing training in other industries is disallowed. Thus, Krawitt's allegation that he notified Infosys and Apple of the trainers' use of B-1 visas does not show that Infosys or Apple knew or were willfully blind to the alleged illegality of hiring B-1 visa holders to provide the training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Krawitt claims that \"[t]he false statements that Apple and Infosys made [in the invitation letters] betray an intimate knowledge by both Apple and Infosys employees of the exact provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that they were violating.\" Opp. at 9.

Moreover, Krawitt still fails to direct the Court to any authoritative guidance from the government establishing that providing training was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allowable under a B-1 visa.

At bottom, Krawitt's failure to plead an FCA claim is a legal deficiency that cannot be cured with amended factual pleadings because the Court held the trainers permissibly entered the United States on B-1 visas, and because the Court determined that the immigration laws are not clear as to the permissible uses of a B-1 visa. This reasoning applies equally to Krawitt's FCA claim against Infosys. Thus, the Court dismisses Krawitt's FCA claim against Infosys and DENIES Infosys' motion to dismiss the second amended complaint as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court's order granting Apple's previous motion to dismiss warned that \"failure to cure the deficiencies ... will result in dismissal with prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Krawitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528137\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/342/958/#p964\">\n    342 F.Supp.3d at 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
