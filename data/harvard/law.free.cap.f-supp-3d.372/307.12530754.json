That motion was heard in open court on March 20, 2019, and was granted because the court concluded that Shaw's settlement agreement resolving her grievance barred her Title VII claims based on alleged conduct predating the agreement. (\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Doc. 47 in case 1:17-CV-00699.) For the same reasons stated at length from the\n     bench at the March 20, 2019 motion hearing in case 1:17-CV-00699, the court finds that Shaw's settlement agreement with DPS also bars her claims in the present case, all of which predated the settlement agreement and fall within its plain release terms.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      While employees cannot prospectively waive their statutory rights,\n      <em>\n       Alexander v.

This squares reasonably with Shaw's agreement to cease her employment with DPS as part of the settlement. (Doc. 19-7 at 16.) Cynthia Thornton, a DPS Correctional Superintendent who was the respondent at the June 8, 2016 settlement meeting and a signatory to the settlement agreement, states in her affidavit, and Shaw does not dispute, that Shaw was\n     given the opportunity to have counsel during her consideration of the document, but she declined to do so. (Doc. 19-6 at 4.) She also acknowledged she understood the settlement agreement and was not coerced into signing it. (\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 36; Doc. 19-7 at 15-16.) DPS was entitled to rely on her representation, and the agreement and waiver, which were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, should therefore be given effect.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Coyne\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204384629\">\n       2014 WL 4384629\n      </extracted-citation>\n      , at *4 n.6 (finding that although the agreement at issue did not explicitly list the Maryland Flexible Leave Act of 2008 as one of the laws for which claims would be released, the language in the agreement covering \"any other federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance\" was sufficient to clearly bar such claim);\n      <em>\n       Singletary v.
