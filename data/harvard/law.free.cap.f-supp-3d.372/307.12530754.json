(Doc. 19 at 9.) Shaw acknowledges having executed the settlement agreement, in which she agreed (among other things) to terminate her employment with DPS on June 30, 2016, and which contained the following language:</p><p id=\"p-11\">I have read, understand, and agree that the above terms of agreement are an accurate account of the areas of agreement reached in the mediation process and that all matters in the dispute between the grievant and the agency have been settled with the terms of this agreement.</p><p id=\"p-12\">I understand and agree that by signing this Memorandum of Agreement, I release the Respondent, the applicable Agency, Commission and/or Division, and the State of North Carolina from any and all claims that I may have related to my employment and the alleged action(s) that led to this grievance.

That motion was heard in open court on March 20, 2019, and was granted because the court concluded that Shaw's settlement agreement resolving her grievance barred her Title VII claims based on alleged conduct predating the agreement. (<em>See</em> Doc. 47 in case 1:17-CV-00699.)

The Fourth Circuit has since recognized that while the \"precise ruling in <em>O'Shea</em> has of course been superseded by the limitations on waivers of ADEA rights that Congress created in the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act,\" for non-ADEA claims, \"courts can resolve interstitial questions of federal law either by formulating a federal common law rule or by adopting existing state law, and that they must choose between these two courses on a statute-by-statute, issue-by-issue basis.\" <em>Kendall v.

This squares reasonably with Shaw's agreement to cease her employment with DPS as part of the settlement. (Doc. 19-7 at 16.) Cynthia Thornton, a DPS Correctional Superintendent who was the respondent at the June 8, 2016 settlement meeting and a signatory to the settlement agreement, states in her affidavit, and Shaw does not dispute, that Shaw was <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"311\" href=\"#p311\" id=\"p311\">*311</a>given the opportunity to have counsel during her consideration of the document, but she declined to do so. (Doc. 19-6 at 4.) She also acknowledged she understood the settlement agreement and was not coerced into signing it. (<em>Id.</em> at 36; Doc. 19-7 at 15-16.) DPS was entitled to rely on her representation, and the agreement and waiver, which were entered into knowingly and voluntarily, should therefore be given effect. <em>See</em> <em>Coyne</em>, <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204384629\">2014 WL 4384629</extracted-citation>, at *4 n.6 (finding that although the agreement at issue did not explicitly list the Maryland Flexible Leave Act of 2008 as one of the laws for which claims would be released, the language in the agreement covering \"any other federal, state or local law, rule, regulation or ordinance\" was sufficient to clearly bar such claim); <em>Singletary v.
