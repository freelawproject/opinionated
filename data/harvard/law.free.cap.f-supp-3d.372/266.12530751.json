(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18-20, 32, ECF No. 7).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-89). As a result, Plaintiffs \"were required to pay additional taxes on the commissions,\" thereby reducing their wages earned.

Rather, they plead that they were W-2 employees during their employment, and that Defendants issued them 1099s for commission payments after they left their employment so Defendants could \"avoid paying the employer portion of the FICA, FUTA, and other federal and state income taxes on paychecks issued after Plaintiffs left employment.\" (Am.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92). Plaintiffs specifically allege that Defendants underreported their wages by not reporting all wages earned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, 98-99, 101, 103). Although Plaintiffs' allegations of underreporting\n   stem from the fact that the Defendants misclassified their post-employment commission payments, Plaintiffs nonetheless allege that the amounts Defendants reported were incorrect-and that this misreporting was willful. They further allege that Defendants willfully underreported the amounts on their W-2s, 1099s, or both in an effort defraud tax authorities by reducing their tax obligations.

Defendants counter, based on the plain language of L &amp; E \u00a7 3-503, that they did not make any deductions from Plaintiffs' wages. The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 3-503 of the MWPCL prohibits employers from making unauthorized deductions. Section 3-503 specifically provides that an employer may take a deduction from an employee's wages if the deduction is: \"(1) ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) authorized expressly in writing by the employee; (3) allowed by the Commissioner because the employee has received full consideration for the deduction; or (4) otherwise made in accordance with any law or any rule or regulation issued by a governmental unit.\" L &amp; E \u00a7 3-503.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The MWPCL does not define \"deduction,\" and there is scant case law interpreting this term. Even so, the cases concluding that an employer made an unauthorized deduction from an employee's wages all involve just that-the employer making the deduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Guerra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20330871\">\n    2019 WL 330871\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (concluding that the employer's deduction from an employee's wages for the cost of tools and equipment without the employee's permission is a violation of L &amp; E \u00a7 3-503 );\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Defendants contend that Plaintiffs rely solely on statements of \"information and belief\" and that this is insufficient to plausibly state a claim.

The Court agrees with Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs cite two principal cases in support of their assertion that Maryland recognizes a cause of action for negligent issuance of owed wages:\n   <em>\n    Jacques v.

In\n   <em>\n    Jacques\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals of Maryland held that a bank which agreed to process a loan application owed the applicants a duty of care in processing the application.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2064102\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/307/527/\">\n    515 A.2d at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In imposing a duty of care on the bank, the court emphasized that the applicants were \"particularly vulnerable and dependent\" upon the bank's exercise of reasonable care because the contract for purchase of their home obligated them to accept \"whatever loan they could obtain at the agreed rate of interest,\" and that the bank was aware of this fact.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 762-63. As a result, the applicants would have to proceed to settlement on whatever loan terms the bank offered or forfeit their $ 10,000.00 deposit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 763. The court also emphasized the nature of the business-one that had a \"public calling\" and involved dealings with professionals whose occupations required a \"peculiar skill\"-weighed in favor of imposing a tort duty on the bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Here, Defendants are employers who own and operate a furniture store, which is not a profession with a public calling or one that requires a peculiar skill. Even if the Court were to conclude that Defendants' profession weighed in favor of imposing a tort duty, nothing in the facts as alleged establish a relationship between Plaintiffs and Defendants that made Plaintiffs \"particularly vulnerable and dependent\" upon Defendants' exercise of due care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 762-63. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Jacques\n   </em>\n   does not support a cause of action for negligent issuance of owed wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court also does not read\n   <em>\n    Shofer\n   </em>\n   to create or permit a cause of action for negligent issuance of wages. In\n   <em>\n    Shofer\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals concluded that ERISA did not preempt the plaintiff's state-law professional malpractice action against a retirement plan consultant for failing to properly advise the plaintiff of the tax implications of withdrawing money from his retirement account.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1989665\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/324/92/\">\n    595 A.2d at 1083-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The consultant did not miscalculate the plaintiff's taxes; he allegedly failed to advise the plaintiff of the income tax consequences of borrowing money from his retirement plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1080. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Shofer\n   </em>\n   did not recognize a cause of action for negligent issuance of owed wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In short, neither of these cases recognize a cause of action for negligent issuance of wages, and the Court finds no other case that does. The Court, therefore, concludes that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for negligent issuance of owed wages. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendants' Motion as to Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Breach of Contract - Count V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached the Commission Agreement because they failed to pay commissions \"less standard deductions and withholdings,\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 57; Comm'n Agmt. at 3), and because they issued Plaintiffs 1099s that did not include the required deductions and withholdings. Defendants point to language in the Commission Agreement, which states, \"I understand that this is not a contract for employment....\" (Comm'n Agmt. at 2). Based on this language, Defendants argue that the Commission Agreement is not an enforceable contract. Defendants are mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While the Commission Agreement expressly states that it is \"not a contract for employment,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), it does not state that the Commission Agreement is not a contract. The Commission Agreement \"specifies the manner and method\" by which an employee \"will be compensated while employed by [Regency].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). So, although the Commission Agreement is not an employment contract, it is still a contract-and it imposed an obligation on Defendants to pay Plaintiffs commissions \"less standard deductions and withholdings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). Plaintiffs allege that Defendants breached this obligation when they issued Plaintiffs commission payments as 1099 payments without the required deductions and withholdings. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 112). Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Belyakov v. Med.

Accordingly, the Court will deny Defendants' Motion as to Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under MWPCL \u00a7 3-503 and for negligent issuance of wages owed. Plaintiffs, however, sufficiently state claims for violations of IRS Code \u00a7 7343(a), MWPCL \u00a7 3-505, and breach of contract.
