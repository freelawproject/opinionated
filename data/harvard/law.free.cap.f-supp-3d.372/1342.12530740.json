(DE 54). Defendant Harrison is proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in this matter. On January 4, 2019, I entered an Order with instructions to Defendant Harrison regarding the operation of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and advising him of the consequences of his failure to properly respond (DE 57). Thereafter, on January 22, 2019, Harrison filed a Response in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 59), and a \"Motion to Order Immediate and Urgent Subpoena of Potentially Connected Parties\" (DE 60). Plaintiffs filed a Reply in support of their Motion for Summary Judgment on January 29, 2019 (DE 62), and Response in Opposition to Harrison's motion for subpoena on February 6, 2019 (DE 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. OVERVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 7, 2018, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint for damages and equitable relief against Defendants Monkey Capital, LLC, Monkey Capital, Inc., and Daniel Harrison. (DE 28 or \"Amended Complaint\"). At the heart of Plaintiffs' lawsuit are allegations that Plaintiffs contributed cryptocurrency worth millions of dollars in advance of a scheduled Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and supposed launch of a private cryptocurrency exchange and decentralized hedge fund (the \"Monkey Capital Market\"). Plaintiffs state that the ICO never occurred, the status of the development of the Monkey Capital Market is unknown, and that Defendants unlawfully pocketed investor money. On August 14, 2018, I entered final default judgment against Defendants Monkey Capital LLC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   and Monkey Capital Inc. (DE 44). On August 27, 2018, after an evidentiary hearing, I awarded damages. (DE 50). Harrison is the only remaining Defendant, and Plaintiffs' now seek summary judgment against him as to all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Harrison's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Response to Plaintiffs' summary judgment motion fails to comply with applicable Federal Rules, Local Rules and law, rendering Plaintiffs' Motion effectively unopposed. Therefore all facts set forth in the following analysis of Plaintiffs' claims are deemed undisputed and/or admitted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or after January 1, 2016, Defendant Daniel Harrison created Monkey Capital, LLC and Monkey Capital Inc. (\"Monkey Capital\"). (DE 55, Statement of Undisputed\n   Facts (\"SUF\") at \u00b6\u00b6 1-6). He managed the business affairs of these companies, and controlled their development. (SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 1-6). Harrison's efforts were essential to the success of Monkey Capital's enterprise. (SUF at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Monkey Capital scheduled an Initial Coin Offering (\"ICO\") to occur in July of 2017. (SUF \u00b6 11). Harrison solicited people to invest in Monkey Capital at a valuation premium before the Monkey Capital ICO. (SUF \u00b6 11). Harrison solicited investors in the Monkey Capital ICO, Coeval, and Monkey Coin. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 12-14). Each of the named Plaintiffs invested in Monkey Capital with an expectation of garnering financial profit, based on Harrison's representations to investors that Monkey Coin would increase in value. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17-35). The Plaintiffs' investments were pooled with funds of other investors in an effort by Monkey Capital to secure a profit for itself and the investors. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 15, 17-35). Harrison represented to investors that Monkey Coin would increase in value, and Harrison believed that the Plaintiffs expected to profit from their Monkey Capital investments. (SUF \u00b6 15, 17-35). The address on the Waves DEX to which Monkey Capital investors sent their investment assets was a wallet owned by Harrison. (SUF \u00b6 9). The Monkey Capital ICO did not take place. (SUF \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Monkey Capital issued tokens, Monkey Coin and Coeval and offered these for sale across the United States, using electronic means. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 52-54). Monkey Capital did not register its business -- including the issuance of tokens, Monkey Coin or Coeval -- with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, nor did it obtain any exemption from registration requirements from the SEC. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 36-51). Monkey Capital also did not register its business - including the issuance of tokens, Monkey Coin or Coeval - with any state securities regulator in the United States, nor did it obtain exemptions from registration requirements from such entities. (SUF \u00b6\u00b6 36-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I note here, as I did at the final default judgment stage of these proceedings, that the legal conclusions reached in this Order pertain to legal theories that are somewhat novel. Because this Order arises within the context of a motion for summary judgment which is effectively unrebutted by the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant, my conclusions are necessarily based upon Plaintiffs' one-sided submissions to the Court, without the benefit of any meaningful adversarial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Violation of Section 12(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Count I)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 12(a)(1) [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2077\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   /(a)(1) ] grants Plaintiffs a private right of action against any person who offers or sells a security in violation of Section 5 [ 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e ], and states that such person \"shall be liable... to the person purchasing such security from him, who may sue either at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction, to recover the consideration for such security with interest thereon, less the amount of any income received thereon, upon the tender of such security, or for damages if he no longer owns the security.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To prevail on a Section 5 claim, a plaintiff must establish the following elements: \"(1) absence of an effective registration statement covering the securities in question; (2) the offer or sale of the securities; and (3) the use of the mails, or any means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate commerce in connection with the sale or offer.\"\n   <em>\n    Scheck Invs., L.P. v.

As founder and manager of the business activities of Monkey Capital, Harrison was a controlling person. His knowledge of the representations made by Monkey Capital in connection with the ICO may be inferred. By virtue of his position as a top-level executive and participation in and/or awareness of Monkey Capital's operations, Harrison had the power to and did influence and control the decision making relating to Monkey Capital's solicitation of funds from investors, including the decision to engage in the sale of unregistered securities. Moreover, Harrison successfully solicited Plaintiffs' purchases of the securities at issue, motivated by a desire to serve his own financial interest.

Instead, Plaintiffs' cite to the facts set forth in this Court's order entering final default judgment against the Monkey Capital entities, but at the default judgment stage, I was evaluating the sufficiency of the Plaintiffs' allegations only.

The scheduled Monkey Capital ICO called for an investment of money or assets by Plaintiffs. The undisputed facts demonstrate that the funds paid by Plaintiffs were pooled by Defendants in the project in an effort by Defendants to secure a profit for themselves and Plaintiffs. As a result, the facts support a finding that Plaintiffs -- as the investors - shared in the risks and benefits of the investment scheme. Plaintiffs relied upon, and were dependent upon, the expertise and efforts of Harrison for their investment returns. Plaintiffs expected that they would receive profits from their investments in Harrison's efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The transactions at issue constituted investment contracts and are therefore subject to the Florida Blue Sky Laws, including the registration requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20517.07\">\n    Fla.

Plaintiffs state that Harrison falsely represented, among other things, that: \"(a) Monkey Capital was developing a news, information, and trading network -- along with a decentralized hedge fund -- in which investors could place their funds for profit; (b) Plaintiffs' cryptocurrency was being used to build out the Monkey Capital Network; (c) The Monkey Capital Network would be fully functional shortly after the ICO; and (d) Monkey Capital would timely issue to investors their proportional Monkey Coin holdings shortly after the ICO.\" (DE 54 at 13-14). Plaintiffs argue that these acts \"constitute both deceptive and unfair trade practices because the false representations and omissions made by Defendant Harrison ha[d] a tendency or capacity to deceive consumers, such as Plaintiffs, into investing in Monkey Capital's falsely-touted business and [were] immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202365347\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I previously held in the context of default judgment that these well-pleaded facts, taken as true, were sufficient to impose liability for a violation of FDUPTA.
