Plaintiff has filed a response (Doc. 14) and Defendants have filed a reply with the Court's leave (Doc. 18).

(Doc. 1 at 2). Over the course of her nearly three decades of teaching, she has declined to join Defendant Illinois Education Association or its affiliates, Defendant Congerville-Eureka-Goodfield Education Association and Defendant National Education Association, because she \"disapproves of their political advocacy and collective bargaining activities\" and \"the excessive salaries\" paid to high-ranking union officials.

If a majority of the employees in a bargaining unit vote to be represented by a union, that union is designated as the exclusive representative of all the employees. \u00a7\u00a7 315/3(s)(1), 315/6(c), 315/9.

The plaintiffs do not propose to give back the benefits that the union's efforts bestowed on them. These benefits were rendered with a reasonable expectation of compensation founded on the collective bargaining agreement and federal labor law, and the conferral of the benefits on the plaintiffs would therefore give rise under conventional principles of restitution to a valid claim by the union for restitution if the union were forced to turn over the escrow account to the plaintiffs and others similarly situated to them ....

This case demonstrates the importance of the concurrence's observation. Plaintiff does not allege Defendants meant to behave unlawfully. Rather, they acted in the utmost good faith reliance upon a state statutory scheme so similar to one upheld by the Supreme Court that Court could not find it unconstitutional without overruling its prior decision. To suggest Defendants' conduct was \"unlawful\" or even wrong while it was in accordance with state law and Supreme Court precedent would undermine basic principles of equity and fairness. The good-faith defense prevents that injustice here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Availability of Retrospective Monetary Relief for Conduct Previously Authorized by the Supreme Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court also agrees with the Northern District of California's observation \"there is a strong argument that when the highest judicial authority has previously deemed conduct constitutional, reversal of course by that judicial authority should never, as a categorical matter, result in retrospective monetary relief based on that conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Hough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201274528\">\n    2019 WL 1274528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. That court suggested \"in situations where the Supreme Court has reversed a prior ruling but not specified that the party before it is entitled to retrospective monetary relief, it seems unlikely that lower courts should even consider awarding retrospective monetary relief based on conduct the Court had previously authorized.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201274528\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This line of reasoning is deeply persuasive to this Court. It is buoyed, moreover, by the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   that although \"the loss of payments from nonmembers may cause unions to experience unpleasant transition costs in the short term\" those \"disadvantages\" had to be weighed \"against the considerable windfall that unions have received under\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   for the past 41 years.\" 138 S.Ct. at 2485-86. Although certainly not dispositive, the Supreme Court does not appear to contemplate the \"windfall\" being disgorged, nor the potential that some unions might face an existential threat from lawsuits such as the present one. Prudence, equity, and fairness would have counseled the same result even absent the good-faith defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Possible\n    <em>\n     Abood\n    </em>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In the Complaint, Plaintiff separately requests a refund of \"any and all 'fair-share fees' \" and \"any and all 'fair-share service fees' that were spent on political and ideological expenditures, in violation of\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and pre-\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   cases.\" (Doc. 1 at 5-6). Defendants have moved to dismiss this as a separate claim (Doc. 12 at 26-27). Plaintiff does not directly address this portion\n   of Defendants' motion but does include the now-rejected argument that Defendants must prove compliance with\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   to establish the good-faith defense against Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   claim. (Doc. 14 at 20). The Court is uncertain if Plaintiff intended this request to be a separate claim or rather a more limited request in case the Court determined there was a good-faith defense which applied to fair-share fees except where Defendants failed to show they had complied with\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Either way, the request does not survive. Plaintiff has not alleged any facts indicating an\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   violation. If it was intended as an independent claim, the claim lacks \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claim therefore would be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6). If the request is merely a separate request for damages that anticipates a potential application of the good-faith defense, the attempt to acquire any damages fails because the Court held above that the good-faith defense bars Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   claim\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. State-Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Invoking supplemental jurisdiction, Plaintiff asserts claims for \"conversion, trespass to chattels, replevin, unjust enrichment, restitution, and any other legal or equitable cause of action that offers relief\" to her. (Doc. 1 at 5). Defendants seek dismissal of these claims, arguing they are preempted by an Illinois statutory scheme and that Plaintiff has failed to state the elements of the various asserted claims because the fair-share fees were authorized. (Doc. 12 at 24-25). Defendants further argue the state law claims have been abandoned by Plaintiff's failure to defend them in her response. (Doc. 18 at 2 n.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court declines the invitation to reach these claims. \"The supplemental-jurisdiction statute provides that the district court 'may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction' over state-law claims if the court 'has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.' \"\n   <em>\n    RWJ Mgmt.
