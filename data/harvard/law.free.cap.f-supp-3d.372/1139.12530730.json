Mart\u00ednez, United States District Judge\n   This case arises out of Defendant DaVita Inc.'s (\"DaVita\") relationship to the American Kidney Fund (\"AKF\") and statements made by DaVita executives Kent Thiry, James Hilger, and Javier Rodriguez (together with DaVita, \"Defendants\") about DaVita's financial performance and its relationship to AKF. Plaintiffs Peace Officers' Annuity and Benefit Fund of Georgia (\"POA\") and Jacksonville Police and Fire Pension Fund (\"Jacksonville Fund\") (together, \"Plaintiffs\") bring this action pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") on behalf of themselves and others who purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of DaVita between February 26, 2015, and October 6, 2017 (the \"Class Period\"). They allege that Defendants made a variety of fraudulent statements or omissions in connection with the sale of DaVita stock, which caused Plaintiffs to purchase DaVita stock at artificially inflated prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Now before the Court is Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (the \"Motion\") in which Defendants argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims for statements made after October 14, 2016, and that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently plead fraudulent statements, scienter, and loss causation. (ECF No. 43.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court denies Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following factual summary is drawn from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Healthcare for End-Stage Renal Disease Patients\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the center of this action is DaVita's business of providing dialysis to end-stage renal disease (\"ESRD\") patients. Because of the expensive and time-consuming nature of dialysis, ESRD patients often have difficulty finding or maintaining employment. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 38.) In 1972, Congress recognized the challenge faced by ESRD patients and made all ESRD patients eligible for Medicare at any age and regardless of financial circumstance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Medicare covers 80% of ESRD patients' dialysis treatments as well as kidney transplant and aftercare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Patients are liable for the remainder of dialysis costs, and may be eligible for state-run Medicaid programs for those remaining costs not covered by Medicare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Some ESRD patients are insured by private group plans through an employer or other private insurance. When the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") went into effect in January 2014, ESRD patients' insurance options expanded because commercial insurers could no longer exclude coverage for preexisting conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Private insurance plans typically reimburse dialysis providers at much greater rates than Medicare or Medicaid, \"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , up to $ 4,000 per treatment, as opposed to only $ 300 per treatment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to a rule issued by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), private plans serve as the patients' primary insurer for a 30-month \"coordination period,\" during which Medicare is a secondary insurer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) After that period, Medicare becomes the primary insurer, and private insurance becomes secondary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. AKF Commercial Premium Assistance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   AKF provides charitable premium assistance (\"CPA\") to ESRD patients who\n   would otherwise have difficulty affording insurance premiums and cost of care. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.) AKF is the largest provider of third-party CPA for ESRD patients in the country, and is funded almost entirely by dialysis providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2015, AKF reported over $ 260 million in donations, 80% of which, according to press reports, was provided by DaVita and its competitor Fresenius. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.) Plaintiffs allege that DaVita donated in excess of $ 100 million to AKF in 2015, and imply that DaVita increased its annual donation in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The federal government has been aware of the AKF's CPA program for at least twenty years. In 1997, AKF sought an advisory opinion from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\") regarding funding of CPA for ESRD patients for Medicare Part B or Medigap premiums. OIG Ad. Op. 97-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2034684549\">\n    1997 WL 34684549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under the arrangement proposed by AKF, it would assess applicants' eligibility and financial need, and award CPA solely based on those factors; AKF would not take into account the identify of the referring facility or amount of any donor's contribution.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2034684549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Donor companies certified that they would not track the amount that AKF pays on behalf of patients at their facilities, but could consider what they would have otherwise paid on behalf of financially needed patients.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2034684549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In addition, donor companies agreed not to disclose the amount of their donations or method of calculating contributions, nor place restrictions or conditions on donations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2034684549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the information provided, the OIG stated that the proposed arrangement would not constitute grounds for the imposition of civil monetary penalties under Section 231(h) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%2034684549\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. DaVita's Business Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DaVita's profits are primarily driven by private insurance, due to the much greater reimbursement rates of private insurers. While commercially insured patients comprise approximately 10% of DaVita's patient population, those patients drive nearly 100% of its profits and 33-36% of its revenues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that DaVita \"intentionally and illegally 'steered' as many ESRD patients as it could,\" including Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible patients, \"into commercial plans by paying their premiums for them through AKF.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Plaintiffs set forth in great detail, with reference to internal DaVita documents and confidential witness statements, how DaVita tracked the acquisition of \"private pay\" patients at its facilities, incentivized patient steering by offering bonuses to employees, prepared training and instructional materials for employees that disparaged Medicare and Medicaid, and designed materials to convince patients that Medicare and Medicaid were worse options than private insurance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-103.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that DaVita tracked the acquisition of \"private pay\" patients, including patients who switched from Medicaid to Medicare to commercial plans (described in one instance as \"private insurance wins\" and a \"leading indicator\" of performance for one of DaVita's divisions). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-59.) They also claim that DaVita insurance counselors were required to regularly circulate internal DaVita spreadsheets that listed patients with commercial insurance as their primary insurer, reimbursement rates for dialysis treatments under each plan, and how much money was collected by DaVita for each patient. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61, 100.) According to Plaintiffs, DaVita implemented formal incentive programs for employees, regions, and divisions that acquired the most privately insured patients (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-67, 97-99),\n   and, by 2015, had developed a \"Medicaid Opportunity\" initiative, which formalized a company-wide plan to direct all current patients to private insurance with AKF CPA helping patients afford otherwise unaffordable private insurance premiums (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82, 89). Confidential Witness 3 (\"CW 3\"), a former insurance counselor for DaVita clinics in and around Austin, Texas, explains that DaVita conducted training for insurance counselors that emphasized the benefits to DaVita of having patients with private insurance, rather than Medicaid or Medicare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85, 91, 92.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that DaVita's educational materials pushed all ESRD patients toward private insurance, regardless of individualized medical or financial need, by \"telling patients that Medicaid and Medicare would not meet their medical needs, and was much worse than private insurance.\" (ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 68, 72, 76;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-80, 92.) Plaintiffs cite an example of DaVita counseling a patient, who had obtained private insurance prior to becoming a DaVita patient but struggled to pay premiums, on the \"benefits of having private insurance as primary as opposed to Medicare.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) They also cite an example of Confidential Witness 5's (\"CW 5\") husband being told by DaVita staff not to enroll in Medicare, and a DaVita social worker not allowing CW 5's husband to fill out paperwork to enroll in Medicare, which CW 5 and her husband wanted as a safety net. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, DaVita also instructed employees to assure ESRD patients concerned about monthly premiums for private insurance that they may qualify for CPA through AKF, and employees assisted patients in applying for CPA through AKF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70, 79.) Confidential Witness 1 (\"CW 1\"), a former DaVita insurance counselor who worked at several facilities in the New York City area, explained that signing up patients for the AKF CPA program was \"a way to force exchange plans on people.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs also reference public comments filed in response to CMS's August 18, 2016 Request for Information (\"RFI\") regarding dialysis companies' steering patients to commercial insurance plans with AKF would paying patient premiums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-112.) They cite the comments of a former DaVita social worker who stated that DaVita insurance counselors would assure ESRD patients that they would \"preapprove them for AKF\" CPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111.) Another former insurance counselor stated that DaVita closely tracked \"their AKF enrolles and how much money goes for each person that receives assistance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, DaVita contends that it has a statutory obligation to \"educate ESRD patients about any financial resources-such as CPA-that may be available to help pay for their care.\" (ECF No. 43 at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Scrutiny of and Reaction to the AKF CPA Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In July 2016, UnitedHealth sued the American Renal Association for fraud, alleging that the organization targeted Medicaid- and Medicare-eligible patients, and convinced them to enroll in UnitedHealth commercial plans using financial assistance from the AKF. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 18, 2016, CMS issued the RFI seeking information about dialysis companies steering Medicare- and Medicaid-eligible ESRD patients on to commercial health plans through the ACA and use of the AKF CPA program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106.) CMS expressed concern that \"some organizations may be engaging in enrollment activities that put their profit margins ahead of their patients' needs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) DaVita\n   responded to the RFI on September 22, 2016, stating that it \"does not steer patients toward any particular insurance option or plan. DaVita educates its patients so that they are able to make informed decisions that are in their best interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 23, 2016, the\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n   </em>\n   published an investigative report, based on internal DaVita e-mails and interviews with former DaVita employees, which suggested that DaVita systematically steered patients toward commercial plans and AKF CPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118-21.) After publication of the article, DaVita's stock price dropped by $ 2.86 per share. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 31, 2016, DaVita issued a press release stating that it would \"suspend support for applications to the ... charitable premium assistance by patients enrolled in minimum essential Medicaid coverage who are seeking additional coverage on a 2017 ACA Plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123.) DaVita stated that this change would impact only 1% of its patient population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) The press release included only the financial impact for the ESRD patients with ACA plans receiving CPA from AKF, not the total number of its ESRD patients with commercial plans receiving assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 14, 2016, CMS published an interim final rule requiring dialysis providers to disclose to commercial insurers which patients received AKF CPA assistance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the summary of comments received in response to the RFI, CMS observed that \"all commenters on the topic-including insurance companies, dialysis facilities, patients, and non-profit organizations-stated that they believe many dialysis facilities are paying for or arranging payment for individual market health care premiums for the patients they serve.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, \"[c]omments also described that, even though it is financially beneficial to suppliers, enrollment in individual market coverage paid for by dialysis facilities or organizations affiliated with dialysis facilities can lead to ... harm to patients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On December 25, 2016, the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   published an article that described the relationship between AKF and its largest donors, including DaVita, and suggested that AKF denied CPA to patients of dialysis companies who did not donate to AKF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 134-35.) It also discussed AKF's guidelines, which allegedly \"instruct[ed] dialysis providers to track the amount of money their patients received from the AKF and donate an equivalent amount back to the program in order for patients to receive premium assistance.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 135.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On Friday, January 6, 2017, the federal government opened an investigation and served a subpoena on DaVita related to AKF and CPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 136.) DaVita stock fell from $ 65.79 on that day to $ 63.38 per share on Monday, January 9, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 12, 2017, a shareholder activist group wrote a letter to DaVita's board questioning DaVita's increase in commercial patients after the ACA went into effect and its relationship with AKF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.) In DaVita's Form 10-K filed\n   with the SEC on February 24, 2017, DaVita noted that insurance companies had started to include provisions to refuse to accept CPA, which could impact the number of patients able to afford commercial plans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.) On May 2, 2017, DaVita noted \"lower enrollment of patients on the ACA plans\" and that its commercial mix dropped significantly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DaVita subsequently confirmed that over 4,000 patients also received AKF CPA for employer group and COBRA plans, and estimated that its loss in operating income if patients no longer received AKF assistance for commercial non-ACA plans would amount to $ 450 million in financial exposure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 152.) These numbers were in addition to the \"2,000 Medicaid patients who were enrolled in ACA plans with AKF assistance,\" with a potential financial impact of $ 140 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In September and October 2017, third-party reports estimated that \"as much as 60-80% of [DaVita's] earning power is derived from its AKF relationship\" and described the AKF relationship as \"DaVita's sole moat, or a sustainable economic advantage separating it from competitors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-49.) Plaintiffs contend that DaVita's stock dropped over 6%, from $ 61.26 to $ 57.49 in reaction to the September 22, 2017 report, and nearly 10%, from $ 59.82 to $ 53.89 in reaction to the October 9, 2017 report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148, 151.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    E. DaVita's Public Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that DaVita made false and misleading statements and material omissions during the Class Period in its annual 10-K filings, quarterly 10-Q filings, statements made in conjunction with those filings and during earnings calls, press releases, a response to the CMS RFI, and during the 2017 Capital Markets Day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-225.)

Certain of the alleged false statements, particularly those related to educating or steering patients, can be construed as potentially false or misleading independent of the illegality of the underlying scheme.

Cir. 2016) (\"[A]t the moment the company chooses to speak, it takes upon itself the obligation to\n    <em>\n     speak truthfully\n    </em>\n    , and it is the breach of\n    <em>\n     that\n    </em>\n    obligation which forms the basis for the \u00a7 10(b) claim.\" (emphasis in original) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Defendants raise a variety of arguments that Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead any false or misleading statement. Defendants first argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged facts sufficient to support a claim of illegal steering because they fail to identify with particularity the \"when, where and who was involved\" in the purportedly illegal scheme. (ECF No. 43 at 28.) This criticism is unavailing because it is premised on identifying conduct related to an illegal scheme and, as just discussed, Plaintiffs' allegations related to certain steering statements are in fact not all predicated on an underlying illegal scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Defendants also criticize Plaintiffs' failure to identify any DaVita patient who was steered onto \"unnecessary or detrimental insurance.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) However, as an example of such steering, Plaintiffs cite CW 5's experience of DaVita staff refusing to allow CW 5's husband to enroll in Medicare. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6 95.) Moreover, Plaintiffs do not necessarily have to demonstrate that any patient was in fact steered; at this stage, it is sufficient to plead that DaVita expressly disclaimed steering and publicly attributed success to other factors, while fully cognizant that it had a policy of directing ESRD patients to private insurance and internal metrics to demonstrate its success in directing patients.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Finally, Defendants claim that Plaintiffs cannot rely on evidence of DaVita's 2014-15 initiatives to support the falsity of statements made in 2016. (ECF No. 43 at 32.) As a factual matter, Plaintiffs' support for allegations of steering go through at least early 2016. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 95, 101.) According to the 2014-2015 documents referenced by Plaintiffs, DaVita characterized its business plan as patient education, even though the program allegedly pushed people to enroll in private insurance plans. DaVita's 2016 statements challenged by\n    Plaintiffs emphasize the allegedly educational nature of DaVita's actions. It is thus a reasonable inference that DaVita's educational (potential steering) activities continued into 2016 and through the date of the allegedly fraudulent statements. Whether DaVita's program changed by the time it made the 2016 statements is a question best left for summary judgment or trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants do not make any arguments as to the materiality of these statements, nor do they contend that the statements were not made in connection with the sale of securities. The Court will not address arguments not actually raised and briefed by the parties. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have adequately pled that Defendants made false or misleading statements regarding steering and attributing DaVita's success to other factors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Statements Premised on the Illegality of the Underlying Scheme\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The remainder of the allegedly false or misleading statements are premised on the impropriety or illegality of DaVita's relationship with AKF. These statements concern which types of patients were eligible and targeted for AKF CPA, DaVita's relationship to AKF, and whether DaVita failed to disclose that its performance was based on illegal conduct. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 157, 159, 161, 164, 170, 171, 173, 178, 181, 184.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Because Plaintiffs adequately plead a claim for relief based on certain of Defendants' false statements, the Court need not at this juncture determine whether Plaintiffs have also adequately pled the falsity of these statements premised on the illegality of the underlying scheme. This is not to say that claims based on the remaining statements would necessarily survive summary judgment or a Rule 50 motion at trial. Nonetheless, at this time, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled particular facts regarding Defendants' false or misleading statements that, taken as true, would form the basis for a securities fraud action against Defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     D.

Plaintiffs allege that DaVita knew that its statements publicly denying steering patients to ACA plans, made feasible by the AKF CPA, were false when made, and knew that its improving financials were attributable to that companywide effort,\n    and not necessarily as a result of other economic factors. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege, with reference to internal documents and confidential witness statements, that Defendants were aware, or should have been aware, of DaVita's alleged steering program, as well as DaVita's efforts to move patients to private insurance plans with AKF CPA. Through these averments, Plaintiffs clearly allege that Defendants made these statements with the intent to deceive investors about the true source of the DaVita's success, as well as about the extent to which it relied on AKF and CPA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to adequately allege scienter as to steering because \"knowledge of 'steering' does not equate to knowledge of illegal conduct.\" (ECF No. 43 at 34.) Defendants state that \"the internal company documents and former employees' accounts pled here, Opp. at 23-24, aver, at most, that the Defendants knew about the Medicaid Opportunity program's existence, not its alleged illegality.\" (ECF No. 48 at 16.) However, as discussed above, the falsity of Defendants' disclaimer of steering does not necessarily depend on the alleged illegality of DaVita's relationship to AKF. Defendants also add that they \"openly disclosed all the elements of the scheme.\" (ECF No. 43 at 37.) However, this statement is contrary to the facts plausibly pled by Plaintiffs, which allege that DaVita in fact concealed the nature of its so-called \"education\" programs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs do little more than make generalized allegations about Defendants' awareness of DaVita's relationship to AKF, and that they cannot rely on executive knowledge of \"core operations\" to plead scienter. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 43 at 35.) This argument relies on the Tenth Circuit's decision to decline to accept a \"core operations\" inference in order to plead scienter, absent particularized facts showing what executives actually knew.\n    <em>\n     Anderson v. Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335394\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1229/#p1245\">\n     827 F.3d 1229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1245 (10th Cir. 2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Plaintiffs do much more, however, than make generalized allegations related to scienter. Plaintiffs allege that DaVita executives were personally involved in DaVita's reporting of dialysis revenues, revenue per treatment, and other key metrics, and that they closely tracked the dialysis businesses financial metrics. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 242, 246.)\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335394\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1229/#p1245\">\n     827 F.3d at 1246\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . And, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Anderson\n    </em>\n    , Defendants' statements cannot be characterized as \"overly optimistic\" projections about DaVita's abilities to achieve some outcome, because Defendants statements flatly denied the existence of the program that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged existed.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335394\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1229/#p1245\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Defendants also attempt to clarify DaVita's statement that it \"does not steer\" claiming that \"DaVita was asserting that it did not engage in illegal conduct and that its communications with patients about insurance were proper-a position that DaVita maintains and that the Complaint's allegations have not contradicted.\" (ECF No. 48 at 13.) In proffering this clarification, however, Defendants ignore Plaintiffs substantial allegations that DaVita's communications with patients were not solely for the purpose of education, but rather for persuasion. Defendants' own definition of \"steering\"-as legal communications with ESRD patients-is not necessarily supported by the context of the statement, or what a reasonable person would understand that statement to mean. Defendants thus present only a weak plausible alternative explanation as to the meaning of the statement that it \"does not steer.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Weighing the totality of the facts plausibly alleged by the Plaintiffs and Defendants' plausible alternative explanation,\n    the Court finds that these facts give rise to a strong inference that Defendants made statements about steering and the source of Defendants' financial success with the intent to manipulate, deceive, or defraud, or were reckless because their statements presented a danger of misleading buyers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Tellabs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p323\">\n     551 U.S. at 323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573048\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/308/#p323\">\n     127 S.Ct. 2499\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    <strong>\n     E.

(ECF No. 43 at 37-39; ECF No. 48 at 19-20.) Here again, Defendants focus on whether these public announcements revealed findings of illegality or fraudulent conduct. In other words, Defendants contend that the public statements merely revealed the\n    <em>\n     risk of fraud\n    </em>\n    , rather than an actual fraud or illegality.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    While DaVita is correct that the announcement of a federal investigation into its relevant conduct is not, without more, sufficient to allege loss causation, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support a claim of loss causation because they state facts connecting corrective disclosures revealing the fraudulent nature of the statements discussed in Part C.2 above to a subsequent price drop.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5674548,3360918\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/558/1130/\">\n     558 F.3d at 1137\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    First, Plaintiffs allege that the\n    <em>\n     St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n    </em>\n    revealed that DaVita systematically steered all patients to commercial plans, backed by the AKF CPA, with reference to internal DaVita documents to contradict DaVita's explicit statement that it did not steer and merely provided education to ESRD patients. (ECF No. 36 \u00b6\u00b6 118-21.) Thereafter, DaVita's stock\n    price dropped $ 2.86 per share. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 122.) Here, the report did not merely reveal a risk of fraud, but rather that DaVita's business practices were the opposite of what they represented in public statements.

This revelation contradicted DaVita's express contention that its improvements in commercial mix and financials was due to the ACA exchanges or improvements in the economy, rather than primarily due to its steering and relationship to AKF CPA.
