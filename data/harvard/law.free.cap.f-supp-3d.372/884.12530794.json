Before the Court is the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings filed by Plaintiff Safeco Insurance Company of America (\"Safeco\"). (Doc. 22.) The motion is fully briefed. (Docs. 23, 24, 25.) For the reasons below, the motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   as to Defendants C.A. and Christy Owens. (Doc. 22). Safeco is further ordered to show cause why it's case against Defendants Amanda Schweitzer and Jonah Schweitzer should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The relevant facts in this matter are undisputed. C.A. is a minor child who, through his mother Christy Owens (\"Owens\"), has a pending civil action for damages in state court against his middle school teacher, Amanda Schweitzer (\"Amanda\"), and Amanda's husband, Jonah Schweitzer (\"Jonah\"). C.A.'s civil action stems from the allegation that Amanda groomed and subsequently engaged in sexual intercourse with C.A. Amanda has been charged with crimes for her alleged sexual misconduct. Amanda and Jonah are insured under a Safeco homeowners' insurance policy. After Owens and C.A. made a demand on Safeco for payment of the policy proceeds, Safeco brought this declaratory judgment action naming as defendants: Amanda, Jonah, C.A., and Owens. In its motion for judgment on the pleadings, Safeco requests for judgment to be entered in its favor by declaring that there is\n   no coverage under the policy for C.A.'s claims against Amanda and Jonah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To date, neither Amanda nor Jonah Schweitzer has appeared in this action. The Clerk of the Court previously entered defaults against Amanda and Jonah. (Docs. 14, 20.) However, Safeco has not submitted a motion for default judgment as to these defendants. Accordingly, the Court will address Safeco's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to Defendants C.A. and Christy Owens only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying State Civil Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Analysis of the arguments at issue requires review of the petition filed by C.A. in state court (the \"Petition\"). C.A. sues Amanda for negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count I) and false imprisonment (Count II) and sues Jonah for negligence (Count III). The factual allegations which are common to all counts are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   6. C.A. was a student at North Middle School during the 2016-17 school year.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   7. During that same year, [Amanda] was an adult female teacher employed by the Joplin School District (\"JSD\") at North Middle School where she served as a teacher to C.A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   8. In early 2017, [Amanda] began grooming C.A. via social media and text message in violation of JSD policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   9. On or about March 29, 2017, C.A. was late for the bus and subsequently missed school.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   10. [Amanda] messaged C.A. when she noticed he was not at school.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   11. [Amanda] subsequently drove to his home and picked him up without the consent of his mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   12. While at her home, [Amanda] engaged in sexual intercourse with C.A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   13. As a result of the encounter, C.A. has sustained emotional injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   14. In addition, C.A. was forced to finish the semester off campus after the encounter with [Amanda] came to light. He subsequently transferred schools.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc. 1-2 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Each count sets out additional relevant allegations. In Count I, for negligent infliction of emotional distress against Amanda, the Petition alleges that Amanda breached a duty to C.A. \"by engaging in sexual intercourse with the minor[, C.A].\" (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 18.) \"By engaging in sex with C.A. at her home, it must have been foreseeable to [Amanda] that her conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing distress to him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) In Count II, for false imprisonment against Amanda, the Petition alleges that \"[b]y falsely imprisoning C.A. at her home and subsequently engaging in sex with him there, it must have been foreseeable to [Amanda] that her conduct involved an unreasonable risk of causing distress to the minor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Count III is the sole count against Jonah. In Count III, the Petition alleges that Jonah \"knew, or should have known, of the proclivities of his wife to 'groom' young, male students and prey on them for sex.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) The Petition further alleges that despite this knowledge, Jonah was negligent for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   a. Failing to warn others of his wife's dangerous proclivities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   b. Failing to timely call the police;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   c. Failing to protect C.A., while he was at the home [Jonah] shared with [Amanda], from the foreseeable criminal conduct of [Amanda]; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   d. Failing to take reasonable measures to ensure [Amanda] would never be alone at home with a minor ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 31(a)-(d) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Homeowner's Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Also necessary to the analysis is a review of the relevant definition and exclusion\n   provisions in Safeco's policy issued to Amanda and Jonah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policy provides liability coverage for Amanda and Jonah \"[i]f a claim is made or a suit is brought against any insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies[.]\" (Doc. 1-3 at 26.) The policy defines \"occurrence\" to mean \"an accident ... which results in: (1) bodily injury[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The policy contains the following three relevant exclusions. First, the policy excludes from coverage bodily injury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   which is expected or intended by any insured or which is the foreseeable result of an act or omission intended by any insured;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   This exclusion applies even if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) Such bodily injury ... is of a different kind or degree than expected or intended; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (2) Such bodily injury ... is sustained by a different person, or persons, than expected or intended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Second, the policy excludes from coverage bodily injury \"which results from violation of criminal law committed by, or with the knowledge or consent of any insured. This exclusion applies whether or not any insured is charged or convicted of a violation of criminal law[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) Third, the policy excludes from coverage bodily injury \"arising out of physical or mental abuse, sexual molestation or sexual harassment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) The Court will refer to the three exclusions using Safeco's labels, respectively: (1) the expected/intended injury exclusion, (2) the violation of criminal law exclusion, and (3) the physical, mental, or sexual abuse exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With the background and relevant legal standards as the framework, the Court turns to the arguments in the motion as to whether the policy covers C.A.'s claims against Amanda and Jonah. The facts are undisputed and the coverage issue can be decided as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the instant motion, Safeco maintains that by the unambiguous terms of the insurance policy at issue, and pursuant to Missouri public policy, there is no insurance coverage available to the perpetrator of sexual abuse of a minor for her misconduct. Safeco also argues that coverage is excluded for both Amanda and Jonah under three different exclusions: (1) the expected/intended injury exclusion, (2) the violation of criminal law exclusion, and (3) the physical, mental, or sexual abuse exclusion. Safeco contends that if any one of these exclusions is found to apply, there is no coverage available under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants do not contest Safeco's position that the policy does not cover C.A.'s claims against Amanda. Rather, in response to Safeco's motion, Defendants Owens and C.A. (collectively, \"Defendants\") argue that the application of the doctrine of concurrent proximate causation permits coverage for C.A.'s claim against Jonah because the claim constitutes an independent and distinct act of negligence that does not involve excluded conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although Defendants appear to concede that there is no coverage for Amanda, the Court must still determine whether Safeco is entitled to judgment as a matter of law that there is no coverage for Amanda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Then, the Court must consider whether, notwithstanding the issue of coverage for Amanda, there is coverage for Jonah based on the doctrine of concurrent proximate causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Terms of the Policy as to Amanda\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Upon review, the Court is persuaded that there is no coverage for C.A.'s claims against Amanda based on the unambiguous terms of the policy. The Court notes that Defendants raise no argument that the language of the policy is ambiguous. To begin, the policy provides coverage if a claim is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury caused by an occurrence. (Doc. 1-3 at 26.) The policy defines an \"occurrence\" to mean an \"accident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.) Although the policy does not define \"accident,\" by its common meaning it is \"[a]n event that takes place without one's foresight or expectation.\"\n   <em>\n    Am. States Ins. Co. v. Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11701075\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/974/647/#p650\">\n    974 S.W.2d 647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650 (Mo. App. 1998). Regardless of subjective intent, as a matter of law, sexual abuse of a minor is not an \"accident,\" and it is therefore not an \"occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.M.A. v.

Because Amanda is deemed as a matter of law to have expected or intended the harm to C.A., coverage for Jonah is also excluded by the \"any insured\" language of the expected/intended acts exclusion.

Amanda has been charged with crimes for the same conduct alleged in C.A.'s Petition. Even though the charges are still pending, the \"exclusion applies whether or not any insured is charged or convicted of a violation of criminal law[.]\" (Doc. 1-3 at 27.) For the same reasons addressed with respect to the expected/intended injury exclusion, there is no coverage for Jonah because the violation of criminal law exclusion applies to such violations by \"any insured.\" Further, this exclusion applies to exclude coverage for criminal acts committed \"with the knowledge or consent of any insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Petition specifically alleges that Jonah \"knew, or should have known, of the proclivities of his wife to 'groom' young, male students and prey on them for sex.\" (Doc. 1-2 at 5.) Therefore, the plain and unambiguous terms of the violation of criminal law exclusion prevents coverage for both Amanda and Jonah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   A third exclusion in the policy excludes from coverage bodily injury \"arising out of physical or mental abuse, sexual molestation or sexual harassment.\" (Doc. 1-3 at 29.)

C.A. alleges that Jonah was negligent by failing to warn others of his wife's dangerous proclivities; failing to timely call the police; failing to protect C.A. while he was at the Schweitzer's home from the foreseeable conduct of Amanda; and failing to take reasonable measures to ensure Amanda would never be alone at home with a minor.

Therefore, the cause (Jonah's failure to act) is not independent and distinct from the excluded cause (Amanda's intentional acts). The Court therefore declines to apply the doctrine of concurrent proximate cause to permit coverage for Jonah.
