This action led to criminal charges of Wanton Destruction of Livestock against the plaintiffs in Iron County, as well as the lawsuit pending before this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Originally filed in 2015 while their criminal prosecutions were pending in state court, plaintiffs amended this \u00a7 1983 action as a matter of right three months later. (ECF No. 3.) In both initial complaints, plaintiffs sought for this court to certify an issue of first impression to the Utah Supreme Court, namely, that a legitimate finding of probable cause for the criminal charges against them depends on a determination of the animal's ownership by a brand inspector that complies with various statutory provisions\n   of the Utah Livestock Brand and Anti-Theft Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for two reasons. (ECF No. 6.) First, they alleged that plaintiffs would have a full and fair opportunity to litigate their statutory ownership arguments in the pending state criminal cases, such that\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention applied and certification of the state issue was not necessary. Second, they alleged that plaintiffs' complaint otherwise failed to state a claim for relief under Rule 12(b)(6). The following day, defendants also answered the amended complaint. (ECF No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs filed additional motions that led to the procedural posture now before the court. First, plaintiffs moved to amend (the court refers to this proposed complaint as \"the first proposed second amended complaint\"). (ECF No. 11.) Second, plaintiffs filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions against defendants (ECF No. 25) and third, plaintiffs filed a conditional motion to stay defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss in the event that the court exercised\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   abstention. (ECF No. 30.) A hearing was held on these motions. Following the hearing, the court granted the motion to stay this action until the underlying criminal prosecutions were completed and all appeals exhausted. The court also deferred ruling on the motion to dismiss (ECF No. 6) and the motion to amend the complaint (ECF No. 11), but denied the motion for sanctions. (ECF No. 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' criminal prosecutions and appeals became complete in 2018, when the Utah Court of Appeals issued its decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and plaintiffs did not petition for review by the Utah Supreme Court. Plaintiffs withdrew their first motion to amend the complaint and filed a second motion to amend the complaint (ECF No. 47). This proposed amended complaint was subsequently revised twice, (ECF No. 50 and ECF No. 57-1), and the court refers to the proposal at ECF No. 57-1 as the \"second proposed Second Amended Complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs also filed a motion to lift the stay that had been in place while the underlying criminal matters and appeals were pending. Defendants did not object and the motion is GRANTED. (ECF No. 46.) The court does not believe that additional oral argument would be helpful in reaching its decision on the remaining motions. Accordingly, consistent with DUCivR7-1(f), the motions will be determined by the court on the basis of the previous arguments and the written memoranda of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO AMEND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue that the court should decide their deferred motion to dismiss prior to considering the rather moving target of plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint, including the various iterations of those proposed amended complaints. On one hand, it would be a more efficient use of the court's resources to consider the latest iteration of plaintiffs' second proposed Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 57-1), because the resolution of the underlying criminal cases and appeal prompted plaintiffs to eliminate all references in earlier complaints to the statutory arguments about how to determine ownership of horses as well as to eliminate two other claims outright.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand,\n   plaintiffs' second proposed Second Amended Complaint problematically contains the statement that it does not stand alone, but rather \"re-allege[s] and incorporate[s] by this reference any and all previous allegations set forth in previous pleadings, if applicable, including all previous factual allegations and all allegations regarding the legal bases and applicable law regarding Plaintiff(s)' claims.\" (Second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 12, ECF No. 57-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ultimately, the court did examine the factual allegations in all versions of the complaint in deciding defendants' motion to dismiss (excluding the two eliminated causes of action). Because no version of the existing or proposed complaints survives defendants' motion to dismiss,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the court DENIES plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint.

Plaintiffs' speech and/or expressions of this type is protected under the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Van Deelen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617679\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1151/#p1155\">\n    497 F.3d at 1156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The complaints go on, however, to allege that eventually, on or about April 27, 2013, plaintiffs knowingly took matters into their own hands and castrated some of the feral, estray horses, as well as Mr. Bailey's problematic pinto stallion. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6 52, ECF No. 2; second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. 57-1.) After this incident, both complaints allege that Iron County government officials began to engage in a host of adverse actions against plaintiffs, including arresting, searching, seizing, detaining, and prosecuting them for Wanton Destruction of Livestock, warning them that they could be charged with witness tampering or obstruction of justice if they attempted to contact or engage in settlement discussions or negotiations with Allen Bailey-who was a witness and a victim in the criminal prosecutions-and in doing so that defendants injured them by violating their First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 125-128, ECF No. 2; second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, ECF No. 57-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation cause of action must fail because, on the face of the complaints, the specific adverse actions about which plaintiffs complain arose only after April 27, 2013 from plaintiffs' constitutionally unprotected conduct, namely, from plaintiffs knowingly castrating horses that did not belong to them. Under Utah law, this was criminal activity and not speech or expressive activity protected by the First Amendment. Furthermore, the required nexus between the adverse actions defendants allegedly took and \"the plaintiff's exercise of constitutionally protected conduct,\"\n   <em>\n    Klen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050269\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/498/#p508\">\n    661 F.3d at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is missing. Plaintiffs have not adequately pled that the injuries they suffered as a result of defendants' adverse actions were substantially motivated in response to plaintiffs' protected, rather than unprotected, speech or activities. As a result, the plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation cause of action fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Warrantless search, seizure, arrest, detention of persons and property under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs allege violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments based on allegations that defendants lacked probable cause to search, seize, arrest, or detain plaintiffs or their property. As previously noted, plaintiffs' second proposed Second Amended Complaint abandons the \"Brand Certification of Livestock\" requirement as an obstacle to probable cause, which was thoroughly litigated in state court where plaintiffs' arguments did not prevail. Instead, plaintiffs now argue that probable cause did not exist because law enforcement officers relied on Allen Bailey's statements of the value of the horses castrated by plaintiffs to justify a warrantless felony arrest rather than charging them with a misdemeanor. This argument is based on\n   allegations in all versions of plaintiffs' complaints. (Compl. \u00b6 74, ECF No. 2; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 74, ECF No. 3; first proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 74, ECF No. 11-1; and second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23, 40, 73; ECF No. 57-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants argue that these claims are precluded because the Utah state courts have fully reviewed and ruled in their favor on plaintiffs' probable cause arguments, and in any event, there was probable cause under the Fourth Amendment.

Minor differences in word choice notwithstanding, the cases set forth essentially the same requirements. Having thus concluded, the court cannot consider plaintiffs' arguments that the state court improperly applied the standard to them until it considers whether issue preclusion prevents plaintiffs from claiming insufficiency of constitutionally valid probable cause when\n   the state court has already reviewed and ruled that probable cause existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Review of Probable Cause Determination is Barred by Issue Preclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Issue preclusion prevents a party from relitigating any \"issue once it has suffered an adverse determination on the issue, even if the issue arises when the party is pursuing or defending against a different claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Park Lake Resources Ltd.

At plaintiffs' November 13, 2013 preliminary hearing in state court in their criminal cases, after hearing from witnesses including Allen Bailey, a Utah magistrate judge bound plaintiffs over for trial after finding probable cause to believe that the felony crime of Wanton Destruction of Livestock had been committed on April 27, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 108, ECF No. 2; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 108, ECF No. 3; and first proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 111, ECF No. 11-1.) This determination was reviewed at a hearing by a Utah state district judge on January 27, 2015, where again, the court found probable cause to believe the offense had been committed and denied the motion to quash. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 111, ECF No. 2; First Am. Compl. \u00b6 111, ECF No. 3; and first proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 114, ECF No. 11-1.) As plaintiffs repeatedly allege in their complaint, the state court has at least twice decided the issue of probable cause, and not in their favor. This element of issue preclusion is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, the court examines whether \"the prior action has been finally adjudicated on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Park Lake Resources\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216440\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1132/#p1136\">\n    378 F.3d at 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs' Utah state convictions were challenged on direct appeal, on the grounds of both ownership and value of the castrated horses, and the Utah Court of Appeals upheld the convictions by decision dated November 29, 2018.

This element of issue preclusion is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The third element of issue preclusion is whether \"the party against whom the doctrine is invoked was a party, or in privity with a party, to the prior adjudication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216440\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1132/#p1136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants invoke the doctrine of issue preclusion against plaintiffs Marvin Jay and Colby Hunt. Marvin Jay Hunt was a party in the appeal of his state conviction.

As noted previously, plaintiffs' complaints repeatedly acknowledge having challenged probable cause in the underlying state cases. While plaintiffs' second proposed Second Amended\n   Complaint abandons the \"Brand Certification of Livestock\" ownership requirement as an obstacle to probable cause, and instead focuses on the allegedly improper reliance by law enforcement officers on Allen Bailey's statements of the value of the horses castrated by plaintiffs to justify a felony warrantless arrest, the record unquestionably reveals that plaintiffs had every opportunity to assert value as the basis and grounds for its probable cause arguments to the magistrate judge, district court judge, and again on appeal. Plaintiffs argue that \"there was little overlap between the substantive facts, issues, claims and merits of the underlying criminal cases, and constitutional claims in this case, which focuses on how Plaintiffs were treated by Defendants in terms of applicable constitutional standards and requirements.\" (Mot. to Amend \u00b6 5; ECF No. 47.) Plaintiffs are incorrect as to all claims that depend on probable cause for their support. Plaintiffs had notice and opportunity to be heard on the issue of probable cause throughout their state court proceedings. The state courts decided that issue and the Hunts lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   All of the elements of issue preclusion are met. Accordingly, this court concludes that all of plaintiffs' proposed causes of action challenging probable cause are precluded. The bottom line is that defendants had testimony supporting sufficient value in the damaged horses to charge a felony offense. The state courts reviewed and rejected plaintiffs' challenges that the evidence was not sufficient. It is irrelevant to the analysis that a jury ultimately accepted that the evidence did not sustain that value. The evidence has been repeatedly found sufficient to support probable cause. The majority of plaintiffs' claims are Fourth and/or Fourteenth Amendment claims based on the allegation of insufficient probable cause. The court is precluded from considering any of them, and they are appropriately dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Excessive Bail\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiffs allege violations of the prohibition against excessive bail in the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Other than a conclusory allegation that the amount was \"excessive,\" plaintiffs\n   have not alleged any facts that could demonstrate that the magistrate abused his discretion in setting the amount of bail. Nor have plaintiffs alleged that defendants are the parties who set their bail or negatively affected its amount, because they allege that the magistrate reduced bail notwithstanding Attorney McUne's objections. Attorney McUne is not named as a defendant; rather, plaintiffs seek to hold Attorney Garrett responsible for McUne's objections, ineffective as they ultimately were.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 85, 152-54, ECF No. 2; First Am.

Further, \"[a] plaintiff may succeed on a \u00a7 1983 supervisory-liability claim by showing that the defendant 'promulgated, created, implemented, or possessed responsibility for the continued operation of a policy that ... caused the complained of constitutional harm' and 'acted with the state of mind required to establish the alleged constitutional deprivation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Moya v.

While plaintiffs have vigorously alleged throughout the complaints that Sheriff Gower had the state of mind to commit a constitutional violation, there are no non-conclusory allegations that he \"promulgated, created, implemented, or possessed responsibility for the continued operation of a policy\" of accepting less than court-ordered bail.\n   <em>\n    Contra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dodds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3707080\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1185/#p1199\">\n    614 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there is no factual basis to support liability against Sheriff Gower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The court further concludes that plaintiffs should not be allowed to amend the complaint to state a cause of action on this claim. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"A party may amend its pleadings once as a matter of course.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). Plaintiffs have done that. The subsequent proposed pleadings fail to cure the deficiencies and amendment appears to be futile. \"Refusing leave to amend is generally only justified upon a showing of undue delay, undue prejudice to the opposing party, bad faith or dilatory motive, failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, or futility of amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Frank v.

In total, the plaintiffs have already filed at least six versions of their complaint and/or proposed complaints, and none of them allege a factual basis for this claim against Sheriff Gower.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, defendants specifically identified the deficiencies in the factual assertions supporting this claim and moved to dismiss it. In response, plaintiffs filed two motions for leave to amend that are silent about additional facts that would support liability on this claim. Neither motion even suggests that plaintiffs have additional facts that could be alleged sufficient to support Sheriff Gower's liability on this claim. Plaintiffs' reply memorandum specifically addresses the proposed amended supervisory liability claims and argues that they do not just claim that other defendants were merely acting with Sheriff Gower's \"knowledge and acquiescence,\" but that Sheriff Gower was \"intentionally directing the other Defendants' actions as part of a deliberate effort to retaliate against Plaintiffs.\" (Pls.' Reply Memo. 9-10,\n   ECF No. 57.) The problem with this argument is that plaintiffs have never alleged anything but conclusory statements regarding Sheriff Gower's intentional direction, actions, or policies, and certainly none regarding the bail posting issue. Thus, this claim is dismissed and leave to amend is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Selective Enforcement (Discrimination, Equal Protection)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, under the Fourteenth Amendment, that state officials singled them out for discriminatory and unequal treatment by selectively enforcing laws against them while similarly situated individuals-including Allen Bailey-were not prosecuted. A claim for selective enforcement requires plaintiffs to first allege specific facts, as opposed to conclusory statements, to show that \"others similarly situated generally have not been proceeded against for the type of conduct forming the basis of the charge\" against them.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

They have not alleged the existence of any similarly situated individuals who engaged in the type of conduct for which plaintiffs were charged, specifically gelding animals belonging to others leading to a charge of Wanton Destruction of Livestock. At most, they have merely made wholly conclusory allegations that there are others similarly situated, including Allen Bailey. With respect to Bailey's conduct, however, they allege he engaged in trespassing, vandalizing, stealing water and personal property, and telephone threats. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 121-22, 165, ECF No. 3; first proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 125-26, 177, ECF No. 11-1; and second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 30, 65-66, ECF No. 57-1.) This is not the same or similar conduct as plaintiffs' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There is no allegation in any of the complaints that identify any individuals who engaged in the same conduct as plaintiffs but were not prosecuted, which is fatal to their claim because it does not meet the first element of the cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a selective enforcement claim and this claim is dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Just Compensation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that one of their horses was damaged when it panicked and ran into a squeeze chute and was injured during a nighttime search of horses in their corral by Deputy Humphries on November 6, 2013. Plaintiffs also allege that Deputy Humphries also told them they could not sell a brown gelding in their corral pending DNA testing. They further allege that Deputy Humphries informed them on this date that he was investigating a claim by Allen Bailey of the theft of a\n   pinto and/or brown gelding horse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (First Am.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 89, 95, ECF No. 57-1.) These actions, plaintiffs allege, amount to property damage and deprival of their property without due process or just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides as follows: \"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. None of plaintiffs' complaints assert that defendants damaged or took their property for \"public use.\" Additionally, plaintiffs failed to respond to this argument in defendants' motion to dismiss and did not allege otherwise in their subsequently proposed complaints. Based on this, the court dismisses plaintiffs' takings claim for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Municipal Liability\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Iron County is responsible for violating their constitutional rights under a theory of municipal liability. \"Municipalities can be liable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   only for their own unlawful acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Pyle v.

Instead, the complaints merely contain conclusory statements that defendants \"engaged in policies, procedures, customs, practices, training, and supervision\" that resulted in violation of their constitutional rights. Plaintiffs also fail to allege similarly situated individuals being similarly mistreated to demonstrate the existence of an informal policy or custom to violate constitutional rights. They fail to allege specific facts demonstrating a causal link between Iron County policies or customs of violating constitutional rights to a particular violation of plaintiffs' rights. Instead, they merely state the elements of the cause of action and conclusorily claim that defendants engaged in this conduct. Without\n   sufficient factual allegations to support a reasonable inference of a municipal liability cause of action, however, the court must dismiss this cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   8.\n   <em>\n    Declaratory Judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiffs' first cause of action in both the First Amended Complaint and the second proposed Second Amended Complaint is for Declaratory Judgment. In the First Amended Complaint, this claim primarily addresses the brand inspection of ownership issue in determining probable cause for a charge of Wanton Destruction of Livestock, which the plaintiffs have now abandoned. (First Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 123-26, ECF No. 3.) The court dismisses this count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the second proposed Second Amended Complaint, plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that their constitutional rights were violated under every other cause of action pled elsewhere in the complaint. The court has already determined that none of the other causes of action state claims upon which relief can be granted; thus, paragraphs A through J of plaintiffs' first cause of action in the second proposed Second Amended Complaint are dismissed for the same reasons. In paragraph K, however, plaintiffs seek a determination that was not previously pled. This paragraph states: \"Determination as to whether, following the outcome of the Jay Hunt trial, Defendants threatened to \"break the bank\" in an attempt to crush Plaintiff Colby Hunt by convicting him of a serious felony, in further demonstration of their malice and ill-will towards Plaintiffs Hunt.\" (Second proposed Sec. Am. Compl. \u00b6 59(K), ECF No. 57-1.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The alleged threatening statement does not state a claim for relief itself. At best, and based on the number of times plaintiffs use the term \"malice\" or \"malicious\" throughout the complaint, the court concludes that they are attempting to state a claim for malicious prosecution. If so, the claim must be dismissed. A \u00a7 1983\"malicious prosecution claim includes the following elements: (1) the defendant caused the plaintiff's continued confinement or prosecution; (2) the original action terminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) no probable cause supported the original arrest, continued confinement, or prosecution; (4) the defendant acted with malice; and (5) the plaintiff sustained damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v. DeReyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582012\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/790/#p799\">\n    528 F.3d 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (10th Cir. 2008). Plaintiffs here were convicted of the criminal charges against them, and, as noted above, the state court found that probable cause supported the prosecution. Thus, this paragraph does not state a claim for relief and is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The court understands the plaintiffs' frustration with the Sheriff's Office's failure to respond to their complaints about stray horses and the impact their neighbor's conduct was having on them and their operations. In a civil society, however, a party cannot simply take the law into his own hands and use self-help in disregard of another's property and legal rights. No matter how frustrating, the plaintiffs were required to seek legal recourse, not self-help. The claims plaintiffs now attempt to assert fail for the reasons stated above. The motion to lift the stay is GRANTED (ECF No. 46), defendants' Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED (ECF No. 6), and plaintiffs' Motion to Amend is DENIED.
