This case arises from allegations by the Plaintiff that the Defendants used the Plaintiff's wireless router, which was leased from the Defendants, to broadcast a public Wi-Fi network, without the Plaintiff's authorization. In a Memorandum of Decision &amp; Order, dated September 27, 2017 (the \"Order\"), the Court dismissed the Plaintiff's CFAA claim, leaving the state law claim as the only remaining cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendants have moved to exclude the reports and testimony of Dr. Jennifer Golbeck and Dr. Mitchell Smooke. In addition, the Plaintiff has moved for class certification, pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\" or \" FED. R. CIV.

The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plaintiff is a resident of Brooklyn, New York and a subscriber to Cablevision's private Wi-Fi service, Optimum Online Wi-Fi (\"Optimum Residential Wi-Fi\"). Cablevision provided Jensen with a router free of charge in conjunction with his purchase of Optimum Residential Wi-Fi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cablevision is an American corporation, which is incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. Cablevision provides Optimum Residential Wi-Fi, along with other cable and internet services, to customers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania and is registered with the New York Department of State. Its principal place of business is\n   located at 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, New York 11714. In June 2016, Cablevision was acquired by Altice and has since done business in the United States as \"Altice USA.\" Amended Class Action Complaint (\"Compl.\") \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Altice is a Dutch telecommunications company with an international footprint. Its principal place of business is in Amsterdam. Altice \"provides and/or oversees\" Optimum Residential Wi-Fi.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Public Wi-Fi Network\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In July 2013, the Defendants conceived of a public Wi-Fi hotspot network that utilized the Wi-Fi home networks of their customer base (\"Optimum Public Wi-Fi\"). Declaration of Gillian L. Wade (\"Class Cert. Wade Decl.\"), Feb. 9, 2018, Ex. 2 at 37:10-24. Originally, Cablevision considered providing customers with the opportunity to opt out of participating in Optimum Public Wi-Fi, which at the time was referred to as \"Home as a Hotspot.\" Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 2 at 31:5-16. The Defendants conducted market research, in part to determine customer opinion on this new network. This revealed that customers were concerned about control, security, internet speed and cost. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 4 at CV00034939. In pertinent part, the study explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Subscribers often talked about control and how they want to maintain control over their connections. The fact that the router will be deployed to customers as an upgrade whether requested or not caused some to feel a loss of control, which is problematic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Security was a major concern. Despite being told that [the public network] operates on a completely separate network and that tech remote-in requires permission, subscribers often worried that their personal data would be compromised. Saying that this is not the case was enough for some, but others needed more convincing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Many worried that having guests on their network would mean decreased speeds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   There was a rather widespread assumption that the smart router would come at a price and/or would increase monthly charges - even after people read through information noting \"no extra cost.\" This was concerning and another potential barrier to the adoption of the device.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7410081\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/473/#p483\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When the service was launched, Cablevision altered its initial concept and revised its \"Home as a Hotspot\" name to \"Optimum Wi-Fi.\" Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 2 at 37:10-24. The program called for a modification of Cablevision's wireless routers, which were provided to customers free of charge. In addition to providing the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network, Cablevision's routers were configured to broadcast the separate, publically accessible Optimum Public Wi-Fi. This network is only available to active Optimum subscribers. Declaration of Matthew Ingber (\"Ingber Decl.\"), Ex.10 at 35:18-24. Cablevision provides one of four models of wireless routers: Sagemcom 5260, Sagemcom 3965, D-Link DIR-868L and Netgear 3400. Each router became a component, along with other Cablevision wireless routers provided to other customers, of a large-scale, public Wi-Fi network. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 46. Optimum Public Wi-Fi is accessible to any active Optimum subscriber within range of the wireless router and is not password protected. Customers are not able to detect or monitor any of the individuals who utilize their wireless router to access Optimum Public Wi-Fi. However, customers\n   may elect not to use the Cablevision-provided router and instead, purchase their own. Ingber Decl., Ex. 11 at 75:22-76:6. Allegedly, this large-scale, public network is part of a concerted effort by the Defendants to utilize their customer base to compete with cellular networks. Jensen claims that the Defendants are \"externaliz[ing] much of the capital and operating costs\" of such a network, in order to compensate for the lack of their own network infrastructure. Compl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Cablevision's Alleged Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Plaintiff contends that Cablevision altered its initial conduct based on the concerns noted in the customer opinion survey, including the assertion that public messaging avoided any reference to the integration of customers' home Wi-Fi network. Jensen points to an Optimum internet page that states \"Optimum hotspots are a network of over 1.5 million super fast WiFi internet access points in locations including shopping centers, major streets, train platforms, parks, marinas, sports fields and more.\" Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 2 at 89:15-90:17. Cablevision's 30(b)(6) deponent testified, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q Okay. Is it fair to assume that Cablevision has engaged in advertising campaigns with regard to the Optimum Wi-Fi hotspot?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q Does Cablevision still, to this day, engage in campaigns with regard to the Optimum Wi-Fi network?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A We do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q Do any of these campaigns specifically mention the second SSID?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A Again, as I've stated previously, we don't talk about the second SSID. We talk about the benefit of it. So we talk about the Optimum Wi-Fi network, the one that exists for home and the one that exists when you're out and about within the proximity of a hotspot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Q That's consistent across all of the campaigns?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   MR. KIRSCHNER: Object to form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Q They're talking about the benefit, not the SSID.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MR. KIRSCHNER: Object to form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Q I think you've already said this, but just to be sure, are you aware of any marketing material or collateral that Cablevision has provided to consumers that specifically mentions the second SSID?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   A It's a very, very, broad, broad statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Q I understand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   A I do not know off the top of my head. It may be out there, so -- what I can say is of the materials we looked at today, it is something that was not in those materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Q Sitting here today, you can't specifically recall a material that discussed the second SSID?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   MR. KIRSCHNER: Object to form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   A No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 5 at 153:2-24, 186:5-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Plaintiff contends that prior to the launch, Cablevision decided to actively discourage any customers from being able to turn off the service by establishing a policy of instructing customer service representatives to inform concerned customers that Optimum Public Wi-Fi could not be disabled under any circumstances. Further, the Defendants purportedly configured routers to prevent customer devices from seeing that their router was used for Optimum Public Wi-Fi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Jensen argues that these decisions were devised by Cablevision's leadership. In a\n   January 22, 2014 email, executive Kristin Dolan emailed then-CEO James Dolan stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   We want to be sure that we're violating your edict of not mentioning [Optimum Public Wi-Fi] in our collateral. These examples include language on friends and family accessing Optimum WiFi from home (which is tested and confirmed as a perceived benefit) but do not specifically talk about the [Optimum Public Wi-Fi] as being the mechanism by which this added value is achieved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   I'd vote to keep this language in but we want to be sure we're not going against your direction on \"no mention.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 3. Customer routers account for over 80% of the hotspots in the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 2 at 90:2-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Cablevision's Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To purchase a service from Cablevision, customers must first enter into a contract as a condition for obtaining service. During the relevant time period, there were two ways that customers could sign the General Terms and Conditions of Service (\"General Terms\"). Some customers awere presented with a physical work order at the time of installation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A. In that case, either the customer or their authorized representative signed the work order which contained a series of terms on the back of it. Other customers signed the General Terms using an iPad which was handed to them by the technician, also at the time of installation. The customer was required to check a box that stated \"I agree\" at every screen and sign their signature at the end of the document. While this document did not contain any reference to Optimum Public Wi-Fi, it did state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition to these General Terms and Conditions of Service, Subscriber agrees to be bound by the terms of service for the applicable Optimum service as set forth at\n   <em>\n    www.optimum.net\n   </em>\n   , such as Optimum TV, Optimum Online and Optimum Voice, as well as the Cablevision Customer Privacy Notice, as such may be updated from time to time (collectively, the \"Terms of Service\"), which are incorporated herein by this reference. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and Conditions below and the Terms of Service, the Terms of Service shall control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 40 (internal citations omitted). Further, the General Terms contain an arbitration provision, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS SUBJECT TO A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICES. THIS PROVISION INCLUDES A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND PROVISIONS FOR OPTING OUT OF ARBITRATION. A FULL COPY IS CONTAINED IN THE TERMS OF SERVICE, available at \"optimum.net/serviceinfo.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Compl., Ex. A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The second pertinent agreement is the service terms which relate to residential Wi-Fi the Agreement for Optimum Online (the \"Agreement\"). The Agreement stated, \"The Optimum Router is preconfigured to distribute a second wireless network (i.e. an Optimum WiFi Hotspot) in addition to the Home Network. This Optimum WiFi Hotspot is separate from the Home Network and is accessible by certain authorized Optimum WiFi users.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    \u00b6 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendants' 30(b)(6) witness testified that this language was the only reference to Optimum Public Wi-Fi in any customer agreement or terms of service. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 5 at 38:7-34. The Agreement was not provided to class members\n   on the date of installation and was only found on the \"Service Terms &amp; Info\" page on the Optimum website.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    at 26:3-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Service Terms &amp; Info page included a series of additional agreements for a variety of products. These agreements also included an arbitration clause. Declaration of Anne Cheung \u00b6 2. The Defendants argue that it was incorporated by reference. Jensen contends that there was no similar statement in any of the Defendants' marketing materials. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 5 at 153:2-24. Less than one percent of customers have opted out of Cablevision's arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ingber Decl., Ex. 1 (listing all subscribers who opted out of Cablevision's arbitration clause as of January 1, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Plaintiff's Experience\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On June 5, 2015, Cablevision entered into a contract with the Plaintiff to provide Optimum Residential Wi-Fi for his residence. As part of that agreement, Cablevision provided the Plaintiff with a Netgear 3400 wireless router. The Plaintiff had the option to purchase his own wireless router, but chose instead to lease Cablevision's device. During the installation, Jensen received a work order with the General Terms on the back, and his brother signed it. Compl. Ex. A. He did not receive any additional materials at the time of the installation. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 12 at 194:8-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   After a few days, Jensen noticed that there were two Wi-Fi networks broadcasting from his Cablevision-provided router. That day he contacted Cablevision to ask if the Optimum Public Wi-Fi feature could be disconnected. The Plaintiff was told that the service could not be turned off, and that he was free to purchase and use his own wireless router if he continued to harbor such concerns. During his conversation with customer service, Jensen demanded that Optimum Public Wi-Fi be disabled and when they refused to do so, ordered Cablevision to compensate him for what he viewed as an invasion of privacy and potential increased electricity costs. He also threatened Cablevision with a class action lawsuit to obtain compensation for his perceived damages. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 13 (\"[I] will contact the attorneys that have sued comcast for this practice.\"). Soon after, the Plaintiff sent an email to Cablevision opting out of the purported arbitration provision. Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 14 (\"I Paul Jensen ... therefore choose to opt out of the arbitration clause, and I choose to pursue this matter and any other disputes in court, not through arbitration, I do not waive any of my legal rights, and I am opting out of the arbitration clause.\"). Following the installation, numerous unidentified parties connected to Optimum Public Wi-Fi using the Cablevision router provided to the Plaintiff. According to Jensen, he did not authorize Cablevision to use the wireless router to broadcast Optimum Public Wi-Fi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Jensen claims that he has been forced to incur a higher electricity bill as a result of the Defendants' wireless router. He further alleges that his Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network has experienced decreased speeds and that the wireless router leased from the Defendants have been exposed to \"possible, additional use by unknown third parties\" without his knowledge or authorization. Compl. \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Dr. Mitchell Smooke\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dr. Mitchell Smooke is currently the Strathcona Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Yale University. He teaches classes in fluid mechanics, computational methods, applied mathematics and chemically reacting flows. He holds a joint appointment in the Department of Applied Physics. Previously, he was the Dean of\n   Engineering, the Chairman and Director of Undergraduate Studies of Mechanical Engineering, and the Director of Graduate Studies for Engineering. Dr. Smooke also held a research position in the Department of Computer Science. Prior to joining the Yale faculty in 1984, he was a Staff Scientist at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California. He is an active member of the Combustion Institute, the Institute of Physics, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Since 1996, he has also been the Editor-In-Chief of\n   <em>\n    Combustion Theory and Modelling.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Smooke has authored more than 200 academic publications and given lectures at more than 50 conferences and symposiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Dr. Smooke was retained by the Plaintiff to run tests on a series of Optimum routers to measure their electricity consumption. To accomplish this, he used two versions of four different model routers. For each model router, one version was only configured for a home network and another version was configured for both Optimum Residential Wi-Fi and Optimum Public Wi-Fi. For those routers only configured for a home network, Dr. Smooke connected the router to a SONY laptop and streamed a 50-minute episode of Star Trek. Power usage was monitored for 60 seconds every 10 minutes over a 50-minute period and the highest value during each 60-second period was recorded. The measurements were taken using a Kill A Watt EZ power monitor. Dr. Smooke then averaged the six measurements and a yearly kilowatt hour energy cost was computed using a cost of $ 0.25 per kilowatt hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For those routers that were Optimum Public Wi-Fi enabled, Dr. Smooke obtained power usage measurements under four separate conditions: (1) without any device connected to the router; (2) with a SONY laptop connected to Optimum Residential Wi-Fi and a 50 minute episode of Star Trek streaming; (3) with an ASUS laptop connected to the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network and a 50 minute episode of Star Trek streaming onto the laptop; and (4) with a SONY laptop connected to Optimum Residential Wi-Fi and the ASUS laptop connected to the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network and a 50 minute episode of Star Trek streaming onto both laptops. Power usage was monitored for 60 seconds every 10 minutes over a 50-minute period and the highest value during each 60-second period was recorded. The measurements were also taken using a Kill A Watt EZ power monitor. Dr. Smooke then averaged the six measurements and a yearly kilowatt hour energy cost was computed using a cost of $ 0.25 per kilowatt hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Based on this experiment, Dr. Smooke concluded that (1) there is an increase in yearly electrical costs when any of the routers stream data over Optimum Residential Wi-Fi compared to being idle; (2) there is an increase in yearly electrical costs of between 14.9% to 43.4% when data is streaming over the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network compared to being idle; (3) the electrical costs are 9.6% to 25.4% higher when data is streaming on the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network compared to the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network; and (4) the additional electrical costs when running data on both the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network and Optimum Residential Wi-Fi is 10.4% to 27.1% high compared to when data is streaming on the residential network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Dr. Jennifer Golbeck\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Dr. Jennifer Golbeck is an associate professor in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland. She was an assistant professor from 2007 until\n   2013, when she received tenure. While at the University of Maryland, Dr. Golbeck focuses her research and teaching on the internet as well as various aspects of social media. At her deposition, she testified that she also focuses her research on issues of trust, privacy, and network analysis. Dr. Golbeck recently authored two books on social media, entitled \"Social Media Investigation\" and \"Analyzing the Social Web.\" She has taught the following classes at Maryland: \"Analyzing Social Networks and Social Media,\" \"Social Networks: Technology and Society,\" \"Development of Internet Applications,\" \"Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction,\" \"Information Users in Social Context,\" and \"Small Worlds, Social Networks, and Algorithms.\" Over 100 of her published papers or conference presentations relate to social media and the internet. Prior to joining the faculty of the University of Maryland, Dr. Golbeck taught at the University of Chicago, George Mason University, Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, George Washington University, and American University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Dr. Golbeck was retained by the Plaintiff to provide an expert opinion on the following issues: (1) consumer expectations of privacy and autonomy, generally; (2) consumer expectations of privacy and autonomy, as they pertain to Internet Service Providers; and (3) the extent to which Cablevision's broadcasting of Optimum Public Wi-Fi from its subscribers' routers may or may not undermine consumers' expectations of privacy and autonomy. Based on her analysis, she concluded: (1) consumers have expectations of privacy and autonomy regarding their home routers; and (2) Cablevision's practices with regard to broadcasting Optimum Public Wi-Fi from routers undermine consumers' expectations of privacy and autonomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To reach these conclusions, Dr. Golbeck reviewed a selection of case-related documents as well as recent studies on the subject. She also designed a methodology for determining whether an Internet Service Provider's use of routers for a public Wi-Fi hotspot intrude on customer's expectations of privacy and autonomy. She first identified four factors of privacy: trust, compensation, awareness and control and then explained that within the context of ISPs, consumers are concerned about access to their information, and access to or control over devices. \"Concern over device control is slightly different [from other contexts], since it focuses on access to a service or device the user pays for, rather than information about the user.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, Dr. Golbeck compiled data and articles specifically pertaining to Internet Service Providers broadcasting public Wi-Fi hotspots using customer routers and examined relevant user comments. She then coded relevant comments regarding the practice using a series of labels. For example, she used \"D\" for \"deceptiveness,\" \"S\" for \"security issues,\" and \"P\" for \"power usage.\" Approximately 81% of comments expressed a concern about the practice. The most common concerns were violations of consumer autonomy, quality of service, and trust in the cable company to fairly administer the program. This work was partially funded through a National Security Agency grant.

Dr. Terrence McGarty\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Defendants retained Dr. Terrence McGarty to review and evaluate the expert reports of Dr. Smooke and Dr. Golbeck. Dr. McGarty is currently Managing Partner and Founder of the Telmarc Group, a technology management and investment company. Prior to that, he was a Research Affiliate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his 30 years of teaching, Dr. McGarty held faculty positions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, George Washington University, Polytechnic University, and Columbia University. Throughout his career, Dr. McGarty has had roles in operations and management for numerous telecommunications companies. According to his expert report, he has \"considerable experience with the design and implementation of telecommunications networks, including IP data networks. [He] also has considerable experience with network management and operations. [He] is familiar with practices and procedures used to manage telecommunications network based on [his] experience at Warner Communications, where [he] served as Group President of Warner's Electronic Media Company; and NYNEX Mobile Communications Company ... where [he] served as Chief Operating Officer; and at Telmarc, among others.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In his report, Dr. McGarity is highly critical of the opinions contained in the expert reports of Dr. Golbeck and Dr. Smooke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On July 16, 2015 Jensen filed a putative nationwide class action lawsuit against Cablevision in this District. Although Cablevision filed a motion to dismiss, Jensen stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of every claim but his GBL \u00a7 349 claim. Judge Wexler subsequently dismissed the case\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On January 6, 2017, the Plaintiff commenced this action by filing a class action complaint in this Court. The complaint set forth two causes of action: violations of the CFAA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and GBL \u00a7 349. For the first time, the Plaintiff included Altice in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   On January 12, 2017, the Plaintiff filed the Amended Class Action Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On March 27, 2017, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss all of the Plaintiff's claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Rule 12(b)(2) and Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   On July 6, 2017, the Defendants submitted a Notice of Supplemental Authority regarding the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

Specifically, Jensen seeks to represent a class of \"[a]ll natural persons who have subscribed to Cablevision's Optimum Online Service in the State of New York and who, as a result, have leased wireless routers that broadcast an Optimum Wi-Fi Hotspot.\" In this motion, he relies on Dr. Smooke and Dr. Golbeck for his argument regarding class-wide injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   On April 30, the Defendants filed motions seeking to exclude the report and testimony of Drs.

THE MOTIONS TO EXCLUDE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Defendants seek to exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Mitchell Smooke on the basis that he is not qualified to render expert opinions in this case and that the opinions expressed in the expert report do not meet the standards for admissibility outlined in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. The Defendants also argue that this Court should exclude the expert report and testimony of Dr. Jennifer Golbeck because she lacks the qualifications to render expert opinions on this case and the opinions contained in her expert report do not meet the standards for admissibility outlined in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   and its progeny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

While Dr. Smooke is admittedly not an electrical engineer and cannot be considered an expert in electrical engineering matters, the scope of his testimony is limited to his analysis of the electrical consumption test he used. Dr. Smooke has extensive and notable training and experience in various fields of engineering. Given his engineering education, training and experience, he is certainly qualified to testify regarding an electrical consumption test. As a highly educated and experienced engineer, he is qualified to render an opinion on the electrical consumption of routers. Any issue raised by the Defendants \"goes to the weight of his testimony,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063091\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/54/223/#p235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , rather than the admissibility of that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCullock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11321030\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/61/1038/\">\n    61 F.3d at 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ruling that the movant's argument regarding the purported expert witness' \"academic training ... and his other alleged shortcomings (lack of knowledge regarding the chemical constituents of the fumes or the glue vapor's concentration level), were properly explored on cross-examination and went to his testimony's weight and credibility-not its admissibility\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Court rules that Dr. Smooke is qualified to offer his expert report at the class certification stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Reliability &amp; Helpfulness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Defendants further argue that Dr. Smooke's expert report should be excluded because the methodology used in his electrical consumption test is unreliable. Cablevision makes five criticisms of Dr. Smooke's methodology: (1) the power meter used in the experiment is unreliable; (2) the study is not reflective of real-world customers; (3) the experiment was conducted in Dr. Smooke's residence rather than a controlled laboratory environment; (4) the readings were manually recorded by Dr. Smooke; and (5) Dr. Smooke used the highest energy usage for each 60-second period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   \"In deciding whether a step in an expert's analysis is unreliable, the district court should undertake a rigorous examination of the facts on which the expert relies, the method by which the expert draws an opinion from those facts, and how the expert applies the facts and methods to the case at hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The judge should only exclude the evidence if the flaw is large enough that the expert lacks 'good grounds' for his or her conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Paoli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528111\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/717/#p746\">\n    35 F.3d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Defendants' second critique of the experiment is that the test is not reflective of the actual experience of any of Calbevision's customers because he assumed that users would be streaming data at all times. This argument, that the testing was not conducted under normal operating conditions goes to the weight of Dr. Smooke's opinion rather than its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amorgianos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11432561\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/256/#p267\">\n    303 F.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court agrees that these test results do not account for realistic electricity consumption by Cablevision customers throughout the course of the year. There are a series of variables that impact a customer's energy usage including the number of people using it, the strength of signal, building type, and location of the router. Yet, the limits in the potential applications of Dr. Smooke's data do not render the entire report inadmissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   However, the Defendants' first, third, fourth and fifth reasons all counsel against the reliability of the study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   First, the power meter used in the study, the Kill A Watt device, does not have the accuracy required to calculate incremental energy consumption. The Defendants' expert, Dr. McGarty conducted a laboratory test to measure the accuracy of the device and found that it failed to meet the manufacturer's stated 2% maximum error rate in 17 out of 18 testing scenarios. The Plaintiff fails to rebut this contention. While Dr. Smooke did test the accuracy of the Kill A Watt, he merely measured the voltage of a power outlet at home with both the Kill A Watt and another voltage meter. Further, the Plaintiff argues that a deviation from the stated accuracy specifications is irrelevant when comparing the electrical consumption of routers. Yet, unreliable measurements can have a significant impact on a comparative study where the difference between measurements of a given router may be less than 5%. Dr. McGarty's study revealed an average error rate of between 2.47% and 4.29%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   This issue is potentially compounded by the Defendants' fourth argument, that Dr. Smooke manually observed and recorded the power readings. Throughout the entire study, Dr. Smooke recorded approximately 8,000 numbers. With the introduction of the volume of manual data entries, which were recorded on a second-by-second basis, this strongly suggests that Dr. Smooke's experiment potentially suffers from a significant rate of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Defendants' third challenge to Dr. Smooke's test is that he conducted it in his own home rather than a controlled laboratory environment. As explained above, in a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   analysis, courts frequently consider whether an expert has accounted adequately for potential alternative explanations. By failing to conduct this study in a controlled environment, the Court is unable to evaluate whether alternative explanations are plausible. One obvious explanation for the higher electricity consumption is that other users may have been connected to the routers, increasing the meter readings. Without conducting the test in a controlled environment, it is impossible to rule out obvious alternative explanations for the study's results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the Defendants challenge Dr. Smooke's use of the highest value of energy usage recorded in each 60-second period. Using only the highest value gives a distorted picture of the power consumed during the entire 60-second period. It is entirely possible that the average electricity was not higher when using the average rather than the highest value. The Defendants contend that it is entirely possible that this practice does not just overestimate energy usage but yields different outcomes. The Plaintiff does not address this possibility in their briefing and the Court recognizes the potential for such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   After evaluating Dr. Smooke's expert report, the Court finds that he fails to employ \"the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\"\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    526 U.S. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p152\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Dr. Smooke's expert report does not assist the trier of fact in determining whether a class-wide injury existed in the class certification context. As such, the Court excludes Dr. Smooke's expert report from consideration during its evaluation of the Plaintiff's motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    C. DR.

Apr. 1, 1997) (ruling that portions of an expert report were inadmissible because the testimony consisted of \"a narrative of the case which a lay juror is equally capable of constructing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Dr. Golbeck's expert report includes an improper rehashing of otherwise admissible evidence. Interpreting admissible evidence without having personal knowledge or experience is improper. Beginning in Section IV.b, she goes into painstaking detail surrounding the results of Cablevision's market research and what internal company presentations revealed on the company's knowledge of privacy concerns. She continues to testify as to her interpretation of internal documents that show, in her opinion, that \"the company worked to\n   prevent customers from even knowing that their routers were being used to provide public internet access.\"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   Wade Decl., Ex. 2 \u00b6 36. She opines that \"Cablevision makes it extremely difficult for customers to find its lone reference to the residential hotspots, which is found in an ancillary page on its website,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37, and that this reference is the only mention of it \"in any of Cablevision's disclosures, webpage documents or marketing materials,\n   <em>\n    per the company's express intent.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38 (emphasis added). Section IV.b also contains deposition testimony from Timothy Farrell, which Dr. Golbeck concludes \"demonstrates a dissonance between the representation made by Cablevision as to a particular benefit of its Smart Router ... and the intentional\n   <em>\n    omission\n   </em>\n   of information that Cablevision has incorporated into its router's functionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41 (emphasis in original). After reviewing company documents, Dr. Golbeck hypothesizes that \"[t]he decision to hide the existence of residential hotspot[s] was a decision passed down from the highest levels of the company.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Section IV.c gave readers a \"view into Cablevision's strategy\" to determine that \"the company\n   <em>\n    consciously chose\n   </em>\n   to eliminate consumer choice from the process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53 (emphasis added). Dr. Golbeck analyzes a collection of company emails to explain that the process by which a customer can turn off the Optimum Public Wi-Fi hotspot \"involved Cablevision making\n   <em>\n    intentionally inaccurate representations\n   </em>\n   to [customers].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   These sections of the report include speculation regarding the meaning of certain internal documents as well as conjecture as to the company's intentions. Dr. Golbeck is simply repeating otherwise admissible evidence. She has no personal knowledge regarding any of this information and it is only presented to the fact-finder for the purpose of repeating the Plaintiff's factual narrative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Accordingly, the Court excludes paragraphs 30 to 57 in Dr. Golbeck's expert report from consideration during its evaluation of the Plaintiff's motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Defendants further contend that the methodology Dr. Golbeck used in reaching her opinions in this case was unsound. Specifically, they take issue with (1) her use of \"anecdotal Internet article and the comments posted on those articles[;]\" and (2) the sources used are not specific to Cablevision customers. Yet, these challenges have not demonstrated that Dr. Golbeck's methodology was so flawed so as to make her analysis fundamentally unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clarke v.

As Dr. Golbeck testified during her deposition, there is no evidence of any instance in which a subscriber's personal data was accessed using the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ingber Decl., Ex. 14 at 70:4-71:22. In today's modern technological landscape, privacy protection is at the forefront of the consumer consciousness. Navigating the plethora of new technologies that collect a myriad of private data can seem like a potential minefield to consumers and induce a fair amount of anxiety. Yet, the subjective privacy expectations of consumers, while important data points for companies like Cablevision, are not actual injuries under \u00a7 349. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with state and federal jurisprudence and vastly expand the scope of the statute. The\n   <em>\n    poten\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tial\n   </em>\n   for the release of private information, without any evidence of the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   release of private information, by itself, does not constitute an injury sufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 349.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Accordingly, the Plaintiff's privacy theory is insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate class-wide injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The Plaintiff's second damages theory, that the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network causes increased electricity costs, relies primarily on the expert testimony of Dr. Mitchell Smooke, the Strathcona Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Yale University. For the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in Section II.B.2, Dr. Smooke's expert report will not be used in the disposition of the instant motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Without the expert report of Dr. Smooke, the Plaintiff relies exclusively on Cablevision's internal study on the power consumption of three wireless routers to prove that damages can be proved on a class-wide basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Cert. Wade Decl., Ex. 8. This study was conducted on three wirless routers-D-Link 868L, Netgear 3400 and Sagemcom 3965. For each router, Cablevision employees tested the power consumption when (1) idle; (2) connected to the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network only; (3) connected to the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network only; and (4) connected to both the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network and the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network. This consisted of one-hour continuous file transfers, for a total of 25 tests, with half performed on the 2.4 Ghz band and the other on 5 Ghz band. For the Sagemcom 3965, the monthly electricity cost of actively using both networks was 10 cents higher than the cost of only using the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network on the 2.4 Ghz band and 15 cents higher on the 5 Ghz band. When testing the Netgear 3400, the monthly electricity cost of actively using both networks was seven cents higher than the cost of only using the Optimum Residential Wi-Fi network on the 2.4 Ghz band and one cent higher on the 5 Ghz band. The tests that involved the D-Link 868L resulted in an increased average monthly cost of 29 and 31 cents when using the 2.4Ghz and decreased by one cent when using the 5 Ghz band.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   This study does not provide reliable evidence that the proposed class suffered damages that can be proven on a class-wide basis. Only two of the three routers showed any increase in electrical consumption on both the 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands. For the D-Link 868L, the test actually revealed a\n   <em>\n    decrease\n   </em>\n   in electrical consumption. In the remaining two wireless routers, the increase in cost was diminimis. Without nearly enough data to report averages, standard errors, or margins of errors, the Court is unable to draw any conclusions from these results. These tests were not repeated and only intended to provide a range of monthly power consumption. In the outcome section, the study notes that, \"[d]ue to dynamics of environment, [and] location results can vary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For those tests that did show an increase in power consumption, this increase very well may have been within a proper study's margin of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Even if the Court assumes that data can conclusively be derived from this study, it only confirms that increased electrical costs cannot be demonstrated on a class-wide basis. Cablevision provides one of four models of wireless routers: Sagemcom 5260, Sagemcom 3965, D-Link DIR-868L and Netgear 3400. The Sagemcom 5260 is not represented in this study\n   <em>\n    at all.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the Court cannot draw any conclusions regarding purported class members that were provided with a Sagemcom 5260. Without any information in the record regarding the number of absent class members\n   that used this router during the class period, no information is available for at least a plurality of the proposed class. Further, the D-Link 868L showed a decrease in monthly costs using the 5 Ghz band and an increase using the 2.4 Ghz band. This does not demonstrate that customers using this router experienced an increase in costs over the class period. And once again, without information on the frequency of this router among the proposed class, the Court is unable to determine how many individuals are impacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Finally, the Defendants' expert, Dr. Terrence McGarty conducted his own laboratory test of power consumption and confirmed that both the Sagemcom 5260 and the D-Link 868L experience a decrease in incremental average power usage when streaming video data. These results only muddle the waters. Without additional data regarding the proportions of the class that used each of the four wireless routers and a scientifically acceptable study that shows an increase in electricity consumption, this Court cannot conclude that either Jensen or members of the purported class were injured in this manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Accordingly, the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that increased electrical consumption can be demonstrated on a class-wide basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Finally, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Plaintiff was able to demonstrate that either increased electrical consumption or intrusion into privacy or autonomy could be demonstrated on a class-wide basis, individual issues predominate this action because a share of Cablevision's New York Wi-Fi subscribers may have wanted the free wireless router that was Optimum Public Wi-Fi enabled. In\n   <em>\n    Vaccariello v. XM Satellite Radio, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260935\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/295/62/#p74\">\n    295 F.R.D. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), the court denied certification of a proposed New York class of consumers alleging violations of \u00a7 349. There, the plaintiffs claimed that XM's automatic renewal policy constituted a deceptive trade practice. Judge Owen held that the proposed New York class lacked predominance because those customers that wanted to have the service automatically renewed did not suffer a cognizable \u00a7 349 injury, regardless of the sufficiency of the disclosures. \"Ascertaining which customers actually wanted renewal requires a myriad of individual inquiries that would predominate over any common questions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260935\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/295/62/#p74\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <em>\n    Brissenden v.

Ct. 2009) is also illustrative. There, the plaintiff filed a putative class action lawsuit alleging that Time Warner inadequately disclosed that customers were not required to rent cable boxes or remote controllers, in violation of \u00a7 349.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 882-83. The court denied the Plaintiff's motion for class certification motion, noting that there was no injury to customers who wanted the equipment and that an individual inquiry was required to determine which customers were injured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 884-85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In the instant case, there is undoubtedly an economic benefit that customers receive by being provided with a free wireless router. Further, the installation of a Wi-Fi network that is accessible to customers outside of their home provides a significant benefit to Cablevision customers. For customers who wanted the router either regardless of or because of the Optimum Public Wi-Fi network, there was no cognizable \u00a7 349 injury. To ascertain which New York customers' individual preferences requires individual inquiries would predominate over common questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the Plaintiff has not satisfied Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
