Plaintiffs TDY Holdings LLC, TDY Industries, LLC and their predecessor, the Ryan Aeronautical Company (collectively, \"TDY\") seek to recover from Defendant the United States of America (the \"government\") an equitable allocation of the costs TDY incurred cleaning up hazardous wastes at an aeronautical manufacturing plant TDY operated in San Diego, California from 1939 to 1999 (the \"Site\"), pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a bench trial, the Court determined that TDY, as an owner of facilities and the sole operator of the Site, was the responsible party for the contamination at issue in the litigation and the associated response costs. The Court further concluded that the government, although a past owner of facilities at the Site, was not the responsible party for the introduction of the contaminants of concern into the Site's soil, sediment and water that necessitated the remediation efforts.\n   <em>\n    TDY Holdings, LLC v.

In\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cadillac Fairview\n   </em>\n   , the government was the admitted arranger of the disposal plan and made conscious decisions to dispose of the wastes in landfills due to the immediate need to get rid of the excess wastes created by the urgent war requirements and the lack of time and resources to employ alternative solutions to the waste dumping.

The government never agreed to \"hold harmless\" TDY for its actions at the Site. Nor did the government otherwise waive sovereign immunity (explicitly or implicitly) to accept CERCLA responsibility for the polluting acts controlled by TDY.

These allocations, however, were not premised, as TDY advocates, on a principle that such an outcome is the default in cases involving fulfillment of a government military contract. Rather, these allocations were based on facts specific to the wastes involved, the circumstances in which the wastes were generated, and the roles and responsibilities of the PRPs for the generation and disposal of the wastes.

Consequently, the cost of the remediation of these contaminants was fixed or calculable at the time of trial. The allocation herein applies to the costs calculable at the time of trial and includes no additional remediation expenses incurred by TDY after 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In assessing an appropriate allocation of response costs, the district court, in its discretion, may properly consider such factors as: (1) each PRP's contribution to the discharge, release or disposal of the hazardous waste; (2) each PRP's degree of involvement in the generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of the hazardous waste; and (3) the care exercised by each PRP with respect to the hazardous waste concerned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Envtl.

Here, the government's specifications required or recommended the use of two of the contaminants in concern, chromium and chlorinated solvents, but TDY's management and handling of these contaminants resulted in their introduction to the environment. Based on the government's limited role in the introduction of the contaminants to the Site, the Court finds it equitable to allocate to the government five percent of the cleanup costs associated with the chromium remediation and ten percent of the chlorinated solvent remediation specific to the ground water plume associated with the sewer line failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Document numbers and page references are to those assigned by CM/ECF watermark at the top of the page for the docket entry.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    An arranger under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(3) is \"any person who by contract, agreement or otherwise arranged for disposal or treatment, or arranged with a transporter for transport for disposal or treatment, of hazardous substance owned or possessed by such person.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The benzol waste made up between five and six percent of the waste at the McColl Site.\n    <em>\n     Shell Oil\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11688765\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/13/1018/#p1023\">\n     13 F.Supp.2d at 1023\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The district court opinion provides no factual analysis with regard to the benzol waste and its relationship to the war effort.
