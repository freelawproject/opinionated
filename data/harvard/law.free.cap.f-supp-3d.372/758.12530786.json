No. 91) for summary judgment filed by defendant Forward Air, Inc. (Forward). Plaintiffs Gary, Nicholas and Ryan Rohlfs (the Rohlfs) have filed a resistance (Doc. No. 102) and Forward has filed a reply. Doc. No. 110. The Rohlfs' also filed a notice (Doc. No. 112) of supplemental authority. I find that oral argument is not necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case arises out of a fatal three-vehicle crash on Highway 175 west of Lake View, Iowa, on December 24, 2016. Ivan Milosevic was driving a semi-truck westbound when he crossed the center line into oncoming traffic, striking an eastbound vehicle occupied by Gary and Sharon Rohlf. This collision caused a second collision between the Rohlf vehicle and a vehicle occupied by Barbara Scott and Jeanette Fertig. Sharon Rohlf died as a result of the collision, while Gary Rohlf and Barbara Scott sustained injuries. On January 13, 2017, Barbara and Everett Scott (the Scotts) filed a complaint (Doc. No. 1) alleging negligence and vicarious liability against defendants Milosevic and U.S. Expediters, Inc. (Expediters).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 6, 2017, the Rohlfs filed a complaint alleging negligence, vicarious liability and negligent hiring, training and supervision against Milosevic and Expediters. Doc. No. 1 in C17-4022-LTS. The two cases were consolidated on June 8, 2017. Doc. No. 10. Subsequently, the Scotts and the Rohlfs amended their complaints to add defendants Sirius Air Logistics (Sirius) and Forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. Nos. 60, 61. In Division V of the Rohlfs' Second Amended\n   Complaint, they list various theories of alleged negligence on Forward's part. Doc. No. 61 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Milosevic and Expediters answered (Doc. Nos. 62, 63) the amended complaints while Sirius and Forward filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, which were denied. Doc. No. 78. Sirius and Forward answered on May 30, 2018. Doc. Nos. 81, 82. The present motion for summary judgment was filed November 23, 2018. This matter is scheduled for a jury trial beginning April 22, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

Expediters was a new carrier and its sole owner, president and full-time employee, Milutinovic, did not have prior experience operating motor carriers. Further, Expediters was a participant in the new entrant program and new entrants have a statistically higher rate of accidents coupled with a lack of data to prove that they can comply with the relevant safety regulations. At the time Expediters was hired, it had not yet finished its new entrant safety audit and had not yet been rated by the FMCSA. Finally, Expediters did not vet their drivers beyond certifying that they had a valid CDL and a clean criminal background check, and hired Milosevic, who had never had a job as a truck driver, had little training and lacked lawful status in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Comment\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 411 defines \"competent and careful contractor\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [A] contractor who possesses the knowledge, skill, experience, and available equipment which a reasonable man would realize that a contractor must have in order to do the work which he is employed to do without creating unreasonable risk of injury to others, and who also possesses the personal characteristics which are equally necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 411 cmt.\n   <em>\n    a.\n   </em>\n   Competency does not require perfection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7077506\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/797/611/#p614\">\n    797 N.W.2d at 616-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fact that driver was partially deaf, possibly diabetic and had a history of traffic violations did not compel conclusion that he was incompetent).

The Rohlfs' expert, Dr. Corsi, testified that new entrant motor carriers have a crash rate that is 50% higher than experienced motor carriers and that they are known to be less reliable, in part because of difficulty complying with the numerous regulations that affect interstate hauling. In this case, there is evidence that Expediters did not thoroughly vet the drivers or the trucks that it leased, which did not have their own FMCSA motor carrier certificates and operated under Expediters' certificate. Further, between October 1 and December 23, 2016, Expediters had seven DOT inspections, which resulted in four violations, including two out-of-service violations. Forward has not offered any evidence that Expediters was competent at the time of hiring other than its motor carrier certificate and its proof of insurance. A reasonable jury could infer from these facts that Expediters was not competent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Forward's Duty of Care\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Forward argues that regardless of whether Expediters was a competent independent contractor, it exercised reasonable care in hiring Expediters. Before entering into a BCA with Expediters, Forward took steps to make sure that Expediters was a \"legally qualified\" independent contractor. Forward confirmed that Expediters possessed a motor carrier certificate from the FMCSA and that it carried appropriate liability insurance. Forward also monitored the status of Expediters' certificate using Carrier411. Forward further required Carrier to warrant that it would hire only qualified drivers, comply with certain safety procedures and protocols, and use safe equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In response, the Rohlfs rely heavily on the fact that Expediters were a \"new entrant\" motor carrier with no record of safety and argue that this fact should have triggered a more extensive inquiry because new entrants have a statistically higher rate of motor vehicle collisions. Had Forward inquired further, the Rohlfs argue, it would have discovered that Expediters' president and sole full-time employee had no experience in hiring or managing truck drivers, that Expediters had misrepresented the number of trucks available to it, and that Expediters neither vetted nor trained its drivers. The Rohlfs also argue that Forward could have discovered that Milosevic was issued a CDL in error, had only completed 36 hours of training and had no previous experience as a truck driver. The Rohlfs' criticize Forward's decision to use only the Carrier411 website, which apparently did not contain sufficiently up-to-date information. Forward has not offered evidence to explain why it did not rely on FMCSA's websites, nor has it submitted expert opinions on the \"industry standard\" as it relates to hiring new entrant motor carriers or investigating motor carriers generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Rohlfs have submitted expert testimony as to the industry practice when dealing with new entrant motor carriers and unrated motor carriers like Expediters. Dr. Corsi testified that some brokers will not enter into BCAs with new entrants until they have been in the business for at least a year (or in extreme cases, five years). Doc. No. 95-5 at 10. Further, some brokers will not enter into BCAs with motor carriers who do not have a successful compliance review (\"unrated\") without further inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I find that the Rohlfs have submitted enough evidence to generate a jury issue as to whether Forward's investigation of Expediters was reasonable. Other courts have held that the red flags present in this case - the fact that Expediters was a \"new entrant\" motor carrier with no record of inspections and very little experience\n   - should have prompted further inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , 558 F.Supp.2d at 644-46 (motor carrier's low safety scores, history of regulatory violations and hiring of novice driver generated a fact issue on duty to investigate further);\n   <em>\n    Beavers\n   </em>\n   , 38 F.Supp.3d at 1272-73 (same). It does not automatically follow that it would have been negligent to hire Expediters if Forward had all the above information at the time of hiring, or that Forward's alleged negligence was a proximate cause of the collision.
