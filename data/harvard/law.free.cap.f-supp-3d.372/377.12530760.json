ECF Nos. 28 &amp; 34. The CAMO Defendants also have filed a Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Authority (ECF No. 51), and the United States has filed a Motion for Leave to File an Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory Relief. ECF No. 48. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motions to dismiss,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion to file supplemental authority, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States brought this action on September 11, 2018, seeking an Ex Parte Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Preliminary Injunction, with the ultimate goal of securing a Permanent Injunction and other relief. With respect to the TRO, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   the motion and scheduled a preliminary injunction hearing for September 17, 2018. In the meantime, the TRO prevented the CAMO Defendants and the Grassy Run Defendants from,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , harvesting and transporting certain cannabis plants across state lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The cannabis at issue in this case was grown under an \"industrial hemp\" pilot program in West Virginia. At the time, \"industrial hemp\" was defined as \"the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of such plant, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration [ (THC) ] of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205940\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 5940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Mallory, using the business name CAMO HEMP WV LLC, applied for and received a Research and Marketing Cultivation of Industrial Hemp License from the West Virginia Department of Agriculture (WVDA) to grow the plants. The seeds used by Defendants were purchased from a supplier in Kentucky\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and shipped directly to Grassy Run Farms in West Virginia. The seeds were then planted and grown on property located in Mason County, West Virginia. The United States claims the property is owned by Grassy Run Farms, LLC, and Gary Kale is an employee of that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In its Verified Complaint, the United States alleges Defendants conspired together to violate the law with respect to the project, and they failed to follow the project description submitted by the CAMO Defendants to the WVDA. Specifically, the United States argues that Defendants violated the Controlled Substances Act (CSA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , when they obtained the cannabis seeds from Kentucky. Additionally, the United States asserts Defendants will continue to violate the CSA if, as intended, they transport harvested portions of those plants to Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Upon hearing the parties' arguments, the Court converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction. The Court allowed Defendants\n   to harvest, dry, and process the cannabis, but the Court prohibited Defendants from transporting or selling it after it was processed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The harvesting, drying, and milling process took several weeks to complete. In the interim period, the parties filed and briefed the current motions. However, as a result of a lack of congressional appropriations, civil cases in this District with the United States as a party were stayed on December 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Gen. Order Holding Civ. Matters in Abeyance\n   </em>\n   , Misc. No. 2:18-mc-00196 (Dec. 26, 2018) (Berger, J.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The CAMO Defendants then moved to lift the stay because they had a time-sensitive contractual obligation to deliver cannabidiol (CBD) isolate, a hemp extract, by the end of January 2019. The CAMO Defendants represented to the Court that they had to take the plant material to a facility in Pennsylvania to be processed in order to fulfill the contract. Given that the passage of time had changed the circumstances of the CAMO Defendants because of the looming contractual deadlines, and the fact the Court had become increasingly doubtful as to the merits of the United States' case, the Court lifted the stay and exercised its inherent authority to dissolve the preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court permitted Defendants to immediately transport the product to Pennsylvania to be processed into CBD isolate. Now, upon consideration of the merits of Defendants' motions to dismiss, the Court rules in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The facts essential to resolving the current motions are not in dispute. Although the Court herein considers several documents submitted by the parties, no party has challenged the authenticity of these documents and many of them are attached and integral to the Verified Complaint. Of those the Court references that are not attached to the Verified Complaint, almost all are public records. The only documents the Court mentions that do not fit into one of these categories is a handout by CAMO and three letters. The handout by CAMO was submitted by the United States to support its argument. However, the Court finds that this handout does nothing to change this Court's legal analysis, and the Court does not rely upon it. With regard to the letters, two are from Jennifer S. Greenlief dated September 11 and 14, 2018, and the other is from Mr. Mallory dated September 21, 2019. As is explained below, the letters also do not change this Court's legal conclusions. They are merely cited to provide background information. Therefore, as the Court finds that all the documents it does rely upon are either integral to the Verified Complaint or a public record, the Court will not convert Defendants' motions into ones for summary\n   judgment and will consider them under the motion to dismiss standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to the dismissal standard, courts must look for \"plausibility\" in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

CBD is a derivative product of the Cannabis sativa L. plant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2014, Congress passed the Agriculture Act of 2014, Pub.

As part of the Act, Congress carved out a special exception to the CSA under certain circumstances, for the domestic growth, cultivating, and marketing of industrial hemp.

Thus, rather than defining industrial hemp on the part of the plant used, the 2014 Farm Bill defined industrial hemp on the level of THC it contains. However, as the CSA continued to define marijuana broadly as the entire Cannabis sativa L. plant, including its seeds and extracts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   conflicts arose between agencies charged with enforcing the CSA and those who sought to promote and explore the hemp industry under the 2014 Farm Bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In reaction to this tension, in December 2015, Congress adopted language in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (the \"2016 Spending Bill\") to address the issue.

In the 2018 Spending Bill, which was passed on March 23, 2018 and was effective through the 2018 fiscal year, the phrase \"or seeds of such plant\" was added to subsection (2) to provide: \"None of the funds ... may be used ... to prohibit the transportation, processing, sale, or use of industrial hemp, or seeds of such plant....\" Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, Pub.

Thus, by the time the seeds were purchased in this case, these Spending Bills made it clear that agencies, such as the United States Attorney's Office and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), cannot use federal funds to prohibit the interstate or intrastate \"transportation, processing, sale, or use of industrial hemp, or seeds of such\n   plant, that is grown or cultivated in accordance\" with the 2014 Farm Bill.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20Stat.%20348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After the passage of the 2016 Spending Bill, however, the United States Department of Agriculture, the DEA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp (SOP) on August 12, 2016.

When tensions arose between enforcement of the broad language in the CSA and the narrow exception for industrial hemp carved out from the 2014 Farm Bill, Congress reacted by inserting language in the 2016 Spending Bill to bar enforcement agencies from using appropriations \"to prohibit the transportation, processing, sale, or use of industrial hemp that is grown or cultivated in accordance with [the 2014 Farm Bill], within or outside the State in which the industrial hemp is grown or cultivated.\" Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, Pub.

Notably, the Spending Bills provided that such agencies were not to prevent the transportation or sale of industrial hemp within or outside a State. This language certainly suggests that Congress contemplated there would be both intrastate and interstate transportation and sale of industrial hemp and its seeds, and it undermines the United States' argument the seeds only could be purchased from international sources. Furthermore, this conclusion drawn from the pronouncements in the Spending Bills is consistent with the legislative history and the recently passed 2018 Farm Bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Prior to the 2014 Farm Bill, industrial hemp could not be grown in the United States.

Despite being enacted after the issues in this case arose, the 2018 Farm Bill provides further evidence that Congress did not intend for industrial hemp to be classified as a Schedule I drug.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In light of the language of the 2014 Farm Bill, the Spending Bills, and the legislative history, the Court finds that Congress intended to carve out an exception to the CSA for industrial hemp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KAB, LLC v. USPS\n   </em>\n   , No. MLB 18-39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204913891\">\n    2018 WL 4913891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (US Postal Serv.

[and] Congress clearly 'swept away' the provision of the CSA, at least in so much as it otherwise restricts the growth, cultivation, and marketing of industrial hemp.\"). Under the 2014 Farm Bill, there is no requirement that hemp seeds be imported from international sources, and it was contemplated that, if in compliance, industrial hemp and industrial hemp seeds could be shipped domestically. As an exception to the CSA, it also was not necessary for qualifying individuals operating under a State's pilot program to be registered with the DEA. Indeed, the 2018 Spending Bill, which was passed before the seeds were shipped in this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   made it clear that Congress did not want enforcement agencies interfering with the growth, cultivating, and marketing of industrial hemp and industrial hemp seeds. Quite simply, industrial hemp is not a controlled substance under the CSA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nevertheless, the United States argues that Defendants are not shielded from federal\n   enforcement because West Virginia's pilot program required Defendants to buy their seeds from an international source through the WVDA's DEA registration number. In support, the United States attached to the Verified Complaint an undated letter from the Plant Regulatory Programs Coordinator of the WVDA.\n   <em>\n    Letter from Michael C. Arnold, Plant Reg. Pros. Coord. for the WVDA\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 3-6. The two-page letter, which provides guidance on licensing, background checks, and harvesting, also contains a paragraph entitled \"Obtaining Seed and Import Permits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, ECF No. 3-6, at 3. This paragraph provides the WVDA is registered with the DEA to import hemp seeds internationally. When an international source for seeds is located by an applicant, the applicant must work through Mr. Arnold to get an Import Permit from the DEA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, all international orders must be shipped to the WVDA for distribution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Upon review, however, the Court finds this paragraph merely explains the process\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   an applicant elects to buy seeds from an international source. There is nothing in this letter that requires an applicant to buy seeds internationally. Likewise, there is nothing in West Virginia's Industrial Hemp Development Act or West Virginia's regulations that requires seeds to be purchased internationally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=W.%20Va.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019\">\n    W.

Therefore, the Court rejects the United States' argument Defendants were constrained under West Virginia law to buy internationally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The United States further argues, however, that Mr. Mallory stated in the Hemp Research Project Description submitted to the WVDA that he would be ordering the seeds through the WVDA.\n   <em>\n    Hemp Research Project Description\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Application for Research and Marketing Cultivation of Indus.

Thus, the United States asserts it is undeniable that the CAMO Defendants understood the requirement and violated West Virginia's pilot program by not complying with this requirement and for not fulfilling their other obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, Congress vested authority over such pilot programs with the States and their respective departments of agriculture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205940\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 5940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(iii) (2014) (authorizing \"State departments of agriculture to promulgate regulations to carry out the pilot program\"). Although the United States believes Defendants did not adhere to West Virginia's requirements, it is the obligation of the WVDA, not the United States, to enforce those requirements. Therefore, the Court declines to accept the United States' argument that it should be able to bring an enforcement action against an applicant for what it believes are violations of the WVDA's pilot program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    KAB\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204913891\">\n    2018 WL 4913891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (citations omitted) (stating Congress gave the States authority over industrial hemp, and \"its growth and cultivation does not require DEA licensing for cultivation nor is it subject to DEA oversight\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In fact, as background and not as an underpinning of this Court's legal conclusion, the Court notes that the WVDA rejected the United States' position that the WVDA should take an action against the CAMO Defendants for their alleged violations of the pilot program. On the same day this action was filed, the WVDA sent a letter to the United States Attorney's Office responding to a letter sent by the United States Attorney's Office the previous week.\n   <em>\n    Letter from Jennifer S.
