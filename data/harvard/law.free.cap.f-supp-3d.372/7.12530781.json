He now claims that the Court should vacate his conviction because his plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The Court has determined that no hearing is necessary. The Court finds that Mr. Marandola's Motion to Vacate (ECF No. 172) is procedurally barred and thus DISMISSES his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island indicted Mr. Marandola on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, (Count 1), bank fraud (Counts 2-6), wire fraud (Counts 7-9), and aggravated identity theft (Counts 10, 12-13, 15-16, and 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Marandola pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 16, in exchange for the Government's agreement to dismiss the remaining counts.

First, he argues that the legal basis for his claim was not reasonably available to counsel at the time his plea was entered. This argument is without merit. While we have held that a claim that is so novel that its legal basis is not reasonably available to counsel may constitute cause for a procedural default, petitioner's claim does not qualify as such. The argument that it was error for the District Court to misinform petitioner as to the statutory elements of \u00a7 924(c)(1) was most surely not a novel one. Indeed, at the time of petitioner's plea, the Federal Reporters were replete with cases involving challenges to the notion that use is synonymous with mere possession. Petitioner also contends that his default should be excused because, before\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , any attempt to attack [his] guilty plea would have been futile. This argument, too, is unavailing. As we clearly stated in\n   <em>\n    Engle v. Isaac\n   </em>\n   , futility cannot constitute cause if it means simply that a claim was unacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.
