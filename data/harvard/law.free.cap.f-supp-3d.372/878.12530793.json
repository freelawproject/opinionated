(Doc. 1 at 12-21.) Plaintiffs alleged that Marc Czapla suffered numerous negative health effects as a long-term result of radiological waste kept at the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri, where Marc grew up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 5, 2018, only thirteen days after Plaintiffs filed suit and before they perfected service on any adverse party, Defendant Bridgeton Landfill removed the case to this Court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-10.) Defendants did not cite any other basis for removal. Plaintiffs now move to remand, arguing that the parties are not completely diverse and that Defendants' attempt to invoke federal-question jurisdiction is impermissible.

(Doc. 28 at 22.) In fact, Defendants argue, the Court has jurisdiction over any properly removed case so long as a federal question is apparent from the face of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pet Quarters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660232\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/772/#p778\">\n    559 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   779 ;\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

(Doc. 28 at 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that Defendants' cases all presuppose \"proper\" removal, which Plaintiffs argue did not occur in this case. (Doc. 31 at 8.) Likewise, they note that\n   <em>\n    Hart\n   </em>\n   referenced a federal Court's affirmative obligation to remand a case when it lacks jurisdiction rather than, as Defendants imply, an obligation to deny remand based on its sua sponte discovery of a jurisdictional basis not raised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They also add\n   <em>\n    City of St. Louis v.

Mo. 2013), in which this Court held that a \"notice can only be amended to add specific facts supporting the originally stated grounds for removal or to clarify the grounds for removal as stated in the original notice ... [Defendants] cannot add new grounds for removal once the 30 day period [for amendment] has expired.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Whitehead v.

First, the plain meaning of \u00a7 1446(a) supports Plaintiff's reading. Under the statute, the removing party is required to state \"the grounds for removal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Court sees no reason to interpret the requirement to mean \"at least one ground for removal,\" as Defendants apparently insist. Indeed, the Eighth Circuit holds that the removing party \"is required to cite the proper statutory basis for removal and to allege facts from which a district court may determine whether removal jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Pet Quarters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660232\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/772/#p778\">\n    559 F.3d at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
