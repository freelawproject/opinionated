Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs, the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP (\"the Alabama NAACP\"), Eric Calhoun, and Jennifer Ford, bring this action against Defendants, City of Pleasant Grove (\"Pleasant Grove\"), Jerry Brasseale in his official capacity as Mayor of Pleasant Grove, and William Bullion, James Crumpton, Kenneth Hatfield, Phillip Houston, and Paula Johnson in their official capacities as Pleasant Grove City Council members (collectively \"Defendants\"). In their Complaint, Plaintiffs challenge the at-large method of electing members to Pleasant Grove's City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (doc. 14), Motion to Stay (doc. 16), and Motion to Strike (doc. 27). For the reasons stated below, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (doc. 14) is due to be GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART. Defendants' Motion to Stay (doc. 16) and Motion to Strike (doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   27) are due to be TERMINATED as MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under Pleasant Grove's at-large election method, each of the five members of the Pleasant Grove City Council is elected from one of five numbered places. City Council members serve four-year, non-staggered terms, and candidates to the City Council must win by a majority vote. Although the 2010 Census indicates that 44.8% of Pleasant Grove's population is Black, no Black candidate has ever been elected to the Pleasant Grove City Council. In Pleasant Grove's most recent City Council elections, which took place in 2016, all four Black candidates for City Council lost to White candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs' Complaint has four causes of action for which Plaintiffs seek relief. Plaintiffs first allege that the at-large method of electing Pleasant Grove City Council members violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , under either a results-only or intentional vote dilution theory of liability. Plaintiffs also allege that Pleasant Grove's at-large election method violates the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const., amends. XIV &amp; XV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because it was purposefully adopted, or is being maintained, to dilute the strength of Black voters. Plaintiffs request a declaratory judgment and an injunction enjoining the Defendants from continuing to conduct elections using the current at-large method of electing City Council members. Additionally, Plaintiffs ask that this Court require Pleasant Grove to adopt single-member districts or another permissible method of electing City Council members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Court will address Defendants' argument that the Alabama NAACP does not having standing to bring this action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 at 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To establish standing under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff must allege (1) that it has suffered an actual or imminent \"injury in fact,\" (2) that there is a \"causal connection\" between that injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) that the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Alabama NAACP has pled injuries sufficient to confer standing. An organizational plaintiff may establish standing in one of two ways. First, an organization's \"diversion-of-resources\" injury is sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arcia v. Fla. Sec'y of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314214\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1335/#p1341\">\n    772 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1341 (11th Cir. 2014). Second, an organization may enjoy standing as the representative of its members \"when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314214\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1335/#p1341\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

According to the Complaint, the Alabama NAACP's membership includes Black residents of Pleasant Grove whose voting strength is currently diluted. (Doc. 1 \u00b6 8.) The Complaint further alleges that the Alabama NAACP's members include individuals who reside in areas of Pleasant Grove that could constitute a single-member district with a majority-Black voting-age population. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p181\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Complaint goes on to state that \"[t]he goals of the Alabama NAACP are to eliminate racial discrimination in the democratic process, and to enforce federal laws and constitutional provisions securing civil and voting rights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Thus, the Alabama NAACP has sufficiently alleged that: (1) its members would have standing to sue in their own right; and (2) that the interests at stake are germane to its organizational purpose. Because the Court finds that this case does not require participation by the Alabama NAACP's individual members, the Alabama NAACP may assert standing on behalf of its members. Accordingly, the Alabama NAACP need not also establish that it has standing in its own right under a \"diversion-of-resources\" theory of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

This action can be accomplished by allowing Plaintiffs' claims against Pleasant Grove to go forward.

Plaintiffs have attached three population summary reports and maps to their Complaint, which provide support for their contention that Pleasant Grove's Black voting-age population is in the minority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A, B, C.) These exhibits also suggest that Pleasant Grove could draw three geographically compact single-member districts where the majority of the voting-age population would be Black. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341228\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1336/#p1342\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Although Pleasant Grove urges the Court to take judicial notice of the fact that more recent U.S. Census surveys show that the majority of Pleasant Grove's population is now Black, the Court finds that whether Black voters actually constitute a majority of Pleasant Grove's voting-age population is a matter more appropriately assessed in a ruling on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs have also sufficiently alleged that Pleasant Grove's Black voters are \"politically cohesive\" and that Pleasant Grove's \"white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it ... to defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p50\">\n    478 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p50\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have alleged that elections in Pleasant Grove are \"racially polarized.\" (Doc. 1 \u00b6 28.) Plaintiffs point to the 2008 and 2016 City Council elections as providing factual support for their allegations of racial polarization. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he 2016 elections demonstrate how white bloc voting in [Pleasant Grove] has operated and still operates to defeat Black-preferred candidates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) According to Plaintiffs, in the racially polarized 2016 election, all four Black candidates for City Council lost to White candidates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 29-30.) Plaintiffs state that in 2008 the two Black candidates for City Council lost to White candidates in elections that were also racially polarized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 31.) Accepting these allegations as true, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that the\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court next turns to the totality of the circumstances analysis. After considering the totality of the circumstances alleged and the relevant Senate factors, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Pleasant Grove's Black voters \"have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010301\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Two of the most important Senate factors are \"the existence of racially polarized voting\" and \"the extent to which minorities are elected to public office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Calhoun Cty., Miss.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050812\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/1393/#p1397\">\n    88 F.3d 1393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1397 (5th Cir. 1996). Here, Plaintiffs have alleged: (1) that no Black candidate has ever been elected to the Pleasant Grove City Council (doc. 1 \u00b6 21); and (2) that the 2008 and 2016 City Council elections were voted on along racial lines (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-31). Accordingly, Pleasant Grove's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 2 results-only claim is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2. Fourteenth Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs also claim that Pleasant Grove's at-large election method violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \"[T]o establish a constitutional vote dilution claim, Plaintiffs must show that: (1) [Pleasant Grove's] black population lacks an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of its choice; (2) this inequality of opportunity results from [Pleasant Grove's] at-large voting scheme; and (3) a racially discriminatory purpose underlies [Pleasant Grove's] voting scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. DeSoto Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481099\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/1335/#p1345\">\n    204 F.3d 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1345 (11th Cir. 2000) (\"\n   <em>\n    Desoto II\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The allegations discussed in section IV. C. 1.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   provide sufficient factual support for the first two elements of Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment claim to survive 12(b)(6) scrutiny. These allegations essentially state that Pleasant Grove's Black population, which constitutes a minority of the voting-age population, cannot elect its preferred candidates to the City Council due to the at-large election method. Based on these allegations, it is plausible that the single-member districts proposed by Plaintiffs would provide Pleasant Grove's Black population with better access to the political process. As stated above, it would be inappropriate at the pleadings stage for the Court to consider contradictory evidence presented by Pleasant Grove. Additionally, after reviewing Plaintiffs' Complaint as well as the factors set forth by the Supreme Court for finding intent in\n   <em>\n    Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n    429 U.S. 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266-68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p266\">\n    50 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations of discriminatory intent are sufficient. Thus, Pleasant Grove's motion to dismiss the Fourteenth Amendment claims against it is due to be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   3. Fifteenth Amendment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In contrast to their Section 2 and Fourteenth Amendment claims against Pleasant Grove, Plaintiffs' Fifteenth Amendment claims are due to be dismissed. Vote dilution is not a cognizable claim under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osburn v.
