BREYER, United States District Judge\n   In 1994, Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to create a sentencing enhancement for any felony involving or intending to promote terrorism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 120004,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n    108 Stat. 1796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2022. The Sentencing Commission did so, and over time, that enhancement evolved into its current form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   James P. McLoughlin Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Deconstructing United States Sentencing Guidelines Section 3A1.4: Sentencing Failure in Cases of Financial Support for Foreign Terrorist Organizations\n   </em>\n   , 28 Law &amp; Inequality 51, 51-52 (2010) (explaining evolution of terrorism enhancement); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a) (2018). When it applies, the enhancement dramatically increases the sentences imposed on individuals convicted of federal crimes of terrorism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McLoughlin (describing enhancement as \"draconian\"). It does so in an unusual way-increasing not only the offense level, but also a defendant's criminal history category, automatically, to the highest possible number (VI).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The terrorism enhancement provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (a) If the offense is a felony that involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism, increase by 12 levels; but if the resulting offense level is less than level 32, increase to level 32.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) In each such case, the defendant's criminal history category from Chapter Four (Criminal History and Criminal Livelihood) shall be Category VI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.4(a). Application Note 1 to that Guideline explains that a \"federal crime of terrorism\" is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5), and that statute has a two-part definition. First, a federal crime of terrorism means an offense that \"is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A). Second, the offense must be a specific violation of a statute listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(B).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Amer Sinan Alhaggagi, a 23-year old Berkeley High School graduate with \"zero\" criminal history,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") (dkt. 84) at 3, 14, 99, pled guilty to all of the counts in the Indictment in this case, including Count 1, violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339B(a)(1), Attempting to Provide Material Support of Resources to Designated Foreign Terrorist Organization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment (dkt. 33)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Change of Plea Hearing (dkt. 76); Plea Application (dkt. 77).

Sentencing Memo. (dkt. 87) at 29; Gov. Sentencing Memo. (dkt. 90) at 61. Much of what drove the difference in the parties' proposed sentences was their views of the\n   Defendant-whether he was merely \"an immature prankster,\" D. Sentencing Memo. at 1, or \"a violent threat to the community, whose imagination and appetite for evil knows no bounds,\" Gov. Reply (dkt. 101) at 1. And much of what drove the parties' disparate sentencing recommendations was their views of the terrorism enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unsurprisingly, Defendant argued that the terrorism enhancement should not apply to his case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. Sentencing Memo. at 25; D. Reply (dkt. 100) at 13-21, while the government argued that it should,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov. Sentencing Memo. at 51-57; Gov.

Sentencing Memo. at 25; D. Reply at 13-21; Gov. Sentencing Memo. at 51-57; Gov. Reply at 7; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A). The parties focused more on the first, \"influence of affect,\" prong of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A), and so the Court requested and received additional briefing on, among other things, the second, \"retaliation,\" prong of that section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of 12/17/2018 (dkt. 116) at 4-5; Gov. Supp. Memo. (dkt. 123) at 2-7; D. Supp. Memo. (dkt. 124) at 5-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sentencing in this case took place on February 26, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minutes of 2/26/2019 (dkt. 133). In calculating the appropriate guidelines range, the Court held that the terrorism enhancement applied. That holding resulted in an offense level of 36 and a criminal history category of VI, making Defendant's guideline range 324 to 405 months. The Court then departed downward, concluding that Defendant's criminal history should be I, rather than VI, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1) (over-representation of the seriousness of Defendant's criminal history). That resulted in a sentencing guidelines range of 188 to 235 months. The Court sentenced Defendant to a total sentence of 188 months on Counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minutes of 2/26/2019. At the sentencing hearing, the Court provided its reasoning for the 188 month sentence, and the Court will not repeat those remarks here. The Court writes now, as it indicated that it would, to explain both its application of the terrorism enhancement, and its decision to depart from the enhancement's automatic criminal history category of VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Application of the Enhancement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the parties' arguments, the facts of this case, and the controlling law, the Court concludes (1) that Defendant's material support offense was \"calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,\" and, in the alternative, (2) that it was calculated \"to retaliate against government conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. \"Influence or Affect\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Indictment charged Defendant in Count 1 with \"opening social media accounts understanding and intending that such accounts were to be used by, and for the benefit and promotion of, ISIS, and\n   personnel, in the form of himself, to a foreign terrorist organization, namely, ISIS, knowing that ISIS was a designated foreign terrorist organization and that ISIS engages and has engaged in terrorist activity and terrorism....\" Indictment \u00b6 6. In pleading guilty to that Count, Defendant admitted that he participated in several Arabic and English language chat rooms on Telegram. Plea Application (Factual Basis) at 2. One of those chats \"was a pro-ISIS chat entitled (in Arabic) 'Allah is with those who endure.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant \"re-posted pro-ISIS messages that [he] had found on other Telegram chats to this chat.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He was then approached by two individuals, whom he believed were (and apparently actually were) supporters of ISIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They asked him to set up social media accounts for ISIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 31, 2016, Defendant had a one-on-one conversation with the first individual, and told that individual that he was \"ready to create accounts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The individual asked him to create and send two accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant sent the individual usernames and passwords for two Facebook accounts and two Gmail accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The individual asked Defendant if Defendant \"supported the Caliphate\" and Defendant admits, \"I told him that I did.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On November 14, 2016, a second individual approached Defendant with a private message on Telegram, telling Defendant that he had been referred by an individual with the username \"Supporter of the Caliphate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The second individual asked Defendant to open Twitter accounts, which Defendant understood \"might be used to disseminate statements sympathetic to ISIS using the Twitter app.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant sent him usernames and passwords for three Gmail accounts and usernames for three Twitter accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%201796\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant later sent the second individual usernames and passwords for two more Gmail accounts and two more Twitter accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. He agrees that opening those social media accounts for individuals whom he believed were ISIS sympathizers constituted the provision of a \"service\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2339A(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The government notes that the chatroom Defendant admitted to participating in, \"Allah is with those who endure,\" \"is replete with posts from other users declaring hatred and violence towards the United States, the Syrian government, the Iraqi government and a host of other enemies of the Islamic States, and seeking to affect [ ] the conduct of those governments.\" Gov. Sentencing Memo. at 54-55. It provides two examples of posts in the chatroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One is from an individual named Migration Commando, who posted on November 11, 2016: \"A letter to the brothers: To the owners of the invasion channels, we want Tweets in English on American hashtags that are against or pro-Trump.... Let us kindle strife and chaos in their country.... Let us turn the next week into hell on America.... You never know, o supporter, a Tweet from you could cause a divine conquest for your State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A second is from an individual named Publisher, who posted on November 13, 2016: \"Brothers ... Open accounts in Twitter ... And invade the American tags.... Spread disorder! And intensify the spark[.] Allah bless you!\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant responds that there is no evidence that he ever saw these particular posts, and that they could not have inspired him because he had already opened accounts for the first ISIS sympathizer on October 31, before these posts appeared on November 11 and 13. D. Reply at 16-17; D. Supp. Memo. at 6-7. But it is not particularly exculpatory that Defendant had already opened social media accounts for an ISIS sympathizer, and agreed that he supported the Caliphate, before these posts appeared in the chatroom.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea\n   Application (Factual Basis) at 2. These posts reinforce the government's argument that the purpose of the social media accounts was no mystery, but the posts are not necessary in the context of Defendant's online activity or the chatroom itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant need not have seen these two particular posts in order to have understood that the purpose of creating social media accounts for ISIS sympathizers, who approached him in a pro-ISIS chatroom after he had posted pro-ISIS messages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Plea Application (Factual Basis) at 2, was to bolster support for ISIS's terrorist attacks on government and to recruits adherents, thus affecting the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion. Indeed, what other purpose would the accounts serve? Defendant splits hairs in asserting that \"it can be safely presumed that he understood [the accounts] would be used (if at all) to spread information sympathetic to ISIS. But he did not know that they would be used to influence government conduct by coercion or intimidation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Sentencing Memo. at 19. Spreading information sympathetic to ISIS strengthens ISIS, which combats hostile governments through intimidation and force. This is a rather straightforward cause and effect, and not nearly as convoluted as Defendant contends.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Reply at 21 (bemoaning the \"lengthy chain of causation the government draws\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moreover, Defendant need not have had the particular motivation of influencing or affecting government conduct. He need only have had the specific intent to commit an offense that was calculated to influence or affect government conduct by intimidation or coercion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Awan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682127\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/306/#p317\">\n    607 F.3d 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317-18 (2d Cir. 2010) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. Reply at 14 (acknowledging, based on\n   <em>\n    Awan\n   </em>\n   , that whether a defendant is motivated to influence government is not important, as the statute focuses not on the defendant but on the offense). Defendant's assertion that he opened the accounts not out of an allegiance to ISIS but because he was engaged in a \"retaliatory game\" of internet trolling and wanted help \"block[ing] his enemies\" online,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. Sentencing Memo. at 22-23;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682127\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/306/#p317\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. C (Sageman Report) is therefore irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Awan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682127\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/306/#p317\">\n    607 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A hired assassin who kills a political leader at the behest of a terrorist organization can hardly disclaim that his crime was calculated to influence the conduct of government simply because he was motivated by greed rather than politics.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues next that the accounts he created were in fact used to spread \"battlefield news and generic exhortations in praise of ISIS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D. Supp. Memo. at 11 (\"[t]he accounts were used to send updates on the status of the Battle of Mosul and generic messages in\n   praise of ISIS\"). Again, this distinction falls flat. \"Battlefield news\" is a euphemism for battlefield propaganda.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov. Sentencing Memo. at 55-56 (news included how many martyrdom operations ISIS had carried out, how many opposing soldiers had been killed, etc.), Ex. 6 (example). Defendant also ignores the reality of who ISIS was fighting on those battlefields: legitimate governments. The Battle of Mosul was a major military campaign by the U.S.-backed Iraqi military to liberate the city of Mosul from ISIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dan Lamonthe et al.,\n   <em>\n    Battle of Mosul: How Iraqi forces defeated the Islamic State\n   </em>\n   , THE WASHINGTON POST , July 10, 2017, https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/battle-for-mosul/?utm_term=.31a73a928f12. It does not help Defendant's case that ISIS used the accounts to spread propaganda about its battles against legitimate governments and to garner support more broadly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the government has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that in opening social media accounts for ISIS sympathizers, Defendant had the specific intent to commit an offense that was calculated to influence or affect government conduct by intimidation or coercion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Supp. Memo. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Retaliation against government conduct is one of the central features of ISIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-6 (recounting 2014 speech by ISIS leader repeatedly threatening, \"we will take revenge!\", beheading of American journalist James Foley in retaliation for 2014 American air strike, beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff in retaliation for claimed American \"arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State\"). Retaliation is also a central feature of the propaganda ISIS distributes through social media.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, retaliation was a theme in the chatroom Defendant frequented, as evidenced by the Migrant Commando post discussed above, which included the language, \"Let us kindle strife and chaos in their country.

Supp. Memo. at 7. But as discussed above, Defendant concedes that \"he understood [the accounts] would be used (if at all) to spread information\n   sympathetic to ISIS.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. Sentencing Memo. at 19. Spreading information sympathetic to ISIS strengthens ISIS and recruits adherents to ISIS, which leads to retaliation against governments\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with acts of terror. While the act of opening social media accounts for ISIS is clearly distinguishable from (and less horrific than) the act of beheading journalists, the Court is unpersuaded that the two are unrelated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.
