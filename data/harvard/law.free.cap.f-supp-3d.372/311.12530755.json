Numbers, II, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The United States asks permission to have one of its witnesses testify at trial by video conference because she is in Hawaii and has already traveled to Raleigh once before for a bench conference that was continued at the last minute. This request is understandable and, in many ways, quite reasonable. But under the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, Defendant Amelia G. Rivera has a right to have the witnesses against her testify before her in person. A court may only deny a defendant this right if excusing the witness's attendance furthers an important public policy and the reliability of her testimony is otherwise assured. The Government has not met this standard, so the court will deny\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   its motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The United States filed a criminal information against Rivera in March 2018 containing\n   three misdemeanor counts related to events that allegedly occurred on Fort Bragg. After she pleaded not guilty, the court set a bench trial for January 24, 2019. On the morning of bench trial Government counsel appeared along with several witnesses. One of the witnesses, Kendall Hess, flew in from Hawaii to testify. But defense counsel found himself without a client. Rivera was in the hospital dealing with a serious medical emergency involving her child. At defense counsel's request, the court continued the bench trial until April 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In March 2018, the Government filed a motion asking to allow Hess to testify at the rescheduled bench trial by video conference. It argued that the court should grant the motion because Hess had traveled before to Raleigh for the continued bench trial. Rivera's counsel objected to this request on unspecified grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. But the text does not explain whether a witness testifying at trial by two-way video conference technology satisfies its terms. And neither the Supreme Court nor the Fourth Circuit have weighed in on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Absent an answer from the explicit constitutional text, the court will look to the Confrontation Clause's original public meaning and cases interpreting the clause in other contexts to resolve this issue. Neither source of authority particularly helps the Government. A review of the Clause's history and the common law at the time of the Sixth Amendment's ratification show that in person, face-to-face confrontation was key to the Clause's protection. And the Supreme Court has severely restricted a court's ability to excuse a witness from appearing in person at a trial. What's more every Court of Appeals who has addressed the constitutionality of a witness appearing by two-way video, except one, has required witnesses to appear in person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Framers designed the Confrontation Clause to prevent the \"use of\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   examinations as evidence against the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Their concerns arose from a series of abuses in the 16th and 17th centuries where prosecutors used out-of-court, un-confronted testimony to convict accused persons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    at 43-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The most notorious example occurred in the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh.

Thus, the common law view of confrontation involved \"examination of witnesses\n   <em>\n    viva voce\n   </em>\n   [orally], in the presence of all mankind[.]\" 3 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England *373 (1768). This method of taking evidence was \"much more conducive to\n   the clearing up of truth, than the private and secret examination taken down in writing before an officer... where a witness may frequently depose that in private, which he will be ashamed to testify in a public and solemn tribunal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It was this common law concept, which embraced \"live testimony in court subject to adversarial testing\" which informed the founding generation's views of adequate witness confrontation.\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    541 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p50\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And although the People ratified the Sixth Amendment in 1791, its protections apply with equal force to circumstances unimaginable at that time-such as testimony through video technology.

The factfinder would see the witness, the witness would be subject to cross examination, and the witness could see the defendant. Yet allowing two-way video conferencing would mean that the witness is not physically present in the courtroom, depriving the defendant of the right to in person, face-to-face confrontation. These are two requirements critical to the right of confrontation at common law. And thus like in\n   <em>\n    Kyllo\n   </em>\n   , the court must consider \"what limits [are there] upon this power of technology to shrink the realm of\" protections guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause?\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    533 U.S. at 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312742\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/27/#p34\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court's decisions involving the interaction of new technology to a right that \"comes to us on faded parchment,\"\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168934\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/149/#p174\">\n    399 U.S. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168934\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/149/#p174\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168934\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/399/149/#p174\">\n    26 L.Ed.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring), show that courts must insist on maintaining the protective force of the liberty interest at stake when they are confronted with new technologies. Given that the original public meaning of the Confrontation Clause included, generally, a right to in person, face-to-face confrontation of witness, it would be inappropriate to deny Rivera this right unless a recognized exception to the right justified doing so. This conclusion\n   remains true regardless of how similar video conferencing is to live testimony. If it cannot preserve the core of the right protected by the Confrontation Clause, it is inadequate. The Government has not shown that any exception to the right to confrontation that was recognized at the time of the Amendment's ratification applies here. Thus the court cannot approve of the witness testifying by video conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Cases interpreting the Confrontation Clause from the Supreme Court and several courts of appeal also show that courts may only excuse a witness from testifying in person at trial in limited circumstances not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Supreme Court's decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Coy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Iowa\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , which address the Confrontation Clause's requirement of physical, face-to-face cross-examination, provide guidance on the issue before the court.

Testimony by remote video still allowed the witness to be placed under oath, allowed for cross examination, and enabled the factfinder to observe the witness's demeanor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    at 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court of appeals claimed that\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   was not binding because that case involved a \"standard to constrain the use of one-way closed-circuit television, whereby the witness could not possibly view the defendant[,]\" and the case before it involved \"a two-way system that preserved the face-to-face confrontation celebrated by\n   <em>\n    Coy\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397231\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/75/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397231\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/75/\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also focused on the provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that allow parties to obtain a witness's testimony through deposition and present it at trial when exceptional circumstances are present and the court considers it in the interest of justice to do so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397231\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/75/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397231\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/75/\">\n    at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Fed. R. Cr. P. 15(a) ). Given that the court \"could have admitted [the witness's] testimony pursuant to Rule 15 without offending the confrontation clause\" the court of appeals considered it appropriate to allow two-way video testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397231\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/75/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the other hand, several Courts of Appeal have closely followed the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   standard. For example, the Eleventh Circuit has rejected\n   <em>\n    Gigante\n   </em>\n   's reasoning in favor of the two-part test laid out in\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Yates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996679\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1307/#p1312\">\n    438 F.3d 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1312-14 (11th Cir. 2006) (en banc). It found the one-way/two-way distinction to be unpersuasive and found that\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   applied to two-way video conferencing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996679\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1307/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996679\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1307/#p1312\">\n    at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it has noted that at least four other circuits (the Eighth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth) have reached a similar conclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996679\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1307/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"996679\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/438/1307/#p1312\">\n    at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court finds the reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit and the other courts that have relied on\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   to be persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   maintains the defendant's right to confront his accuser in person, subject only to a narrow exception. This standard is also more protective of the right at the core of the Confrontation Clause than the Second Circuit's exceptional circumstances test. Thus, the court will consider whether the Government has satisfied the two-factor\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if the court were to presume that the two-way nature of the video conference would assure the reliability of the witness's testimony, the Government has not shown that excusing the witness from appearing in person is \"necessary to further an important public policy[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    497 U.S. at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, it relies on the inconvenience to the witness of traveling to Raleigh from Hawaii a second\n   time. This inconvenience does not rise to the level of an important public policy that justifies depriving the witness of her Sixth Amendment right to confront, in person, a witness against her. Thus, while the court acknowledges that travel can be inconvenient to witnesses, the Government has failed to show how avoiding such inconveniences furthers \"an important public policy,\" and therefore the Government's motion is denied.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    497 U.S. at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p840\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As the Supreme Court has noted, \"[i]t is a truism that constitutional protections have costs.\"\n   <em>\n    Coy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774862\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1012/#p1014\">\n    487 U.S. at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1774862\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/1012/#p1014\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2798\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, enforcing the Confrontation Clause will impose costs and inconvenience on the Government and its witness, despite their lack of any responsibility for the need to reschedule the bench trial. But this inconvenience does not outweigh the costs to the defendant and the Constitution of diminishing her right to confront her accuser in person at trial. The court therefore denies the Government's Motion for Government Witness to Appear by Video Teleconference.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The court previously entered a text order informing the parties that the motion would be denied and that a written order would follow.
