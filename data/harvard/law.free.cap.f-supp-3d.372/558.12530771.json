LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiff filed the present action seeking review of the Commissioner's decision denying his claim for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. The case was referred to United States Magistrate Judge Elizabeth A. Stafford under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) and E.D. Mich. LR 72.1(b)(3). Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment to reverse the decision of the Commissioner and remand the case for an award of benefits or for further consideration by the administrative law judge (ALJ). The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment requesting affirmance of the decision of the Commissioner. The plaintiff then filed a supplemental brief arguing that the ALJ's appointment violated the Appointments Clause,\n   U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2, and therefore he is entitled to a remand for a new hearing before a different, properly-appointed ALJ. Magistrate Judge Stafford filed a report on February 1, 2019 recommending that the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment be granted on that ground, and the matter should be remanded for a fresh administrative hearing. Judge Stafford recommended in the alternative that the Court grant the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment and affirm the decision of the Commissioner if the Court disagrees with the proposed resolution of the Appointments Clause issue. Both sides filed timely objections and responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff, who is now 66 years old, filed his application for disability insurance benefits on October 21, 2014, when he was 62. In the application that is the subject of the present appeal, the plaintiff alleged a disability onset date of March 13, 2014. The plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident on his disability onset date and a second collision in December 2014. The plaintiff alleged disability due to spinal fusion of cervical vertebrae, right shoulder rotator cuff surgery, multiple breaks to his left arm and wrist, and back and hip pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff's application for disability benefits was denied initially on December 23, 2014. He timely filed a request for an administrative hearing, and on July 19, 2016, the plaintiff appeared before ALJ Timothy J. Christensen. ALJ Christensen, it appears, was appointed from a pool of applicants maintained by the Office of Personnel Management,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Menoken v. McGettigan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417920\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/273/188/#p192\">\n    273 F.Supp.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (D.D.C. 2017), and not by a head of a department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 28, 2016, ALJ Christensen issued a written decision in which he found that the plaintiff was not disabled. On November 28, 2017, the Appeals Council denied the plaintiff's request for review of the ALJ's decision. The plaintiff then filed his complaint seeking judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ALJ Christensen reached his conclusion that the plaintiff was not disabled by applying the five-step sequential analysis prescribed by the Secretary in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). He found that the plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since March 13, 2014 through the date he was last insured of December 31, 2014 (step one); the plaintiff suffered from spine disorder and dysfunction of the major joints, impairments which were \"severe\" within the meaning of the Social Security Act (step two); and that none of those impairments alone or in combination met or equaled a listing in the regulations (step three).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before proceeding further, the ALJ determined that the plaintiff retained the functional capacity (RFC) to perform light work, except that the plaintiff: (1) cannot engage in occasional \"postural\" such as bending and stooping; (2) can only frequently handle and grasp with the left upper extremity; (3) cannot reach overhead with the left, non-dominant upper extremity; and (4) would be off-task for less than 10 percent of the workday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At step four, the ALJ found that the plaintiff's RFC allowed him to perform the duties required for his past relevant work as a program planner, which was performed at the sedentary exertional level. Based on those findings, the ALJ did not proceed to the fifth step and concluded that the plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff raised three arguments in his motion for summary judgment regarding the ALJ's assessment of his RFC. He said that the ALJ should have adopted a more restrictive RFC based on the plaintiff's\n   upper extremity limitations; the ALJ improperly discounted the opinions of the plaintiff's treating physician regarding his limitations; and the ALJ did not consider the side effects of the plaintiff's medications in formulating the RFC. In a supplemental brief, the plaintiff for the first time challenged the validity of ALJ Christensen's appointment and requested a remand and a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing before a different ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The magistrate judge suggested that the constitutional challenge had merit. She recommended, on that basis, that the case be remanded for a new hearing before a different ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Alternatively, the magistrate judge rejected each of the plaintiff's merits arguments. She concluded that the ALJ appropriately accorded little weight to the opinion of the plaintiff's treating physician, based on the absence of clinical or diagnostic evidence and in light of the conservative treatment the plaintiff received following his car accidents. The magistrate judge then found that the ALJ did not err by crafting a less restrictive RFC based on the plaintiff's conservative treatment during the relevant period, his continued ability to drive and shop, and the consulting physician's opinion that the plaintiff required no manual restrictions for his left upper extremity. And lastly, the magistrate judge concluded, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, that the ALJ considered the side effects of the plaintiff's pain medication and specifically noted that the plaintiff's ability to drive was inconsistent with his claim that his medication's side effects, including drowsiness, prevented him from performing light work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Both parties filed objections to the report and recommendation. The filing of timely objections to a report and recommendation requires the court to \"make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

ALJs who heard administrative proceedings under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 were appointed not by the Commission itself, but by SEC staff members.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court held that those ALJs were \"Officers of the United States\" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, and therefore must be appointed as that Clause prescribes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the ALJ's were \"inferior Officers,\" Congress could vest authority for their appointment \"in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 ). Although the Court believed that the Commission was a \"Head[ ] of Department[ ],\" SEC staff members were not. Therefore, the Court concluded, the ALJ was not properly appointed, and Lucia was entitled to a new hearing before a different and properly-appointed ALJ.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Commissioner here does not quarrel with the argument that ALJ Christensen was improperly appointed in violation of the Appointments Clause. She also concedes \"that 'one who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case' is entitled to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ryder v.

Instead, she insists that the plaintiff forfeited his Appointments Clause argument because it was not \"timely\": he never raised it at the administrative level. The magistrate judge suggested, however, that the plaintiff was not required to do so, and he did not forfeit his argument. The Commissioner objects to that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This issue is not novel. It has come up in dozens of Social Security cases since\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   was decided. The magistrate judge acknowledged that district courts across the country \"overwhelmingly\" have endorsed the Commissioner's position. She nevertheless adopted the reasoning of Magistrate Judge Timothy Rice of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who concluded that general waiver and forfeiture principles do not apply to Social Security cases at the administrative level.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v. Berryhill\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-172 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 2, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This conclusion collides with a fundament of administrative law \"that orderly procedure and good administration require that objections to the proceedings of an administrative agency be made while it has opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For several reasons, the Court agrees. First,\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   addressed the issue-exhaustion requirement in a vastly different substantive and procedural setting.

The Court noted that because the Appeals Council was charged with the responsibility for developing the issues when it reviewed the ALJ's decision, the analogy to \"normal adversarial litigation\" was weak and undercut the benefits served by the issue-exhaustion rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    at 109-110, 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That would be particularly true where the issues that the claimant sought to raise in judicial proceedings focused directly on the disability determination. However, where the challenge is to the structural integrity of the process itself, the adversarial nature of the litigation reemerges. It only makes sense that such challenges should be made \"before those very judges and prior to their action on his case,\"\n   <em>\n    Ryder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    515 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while the agency \"has opportunity for correction.\"\n   <em>\n    L.A.

At that stage of administrative proceedings, \"the regulations provide no notice that claimants must ... raise specific issues before the Appeals Council to reserve them for review in federal court.

The parties agree that in this case, the plaintiff did not raise his Appointments Clause challenge at\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   administrative level, and only brought it up in a supplemental brief filed after the summary judgment briefing had closed.\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   specifically did not consider the wisdom of requiring issue exhaustion at the ALJ level, nor did it furnish a justification for departing from the general rule requiring it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, the\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   claimant presented issues to the district court for judicial review that the Appeals Council naturally would have had to consider in making its \"inquisitorial\" disability determination. There is no reason that the Appeals Council would have questioned the qualifications of the ALJ to entertain the case. Although nothing in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ties the application of the issue-exhaustion rule to the nature of the issues raised, it does establish an exception to an \"ordinary principle[ ] of administrative law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., dissenting), that deserves some measure of justification.

Plaintiff's Objections\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiff filed three objections to the magistrate judge's alternate recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1. First Objection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the magistrate judge's conclusion that the ALJ properly discounted the weight of the treating physician's opinion is not persuasive and that the report did not adequately address the points raised in the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff asserts that neither the magistrate judge nor the ALJ adequately discussed the implications of the plaintiff's long-term relationship with his treating physician, Dr. Perez, which gave Dr. Perez a \"unique, longitudinal understanding\" of the plaintiff's functional capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Commissioner responds that the ALJ in fact considered the nature and length of Dr. Perez's relationship with the plaintiff, and although those factors weigh in favor of crediting Dr. Perez's opinion, the ALJ appropriately relied on the other factors enumerated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plaintiff does not take issue with that determination in his objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The magistrate judge also found justification for the ALJ giving the opinion only \"limited weight.\" See Tr. 25. The plaintiff objects to that finding, contending that the ALJ did not assess all the required factors, including the length of Dr. Perez's treatment relationship with the plaintiff. The regulations require the ALJ to consider the \"[l]ength of the treatment relationship and the frequency,\" and the \"[n]ature and extent of the treatment relationship\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   when determining what weight to give the opinion of a treating source.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(1)(i), (ii). The plaintiff insists that the ALJ did not comply with that directive.

He noted that Dr. Perez's \"documented treatment\" was limited to conservative care. And he discussed other evidence in the record that was inconsistent with Dr. Perez's opinion. Tr. 25-26. The magistrate judge correctly concluded that the ALJ did all he was required to do when assessing Dr. Perez's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The plaintiff's first objection will be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   2. Second Objection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The plaintiff's second objection flows from the first. He argues that the magistrate judge should have found that the ALJ failed to accord Dr. Perez's opinion appropriate weight, and failed to consider other evidence, when formulating the RFC, especially for upper extremity limitations. As noted earlier, he believes his RFC was overstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ALJ's specific determination of RFC must be supported by substantial evidence, but the claimant bears the burden of demonstrating the need for a more restrictive RFC.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954153\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/548/417/#p423\">\n    548 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (6th Cir. 2008) (noting that \"[t]he claimant ... retains the burden of proving her lack of residual functional capacity\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Her v.

As noted above, the magistrate judge correctly determined that the ALJ appropriately assessed Dr. Perez's opinion. And the plaintiff has not identified what \"other\" evidence the ALJ should have considered. He has not met his burden of showing a need for a more restrictive RFC, and his second objection will be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   3. Third Objection\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the magistrate judge erred by approving the ALJ's assessment of the impact (or lack of it) of the plaintiff's medication's side effects. The plaintiff contends that the ALJ failed to address the plaintiff's testimony that he experiences drowsiness in the first hour and slowed thought for two hours after taking his medication. He argues that the ALJ's finding based on the plaintiff's ability to drive was insufficient in light of his own testimony and Dr. Perez's opinion regarding the side effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Much of what the plaintiff argues here ignores the timing of the evidence he references. For instance, Dr. Perez did not complete his August 2016 assessment of the plaintiff until almost two years after the plaintiff's insured status expired, that is, well after the relevant time period. The medical records do not contain\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   complaints about his medication's side effects before the date last insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   To qualify for disability insurance benefits, the plaintiff must not only establish that he is disabled, but also that he was insured within the meaning of the Social\n   Security Act, and became disabled while enjoying insured status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20416\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i), 423(d)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Higgs v.

And the ALJ's discounting of the plaintiff's complaints of drowsiness is justified by his observation that the plaintiff admitted driving and taking care of his daughter. Tr. 25. As the Commissioner noted, the plaintiff testified that he took medication every four hours and had side effects for \"four hours after taking it, three hours after taking it,\" and within \"four hours I'm already taking the next [pill].\" Tr. 49. That testimony is inconsistent with the plaintiff's professed ability to drive, and that inconsistency properly was considered by the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The plaintiff's third objection will be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The plaintiff forfeited his right to challenge the appointment of ALJ Christensen by not raising his Appointments Clause objection during the administrative process and before coming to court.
