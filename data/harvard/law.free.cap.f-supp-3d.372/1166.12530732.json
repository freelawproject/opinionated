Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, filed March 23, 2018 (Doc. 27)(\"MTD\"). The Court held a hearing on August 10, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the applicable statutes of limitations bar Plaintiff Janice Nowell's claims against Defendants Medtronic Inc., Covidien PLC, Covidien LP, and Medtronic PLC for negligence, strict liability -- design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure-to-warn -- breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranty; and (ii) whether Nowell has alleged with specificity how the Defendants' product is defective and how that defect caused her injuries. The Court will grant the MTD. Nowell's warranty claims are untimely, because Nowell alleges that her physician used the Defendants' defective product to repair her hernia\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on October 27, 2010,\n   but Nowell did not file her original Complaint for Damages for Personal Injury Resulting From Negligence, Strict Liability and Breach of Warranties (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"), until October 5, 2017, almost three years after the expiration of the four-year statute of limitations governing express and implied warranty claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2055-2-725\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 55-2-725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Nowell's negligence and strict liability claims are untimely, because the Second Amended Complaint for Damages for Personal Injury Resulting from Negligence, Strict Liability and Breach of Warranties, filed January 19, 2018 (Doc. 24-1)(\"Amended Complaint\"), indicates that Nowell was aware of cognizable tort injuries between April, 2011, and March, 2014, but did not file her original Complaint until October 5, 2017, after the three-year statute of limitations governing negligence and strict liability claims had expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2037-1-8\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 37-1-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Court concludes that Nowell's factual allegations lack specificity sufficient to satisfy the pleading standard that the Supreme Court of the United States of America articulated in\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). Nowell's negligence claim does not plead facts alleging causation. Her strict liability claims do not allege any specific defect -- in either design, manufacture, or warning -- that made the Defendants' product unreasonably dangerous and caused her injuries. Moreover, Nowell has not alleged that a feasible alternative design existed which lacked the alleged design defect and that therefore would have prevented her injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales v. E.D. Etnyre &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8942992\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/382/1278/#p1283\">\n    382 F.Supp.2d 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1283 (D.N.M. 2005) (Browning, J.)(\"Thus, to the extent that a plaintiff could come to court and merely criticize a product, the Court believes that the New Mexico law required the plaintiff to propose an alternative design.\"). Nowell does not allege an affirmation or representation that could support her express warranty claim. Furthermore, Nowell does not allege with sufficient specificity a defect that rendered the Defendants' product sufficiently unfit for its particular purpose or sufficiently unmerchantable to support her claim for breach of implied warranty. Finally, Nowell has not alleged facts sufficient to support a finding that the Defendants' conduct maliciously, intentionally, fraudulently, oppressively, recklessly, or wantonly offended Nowell's rights such that Nowell is entitled to punitive damages. Accordingly, the Court will grant the MTD and dismiss the case with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes the facts from the Amended Complaint. As this matter comes before the Court on a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court assumes that all facts in the Complaint are true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

At the time, Dr. Pollard implanted a twenty centimeter \"Parietex Mesh Composite\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to repair Nowell's hernia. Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Subsequently, the mesh began to \"pull away from the actual edges,\" and on April 27, 2011, Nowell had a second surgery wherein Dr. Pollard used additional sutures to reinforce the existing Parietex mesh. Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Dr. Pollard did not inform Nowell of any problems with the mesh and, after the surgery, noted that Nowell \"was doing well.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Between April 27, 2011, and March 1, 2014, Nowell \"began experiencing symptoms including but not limited to exhaustion and pain in the area of the mesh.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. During this period, \"Nowell was skeptical as to whether the mesh was causing these problems\"; however, Dr. Pollard did not advise her that the mesh was causing these issues. Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. On March 1, 2014, Nowell underwent a CT scan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. The physicians who performed Nowell's CT scan neither concluded nor advised Nowell that the mesh was causing her issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. The physicians\n   were unable to diagnose the symptoms' cause, because Nowell \"apparently had cysts in the area associated with the mesh.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. On October 6, 2014, Nowell underwent another CT scan, which \"revealed a large fluid collection associated with the mesh\" and a corresponding staph infection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. On October 8, 2014, \"Dr. Powell\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   informed Nowell that \"there was no choice but to remove the Parietex mesh and replace it with a biological mesh,\" which he \"memorialized ... in his treatment notes.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Moreover, during this discussion, Dr. Pollard told Nowell \"that there was a problem with the mesh itself.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. \"On or about October 20, 2014,\" Dr. Pollard removed the \"infected and disintegrated (unincorporated)\" Parietex mesh from Nowell's abdomen. Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 5, 2017, Nowell filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, alleging six causes of action: (i) negligence; (ii) strict liability -- design defect; (iii) strict liability -- manufacturing defect; (iv) strict liability -- failure-to-warn; (v) breach of express warranty; and (vi) breach of implied warranty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 103-155, at 18-32, filed October 5, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\"). Nowell subsequently amended the Complaint on October 6, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint for Damages for Personal Injury Resulting from Negligence, Strict Liability and Breach of Warranties, filed October 6, 2017 (Doc. 4), and again on January 19, 2018, but alleges the same claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 103-155, at 22-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nowell contends that the Defendants were negligent in failing to use reasonable care and breached their duty to Nowell \"in designing, manufacturing, marketing, labeling, packaging and selling\" the mesh. Amended Complaint \u00b6 104, at 22. Specifically, Nowell contends that the mesh's design \"did not provide for sufficient resiliency which caused the Product to disintegrate in Plaintiff,\" and that the mesh's manufacturing process caused \"an unreasonable risk of harm to women in whom the Product was implanted, including the Plaintiff.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 105, at 23. Nowell further alleges that the Defendants did not use reasonable care in the mesh's testing and inspection, in instructing physicians in how to use the mesh, and in evaluating the mesh's safety \"to determine the nature, magnitude, and frequency of serious, life threatening complications that were known or knowable.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 105, at 23. Nowell further alleges that the Defendants' mesh is unreasonably dangerous and defective, because the mesh material causes adverse reactions and injuries; the\n   mesh design facilitated harmful bacteria growth, which caused \"immune reactions and subsequent tissue breakdown and adverse reactions and injuries;\" and the mesh has a propensity \"to disintegrate inside the body,\" \"to deform when subject to prolonged tension inside the body,\" to cause \"adverse tissue reactions,\" and to create \"a non-anatomic condition in the abdomen leading to chronic pain and functional disabilities when the mesh is implant[ed] according to the manufacturers instructions.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 106, at 23-24. Nowell adds that her \"adverse tissue reactions ... are causally related to infection, as the materials used to construct the Product are foreign.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 106, at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Nowell also alleges that the Defendants \"negligently failed to warn\" her and/or her healthcare providers about the mesh's \"propensities to deform inside the body,\" about \"degradation, fragmentation and/or creep,\" about \"the rate and manner of mesh erosion or extrusion,\" and about the mesh's risks, including \"chronic infections\" and \"recurrent, intractable abdominal pain and other pain.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 107, at 24-25. The Defendants' duty to warn, asserts Nowell, extends to the \"need for corrective or revision surgery to adjust or remove the Product,\" and treatment with the mesh exposes patients to greater risk than treatment with \"feasible available alternatives,\" including risks attendant to multiple, debilitating surgeries. Amended Complaint \u00b6 108, at 25. Nowell asserts that the Defendants' negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her \"significant mental and physical pain and suffering\" to include \"permanent injury, ... medical treatment and ... likely ... further medical treatment and procedures, ... financial or economic loss, ... obligations for medical services and expenses, lost income, and other damages.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 109, at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nowell contends that the Defendants are strictly liable for the mesh's alleged design defects, but for which, according to Nowell, she would not have sustained her injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 121, at 27. Specifically, Nowell contends that the meshes' \"inelasticity,\" which causes \"them to be improperly mated to the delicate and sensitive areas of the abdomen where they are implanted, and causes pain upon normal daily activities that involve movement in the abdomen,\" and that the mesh has \"[b]iomechanical issues ... including, but not limited to, the propensity of the Product to disintegrate inside the body, that in turn cause surrounding tissue to be inflamed, become fibrotic, and contract, resulting in injury.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 121, at 28. Nowell reasserts the same alleged injuries described in paragraph 109.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 122, at 28-29. Nowell adds that the mesh was \"inherently defective,\" because it \"was not sturdy enough to prevent disintegration and malformation,\" which resulted in the mesh \"breaking apart while in the Plaintiff's body... in turn caus[ing] ... internal bleeding, infection and other serious injuries.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 123, at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nowell asserts that the Defendants are strictly liable for the mesh's alleged manufacturing defects, because the mesh \"deviated materially from Defendants' design and manufacturing specifications in such a manner as to pose unreasonable risks of serious bodily harm to the Plaintiff.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 125, at 29. Nowell alleges that these manufacturing defects were the direct and proximate cause of her injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 126, at 29-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nowell contends that the Defendants are strictly liable for not providing Nowell with \"appropriate and necessary warnings\" regarding the mesh's alleged defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 30. Nowell reasserts her arguments from paragraph 106, including that the Defendants had a duty to warn her about the mesh's propensity to disintegrate, fragment, degrade, and improperly \"mate[ ] with the abdominal region,\" and to cause \"chronic inflammation,\" \"chronic infections,\" \"scarring,\" and \"recurrent, intractable pain.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 30-31. The Defendants' duty to warn, asserts Nowell, extends to the \"need for corrective or revision surgery to adjust or remove the Product,\" and that treatment with the mesh exposes patients to greater risk than treatment with \"feasible available alternatives\" including risks attendant to multiple, debilitating surgeries. Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 31. Nowell asserts that the Defendants' failure-to-warn was the direct and proximate cause of her \"significant mental and physical pain and suffering\" to include \"permanent injury, ... medical treatment and ... likely ... further medical treatment and procedures, ... financial or economic loss, ... obligations for medical services and expenses, lost income, and other damages.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 130, at 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Nowell asserts that the Defendants are liable for breach of express warranty based on assurances made \"to the general public, hospitals and health care professionals that the Product was safe and reasonably fit for its intended purposes.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 141, at 34. Nowell contends that her physician chose the Defendants' mesh based on such warranties and representations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 142, at 34. The Defendants are liable, according to Nowell, because the mesh \"was unreasonably dangerous and defective ... and not as Defendant[s] had represented,\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 144, at 34, which resulted in Nowell's physician implanting the mesh in Nowell's body,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 145 at 34, and thereby causing the injuries detailed in paragraph 109 and repeated in paragraph 146,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 146, at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nowell asserts that the Defendants are liable for breach of implied warranty, because the mesh was neither merchantable nor fit for its intended purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 155, at 35-36. Nowell asserts that such a breach is evident, because the mesh \"disintegrated and mishappened [sic] inside the Plaintiff's body, causing injuries.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 155, at 35-36. Nowell reasserts her injuries that paragraph 106 describes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 157, at 36. Nowell adds that \"someone with knowledge in the trade would reject the mesh for failure to meet the contract description.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 159, at 36. Accordingly, Nowell requests compensatory, punitive, and special damages, as well as attorney's fees and costs, and any other relief that the Court deem appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The MTD\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendants argue in the MTD that, for two independent reasons, the Court should dismiss the Amended Complaint in its entirety pursuant to rule 12(b)(6) : first, applicable statutes of limitations bar each claim, and, second, the Amended Complaint relies on \"labels and conclusions,\" and \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of\" each claim without any well-pled facts alleging a specific defect with the Defendants' product and how that defect purportedly caused Nowell's injuries.

Petro et. al.,\n   <em>\n    Central Failures of Lightweight Monofilament Polyester Mesh Causing Hernia Recurrence: A Cautionary Note\n   </em>\n   , 19 Hernia 155 (2015) ). Moreover, according to the Defendants, the second article -- \"Postoperative Mesh Infection -- Still a Concern in Laparoscopic Era\" -- summarizes published findings and mentions the Defendants' Parietex mesh only once; it says nothing about Parietex Composite.

Finally, the Defendants aver, although the third article -- \"Novel in Vitro Model for Assessing Susceptibility of Synthetic Hernia Repair Meshes to Staphylococcus aureus Infection\" -- studies \"Parietex Composite,\" it does not suggest a potential defect in the Defendants' mesh that could be causally linked to Nowell's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 15 n.14 (citing Ihab F.

Moreover, Nowell avers, she may prove causation for her failure-to-warn claim by showing that \"an adequate warning would have been noticed and acted upon to guard against the danger.\" MTD Response at 8 (quoting Civ. UJI 13-1425 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   According to Nowell, the Amended Complaint alleges causation specifically in paragraph 38, wherein she states that the \"Plaintiff underwent surgery during which the surgeon, Dr. William Pollard, removed an infected and disintegrated Parietex mesh in Plaintiff's abdomen.\" MTD Response at 8 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8). Nowell adds that paragraph 38 alleges that she \"experienced pain in the area of the mesh and exhaustion,\" and that the mesh \"also caused Plaintiff to undergo multiple surgical interventions.\" MTD Response at 8 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8). Moreover, adds Nowell, paragraph 46 alleges that the mesh \"was made from material that is both biologically incompatible with human tissue and susceptible to mechanical failure,\" which, \"when implanted in the human body, ... promotes (and in Ms. Nowell['s] case it promoted) infection and disintegration.\" MTD Response at 8-9 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 46, at 12). Nowell insists that paragraph 38 contains \"scientific references\" which show that \"non-biologically compatible Paritex mesh\" causes the type of injuries that Nowell suffered,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"disintegration and infection.\" MTD Response at 9 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Regarding her failure-to-warn claim, Nowell maintains that the allegations in the Amended Complaint are sufficient, because paragraph 67 states that the \" 'Defendants failed to provide sufficient warnings' ... to put Ms. Nowell 'on notice of the dangers and adverse effects caused by implantation of the Product' \" and because paragraph 70 states that the Defendants marked the mesh \"as safe\" and as \"free from the kinds of risks and hazards that the [Product] actually posed.\" MTD Response at 9 (alteration in MTD Response)(citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 70, at 17). Further support for this claim, according to Nowell, is seen in paragraph 139, which states that \"[b]ut for the Defendants' failure-to-warn, the Plaintiff would not have sustained [the alleged] injuries,\" MTD Response at 9 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 139, at 33), paragraph 138, which states that Nowell's injuries \"would not have occurred if adequate warning and instruction had been provided,\" MTD Response at 9 (citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 138, at 33), and paragraph 129, which states that the Defendants' \"failure to warn caused ... Plaintiff not to be aware of the defects [that] cause her injury,\" MTD Response at 9 (alteration in MTD Response)(citing Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 30) ).

Nowell argues that the \"breach\" and \"defect\" elements in a strict liability claim, and in a negligence claim, respectively, are \"closely related,\" because both elements \"require an unreasonable departure from ordinary care.\" MTD Response at 10. Nowell adds that \"causation\" is another element that strict liability and negligence claims share, because \"products liability law evolved from negligence law.\" MTD Response at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    MacPherson v.

Nowell asserts that her punitive damages request is not an allegation that the Court can dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, because, according to Nowell, the Tenth Circuit has concluded that a punitive damages claim is \"part and parcel of a liability determination,\" and \"does not have any independent being until a jury has decided, based on the preponderance of the evidence, that not only was a defendant's conduct negligent, but that it was gross, willful, wanton or malicious.\" MTD Response at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Mason v.

Nowell responded that a New Mexico statute makes clear that the discovery rule cannot toll an express warranty claim, but that \"New Mexico law ... has not made a decision anywhere in the\n   case law or in statutory law that would either apply or not apply the discovery rule to implied warranty claims such as that for a particular fitness of purpose or merchantability.\" Tr. at 13:14-19 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court then asked why a federal court should predict that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would apply the discovery rule to an implied warranty claim and whether other courts have done so,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:22-14:6 (Court), to which Nowell responded that she has observed a trend in New Mexico appellate jurisprudence which indicates that the Court of Appeals of New Mexico or the Supreme Court of New Mexico would apply the discovery rule to implied warranty claims \"because this particular type of claim is very tort-related, whereas most express warranty claims are more sales-related,\" Tr. at 14:7-19 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Defendants then directed the Court to\n   <em>\n    AIG Aviation Insurance v.

The Court asked the Defendants whether any court has held or suggested that the discovery rule applies to an implied-warranty claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:2-6 (Court). The Defendants responded that they \"have not seen that in our research to date\" and that Nowell apparently also has not seen it, Tr. at 16:9-11 (Reyes), to which Nowell replied that she believes that federal courts in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas have interpreted State of Kansas law to hold that the discovery rule does apply to implied warranties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16:12-17 (Montclare).

The Court asked Nowell what the implied warranty is in this case. See. Tr. at 17:16-17 (Court). Nowell responded: \"merchantability, ... due to the fact that ... the particular type of mesh that was used was causing injuries, ... and that an implied warranty would extend from the discovery of that injury.\" Tr. at 17:18-25 (Montclare). The Defendants rejoined: \"[I]f an implied warranty could be tolled under the discovery rule, it would gut the express warranty rule with respect to the statute of limitations.\" Tr. at 18:6-9 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Defendants insisted that the parties agree that Nowell did not file her claims until seven years after her initial surgery involving the Defendants' mesh, and, thus, \"because the face of the complaint establishes that the statute of limitations bar the claim without some form of tolling,\" Nowell now bears the burden to make allegations that, if proven at trial, could convince a reasonable jury to reject the limitations. Tr. at 18:20-19:4 (Reyes). The Defendants insisted further that Nowell has not carried this burden and that she\n   misconstrues the discovery rule when she states that it became reasonable to assume that the Defendants' mesh was causing her symptoms only on October 8, 2014,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after her physician diagnosed the mesh as her injury's cause despite its implantation nearly four years before, in October, 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr at 19:5-19 (Reyes).

The Defendants maintained that, \"as a matter of law,\" Nowell's cause of action accrued \"no later than April 27, 2011,\" because, on that date, Nowell underwent a second hernia mesh surgery, which \"was necessitated because the mesh had begun to, quote, 'pull away from the edges,' end quote.\" Tr. at 20:8-15 (Reyes)(quoting Amended Complaint, \u00b6 38, at 8). The Defendants insisted that Nowell was \"on inquiry notice that there may have been an issue with the mesh,\" not only because of the second surgery but also because, from April 27, 2011, to March 1, 2014, \"she continued to experience exhaustion and pain, quote, 'in the area of the mesh,' end quote.\" Tr. at 20:16-22 (Reyes)(quoting Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8). The Defendants added that the statutes of limitation on Nowell's remaining claims are three years and therefore are timed-barred even if tolled until April 27, 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 21:8-11 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nowell responded that the parties and the Court are \"not here to weigh the evidence of ... the specific facts that went to when this cause of action ensued\" and that the cases which the Defendants cite are \"summary judgment cases where the few facts have been ... fully developed through the discovery process including the depositions of all the witnesses.\" Tr. at 21:15-22:1 (Montclare). Nowell added that even the Defendants' \"most powerful case,\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Company\n   </em>\n   , \"which investigated the relationship between the misdiagnosis and the discovery of an injury\" is a summary judgment case that is distinguishable from the facts here, because the patient in\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Company\n   </em>\n   was not under a physician's constant care, unlike Nowell, and because the patient's physician did not discuss potential other causes for the patient's injury, whereas here Nowell's physician \"discussed the possibility that the staph infection could have been normal.\" Tr. at 22:5-18 (Montclare). Nowell added that, in\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Honorable John Lungstrum, United States District Judge for the District of Kanasas, \"discussed [\n   <em>\n    Mest v.

Nowell contended that\n   <em>\n    Mest v. Cabot Corp.\n   </em>\n   is relevant here, because here her physician, \"up until October 8, [2014,] had affirmatively said that the mesh did not cause the injury.\" Tr. at 22:19-25 (Montclare). Nowell maintained that her claims are plausible and that, \"at the very least, there is a material issue of fact ... as to when the statute of limitations accrued,\" which, according to Nowell, is a summary judgment standard that the Court need not consider on a motion pursuant\n   to rule 12(b)(6). Tr. at 23:2-8 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court asked Nowell whether she has anything further to say regarding the discovery issue,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , any facts to add that are not already in the Nowell Affidavit or in her Amended Complaint, because, in the Court's experience, plaintiffs avoid addressing statutes-of-limitations questions at the motion-to-dismiss stage by omitting dates, which the Court previously has permitted, but here the Amended Complaint and the Nowell Affidavit include dates and facts such that the issue arguably is ripe for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 23:10-24:6 (Court). Nowell responded in the affirmative and argued that the case has not ripened to the point where the Court can make a final decision, because Nowell, for example, has not deposed her physician \"so that he can explain in detail how he had indicated that he affirmatively said that the mesh was not involved.\" Tr. at 24:7-14 (Montclare). \"So we have not even scratched the surface as far as our ability to marshal the evidence in support of the claim, because we simply don't believe that that's our burden at this juncture.\" Tr. at 24:14-18 (Montclare). The Court asked whether Nowell is suggesting that a split exists among jurisdictions or whether, among New Mexico cases, \"there were some cases that read a certain way which suggest your facts would be time-barred, that the discovery rule -- the discovery would have occurred earlier; and then there are some cases that you're saying it would not satisfy the discovery rule[.]\" Tr. at 24:22-25:4 (Court). In response, Nowell asserted that the cases to which she directs the Court explain how a physician's misdiagnosis could toll the statute of limitations when the misdiagnosis prevents the plaintiff from discovering the issue, and that such cases might help the defense to build arguments \"during summary judgment\" whether Nowell's cause of action accrued before the misdiagnosis. Tr. at 25:8-19 (Montclare). The Court asked what about\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   tells Nowell that her case is not appropriate either to decide on a motion to dismiss or to decide that the discovery rule does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 25:22-26:5 (Court). Nowell responded that\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   cites\n   <em>\n    Mest v. Cabot Corp.\n   </em>\n   , which \"basically says that if the doctor gives a misdiagnosis to the plaintiff, as he did in this case, the statute of limitations tolls. Because ... the plaintiff did not know that there was an injury, because the doctor told the plaintiff that that was not a cause of the injury.\" Tr. at 26:12-22 (Montclare). The Court then asked whether Nowell is alleging that her physician committed malpractice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 26:24-27:1 (Court). Nowell responded that her physician's statement -- that the Defendants' mesh was not the cause of Nowell's injury until October 8, 2014, when he changed his opinion -- \"may very well be malpractice,\" but that she has not developed that argument and therefore considers it a misdiagnosis. Tr. at 27:3-8 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Defendants conceded that\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   \"does indicate that a misdiagnosis is not a basis not to toll the discovery rule,\" but asserted that the issue here is \"[w]hen the individual was on inquiry notice and should have taken reasonable action, reasonable actions would have uncovered the injury.\" Tr. at 27:25-28:5 (Reyes). The Defendants emphasized that\n   <em>\n    Mest v. Cabot Corp.\n   </em>\n   is a United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit case and called the Court's attention to\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

As observed by another court\" -- they cite another court in Texas -- \"because of the discovery rule's requirement of reasonable diligence, the tolling of the applicable statute of limitations by the rule ends when the person claiming the benefit of the rule acquires knowledge of facts, conditions, or circumstances which would cause a reasonable person to make an inquiry leading to the discovery of the concealed cause of action. This is so because the knowledge of such matters is, in the law, equivalent to knowledge of the cause of action itself for limitation purposes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Tr. at 28:13-29:9 (Reyes)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Because Nowell was on inquiry notice as of the day of her second surgery, in April, 2011, the Defendants argued, discovery will not change the facts in the Amended Complaint and in the Nowell Affidavit, and will confirm only that the statutes of limitations bar Nowell's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30:614 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Turning to Nowell's strict-liability claims, the Defendants asserted that Nowell conceded in the MTD Response that she did not plead facts sufficient to state a manufacturing-defect claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 30:22-31:10 (Reyes)(quoting MTD Response at 9 (\"In regard to the manufacturing and warranty defects, Ms. Nowell concedes that despite due diligence, she has been unable to obtain information pertaining to the exact manufacturing process and specific warranty [language].\") ). The Defendants urged the Court to take Nowell's assessment to its logical conclusion and dismiss her manufacturing-defect claim, because she does not \"state in any way, shape, or form how this particular mesh was defective when it came out of the plant with respect to the manufacturing.\" Tr. at 31:11-17 (Reyes). The Court asked the Defendants whether this argument applies to all three of Nowell's strict-liability theories -- design, manufacture, and failure-to-warn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:18-24 (Court). The Defendants responded that their understanding is that Nowell's concession is limited to her manufacturing-defect claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 31:25-32:5 (Reyes). Nowell replied that her inability to articulate plausible\n   facts regarding the manufacturing defect is because that information is available to her only through the discovery process: \"The nuances of the manufacturing process are not known and cannot be known by my client until further discovery.\" Tr. at 32:8-15 (Montclare).

Instead, the Defendants argued that all hernia repair surgeries carry a well-known infection risk, and, thus Nowell's infection allegation is insufficient to indicate that the Defendants' mesh is unreasonably dangerous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33:20-34:2 (Reyes). The Defendants provided the Court with three grounds to dismiss Nowell's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   [F]irst, the claim must be dismissed because they haven't alleged an actual design defect. Secondly, the claim should be dismissed because there's nothing in her allegation that makes it plausible as opposed to just consistent with or possible that her injury was caused by a defect in the mesh as opposed to it just being a known side effect of a well-functioning mesh and would have happened regardless of what mesh was used. And third ..., Your Honor, you had another good question ..., which is: What safer alternative design is she proposing with respect to the mesh? And ... they don't have one.

Tr. at 39:23-40:2 (Montclare). \"Central Failures of Monofiliment Polyester Mesh Causing Hernia Recurrence: A Cautionary Note,\" Nowell averred, describes how a mesh type similar to the Defendants' \"was deemed to have had a high incidence of mechanical failure.\" Tr. at 40:2-7 (Montclare). Further evidence, alleged Nowell, is in \"Postoperative Mesh Infection -- Still A Concern in Laparoscopic Era,\" which \"states that this type of synthetic mesh was ... dangerous,\" and in \"Novel in Vitro Model for Assessing Susceptibility of Synthetic Hernia Meshes,\" which \"state[s] that this type of mesh is a major cause of patient morbidity and results in substantial health care expenditures.\" Tr. at 40:8-18 (Montclare). Because these articles indicate that the Defendants' mesh is \"extremely dangerous,\" Nowell concluded, the question is not whether Nowell can present the Court with a better mesh but whether the Defendants' mesh \"should be used in the first place.\" Tr. at 40:21-24 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Defendants disputed that the three scientific articles support Nowell's allegation that the Defendants' mesh is dangerous, beginning with the first article, which \"discusses a potential for a central mesh fracture, which is not an injury complained of here, not something that happened with the mesh here. It also discussed a different mesh.\" Tr. at 41:7-14 (Reyes). Moreover, the Defendants continued, the second and third articles support the Defendants' position that infection is a known risk in all hernia repair surgeries and, therefore, Nowell cannot allege causation, because the\n   Amended Complaint does not assert facts to suggest that Nowell's injury resulted from a design defect as opposed to a side effect associated with all surgical hernia repairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 41:15-25 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Defendants next turned to Nowell's failure-to-warn claim and asserted that all hernia repair meshes, including their mesh, carry a warning that infection is a known side effect; \"[s]o the physician was warned of the risk of the infection, and the duty here runs from the manufacturer to the physician.\" Tr. at 42:7-14 (Reyes). The Defendants noted that the Amended Complaint does not allege that the Defendants did not warn Nowell's physician or that her physician would have made a decision not to use the Defendants' mesh had he had a different warning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 42:14-17 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Defendants acknowledged their familiarity with the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , wherein the Court concluded that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would not adopt the learned-intermediary doctrine, but asserted that the rationale underlying that decision does not apply here, because\n   <em>\n    Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   involved direct manufacturer-to-consumer advertising and the Defendants do not advertise their hernia mesh products to the consumer directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 42:18-43:8 (Reyes). A patient's physician, the Defendants argued, makes the decision as to which hernia mesh to use, and this decision is based often on the physician's idiosyncratic preferences for one mesh over another or, once the surgery has commenced, after the physician can evaluate a given hernia's nature and extent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 43:11-17 (Reyes). Hence, the Defendants concluded, unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , they do not have a duty to warn the ultimate consumer of the risks associated with their hernia mesh products; \"[h]ere the duty does and must run to the physician.\" Tr. at 43:18-22 (Reyes). The Defendants added that Nowell alleges neither the specific mesh-type that her physician used on her, nor the allegedly inadequate warnings associated with the specific mesh-type used, which, the Defendants argued, clouds the question what specific, adequate warning the Defendants could have provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 44:5-11 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Nowell replied by identifying two distinct issues: first, whether the Defendants should have given a warning in the first place, and second, whether any warning was sufficient or reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 44:14-18 (Montclare). Regarding the first issue, Nowell asserted: \"[W]e don't have any evidence that an actual warning was given.\" Tr. at 44:19-20 (Montclare). Nowell asserted that the Defendants are liable for failing to warn her of the mesh's potential to cause injury but conceded that, \"as far as any type of express warranties, we are not in a position to have that information yet,\" and therefore seeks discovery. Tr. at 44:23-45:7 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court asked Nowell whether the Defendants accurately described her failure-to-warn claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:8-10 (Court). Nowell responded that, although the Defendants did \"a reasonable job\" describing it, they did not address the \"material issue of fact as to whether or not ... a specific warning should have been given, given the dangerous propensity of this mesh.\" Tr. at 45:11-17 (Montclare). Nowell added that, if the Defendants did not give a required warning, they violated their duty to warn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 45:18-20 (Montclare). The Defendants responded that the question is whether the Defendants should have warned Nowell's physician and then asserted that Nowell does not know whether the Defendants did so, which is a basis for dismissal, according to the Defendants, given that \"we're far down the road\n   and that we do have pleading standards.\" Tr. at 45:23-46:9 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Defendants argued that the Court should dismiss Nowell's negligence claim for the same reason that it should dismiss her design-defect and failure-to-warn claims,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , because the Amended Complaint does not include factual allegations \"with respect to a duty or respect to a breach of the duty.\" Tr. at 46:15-23 (Reyes). Without an alleged design defect or an alleged failure-to-warn, the Defendants continued, Nowell cannot allege a breach and the Court, therefore, should dismiss her negligence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 46:23-47:2 (Reyes). Nowell responded that the MTD Response discusses \"every element of negligence and what would have to be proven should this case go to trial,\" and includes citations to the relevant paragraphs in the Amended Complaint, which \"provide a plausible claim for negligence.\" Tr. at 48:6-20 (Montclare)(citing MTD Response at 5). The Defendants replied that the citations to which Nowell directs the Court in the MTD Response \"are just conclusory allegations that are plainly not sufficient under Iqbal and Twombly.\" Tr. at 48:25-49:4 (Reyes). The Defendants added that they have also asked the Court to dismiss Nowell's punitive damages claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 49:5-6 (Reyes). In response, Nowell asserted that she is not \"under the burden to discuss each element,\" but has nevertheless done so, and that, \"as far as punitive damages are concerned,\" the MTD Response \"cite[s] numerous paragraphs that support why punitive damages would be appropriate according to the elements of New Mexico Law.\" Tr. at 49:14-25 (Montclare). The Defendants reasserted their position that the Amended Complaint does not \"allege the type of egregious conduct that would warrant punitive damages.\" Tr. at 50:4-7 (Reyes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Court stated that, although it needs to consider further the implied-warranty issue, the Court nonetheless thinks that Nowell is \"kind of pushing the envelope to try to get the discovery rule to apply to the implied warranty claim\" and that the Court, therefore, is \"inclined to think that it's just overwhelming that th[e] discovery rule shouldn't apply.\" Tr. at 50:10-18 (Court). Turning to the facts that the Amended Complaint alleges, the Court stated that plaintiffs sometimes want bad news early, and that, \"by putting all these facts and all these detailed allegations in the complaint, that there's a lot to work with here to decide whether the negligence and strict liability claims have been tolled.\" Tr. at 51:1-7 (Court). The Court added that it looks to the Court like Nowell \"was on notice that she had some problems outside the statute of limitations period,\" although the Court expressed its intention to review\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. BNSF Railway Co.\n   </em>\n   alongside Nowell's other cases and arguments. Tr. at 51:8-13 (Court). The Court stated that it needs to consider further the Defendants' remaining 12(b)(6) arguments and that it wants to review the Court of Appeals of New Mexico's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bustos v. Hyundai Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   , but that it seems to the Court that \"to embark on a case like this without some alternatives to the product that's being challenged here may just not get us anywhere.\" Tr. at 51:14-52:3 (Court). The Court nonetheless expressed that it would review the three scientific articles attached to the Amended Complaint to \"see if there's a design defect here that should go forward.\" Tr. at 52:6-10 (Court). The Court declined to express any inclination regarding Nowell's failure-to-warn claim, because the Court desired to consider whether its decision in\n   <em>\n    Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   applies to the facts as Nowell alleges them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 52:11-15 (Court). The Court stated its inclination to dismiss Nowell's punitive damages claim,\n   because \"it doesn't look like ... there's anything that's pled or even known by the plaintiff at the present time that would support punitive damages,\" but would permit Nowell to reassert it \"[i]f something comes up down the road.\" Tr. at 52:16-22 (Court). The Court similarly dismissed Nowell's manufacturing-defect claim, because it agreed with the Defendants that \"we shouldn't have discovery going to the manufacturing defect\" unless \"something shows up in the discovery of the other claims,\" in which case Nowell \"may be able to move to reinsert the manufacturing defect claim.\" Tr. at 52:22-4 (Court). The Court dissuaded the parties from continuing to work on this case until the Court issues an opinion, \"because I think some claims are going to be dismissed, if not the case.\" Tr. at 53:6-10 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING RULE 12(b)(6)\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Rule 12(b)(6) authorizes a court to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.

In addition to the cost-distribution rationale ... other courts have approved specifically the rationale that imposing strict liability relieves plaintiffs of the burden of proving ordinary negligence under circumstances in which such negligence is likely to be present but difficult to prove.... The third policy cited for the imposition of strict liability is that suppliers who otherwise might not be liable because of a passive role in the chain of supply should be encouraged to select reputable and responsible manufacturers who generally design and construct safe products and who generally accept financial responsibility for injuries caused by their defective products.... Fourth and finally, imposing strict products liability serves the interests of fairness.... The fairness rationale embodies a normative judgment that plaintiffs injured by an unreasonably dangerous product should be compensated for their injuries. At the heart of this judgment lies the conclusion that although the manufacturer has provided a valuable service by supplying the public with a product that it wants or needs, it is more fair that the cost of an unreasonable risk of harm lie with the product and its possibly innocent manufacturer than it is to visit the entire loss upon the often unsuspecting consumer who has relied upon the expertise of the manufacturer when selecting the injury-producing product.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"598\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995-NMSC-043\">\n    1995-NMSC-043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558920\" index=\"599\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/372/\">\n    120 N.M. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1558920\" index=\"600\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/120/372/\">\n    902 P.2d at 57-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   To succeed on a cause of action brought under a theory of strict products liability, a plaintiff must prove five elements: (i) the product was defective; (ii) the product was defective when it left the hands of the defendant and was substantially unchanged when it reached the use or consumer; (iii) the product, because of the defect, was unreasonably dangerous to the use or consumer; (iv) the consumer was injured or was damaged; and (v) the product's defective condition was the proximate cause of the injury or damage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armeanu v.

An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious and damaging consequences when it is injected. Since the disease itself invariably leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding the unavoidable high degree to risk which they involve. Such a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions and\n   warning, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous. The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like, many of which for this very reason cannot legally be sold except to physicians, or under the prescription of a physician. It is also true in particular of many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience, there can be no assurance of safety, or perhaps even of purity of ingredients, but such experience as there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding a medically recognizable risk. The seller of such products, again with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed, and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it, is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended with a known but apparently reasonable risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <em>\n    Hines v.

Comment e to \u00a7 6 of the\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts\n   </em>\n   provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   Warnings and instructions with regard to drugs or medical devices that can be sold legally only pursuant to a prescription are, under the \"learned intermediary\" rule, directed to health-care providers. Subsection (d)(2) recognizes that direct warnings and instructions to patients are warranted for drugs that are dispensed or administered to patients without the personal intervention or evaluation of a health-care provider. An example is the administration of a vaccine in clinics where mass inoculations are performed. In many such programs, health-care providers are not in a position to evaluate the risks attendant upon use of the drug or device or to relate them to patients. When a manufacturer supplies prescription drugs for distribution to patients in this type of unsupervised environment, if a direct\n   warning to patients is feasible and can be effective, the law requires measures to that effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   Although the learned intermediary rule is generally accepted and a drug manufacturer fulfills its legal obligation to warn by providing adequate warnings to the health-care provider, arguments have been advanced that in two other areas courts should consider imposing tort liability on drug manufacturers that fail to provide direct warnings to consumers. In the first, governmental regulatory agencies have mandated that patients be informed of risks attendant to the use of a drug. A noted example is the FDA requirement that birth control pills be sold to patients accompanied by a patient package insert. In the second, manufacturers have advertised a prescription drug and its indicated use in the mass media. Governmental regulations require that, when drugs are so advertised, they must be accompanied by appropriate information concerning risk so as to provide balanced advertising. The question in both instances is whether adequate warnings to the appropriate health-care provider should insulate the manufacturer from tort liability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   Those who assert the need for adequate warnings directly to consumers contend that manufacturers that communicate directly with consumers should not escape liability simply because the decision to prescribe the drug was made by the health-care provider. Proponents of the learned intermediary rule argue that, notwithstanding direct communications to the consumer, drugs cannot be dispensed unless a health-care provider makes an individualized decision that a drug is appropriate for a particular patient, and that it is for the health-care provider to decide which risks are relevant to the particular patient. The Institute leaves to developing case law whether exceptions to the learned intermediary rule in these or other situations should be recognized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   When the content of the warnings is mandated or approved by a governmental agency regulation and a court finds that compliance with such regulation federally preempts tort liability, then no liability under this Section can attach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <em>\n    Restatement (Third) of Torts\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6 cmt. e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     NEW MEXICO LAW REGARDING PUNITIVE DAMAGES\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   \"Punitive damages 'are not compensation for injury.' \"\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.

Furthermore, the discovery rule does not toll the applicable statutes of limitations, because the rule does not apply to warranty claims, and because Nowell had a cognizable tort injury over three years before she\n   filed her negligence and strict-liability claims.

Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 31. This assertion thus indicates that Nowell was aware of a potential problem with the Defendants' mesh seven years before she filed her original Complaint. Nowell further asserts that, at some point during the three years that followed the April, 2011, surgery, she began to experience \"symptoms including but not limited to exhaustion and pain in the area of the mesh.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. These symptoms compelled Nowell to undergo a CT scan on March 1, 2014, which revealed \"cysts in the area associated with the mesh.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 31. That Nowell's symptoms were proximate to the Defendants' mesh and suitably painful to warrant medical attention indicates that she was aware of injury sufficient to start the three years limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Although Nowell concedes that she was skeptical about the mesh's safety before October 8, 2014, she nevertheless\n   asserts that the discovery rule tolls the limitations period, because she relied on Dr. Pollard's opinion that the mesh was not her symptoms' source and therefore did not discover that the Defendants' mesh was causing her injury until October 8, 2014, when Dr. Pollard advised her \"for the first time that there was a problem with the mesh and that it had to be removed.\" MTD Response at 12-13.

Nowell's negligence claim requires her to prove that the Defendants' mesh caused her injuries.

MTD Response at 5-6. The Court does not agree with Nowell. Ignoring conclusory assertions and recitations of legal standards, the Amended Complaint does not allege any facts that plausibly establish a connection between Nowell's injuries and the Defendants' mesh. Paragraphs 22 and 23 describe \"common injuries caused by hernia surgeries,\" and do not reference either Nowell or the Defendants' mesh. Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, at 5. Paragraph 36 asserts that MAUDE\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   reports\n   document \"serious malfunctions\" with the Defendants' mesh, but neither describes the malfunctions nor connects the malfunctions to Nowell. Amended Complaint \u00b6 36, at 5. Paragraph 38 describes Nowell's hernia repair surgeries and subsequent remedial procedures, and asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-287\">\n   On October 8, 2014, in clinic Dr. Powell advised Ms. Nowell that there was no choice but to remove the Parietex mesh and replace it with a biological mesh....

This paragraph does not include facts which infer that the Defendants' mesh caused Nowell's infection. Presumably, Dr. Pollard's purported \"problem\" was that the mesh was \"infected and disintegrated (unincorporated)\"; however, nowhere in this paragraph does Nowell allege facts to suggest that the opposite conclusion,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that infection caused the mesh to disintegrate, is any less likely than her theory. Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Paragraph 39 describes Nowell's injuries but does not suggest a means through which they occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 39, at 9. Paragraph 39 also discusses Nowell's three scientific articles, none of which, the Court concludes, support Nowell's assertion \"that the type of material that was used in Parietex mesh caused infection and disintegration which resulted in pain, exhaustion, and other injuries\" or \"that the type of surgical mesh as Parietex causes similar injuries as those sustained by Ms. Nowell.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 39, at 9-10. Instead, the articles merely highlight underlying risks common to all hernia repair surgeries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.1. For example, the first article, \"Central Failures of Lightweight Monofilament Polyester Mesh Causing Hernia Recurrence: A Cautionary Note,\" examines \"Parietex TCM,\" and its potential for tearing in thirty-six patients but asserts no causal connection to Nowell's main injury, that is, infection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petro et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 155. Moreover, although the authors conclude that Parietex TCM \"appears to have a high incidence of mechanical failure in the context of open incisional hernia repair,\" they add that \"this limitation may ultimately be revealed as a weakness of all lightweight mesh.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petro et al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 155. Additionally, although the second article, \"Postoperative Mesh Infection -- Still a Concern in Laparoscopic Era,\" states that \"the use of synthetic mesh can be complicated by infection,\" it lists a number of factors influencing mesh infection, including smoking, prior infection at the surgical site, and failure to maintain the surgical site's sterility. Narkhede et. al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 324-26. The third article, \"Novel in Vitro Model for Assessing Susceptibility of Synthetic Hernia Repair Meshes to Staphylococcus aureus Infection Using Green Fluorescent Protein-labeled Bacteria and Modern Imaging Techniques,\" studies \"Parietex Composite\" and concludes that \"[a] multifilament woven mesh (PE) had the highest degree of biofilm formation\"; it does not suggest a causal link between a potential defect in the Defendants' mesh and Nowell's injuries. Ihab F. Halaweish et. al.,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 449. None of the articles demonstrate or even suggest that the Defendants' Parietex Composite Mesh caused Nowell's injury, or provide any factual support for Nowell's assertion that these articles prove that defendants' mesh \"causes harmful bacterial infections.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 39, at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Paragraph 40 includes two unsupported conclusions: that the mesh's \"physical\n   structure\" \"caused trauma to Plaintiff's abdomen as it repeatedly came in contact with it,\" and that \"the composition of the mesh itself caused and exacerbated infection since the materials used to construct the mesh were not chemically compatible to the Defendant's tissue.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 40, at 11. Notably, Nowell describes neither the chemical composition that led to the incompatibility nor the mechanism through which the mesh's \"physical structure\" caused trauma. Amended Complaint \u00b6 40, at 11. Paragraph 46 concludes that the Defendants' mesh is \"biologically incompatible with human tissue\" which seems to suggest that all patients thus treated necessarily suffer infection, \"including the plaintiff.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 46, at 12. Paragraph 47 first defines the words \"degradation\" and \"fragmentation,\" and then concludes that \"[t]he Product was unreasonably susceptible to degradation and fragmentation inside the body.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 47, at 12. Paragraph 49 concludes that \"the Product ... did cause, serious medical problems, and in ... the Plaintiff ... catastrophic injuries.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 49, at 12. Paragraph 50 merely asserts that \"the Product ... caused severe and irreversible injuries, conditions, and damage to ... the female Plaintiff named in the Complaint.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 50, at 12-13. Paragraph 51 states: \"Such defects caused the Plaintiff to undergo additional surgeries which otherwise would not have been necessary.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 51, at 13. The Court notes that the word \"cause,\" when included in an allegation, does not provide per se a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, such as an injury. It is a conclusion rather than a factual allegation. Hence, these paragraphs do not suggest that the Defendants' mesh caused Nowell's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   The Court construes only three allegations in the Amended Complaint as representing facts germane to Nowell's negligence claim: (i) that Nowell had a hernia repair surgery using the Defendants' mesh on October 27, 2010; (ii) that six months later, in April, 2011, she had a second surgery to reinforce the mesh; (iii) that, on March 1, 2014, she underwent a CT scan that revealed \"cysts in the area associated with the mesh\"; and (iv) that, on October 20, 2014, she had a third surgery because of an abdominal wall infection, during which her physician removed the mesh from her first surgery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8.

Paragraph 38, which the Court analyzed above, states only that Dr. Pollard \"removed an infected and disintegrated (unincorporated) Parietex mesh from Ms. Nowell's abdomen.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 38, at 8. Nowell provides no further description of the Defendants' mesh, and the mesh's ultimate state of disintegration says nothing about potential defects that existed at the time of Nowell's October, 2010, surgery. Paragraphs 41 and 42 conclude that \"[t]he disintegration and misshapening [sic] and infection of the Parietex Mesh(tm) occurred because the product was unsafe and defective,\" and that the mesh's materials \"were not strong and resilient enough to prevent this disintegration and misshapening [sic],\" but, again, neither paragraph suggests a defect that could have caused the mesh's disintegration. Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, at 11. Paragraph 47, which the Court analyzed above, concludes that Nowell suffered injuries because \"[t]he Product was unreasonably susceptible to degradation and fragmentation inside the body\" based\n   solely on how the FDA defines these terms; it does not describe a defect that could lead to unforeseen degradation and fragmentation. Amended Complaint \u00b6 47, at 12. Paragraph 50 includes a litany of conclusory allegations regarding the mesh's failure rates and tendency to cause injury, but, again, does not present a defect that could lead to the mesh's failure and resultant injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 50, at 12-13. Paragraph 52 purports to detail \"[t]he specific nature of the product's defects,\" but then vaguely asserts only that the mesh's design facilitates bacteria growth on the mesh itself, thereby causing \"immune reactions and subsequent tissue breakdown\"; it does not describe design aspects that could encourage bacterial growth. Amended Complaint \u00b6 52, at 13. Paragraph 52 asserts also that \"[b]iomechanical issues ... including, but not limited to, the propensity of the product to disintegrate inside the body,\" and to cause inflammation, pain, and injury \"when the mesh is implaning [sic] according to the manufacturer's instructions,\" but provides no further insight into these alleged issues. Amended Complaint \u00b6 52, at 13. Finally, Nowell's conclusory allegation that the Defendants' mesh \"deviated materially from the Defendants' design and manufacturing specifications,\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 125, at 29, is merely a \"formulaic recitation of the elements of [the] cause of action\" and lacks the corresponding factual support to suggest how the mesh departed from its intended design,\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

First, the Amended Complaint does not allege facts that, if true, demonstrate that the Defendants did not adequately warn of the mesh's dangers. An adequate warning must disclose the nature and extent of the danger, yet for the Court to evaluate a warning's sufficiency, Nowell must direct the Court to specific statements. Instead, Nowell alleges, for example, that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   Defendants did not provide sufficient or adequate warnings regarding ... [t]he Product's propensities to disintegrate\n   ... degrad[e], fragment[ ], ... and/or creep ... the Product's inelasticity ... the rate and manner of mesh erosion ... the risk of chronic inflammation... chronic infections ... scarring ... recurrent, intractable pain ... [t]he need for corrective or revision surgery ... [t]he hazards associated with the Product [and] ... [the Products defects described herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 30-31. These concerns are too generalized to assist the Court in evaluating the sufficiency of the Defendants' warnings, nor do they plausibly assert that the Defendants were aware of the specific defect and thus could have warned Nowell in such a way that could have prevented her injuries. Indeed, many of the risks that Nowell mentions are precisely the risks that the FDA considers attendant to all hernia repairs surgeries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.1. Moreover, Nowell does not allege that any of the above warnings would have prevented Dr. Pollard from using the Defendants' mesh to repair Nowell's hernia. Although Nowell asserts that the \"Defendants did not adequately warn the Plaintiff,\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 129, at 30, and that her injuries \"would not have occurred if adequate warning and instruction had been provided,\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 138, at 33, the Amended Complaint does not allege that Dr. Pollard was not aware of the risk associated with the Defendants mesh -- risks seemingly attendant to all hernia repair series -- or that Dr. Pollard would have not used the Defendants' mesh had the Defendants provided him with Nowell's proposed warnings. Furthermore, pursuant to the learned-intermediary doctrine, the Defendants' duty to warn extended only to Nowell's treating physicians.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

Again, Nowell has not alleged that the Defendants sold their mesh absent any warning, and the Court will not presume this fact on Nowell's behalf. Because her allegations do not specify a plausible, causal danger about which the Defendants did not warn, one which would have compelled her physician to make a different treatment decision, Nowell's failure-to-warn claim cannot survive a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   Nowell's lean assertions do not sufficiently allege defective design, manufacture, or warning, and she does not support them with facts sufficient to \"nudge[ ] [the] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

Hence, the Court may not draw a \"reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,\" and will neither\n   presume a defect based on the fact that Nowell suffered injury nor conclude that every hernia mesh on the market is defective. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss Nowell's strict liability claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Defendants insist that this statement evidences that Nowell concedes her warranty claims, and assert that Nowell cannot rely on \"vague allegations and the hope that discovery eventually will reveal some basis\" to amend them later. MTD Reply at 10-11. At the hearing, Nowell clarified that her remaining warranty claim is for \"merchantability, ... due to the fact that ... the particular type of mesh that was used was causing injuries, ... and that an implied warranty would extend from the discovery of that injury.\" Tr. at 17:18-25 (Montclare).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   The Court agrees that Nowell has not pled an implied-warranty claim for either fitness or merchantability.

The Court concluded that direct-to-consumer advertising allows for manufacturers to communicate with consumers for the purpose of increasing \"their market share by making their product well known to both patients and physicians,\" and that such communication \"generates a corresponding duty\" that requires manufacturers to directly warn the ultimate users of potential defects or dangers associated with their products.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877018\" index=\"1187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/1174/#p1226\">\n     577 F.Supp.2d at 1219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-372\">\n    Moreover, the Court found that a patient's reliance on a physician's judgment in selecting an appropriate prescription medication had no bearing on whether the manufacturer should provide the patient with an adequate warning from the drug manufacturer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877018\" index=\"1188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/1174/#p1226\">\n     577 F.Supp.2d at 1219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court reasoned that, because a drug does not react exactly the same way in all individuals, physicians must rely on their patients to inform them as to how they are reacting to the prescribed medication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877018\" index=\"1189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/1174/#p1226\">\n     577 F.Supp.2d at 1219\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Court further noted that, because managed care has reduced the amount of time that physicians are able to spend with each patient, physicians have less time to inform patients of a given prescription drug's risks and benefits.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877018\" index=\"1193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/577/1174/#p1226\">\n     577 F.Supp.2d at 1220\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-374\">\n    These justifications for rejecting the learned-intermediary doctrine are not as persuasive in the medical device context. The Defendants in this case did not advertise their hernia mesh directly to consumers. Without direct-to-consumer advertising, the learned-intermediary doctrine's premises rematerialize. For example, lacking an advertising forum, the Defendants here, unlike the defendants in\n    <em>\n     Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Additionally, if patients can no longer rely on advertisements to make medical decisions, they must again depend on their treating physicians as a \"learned intermediary\" to help them determine the appropriate treatment. Such patients cannot, as might be the case for advertised products, \"demand a particular [device] that they saw on television or in a magazine.\"\n    <em>\n     State ex rel.

Finally, while direct-to-consumer advertising might put the onus on patients to select a treatment product, physicians necessarily become involved in this decision when they alone have access to advertising materials.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-375\">\n    Because, therefore,\n    <em>\n     Rimbert v.

Indeed, one federal court has stated that \"it makes even more sense to apply the doctrine in the context of medical devices.\"\n    <em>\n     Beale v.

Furthermore, Judge Gold opines that the physician plays a larger role in discussing the risks and benefits of implant surgery than he or she might have in discussing a routinely prescribed drug.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Beale v.

Thus, the physician's opportunity to warn the patient is much greater than that of the device manufacturer. The Court has not found any case that does not apply the learned-intermediary doctrine to medical devices, and the Court does not think that the Supreme Court of New Mexico would be the sole entity to refuse to apply the learned-intermediary doctrine to such products.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-376\">\n    The Defendants' mesh is analogous to the medical device that Judge Gold considered in\n    <em>\n     Beale v. Biomet, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848396\" index=\"1201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/492/1360/#p1368\">\n     492 F.Supp.2d at 1368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , because patients cannot obtain Defendants' mesh except through an invasive medical procedure that a surgeon performs,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    MTD at 16-17. Additionally, because the patient is under anesthesia during hernia repair surgery, the patient and her physician must thoroughly discuss the potential risks and benefits before the implantation. These factors are not present when a physician prescribes a routine drug. Hence, not only is the rationale for adopting the learned-intermediary doctrine more persuasive absent end-consumer advertising, but it becomes compelling when the product is a medical device rather than a drug. This case lies at the intersection of that reasoning. The Defendants market their medical device directly to physicians rather than to patients and are therefore not subject to the Court's analysis in\n    <em>\n     Rimbert v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n    </em>\n    As a result, the learned-intermediary doctrine applies to Nowell's failure-to-warn claims. Accordingly, the Defendants had a duty to warn only Nowell's treating physicians of the hernia mesh's risks. Argument that the Defendants owed or breached a duty to warn Nowell directly is therefore irrelevant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-377\">\n    In reaching its conclusion that the learned-intermediary doctrine would apply to surgically-implanted medical devices in New Mexico, wide-spread national recognition of the doctrine's value encourages the Court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Headcount: Who's Adopted the Learned Intermediary Rule?\n    </em>\n    , Drug and Device Law, https://www.druganddevicelawblog.com/2007/07/headcount-whos-adopted-learned.html (last visited March 17, 2019)(collecting cases and statutes, and noting that \"all 50 states and two other jurisdictions ... have precedent supportive of the learned intermediary rule\").

Such criticism and commentary buttress the Court's willingness to accept the learned-intermediary doctrine where, as here, direct-to-consumer marketing is not factor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-380\">\n    When the Court was in private practice, and doing plaintiff cases, it would, in more complex cases like this one, hire an expert witness before filing a complaint. For example, before filing a medical malpractice case against a hospital, the Court would hire its expert medical doctor, to help it put its complaint and case together. Also, even when the Court was on the defense, one of the first things it would do when retained was hire an expert, such as an accountant, to help testify to substance and on damages. Sometimes the Court was trying to beat the plaintiff to a particularly good witness, especially a local one, but it was more often or also to educate the Court how to try the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-381\">\n    There is nothing in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that requires a plaintiff, or his or her attorney, to hire an attorney to help the plaintiff and court to prepare the case and draft the complaint. A federal court also should not create a judge-made requirement that a plaintiff has to have an expert before filing a federal case. On the other hand, the reality is that, in a products-liability case and in other cases, the plaintiff may have to hire an attorney to help counsel to research and allege the defect, to research and allege safe alternatives, to research and allege causation, and to exclude other possible causes.\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly\n    </em>\n    are screening devices, and plaintiffs' counsel are going to have to up their game to avoid these new hurdles to bringing federal cases.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-382\">\n    In the end, the Amended Complaint does no more than say that Nowell had a mesh implant, and, years later, had an infection. It is clear that Nowell believes that theDefendants' mesh caused the infection, but she fails to include enough facts to move her belief across the line to plausibility. There are many sources of infection, so the Amended Complaint needs a more robust allegation of the facts. Here, Nowell has not moved the needle across the line. More is required about the defect, alternative, and causation than Nowell provides.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-383\">\n    It is possible that this pleading would survive under New Mexico procedural law. New Mexico substantive law certainly controls the federal court's requirement of each claim's essential elements.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. PepsiCo, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618089\" index=\"1214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/431/1241/#p1255\">\n     431 F.3d 1241\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1255 (10th Cir. 2005). Federal law, however, governs whether Nowell has pled those elements sufficiently.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Racher v. Westlake Nursing Home Ltd. P'ship\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266459\" index=\"1215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1152/#p1162\">\n     871 F.3d 1152\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1162 (10th Cir. 2017). Thus, the\n    <em>\n     Ashcroft v. Iqbal\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
