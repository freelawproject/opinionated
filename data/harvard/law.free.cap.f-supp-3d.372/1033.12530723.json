Golub, a former shareholder of Gigamon Inc. (\"Gigamon\"), brings suit individually and on behalf of a putative class of shareholders against the company, Gigamon Chief Executive Officer Paul A. Hooper, Gigamon's directors (collectively, these related parties are the \"Gigamon Defendants\"), and the Elliott Defendants arising from the allegedly materially false and misleading proxy statement issued in relation to Elliott's acquisition of Gigamon (the \"Acquisition\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consolidated Complaint (\"Compl.\") at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 18 [Dkt No. 56]. Golub alleges that the proxy statement misled shareholders into voting to approve the Acquisition at an unfair price per share, violating \u00a7 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 14a-9.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. The defendants move to dismiss because the allegedly false and misleading portions of the proxy statement are subject to a statutory safe harbor and are not objectively false. I agree and\n   grant defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. GIGAMON'S OUTLOOK PRIOR TO ACQUISITION DISCUSSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gigamon provides traffic visibility solutions that enable companies to see data traversing networks, enabling stronger security and enhancing network performance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 49. Gigamon's business model was successful at converting initial customers into repeat customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Throughout 2017, it had more than two times the market share of revenue than its next closest competitor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2. Prior to the Acquisition, Gigamon announced that it was partnering with the three largest cloud-based providers and that this would dramatically expand its potential customer base.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In early 2017, Gigamon pre-released its preliminary Q4 2016 results, showing only 27% growth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57. Despite underperforming analyst expectations, 2016 was still Gigamon's second consecutive year of 40% growth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. At a February 2, 2017 conference call, Hooper stated that the company expected Q2 2017 to create a glide path to the back half of the year that would still allow Gigamon to achieve a growth rate in the 20%-25% range.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59-61. On April 27, 2017, Gigamon announced that the company recorded $ 2.2 million loss for Q1 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. It attributed the swing from the previous year's net income of $ 2.9 million to an uptick in spending on research and development, sales, and marketing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this drop, Hooper continued to express confidence in the fundamentals of the business and that interest in upcoming products would allow Gigamon to meet its end of the year growth targets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 65-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ELLIOTT AND POTENTIAL BUYERS BEGIN TO COURT GIGAMON\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 14, 2017, an entity referred to in the Proxy Statement as \"Party A\" expressed interest in acquiring Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 71. Hooper informed Party A that Gigamon was not for sale and asked Party A to refrain from submitting an acquisition proposal until he was able to discuss the matter with Gigamon's Board of Directors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On April 25, 2017, the Board and Gigamon's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs, met to discuss Party A's offer and determined to take no action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 9, 2017, roughly a week before Party A approached Gigamon, Elliott began purchasing Gigamon stock for between $ 30.88 and $ 36.30 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70. At this point, Elliott's acquisition of Gigamon stock was not yet public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On May 8, 2017, a few weeks after Gigamon's Board decided to take no action as to Party A, an Elliott representative contacted Hooper to inform him that Elliott would be disclosing that it had accumulated an equity stake in Gigamon and that it would seek to discuss strategic options, including a potential sale of Gigamon via a going-private transaction in which Elliott might participate as a buyer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 72. Although the Elliott representative stated that Elliott would not make any public statements beyond information in its Schedule 13D disclosure, Gigamon regarded Elliott as an aggressive activist investor and feared a public fight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that day, Elliott filed its Schedule 13D disclosing that it had acquired a 15.3% stake in\n   Gigamon and that it believed the stock was \"significantly undervalued and represent[ed] an attractive investment opportunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73. On that day, Gigamon's common stock closed at $ 41.20, up from the previous day's closing price of $ 35. A few days later, an entity referred to in the Proxy Statement as Party B also expressed interest in acquiring Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 12, 2017, Gigamon's Board and Goldman Sachs met to discuss Elliott's outreach.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77. The next day, Gigamon met with Elliott representatives who stated that, in their view, Gigamon was ill-suited to be a public company, that the Board should initiate a sales process, and that Elliott was interested in being the buyer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79. On May 14, 2017, the Board met again and decided to defer a formal sales process until Gigamon released its Q2 2017 results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80. The Board met again on May 22, 2017, and Chief Financial Officer Rex S. Jackson stated that work was underway to prepare management's long-term financial projections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81. At some point in the following weeks Elliott again reached out to reiterate its interest in buying Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82. During this same time period, Hooper spoke with a representative of Party A to update it on issues raised by Elliott's 13D filling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Elliott reiterated its interest throughout June.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Jackson presented three scenarios of management's long-term financial projections: a base-case stand-alone business plan (\"Case B\"), an upside case (\"Case A\"), and a downside case (\"Case C\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83. A few days later, on June 2, 2017, Reuters reported that Gigamon was preparing to hold talks with potential acquirers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84. After two trading days, on June 5, 2017, Gigamon's stock price rose 9%, closing at $ 42.85 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On June 6, 2017, the Board met again to discuss management's projections and instructed Goldman Sachs to focus on Case B when conducting its financial analysis of Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE START OF ACQUISITION DISCUSSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 2, 2017, the Board met to discuss Gigamon's preliminary Q2 2017 results and decided to initiate sale of the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88. Later that day, Hooper contacted an Elliott representative to invite Elliott to participate in an exploratory sale process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89. Goldman Sachs, at the Board's behest, also began to contact various potential buyers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Gigamon eventually entered into confidentiality agreements with certain parties and management met with a handful of potential buyers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board also established a Transaction Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In public statements on July 27, 2018 and August 8, 2017, Hooper and Jackson stated that Gigamon was continuing to have success with its new products and expressed optimism that the company would hit its year end growth.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 91-95, 99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Gigamon received indications of interest from Elliott, Party A, and Party B to acquire Gigamon for a price range of $ 44 to 46 per share, $ 42 to $ 43 per share, and $ 40 to $ 41 per\n   share respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. Based on Party B's low bid, the Board instructed Goldman Sachs to terminate discussions with Party B.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board also instructed Goldman Sachs to inform Elliott and Party A that their offers were inadequate and needed to be increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Throughout August, Elliott met with members with Gigamon's management and conducted extensive due diligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Party A met once with Hooper and conducted less due diligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On August 31, 2017, the Board met again to discuss the status of the sale process and observed that only Elliott was actively exploring a purchase of Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101. Since there were not likely to be multiple potential buyers, the Board noted that Goldman Sachs's fairness opinion on any eventual deal price would rely on having financial projections that yielded a range of values encompassing the eventual deal price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On September 7, 2017, an Elliott representative contacted director Kispert, who was not a member of the Transaction Committee, to \"better understand the Board's expectations on value.\" Kispert told Elliott to \"stretch on price.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102. The next day, Elliott offered to buy Gigamon for $ 42 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 103. Party A did not submit a revised bid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On September 10, 2017, the Transaction Committee met with Goldman Sachs to discuss the sale process, the status of the company's business, and the preliminary financial analysis, focusing on Case B.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 104. The Board concluded that if Gigamon achieved its Q3 2017 and full year 2017 targets, it should be valued higher than Elliott's latest offer price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board instructed Goldman Sachs to reject Elliott's offer without providing a counteroffer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goldman Sachs conveyed the Board's rejection to Elliott that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board also decided not to contact any other third parties to seek a strategic transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. NEGOTIATIONS WITH ELLIOTT AND Q3 2017 RESULTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Three weeks later, on September 21, 2017, the Board met with management and Goldman Sachs regarding the status of discussions with Elliott and the company's business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107. Hooper continued to express optimism regarding the company's Q3 2017 results but also noted signs of softening.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goldman Sachs indicated that Elliott was unlikely to improve its offer without greater visibility into the Q3 2017 results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board agreed it would be prepared to accept Elliott's latest offer price of $ 42.50 per share but instructed Goldman Sachs to seek a higher price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Goldman Sachs informed Elliott of the Board's decision, but Elliott stated that its debt financing commitments had expired and that its lenders would want to see Gigamon's Q3 2017 results before renewing their commitments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 24, 2017, the Board concluded that $ 42.50 per share was likely a premium to where Gigamon's stock would trade if it announced lower-than-expected Q3 2017 results and did not simultaneously announce a sale (after much speculation that a sale was imminent) and determined that $ 42.50 would be acceptable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108. This price fell at the lower end of the Case B Projections, which estimated Gigamon's value at between $ 42 and $ 56 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Over the next several days, Goldman Sachs informed Elliott that the Board had determined that the $ 42.50 per share offer price was acceptable pending an agreement on other transaction terms and management met with Elliott representatives and Goldman Sachs to discuss expected Q3 2017 results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 109-110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Shortly after, the Q3 2017 results became available internally. They were significantly\n   lower than anticipated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111. Revenue fell $ 5.5 million below Wall Street analysts' consensus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With the Transaction Committee's approval, Goldman Sachs met with Elliott to discuss the Q3 2017 results.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 4, 2017, the Transaction Committee met to discuss the status of discussions with Elliott.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112. Goldman Sachs relayed that Elliott representatives were very surprised by the magnitude of Gigamon's third quarter revenue miss and were purportedly having difficulty securing debt commitments on similar terms as before.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Management also reported that Reuters was planning to run another article stating that Elliott was terminating acquisition discussions because the Board's price expectation was too high.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Transaction Committee discussed the potential need to revisit Gigamon's long-term financial projections.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The next day, on October 5, 2017, Elliott reduced its bid to $ 38 per share based solely on the Q3 2017 financial results, not over concerns over its long-term value.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 113. Later that day, the Board, management, and Goldman Sachs met to discuss Elliott's revised offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 114. They \"recognized that earlier valuation ranges for the Company, which had been based on the Case B projections, were materially higher than Elliott's then current offer price\" and \"could no longer be relied upon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On October 14, 2017, the Board met to discuss the status of discussions with Elliott and Gigamon's purported outlook.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 117. Jackson provided an updated draft set of Case B Projections that included the actual results of Q2 and Q3 2017 but did not otherwise change the long-term growth assumptions for Gigamon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The refreshed Case B Projections were not disclosed in the Proxy Statement or any proxy supplements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Board discussed abandoning the company's long-term financial projections but declined to do so while in negotiations with Elliott, recognizing that would be \"impracticable and inadvisable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 118. The Board agreed that Elliott's $ 38 per share offer would still need to be improved to fall within the range indicated by the refreshed Case B Projections to be acceptable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 19, 2017, Elliott increased its offer to $ 38.50 per share, which it called its \"absolute best and final offer[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119. On October 20, 2017, the Transaction Committee met with management and Goldman Sachs to discuss Elliott's offer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 120. The Transaction Committee decided that \"the Case B Projections were no longer appropriate given recent performance and third quarter results.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 24, 2017, the Board met to discuss the status of the transaction, determined that the offer of $ 38.50 was acceptable, and \"authorized management to instruct representatives of Goldman Sachs to use and rely on the Case C Projections in their financial analysis of Gigamon for purposes of the proposed transaction and rendering its fairness opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On October 26, 2017, Goldman Sachs presented financial analyses to the Board based on the Updated Case C Projections; it stated that Elliott's $ 38.50 per share offer was fair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 123. After Goldman Sachs completed its presentation, the Board formally approved Gigamon's entry into the Merger Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later that day, Gigamon announced its agreement to be acquired by Elliott for $ 38.50 per share.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    V. THE PROXY STATEMENT AND GOLUB'S CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 23, 2017, Gigamon filed the Proxy Statement recommending that\n   Gigamon's shareholders vote \"FOR\" the adoption of the Merger Agreement and sent two notices urging shareholders to vote on December 4 and 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 126, 128; Proxy Statement [Dkt. No. 69-2]. On December 12, 2017, Gigamon issued a Proxy Supplement updating the background to the Merger and Fairness Opinion sections of the proxy. Compl. at \u00b6 126. On December 22, 2017, a majority of Gigamon shares were cast in favor of the Acquisition. Compl. at \u00b6 126. The Acquisition closed on or about December 27, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Golub alleges that the Proxy Statement omitted and/or misrepresented material information about Gigamon's intrinsic value that made it more likely shareholders would be misled into voting in favor of the Acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 128-129. Golub contends that because the deal was described as fair based upon the Updated Case C Projections prepared by management and Goldman Sachs's fairness opinion exclusively relied on the Updated Case C Projections, shareholders were misled about the long term value of the company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 128-129. Instead, Golub argues, the Gigamon Defendants should have disclosed the refreshed or Updated Case B Projections or used the refreshed or Updated Case B Projections as the basis for the fairness opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Only with this disclosure would shareholders be able to make an informed decision whether $ 38.50 per share was actually \"fair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Golub also alleges that portions of the Proxy Statement that discuss how and why the Board chose to rely on the Updated Case C projections rather than the Case B Projections were false in order to hide an attempt by the Board to find a way to ensure that Elliott's offer price of $ 38.50 per share could be declared fair.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 130-131. He claims that the Board knew that the Updated Case B Projections accurately reflected Gigamon's long-term prospects because: Gigamon had consistently met or exceeded management's projections; management had consistently touted the company's success and reliable growth and publicly expressed zero doubts; other analysts relying on Gigamon's public statements valued Gigamon between $ 42-$ 50 per share; the Board only directed Goldman Sachs to use the Updated Case C Projections two days before entering into the Merger Agreement to give the illusion that the Acquisition was \"fair\"; and, when the Proxy Statement and Proxy Supplement were disseminated to shareholders, Gigamon Defendants were aware that the company was on-track to have a record close to 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 131. Golub believes that the Proxy Statement should have disclosed Updated Case A, Updated Case B, and refreshed Case B Projections, along with a description of how Gigamon's new products were treated in preparing the Updated Case C Projection.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Golub brings two claims. His first claim is against the Gigamon Defendants for violations of \u00a7 14(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 14a-9 for preparing, reviewing, and/or disseminating the false and misleading Proxy Statement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 149-156. His second claim is for control person liability under \u00a7 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 against Hooper, the Director Defendants, and the Elliott Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 157-160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In connection with their motion to dismiss, the Gigamon Defendants seek judicial notice of seventeen documents, including the Proxy Statement, Gigamon's press releases, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") filings, and transcripts of earnings calls. Gigamon Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice and Incorporation by Reference in Support of Motion to Dismiss Consolidated Complaint. [Dkt. No. 70].

However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Management Projections not to be achieved include general economic conditions, Gigamon's ability to achieve forecasted sales, accuracy of certain accounting assumptions, changes in actual or projected cash flows, competitive pressures and changes in tax laws. In addition, the Management Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do not give effect to the Merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Management Projections will be realized, and actual results may be materially better or worse than those contained in the Management Projections.

Compl. at \u00b6 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This argument fails for several reasons. First, holding a minority share of a company does not establish control person liability.

Cal. Sept. 29, 2000) (20% equity interest insufficient to establish control). Second, the clause in Article V of the Merger Agreement is boilerplate language that is insufficient to give the Elliott Defendants control over Gigamon. Third, by its own terms, the Merger Agreement only required Gigamon to allow the Elliott Defendants to view and comment on the Proxy Statement before publication. The Elliott Defendants had no power to prevent Gigamon from publishing the Proxy Statement after review, nor to force Gigamon to accept or consider any of the Elliott Defendant's comments. Fourth, the Elliott Defendant's access to Gigamon's assets, properties, books and records, and personnel did not grant it control over those things.\n   <em>\n    In re Parmalat Sec.

Further, Golub is unable to show that the challenged portions of the Proxy Statement are objectively false. Because Golub is unable to state a claim for a primary violation under Section 14(a) and Rule 14a-9, his Section 20(a) claim necessarily fails as well, and I grant the Gigamon Defendant's motion to dismiss.
