Stephen Haynes (\"Haynes\") and Haynes Investments, LLC. (collectively, \"Haynes defendants\") liable for their direct involvement in internet loan businesses that allegedly used Native American tribes to avoid state usury laws. Currently before me are three motions brought by the Haynes defendants: to compel arbitration of the named plaintiffs' claims; to stay in light of a case with some overlap pending in the District Court of Vermont; and to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over the Haynes defendants and for failure to state a claim. I DENY each motion. The Plain Green and GPL arbitration agreements are unenforceable because they are prospective waivers of plaintiffs' rights and remedies. A stay is not warranted because there is not significant overlap between this case and the\n   <em>\n    Gingras\n   </em>\n   case and equity does not support it. There is an adequate basis to assert personal jurisdiction over the Haynes defendants and plaintiffs have sufficiently stated their claims. Consistent with the analyses of numerous courts who have addressed similar arguments, I will allow plaintiffs' claims to proceed in this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Haynes Investments is a private equity firm, owned and managed by Haynes. Complaint (\"Compl\") \u00b6 5 [Dkt. No. 1]. Plaintiffs allege that the Haynes defendants participated in a \"rent-a-tribe\" loan scheme involving Plain Green Lending, LLC, owned by the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation (\"Chippewa Cree Tribe\") in Montana, and Great Plains Lending, LLC (\"GPL\"), a tribal entity owned by the Otoe-Missouria tribe (collectively the \"Tribes\"),\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, The Haynes defendants, along with other parties, allegedly helped design, fluid, and run this \"rent-a-tribe\" scheme using the two \"Native American tribal entities as the conduit to ostensibly cloak the loans in tribal sovereign immunity ... established with the intent of evading state usury laws,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2. Under the scheme, the Tribal Entities - Plain Green and GPL - marketed, offered, issued, and then collected on high-interest loans over the internet, and thereby avoided interest-rate caps imposed under California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The inception of the scheme started in early 2011, when Haynes signed an agreement between Haynes Investments, the Chippewa Cree Tribe in Montana, Think Finance\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Think\"), and Victory Park Capital Advisors, LLC for the creation of a lending institution wholly owned by the Chippewa Cree Tribe, Plain Green, LLC. Term Sheet for Think Finance-Chippewa Cree Transaction (\"Term Sheet\") [Dkt. No. 1-2]. Haynes Investments agreed to provide the initial funds for the creation of Plain Green and to fund loans issued by Plain Green.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Haynes Investment\n   provided ongoing funding for Plain Green loans via Think. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51. Plaintiffs specifically allege that \"Haynes Investment increased its investment in Plain Green on multiple occasions from April 2011 through February 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86. The Haynes defendants are not alleged to have funded loans for GPL - which is alleged to have had the same essential structure and purpose as Plain Green - but instead are alleged to have provided consulting services, including as mentioned above, securing necessary ACH processors and other services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62, 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   With respect to both Plain Green and GPL, Haynes \"played an integral role in helping the [scheme] obtain a bank willing to process payments through the Automated Clearing House Network ... an electronic payment processing system regulated by the National Automated Clearing House Association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. In addition, Haynes \"played a critical role in finding a new bank to partner with Plain Green and [GPL]\" once the original partnering banks were targeted by state and federal regulators and ceased processing the debits and credits on Plain Green's and GPL's loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95, 96.

The Agreements Do Not Expressly Invoke Federal Law and, Instead, Disclaim It\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The Haynes defendants argue that the arbitration agreements do not constitute prospective waivers because, unlike the agreements considered in\n    <em>\n     Dillon\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    , the agreements \"expressly invoke the application of federal law.\" MTC 20. In\n    <em>\n     Hayes v. Delbert Servs. Corp\n    </em>\n    , the terms of the loan agreements stated that the agreements were \"subject solely to the exclusive laws and jurisdiction of the [tribe]\" and that \"no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this loan or Agreement.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4081072\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/666/\">\n     811 F.3d 666\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 669 (4th Cir. 2016). The agreement in\n    <em>\n     Dillon v. BMO Harris, N.A.\n    </em>\n    contained similar language, asserting sole and exclusive tribal jurisdiction and that \"no other state or federal law or regulation shall apply to this Agreement, its enforcement or interpretation.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276749\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/330/\">\n     856 F.3d 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 333 (4th Cir. 2017).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The choice-of-law provisions of the loan agreements at issue here contain some different language from that in\n    <em>\n     Hayes\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Dillon.\n    </em>\n    Defendants point to the following difference. First, neither choice-of-law provision\n    contains language that the tribe or the agreements are subject to the sole jurisdiction of tribal law or that no federal law applies. Instead, the GPL loan agreement \"is governed by Tribal Law and such federal law as is applicable under the Indian Commerce Clause\" and the Plain Green loan agreement states that the \"Agreement to Arbitrate also comprehends the application of the Federal Arbitration Act....\" GPL Agreement 6; Plain Green Agreement 15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Second, both loan agreements state that \"[the lender] may choose to voluntarily use certain federal laws as guidelines for the provisions of services,\" GPL Agreement 6; Plain Green Agreement 15. Regarding the GPL loan agreement, the defendants point to an Otoe-Missouria ordinance that ostensibly requires licensed consumer financial services entities to abide by \"all applicable federal and Tribal consumer protection law....\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    As to the Plain Green loan agreement, defendants reply on an excerpt of the Chippewa Cree code posted on the Plain Green website providing that licensed financial services may not violate \"any applicable Federal Consumer Protection Laws ....\" Chippewa Code \u00a7 10-4-108(c).\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because these provisions provide a possibility that federal law will be applied to the Agreements, defendants argue that they do not prospectively waive plaintiffs' statutory rights and remedies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Those differences in language do not alter the ultimate effect of the choice-of-law provisions. Under the choice-of-law provision for both the GPL and Plain Green loan agreements, the lender \"may choose to voluntarily use certain federal laws as guidelines,\" but \"such voluntary does not represent acquiescence of the [tribe] to any federal law unless found expressly applicable to the operations of the [tribe].\" GPL Agreement 6; Plain Green Agreement 15. The defendants do not identify what federal law would be applicable. Nor do they explain how the arbitrator would apply that law, given that the other more express terms of the agreements that prohibit them from doing so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants also argue that the reference to the Indian Commerce Clause in the GPL loan agreement clearly invokes federal law. MTC 20. The actual language states that the Loan Agreement is governed by \"such federal law as is applicable under the Indian Commerce Clause.\" GPL Agreement 6. Inclusion of the Indian Commerce Clause amounts to \"invocation of an irrelevant constitutional provision.\"\n    <em>\n     Jackson v.

Therefore, the defendants assert, the choice-of-law provisions cannot be applied to the arbitration clause to show that the arbitration agreement is a prospective waiver. However, the holding in\n    <em>\n     Mastrobuono\n    </em>\n    was specific to the case at hand, in which there was an issue of harmonizing the choice-of-law provision with the arbitration agreement.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1214-15. There, the parties chose New York law, which prevented arbitrators from awarding punitive damages, but the arbitration agreement contained implied expectations that the arbitrator would be able to award punitive damages.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1214-15, 1218. Here, there is no tension to harmonize between the choice-of-law provision and the arbitration agreement because they seek the same thing-exclusive application of tribal law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     3. The Choice-of-Law Provisions Unambiguously Waive Statutory Rights and Remedies\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Next, the Haynes defendants characterize the choice-of-law provisions as presumptively valid under federal precedent because plaintiffs have not shown that there is more than a \"mere risk\" that these provisions will prospectively waive plaintiffs' statutory rights and remedies.

This is distinguishable at least insofar as there, the second-filed suit omitted a party that was present in the first suit, whereas here the plaintiffs add Haynes individually in order to pursue a theory that he was personally involved and personally liable for his conduct with respect to services provided to both Plain Green and GPL. The\n    <em>\n     Kohn\n    </em>\n    court's conclusion that a plaintiff could not \"skirt the first-to-file rule merely by omitting one party from a second lawsuit\" is not applicable here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    There is undoubtedly some overlap between the parties in the two cases, but that overlap is not so significant as to mandate a stay here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    <strong>\n     D.

MTD (Dkt. No. 86) at 4-8. The Haynes defendants argue generally that the only acts complained of are acts by others; namely the acts taken by the Native American lenders (Plain Green and GPL) who made and collected on the loans and service providers, such as Think Finance, who were controlling the lenders.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    To the contrary, the Complaint makes numerous allegations - which are uncontested - about the Haynes defendants being responsible for the inception, direction, initial funding, operations (at least with respect to arranging for critical components of the loan process), and ongoing consulting necessary to the continued operation of the loan process. Those allegations include, with respect to the company: (1) Haynes Investments provided the initial capital to fund the operations of Plain Green-it has claimed its \"Native American investments have successfully monetized the tribal advantages of sovereignty to enhance yield while substantially reducing risk,\" Compl. \u00b6 18; (2) Haynes Investments \"provided substantial capital used to make high interest loans to consumers and participated in the affairs of the enterprise,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 5; (3) Haynes Investments agreed to \"provide funding to the Tribe to enable it to make each of the Loans\" and to fund Plain Green's bank account with \"sufficient monies to fund one business day of Loans based upon the average Loan volumes for the preceding month,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 50; (4) Haynes Investments provided funds to Think Finance which could only be used to fund loans originated in the name of Plain Green,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51;\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    (5) Haynes Investments\n    then received back 99% of the funds they provided but also 5% interest on the money loaned to the Tribe, and 1% of the revenue collected on the loans as a \"referral\" fee,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53; and, (6) due to the lucrative returns, Haynes Investments \"increased its investment in Plain Green on multiple occasions from April 2011 through February 2015, resulting in substantial returns to Haynes Investments and Mr. Haynes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 86.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    As to Haynes personally, plaintiffs plead that: (1) he participated in the loan enterprise and signed each of the agreements used to fund the illegal loans,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 19; (2) he personally made \"the decision to invest and reinvest in the enterprise\" and \"actively participated in the affairs of the enterprise and helped design the financial and operational structure of the rent-a-tribe scheme,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 5; (3) \"Haynes used his connections to assist the enterprise's efforts to collect unlawful debt,\" by helping the enterprise obtain a bank willing to process payments through the Automated Clearing House Network (the \"ACH Network\"), an electronic payment processing system regulated by the National Automated Clearing House Association (\"NACHA\"),\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 88; (4) after Plain Green and GPL were targeted by state and federal regulators (and banks ceased processing the debits and credits on their loans), \"Haynes played a critical role in finding a new bank to partner with Plain Green and Great Plains,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 96-97; and, (5) \"based on his rapport with the Tribes through prior transactions, Mr. Haynes also acted as the liaison between Think Finance and the Tribes.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 98.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The discovery plaintiffs have confirms that: (1) Haynes took credit for connecting Think Finance to the Chippewa Cree; (2) that the Haynes defendants agreed to provide \"ongoing consulting services\" defined as services \"in connection with implementing and operating the\" loan processes; (3) Haynes reviewed a recommended tribal code forwarded by Think Finance; (4) the Haynes defendants assisted the Chippewa Cree tribe with the purchase of the Plain Green website; (5) Haynes Investments funded 100% of all Plain Green loans; (6) Haynes actively helped secure ACH processors for the lending process in 2013 and 2014, as well as debit/credit card processors; (7) and Haynes was intimately involved with creating the \"complete business ready package\" to enable tribes to carry out the scheme.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MTD Oppo. (Dkt. No. 111-4) at 4-6.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    As to loans allegedly \"funded\" (or more perhaps more aptly, \"enabled\") by the Haynes defendants in California, plaintiffs do not rely on any hard figures showing how many California loans were funded by Plain Green and GPL during the relevant time period. That is presumably because that information has been marked confidential by non-party Think Finance. Instead, using figures from a similar lawsuit, plaintiffs assert that the Haynes defendants can be assumed to have funded or enabled the funding of loans in California far in excess of the $ 22 million dollars of loans they funded in the much-less populous state of Virginia, MTD Oppo. 4, n.2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    These allegations, as supplemented by the evidence, are adequate to make a prima facie case for exercising personal jurisdiction over the Haynes defendants, who are alleged to be responsible for the creation and implementation of the allegedly fraudulent and illegal scheme as well as funders of millions of dollars in loans in California. These allegations suffice to make a prima facie showing of \"intentional acts\" \"expressly aimed\" at California sufficient to establish both the \"purposeful direction\" and \"purposeful availment\" tests for specific jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Given the size and commercial value of the California market, plaintiffs assert that defendants cannot claim ignorance that their loans would be secured by California consumers. The exercise of jurisdiction over the Haynes defendants is reasonable in light of the Haynes' defendants' alleged immense profit from loans secured by California consumers, California's significant interest in having its usury rates applied to California consumers, the miniscule burden to defendants of litigating here, and that the only other law defendants contend applies to this dispute (tribal law) is a sham attempt to avoid state usury laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Absent\n    <em>\n     evidence\n    </em>\n    to the contrary produced by Haynes defendants, I find plaintiffs' allegations sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction in California over the Haynes defendants. The personal role of Haynes and the corporate role of Haynes Investments in the scheme are alleged in detail. While the specific connection of those intentional acts to California is weaker, given that defendants have come forward with no evidence regarding the actual number of loans generated by Plain Green or GPL in. California, and the apparently reliable source (discovery in another case regarding loans in Virginia) for plaintiffs' unrebutted estimate (far in excess of $ 22 million in loans), there is a basis to find that the Haynes defendants both directed their activities to California and purposefully availed themselves of the large market for loans in California. The purpose of the loan schemes allegedly orchestrated by the Haynes defendants and others was to avoid usury laws, like California's, in order to make more money off of consumer loans, like the ones secured by Brice, Browne, and Novorot.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    As to the third prong of the specific jurisdiction test, the Haynes defendants argue it would be unreasonable to exercise jurisdiction over them in California because the making and direct funding of the loans in California were not undertaken by the Haynes defendants and Texas, where the Haynes defendants are located, is more convenient for them and not inconvenient to plaintiffs, as plaintiff Browne instituted an adversary proceeding against Think Finance in Texas mere months before filing this suit. However, the interests of California in protecting low income consumers (as plaintiffs assert they are) and in applying its usury laws far outweigh the interests of Texas as the residence of the defendants. It is not unreasonable to require defendants to litigate this case here.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    For the forgoing reasons, I DENY the Haynes defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    <strong>\n     C. Failure to State a Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Haynes defendants also move to dismiss for failure to state a claim. They assert that tribal law applies (undermining both the asserted state law claims as well as the RICO claim) and that plaintiffs have failed to state their RICO, usury, and unjust enrichment claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Choice of Law\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    The Haynes defendants argue that the choice-of-law provisions in the Plain Green and GPL loan contacts govern, meaning that tribal law must be applied to plaintiffs' claims. Under that theory, the Haynes defendants contend that the California usury and unjust enrichment claims cannot be stated and the RICO claim fails because the interest rate charged by the tribes was not \"at least\n    twice the enforceable rate\" permitted under the laws of the tribes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201961\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (6) (defining an \"unlawful debt\" under RICO).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    Plaintiffs raise several good reasons why the tribal choice-of-law provisions should not be enforced. First, similar to the arguments made in opposing the motion to compel arbitration, plaintiffs assert that the choice-of-law provisions mandating tribal law effectively deprive plaintiffs of their statutory rights and remedies and are therefore unenforceable. In support, plaintiffs rely on numerous decisions from other circuits and district courts interpreting internet loan agreements with materially similar language requiring application of tribal law and concluding - mostly in the context of holding the arbitration agreements unenforceable\n    <em>\n     because\n    </em>\n    the choice-of-law provisions were unacceptable prospective waivers - that the tribal choice-of-law provisions are an impermissible prospective waiver,\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dillon v.

While defendants argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege a \"connection\" between the funds the Haynes defendants received from the scheme (the enterprise) to the funds that the Haynes defendants invested in the enterprise, this hinges in large part on the Haynes defendants' contention that they were not the ones that collected the unlawful debts. However, plaintiffs' allegations regarding the structure of profits from the scheme paid to the Hayes defendants, plus allegations that the Haynes defendants reinvested in the scheme as late as 2013, is sufficient at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    <strong>\n     ii. Section 1962(b)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Section 1962(b) prohibits \"any person through a pattern of racketeering activity ... to acquire ... control of any enterprise\" engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.

The Haynes defendants argue that because there are no allegations that the Haynes defendants, personally, collected the illegal debts or otherwise engaged in racketeering activity, the RICO claims fail.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    The Complaint repeatedly alleges that the Haynes defendants' role went beyond mere investing and included helping create the scheme, setting up the entities involved, and providing consulting services and key components (ACH transfer houses) that were needed to run the enterprise.\n    <footnotemark>\n     25\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Complaint also explains in detail how the Haynes defendants were compensated, directly from the allegedly usurious rates and fees charged on the loans, over and above the amounts of their \"investments.\" Those allegations are sufficient at this juncture.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    <strong>\n     iii. Section 1962(c)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Section 1962(c) prohibits a person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in interstate commerce to conduct or participate in the conduct of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Similar to their challenges to (a) and (b), the Haynes defendants argue that the failure to allege that they personally\n    collected an illegal debt means that this claim cannot be asserted against them. Plaintiffs do not plead that the Haynes defendants were mere \"passive leaders\" whose investments were used by others to perpetuate a racketeering enterprise. Instead, they contend that the Haynes defendants were instrumental in setting up, and knowingly set up, an enterprise whose sole purpose was to collect illegal debts, thereby causing those acts to occur and reaping the benefits therefrom. Those allegations are sufficient to establish the participation and direction elements.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bunnett &amp; Co., Inc. v.

Conspiracy\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    Finally, the Haynes defendants assert that because plaintiffs cannot allege a substantive RICO claim (as the loans are neither illegal nor usurious under tribal law and there is no proximate causation alleged between the Haynes defendants and plaintiffs' injuries), no conspiracy claim can be alleged under Section 1962(d). However, as plaintiffs have adequately alleged substantive violations of RICO, their conspiracy claim also survives.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Usury\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    The Haynes defendants argue that the usury claim under California law fails for two reasons. First, the statute only holds liable a defendant who received the usurious interest; here it is undisputed that the tribes received the loan payments. Second, the statute of limitations is two years; because the complaint was filed on February 23, 2018 and there are no allegations that the Haynes defendants had any involvement with either Plain Green or GPL since February 2015, this claim is barred. Neither argument has merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    To the first one, plaintiffs respond that because the defendants indirectly received part of the usurious interest payments made by plaintiffs and other loan holders, defendants can be liable under California's usury laws even if they were not the direct payor.

Compl. \u00b6 53. These allegations support plaintiffs' assertions that the Haynes defendants actually\n    <em>\n     received\n    </em>\n    some of the usurious interest payments, albeit indirectly.

Specifically, plaintiffs pleaded that they each made payments on their loans within the year prior to salt, the majority of which were credited towards interest and fees. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 138-140. Those allegations, plus recently secured evidence showing that the Haynes defendants continued to receive payments for their funding of Plain Green and involvement in the loan scheme through at least June 2018, suffice at this juncture.

Unjust Enrichment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    Finally, the Haynes defendants argue that the unjust enrichment claim must be dismissed, if not under the choice-of-law analysis then because unjust enrichment cannot be stated on the facts here as an independent claim. As with usury, this claim will not be dismissed at this juncture. The choice-of-law arguments have been rejected, unjust enrichment can be an independent claim under California law,\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    and while the Haynes defendants argue that plaintiffs' loan agreements had an \"adequate basis at law\" to be enforceable and are not unjust, that is the essence of plaintiffs' challenge and will be determined on its merits.

MOTIONS TO SEAL\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    In support of their Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, plaintiffs submit and rely on various documents produced by the Haynes defendants that were marked as confidential under the Protective Order by defendants.
