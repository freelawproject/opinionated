Each party asks this court to enter judgment in its favor on the issue of whether, under Plaintiff's commercial general liability insurance policy, Defendant owes a duty to defend Plaintiff against an Alabama lawsuit alleging damages from Plaintiff's blasting operations. The cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings are each brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, this court finds that Plaintiff's motion should be granted as to the declaratory judgment count and that Defendant's motion should be denied. Accordingly, judgment will be entered for Plaintiff on the duty to defend issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a North Carolina corporation that conducts \"commercial rock drilling &amp; blasting throughout the Southeastern United States.\" (Complaint (\"Compl.\") (Doc. 3) \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4.) Plaintiff purchased a commercial general liability insurance policy from Defendant on June 13, 2014, which was effective from June 1, 2014 to June 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3; Ex. A, General Liability Policy (the \"Policy\") (Doc. 3-1).) The Policy provides that Defendant will defend Plaintiff against any lawsuit seeking damages for covered conduct and pay any damages that are ultimately proved at trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A at 4.) The Policy contains a \"Subsidence Exclusion\" that reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" directly or indirectly arising out of caused by, resulting from, contributed to, aggravated by or related to the subsidence, settling, settlement, expansion, sinking, slipping, falling away, tilting, caving in, shifting[,] eroding, rising, heaving, landslide, flood or mud flow, earthquake, volcanic eruption or other tectonic processes or any other movement, of land or earth, however caused, and whether by natural, manmade, accidental or artificial means. This exclusion\n   applies regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We shall have no duty or obligation on our part under this insurance to defend, respond to, investigate or indemnify any insured against any loss, claim, \"suit,\" or other proceeding alleging damages arising out of or related to \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this endorsement applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   This exclusion also applies to any obligation to, share damages with, repay or indemnify someone else who must pay damages because of such \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While the Policy was in effect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff performed \"rock drilling &amp; blasting work [ ] under contract in ... Cullman County, Alabama.\" (Compl. (Doc. 3) \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Plaintiff, as subcontractor, performed blasting work on behalf of the general contractor for the project, ASI Constructors, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B, Complaint (the \"Cullman Complaint\") (Doc. 3-2) at 6-7.) On November 10, 2016, a group of homeowners in Cullman County (the \"Cullman residents\") filed suit against Plaintiff in the Circuit Court of Cullman County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (Doc. 3) \u00b6 7; Cullman Complaint (Doc. 3-2).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Cullman Complaint alleges that Plaintiff and other parties were negligent in their blasting operations, are strictly liable for damages caused by an ultra-hazardous activity, and committed trespass and nuisance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-43.) The Cullman residents further claim both compensatory and punitive damages for structural impairment to their homes, harm to livestock and other property, and emotional distress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Cullman Complaint defines blasting as \"the violent disruption of a natural mass of land through the use of explosives.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After being served with the Cullman Complaint, Plaintiff informed Defendant of the lawsuit. (Compl. (Doc. 3) \u00b6 9.) In response, Defendant disclaimed any obligation under the Policy to either defend Plaintiff or to indemnify Plaintiff for damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10; Ex. C (Doc. 3-3); Ex. D (Doc. 3-4).) Specifically, Defendant asserted that all allegations in the Cullman Complaint \"fall within the terms of the Subsidence Exclusion and preclude a present duty to defend National Quarry in the Litigation.\" (Ex. C (Doc. 3-3) at 3.) After receiving Defendant's letters disclaiming any coverage obligation, Plaintiff brought the instant action seeking a declaratory judgment that Defendant owes a duty to defend Plaintiff against the Cullman Complaint, a declaratory judgment that Defendant must indemnify Plaintiff for any resulting losses, and asserting a breach of contract claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. (Doc. 3) \u00b6\u00b6 22-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendant answered the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 7.) Defendant then moved for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. 13), and filed a brief in support of its motion. (Doc. 14.) Plaintiff responded in opposition, (Doc. 20); and Defendant replied, (\"Def.'s Reply\" (Doc. 21).) Plaintiff cross-moved for judgment on the pleadings, (Doc. 16), and filed a memorandum in support of its motion. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\" (Doc. 17).) Defendant responded in opposition, (\"Def.'s Resp.

Ct. App. 2004) (holding that damage from a burst pipe was unambiguously excluded).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This court finds that the Policy's subsidence exclusion is ambiguous and subject to judicial interpretation. The specific items listed in the exclusion, by their plain meaning, describe what are typically thought of as naturally-occurring events.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   While earthquakes and landslides can be triggered by human activity, this court finds that the plain meaning of these phrases includes only natural phenomena. This suggests an intent to include only this type of event. However, the exclusion's \"catch-all\" phrase purports to also capture events caused by human action. There is thus an ambiguity as to what type of manmade subsidence occurrences fall under the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant appears to argue that dislodged debris and sound vibrations fall within the exclusion because they are \"inextricably intertwined\" with and associated with earth movement, which is excluded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply (Doc. 21) at 3-4.) But more than one interpretation of the catch-all phrase is reasonable. The language could include only movements of land similar in kind to those specifically listed, under\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , or it could include any movement of land (for example, if interpreted literally, the exclusion might apply to bar damage caused by dirt flung from a hole dug by Plaintiff's workers). This court finds that the exclusionary language is also ambiguous regarding the object of the movement. The language \"land or earth\" might be limited to large masses of land or tectonic plates, as in the case of the listed natural phenomena, or it may also encompass natural objects resting on or loosely attached to the earth's surface (including rocks and plants).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Applying\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , this court finds that the phrase \"other movement of land or earth\" means the sinking, shifting, rising, or settling of a mass of land. First, while the excluded conduct can be either natural or manmade, the activity must be of a type similar to the specific, listed natural phenomena. This phrase does not encompass the movement of land solely by shoveling or dredging, for example, as these activities alone are not similar in kind to earthquakes, cave-ins or landslides, which involve the sudden shifting movement of a large mass of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, the language in the exclusion also does not cover the movement of rocks, plants or other surface debris, as opposed to the movement of earth itself, either by dislodging pieces of the earth below the surface or by causing portions of the earth to sink, shift, rise or settle. This conclusion follows naturally from a reading of the\n   exclusionary provision. Landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tectonic processes each involve the movement of large amounts of earth or sub-surface material. Surface objects such as rocks and plants, on the other hand, do not expand, erode, heave or settle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This interpretation accords with the cases cited by Defendant and other cases finding that a subsidence exclusion applied to bar coverage, because in these cases the sole conduct at issue was the type of shifting movement of a large mass of earth that was excluded under the relevant policy and would be excluded here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181987\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/761/96/#p102\">\n    761 F.Supp.2d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that damage was caused by \"faulty underpinning that permitted earth to slide away from the foundation\" under plaintiff's house);\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire and Cas.

Further, the Policy's subsidence exclusion includes a provision stating that the exclusion shall apply \"regardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the 'bodily injury' or 'property damage.' \" (Policy (Doc. 3-1) at 44.)

Therefore, Defendant has a duty to defend Plaintiff against the allegations in the Cullman Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this court finds that Plaintiff's cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings should be granted as to the declaratory judgment count and denied as to the other requests and counts, and that Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Doc. 16), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   , in that Plaintiff's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's request for a declaratory judgment on Defendant's obligation to defend in the underlying dispute but\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff's request for a declaratory judgment on Defendant's obligation to indemnify for any losses and as to Plaintiff's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Doc. 13), is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   A partial judgment for Plaintiff on the declaratory judgment action shall be entered contemporaneously with this order, stating that Defendant has a duty to defend Plaintiff in the underlying dispute. As described herein, any remaining claims will be addressed at a later time.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Defendant does not appear to dispute that events giving rise to the Alabama lawsuit occurred within the Policy's effective period. The parties also do not appear to dispute that Plaintiff promptly paid its premiums and otherwise fulfilled its obligations under the Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    This definition appears in the section of the Cullman Complaint entitled \"Count II - Strict Liability.\" Because the definition does not appear in a lead-in or introductory section, this court will not assume that the definition applies to all allegations therein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As both motions for judgment on the pleadings deal solely with the request for declaratory judgment on the duty to defend issue, this court's order will apply only to that specific request. To the extent either party seeks judgment on the breach of contract claim or the indemnification question at this time, this court finds those motions premature and they will be denied.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The court has jurisdiction over this action based on diversity of citizenship. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. (Doc. 3) \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Because the Policy was delivered to the insured party at its business address in Clemmons, North Carolina, (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Policy (Doc. 3-1) at 1), this court must apply North Carolina substantive law to interpret the Policy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    For example, \"earthquake\" is defined as \"a shaking or trembling of the earth that accompanies mountain building or other crustal movements.\" \"Cave-in\" is defined as \"a place where earth has caved in.\" In the opinion of this court, both definitions suggest the absence of human intervention in causing the relevant phenomenon.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n    </em>\n    (3d ed. 1986).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
