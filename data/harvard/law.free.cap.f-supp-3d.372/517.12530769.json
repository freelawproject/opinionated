Butler's testimony is not much better. At one point, he stated that he did not know about the tip or its subject matter.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 72. However, Butler later testified that, leading up to the knock-and-talk, he had learned about a complaint about drug activity involving Apartment 4 that previously came in from either the landlord or someone involved with managing the apartment building.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 87. Nevertheless, for purposes of determining whether the\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    stop in this case was reasonable, this Court imputes to Rosario and Butler the knowledge about the tip and its contents received by other Huntington Police Department officers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Srisavath v. City of Brentwood\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5390390\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/243/909/#p916\">\n     243 F. App'x 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 916 (6th Cir. 2007).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Aside from the fact that Rosario and Butler did not have reasonable suspicion when Jackson and Jennings were initially seized, the Court finds that Rosario lacked reasonable suspicion to perform the pat-down search of Jackson for purposes of officer safety. It is true that an officer may be justified in performing a pat-down search of an individual whom the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe is a drug dealer.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v. Branch\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129752\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/582/#p589\">\n     537 F.3d 582\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 589 (6th Cir. 2008) (an officer is \"entitled to rely on his training and experience that drug dealers frequently carry weapons\" to justify a pat-down search of a suspected drug dealer). However, Rosario never stated that he suspected Jackson of being a drug dealer or had other reason to believe that Jackson was armed. Therefore, Rosario also lacked reasonable suspicion to perform the pat-down search for officer safety when Jackson was outside the apartment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
