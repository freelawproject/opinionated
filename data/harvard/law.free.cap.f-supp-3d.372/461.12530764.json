(Dkt. # 15 at 4-5, 12-14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the evening of February 9, 2015, neighbors witnessed a physical altercation between SPC Giffa and Dawn Larson Giffa outside their off-base home at 1710 Godman Street, Killeen, Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The incident took place after SPC Giffa took Dawn Larson Giffa's and her son K.L.'s identification documents and Dawn Larson Giffa's credit cards and money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dawn Larson Giffa went to the home of her neighbors, Michael and Lydia Farina, and called the Killeen Police Department (\"KPD\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) KPD officers responded, but declined to arrest SPC Giffa based on his military status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Instead, they instructed Dawn Larson Giffa to call the military police at Fort Hood and SPC Giffa's military commander. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 10, 2015, Dawn Larson Giffa went to Fort Hood to speak with her husband's commanding officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) She reported the incident and was provided with a contact number for SPC Giffa's commander. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She returned to the Farina home and called SPC Giffa's commander at Fort Hood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After completing the call, she told Michael and Lydia Farina that Army personnel were going to come get SPC Giffa, put him on a 48-hour watch, require him to live out of the barracks at Fort Hood for seven days, and issue a 500-foot no-contact order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 12, 2015, Dawn Larson Giffa again called the commander from the Farina's home and was again told of the 48-hour watch, seven days in the barracks, and 500-foot no-contact order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) During the conversation, she informed the commander that SPC Giffa had taken her driver's license, credit cards, and her and her son's Legal Permanent Resident identification cards (\"Green Cards\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   After receiving this information, uniformed army personnel went in and out of the Giffa residence multiple times, sometimes in the presence of SPC Giffa, sometimes not, to search for the documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 14, 2015, Dawn Larson Giffa and Michael and Lydia Farina observed SPC Giffa driving less than 500 feet from their residence in violation of the no-contact\n   order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dawn Larson Giffa called SPC Giffa's commander to report the violation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.) It is not clear from the record before the Court whether any action was taken in response. At some point on either February 16 or February 17, 2015, Dawn Larson Giffa and SPC Giffa attended a family counseling session with an Army Counselor on base. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) After the session, Dawn Larson Giffa told the Farina's that she had told the Army Counselor that if SPC was released he would kill her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 18, 2015, SPC Giffa was released from Fort Hood to return to the Giffa home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) He purchased a gun from a pawn shop in Temple, Texas, and ammunition from Walmart. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dawn Larson Giffa and her son, K.L., remained at the Farina home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 22, 2015, SPC Giffa went to the Farina home to ask Dawn to return. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When she refused, he left, retrieved his firearm, and returned to the Farina home where he opened fire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) He shot and injured Michael Farina, and shot and killed Lydia Farina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) He then dragged Dawn Larson Giffa from the Farina house. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Another set of neighbors, Christina and Steven Guzman, relatives of the Farinas, heard the commotion and attempted to help Dawn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) SPC Giffa shot and injured Christina Guzman and shot and killed Steven Guzman. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.) He then shot and killed Dawn Larson Giffa before killing himself via self-inflicted gunshot wound.

That argument also fails. While the Fifth Circuit has not spoken on this exact question, the Court finds the Sixth Circuit's rationale: that factual assurances by the Army to Dawn Larson Giffa regarding her protection from her husband, heard by or relayed to the Farinas, are sufficient to create such an \"independent, antecedent duty unrelated to the employment relationship between [SPC Giffa] and the United States\" persuasive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilburn v.

In\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   , the estranged wife of a military police officer for the Army, Tracy Wilburn, and her friend were murdered by the officer, Brent Burke, and the estates and immediate family members of the two women brought survival and wrongful death claims against the United States through the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n    at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Sixth Circuit held that the Army's assurances to Tracey Wilburn that they would protect her sufficed to create a relationship, like the one in\n   <em>\n    Sheridan\n   </em>\n   , independent of Burke's employment relationship with the Army because those promises could have just as well been to protect her \"from a non-employee, a vicious animal, or a non-human hazard\" as from a member of the Army itself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n    at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The instant case is similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   with regard to the creation of that relationship.

The incidents in this case occurred off-base, in Killeen, Texas. Ordinarily, the local police department, KPD, would be the organization called to protect Dawn Larson Giffa and her neighbors. However, as pled here, KPD explicitly refused to exercise jurisdiction over the domestic violence incident that predated the murder of Dawn Larson Giffa and her neighbors due to SPC Giffa's status as a member of the Army. (Dkt. # 15 at 7.) Army Regulation (\"AR\") 608-18 requires a Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\") between \"Army installations and adjoining local communities\" in order to address \"problems of spouse and child abuse within military [f]amilies.\" AR 608-18, 2-12. Should a civilian agency refuse to enter into such an agreement, the installation must notify the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the complaint, both the Department of the Army and the City of Killeen, Texas, initially indicated that no such MOA exists, in violation of AR 608-18. (Dkt. # 15 at 7.) After further discovery, however, it was revealed that there is a MOA between Fort Hood and KPD, and between Fort Hood and the Bell County District Attorney's Office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, in a case such as this, where the local police department refuses to exercise jurisdiction over an individual because of his military ties, but there is an explicit MOA between the local police department and the military, military law enforcement has to adopt the posture of local law enforcement: they owe a duty to serve and protect third party civilians. To say otherwise would be to allow members of the armed services to behave with impunity, with no actual avenue for relief after the fact for those injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similarly, the Department of Defense regulations, which underscore how seriously the Department takes domestic violence and child abuse, function as rights with no remedies if suit cannot be brought to enforce them. Simply put: the contents of the MOAs between KPD and Fort Hood and the Bell County District Attorney's Office and Fort Hood create genuine issues of material fact as to the duties owed by military police to military families and surrounding civilians residing off-base. Thus, here, the question of whether Dawn Larson Giffa \"reasonably relied on the Army's assertion that it would protect her,\"\n   <em>\n    Wilburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=616%20Fed.%20Appx.%20848\">\n    616 Fed. Appx. at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and whether the Army negligently undertook its duty to protect her pursuant to Army and Department of Defense regulations are all genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment. Additionally, based on the reasons outlined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the FTCA intentional tort exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Texas Negligence Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The United States also argues that the negligence claims alleged by\n   Plaintiffs fail as a matter of state law. \"Whether the United States owed an independent duty to the plaintiffs is [also] a question of Texas state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Bodin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3463939\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/462/481/#p488\">\n    462 F.3d at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2006). The United States argues that there is no liability under state law for a private employer on these facts, (Dkt. # 24 at 8-9), though it concedes that \"Texas recognizes that a duty to use reasonable care may arise 'when a person undertakes to provide services to another, either gratuitously or for compensation.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, quoting\n   <em>\n    Kuentz v. Cole Systems Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655828\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/541/208/#p213\">\n    541 S.W.3d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Tex. App.-Houston 2017).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court disagrees. As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Army and Department of Defense regulations here give rise to such a duty, and those duties would arise in the context of a private employer as well. The United States' reliance on cases arguing that federal internal procedures do not give rise to a duty under state law,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tindall v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526872\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/901/53/\">\n    901 F.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 fn.8 (5th Cir. 1990), is inapposite: as Plaintiffs note, this is not a claim of a private right of action for failure to follow federal regulations; rather, it is a claim for negligent undertaking, grounded in state common law tort, which renders a party liable for breach of a duty voluntarily assumed by affirmative conduct-enacting the regulations and acting under color of them. (Dkt. # 28 at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Restatement 2d of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 323, 324A (1965).) Thus, there is no Texas-law bar to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The United States also concedes that negligent undertaking is a viable tort in Texas,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torrington v. Stutzman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093840\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/829/#p838\">\n    46 S.W.3d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 838-39 (Tex. 2000). To establish a claim of negligent undertaking, Plaintiffs must show that: (1) the Defendant undertook to perform services that it should have known were necessary for the protection of the Plaintiffs; (2) Defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in performing those services; (3) Plaintiff relied upon Defendant's performance; or (4) Defendant's performance increased Plaintiff's risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Restatement 2d of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 323, 324A (1965). Plaintiffs cite to numerous deposition materials from various Army personnel that, in their view, establish that the Army's own understanding was that the policies in place at the time of the incident did establish a duty to Dawn Larson Giffa and those close to her, that the Army undertook to fulfill that duty, and that the Army failed exercise reasonable care, and, in doing so, increased the risk of harm. (Dkt. # 28 at 9-14.) The United States disputes that account, and questions whether any Army personnel were on notice of the danger Dawn Larson Giffa was in and whether any procedures were followed improperly. (Dkt. # 24 at 11-12; 12-14.) In addition, the United States contends that Plaintiffs cannot prove reliance on the alleged undertaking nor an increased risk of harm. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17, 17-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This dispute, however, goes directly to the factual issues at the heart of this case. The United States fails to prove, as a matter of law, that Plaintiffs have no case for negligent undertaking under Texas law. Plaintiffs and the United States rely on different portions of the same deposition testimony as evidence of their claims. Ascertaining which interpretation of the facts controls on each of these issues requires a mini-trial on the merits. Whether Plaintiffs can sustain their burden to prove that there was a negligent undertaking by the Army to enforce the duty owed to Dawn Larson Giffa and her neighbors is a question for the trier of fact. Therefore, the motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Plaintiffs have successfully made out a claim under the\n   FTCA, based on Texas law, for negligent undertaking by the United States and have successfully raised genuine issues of material fact such that summary judgment is inappropriate.

The operative complaint alleges that, based on Fort Hood's size and the number of soldiers who live off-base, civilian authorities defer to military authorities when a service member is accused of criminal activity.
