U.S. Bakery argued that Bimbo Bakeries failed to present evidence of any actual consumer confusion and that Dr. Christensen's testimony should have been excluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, U.S. Bakery also addressed the geographic scope of the consumer surveys conducted, arguing that Dr. Christensen did not present any data outside of Utah, and, therefore, the jury would be speculating as to how consumers in other states respond to U.S. Bakery's tagline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The jury returned a verdict in favor of Bimbo Bakeries on both of its claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following post-trial briefing, judgment was entered against U.S. Bakery for $ 8,027,720 in false advertising damages and $ 1,578,942 in trade secret damages (plus exemplary damages in the amount of $ 789,471).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) allows a party to move for judgment as a matter of law after another party \"has been fully heard on an issue during a trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the motion is not granted, then it may be renewed after the entry of judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The renewed motion \"may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"In ruling on the renewed motion, the court may: (1) allow judgment on the verdict ...;

(2) in commerce; (3) that are either likely to cause confusion or mistake as to (a) the origin, association or approval of the product with or by another, or (b) the characteristics of the goods or services; and (4) injure the plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"To demonstrate falsity within the meaning of the Lanham Act, a plaintiff may show that the statement was literally false, either on its face or by necessary implication, or that the statement was literally true but likely to mislead or confuse consumers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   U.S. Bakery asserts that Bimbo Bakeries' false advertising claim fails as a matter of law and is unsupported by the evidence, because (1) the word \"local\" in U.S. Bakery's tagline is not a specific geographic place, and therefore not false or misleading; (2) Bimbo Bakeries' expert testimony was incompetent and cannot support the jury's verdict; and (3) Bimbo Bakeries failed to present evidence that the word \"local\" was material to a bread purchaser's decision. These arguments were previously asserted by U.S. Bakery in its motions to exclude expert witnesses, motion for summary judgment, motions in limine, and oral motion for judgment as a matter of law. For the same reasons stated in the orders on those motions, U.S. Bakery's request for judgment as a matter of law on Bimbo Bakeries' false advertising claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    The jury appropriately decided whether the term \"local\" in U.S. Bakery's tagline is misleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   U.S. Bakery argues that Bimbo Bakeries failed to satisfy the first element of its false advertising claim because the use of the term \"local\" in its tagline was not a false or misleading representation of fact about its bread product. Although it does not carry a set definition, the term \"local\" is a statement of fact-not a statement of general opinion-which could be found to be misleading as to the nature, characteristics, or qualities of U.S. Bakery's bread.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to U.S. Bakery's assertion, Bimbo Bakeries was not required to prove that U.S. Bakery's advertisement was literally false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead,\n   Bimbo Bakeries was allowed to assert an alternative basis for its claim by demonstrating implied falsehood through extrinsic evidence that the use of \"local\" in U.S. Bakery's tagline tends to mislead or confuse consumers as to where the product is made. At trial, Bimbo Bakeries presented consumer survey data through its expert witness to show that the tagline \"local\" was misleading and material to purchasers. The jury heard that evidence, as well as the rebuttal testimony of U.S. Bakery's expert, and, as it was entitled to do, decided that U.S. Bakery's use of \"local\" in its advertising was misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In support of its Renewed Motion for Judgment, U.S. Bakery cites to\n   <em>\n    Forschner Group, Inc. v. Arrow Trading Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Second Circuit case, to argue that \"local\" is not a specific geographic location that can be verified objectively as either true or false.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   That case is not only not binding on this court, but U.S. Bakery's reliance on it is also inapposite. The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Forschner Group\n   </em>\n   brought a false advertising claim against the defendant, alleging that defendant's use of the phrase \"Swiss Army knife\" falsely suggested to consumers that its knives were manufactured in Switzerland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court determined that the phrase \"Swiss Army knife\" was not a geographic designation because the phrase could not fairly be read to say \"made in Switzerland\" so as to be geographically descriptive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a term does not need to designate a specific geographic origin to be actionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Forschner Group\n   </em>\n   , applying the analytical framework used to gauge the distinctiveness of trademarks to resolve a question of false designation of geographic origin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   distinguished between geographically descriptive terms and geographic terms. \"A geographically descriptive term is one that 'designates geographical location and would tend to be regarded by buyers as descriptive of the geographic location of origin of the goods or services.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Under the false advertising provisions of the Lanham Act, a phrase is eligible for protection as a representation of geographic origin only if the phrase is geographically descriptive\" and \"used in a deceptive manner so as to create a 'likelihood of confusion' concerning the geographic origin of a product.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, \"local\" is a geographically descriptive term, and Bimbo Bakeries presented evidence that U.S. Bakery used the term in a deceptive manner concerning the origin of its bread product-namely, to suggest that its bread products were particularly fresh and of high quality because they were baked within the geographic vicinity of where they were sold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the jury's verdict was sufficiently supported by the evidence and not legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Bimbo Bakeries' expert was properly allowed to establish consumer confusion and materiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   U.S. Bakery next argues that Bimbo Bakeries failed to provide valid evidence of consumer confusion in order to satisfy the third element of its false advertising claim. A plaintiff \"must demonstrate, by extrinsic evidence, that the challenged [advertisements] tend to mislead or confuse consumers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such evidence must show that a \"statistically significant\" number of people have been misled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"While there is no bright line rule on what constitutes a statistically significant group, courts have held that survey evidence of 15% confusion is sufficient to demonstrate actual confusion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, Bimbo Bakeries' expert, Dr. Christensen, presented the results of consumer surveys performed demonstrating 28% consumer confusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S. Bakery asserts that these surveys were not reliable and that Dr. Christensen was not qualified to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   U.S. Bakery previously raised this argument in a motion in limine\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a motion to exclude the testimony of Dr. Christensen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both motions were denied, and there is no basis for disturbing those rulings now.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Dr. Christensen's education, experience, and qualifications qualified him to testify to quantitative surveys.

Although U.S. Bakery did not object to Mr. Hoffman's testimony at trial or seek a jury instruction limiting damages to Utah, its failure to do so then does not rise to the level of having waived its right to object now. Under the invited error doctrine, a party generally cannot complain of errors that he has himself induced or invited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, invited error requires \"intentional relinquishment of a right\" and occurs when \"the party sought out or affirmatively approved an errant outcome.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, \"where the jury has returned a special verdict, the trial judge is obligated to apply appropriate legal principles to the facts found by the jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Mr. Hoffman's unjust enrichment calculations necessarily rely upon Dr. Christensen's consumer surveys and findings of consumer confusion. Bimbo Bakeries had the opportunity to present evidence related to consumer confusion in all eight states in which U.S. Bakery used its tagline. But, Bimbo Bakeries chose to limit its surveys to Utah and did not provide any basis for extrapolating the Utah data to other states. Throughout trial-during argument and in its cross-examination of Mr. Hoffman-U.S. Bakery asserted its position that damages should be limited to Utah. Based on the circumstances, U.S. Bakery cannot be found to have sought out or affirmatively approved the failure to limit either Mr. Hoffman's testimony or the jury instructions regarding damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ultimately, Bimbo Bakeries presented sufficient evidence to allow its false advertising claim to proceed to the jury, but only with respect to consumer confusion in Utah and damages from false advertising in Utah. Bimbo Bakeries did not provide any foundation to seek damages outside of Utah. Having determined that the jury should have limited damages to Utah, the $ 8,027,720 award is not supported by the evidence and is legally insufficient. However, the award can be remitted without a new trial. The jury chose to adopt Mr. Hoffman's method of calculation. At trial, Mr. Hoffman calculated $ 83,398 in profits from U.S. Bakery's use of the disputed tagline in Utah.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the false advertising damages are remitted to $ 83,398.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Renewed Motion for\n   Judgment\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   is DENIED in PART and GRANTED in PART as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 U.S. Bakery's request for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \u2022 U.S. Bakery's request for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \u2022 U.S. Bakery's request for remittitur is GRANTED.
