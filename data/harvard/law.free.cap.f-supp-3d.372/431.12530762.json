Plaintiff is an amputee who is disabled within the meaning of the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 2, 2016, she attempted to call the box office of the Mercedes-Benz Superdome (\"Superdome\") to purchase tickets for a Guns N' Roses concert, to be held on July 31, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reality, she contacted a representative of Box Office Ticket Center LLC, who assured her the tickets she was purchasing were accessible seats compliant with the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Superdome is owned by the LSED and operated and managed by Defendant SMG. SMG is responsible for coordinating events, including creating seating charts for concerts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ticketmaster LLC, not Box Office Ticket Center LLC, has the sole and exclusive right to sell and distribute tickets for concerts at the Superdome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   SMG identifies accessible seats in its seating chart for music concerts and submits that information to Ticketmaster LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   SMG's usual practice is to reserve additional ADA-accessible seats in case a customer with a disability, but without a ticket for an accessible seat, requests to be moved to an accessible seat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the Guns N' Roses concert, SMG reserved approximately one hundred fifty-one accessible seats for this purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's tickets originally were bought from Ticketmaster LLC and resold on the secondary market by Box Office Ticket Center LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The seat for which Plaintiff purchased a ticket had not been designated by SMG as accessible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Plaintiff and her daughter arrived at the Superdome on the night of the concert, they sought assistance from a SMG staffer to locate their seats.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asked the staffer to remove the existing chair in the space of her ticketed seat to permit her to park her wheelchair in its place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The staffer told her the existing chair could not be removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff expressed safety concerns about being transferred out of her wheelchair, but eventually agreed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The SMG staffer took her wheelchair, which was returned to her after the concert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 28, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   She filed an amended complaint on August 20, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants remaining in the case are the LSED, France, in his official capacity as Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the LSED, and SMG. Plaintiff brings (1) a claim for damages and injunctive relief under Title II of the ADA against the LSED and France,\n   (2) a claim for damages under the LHRA against SMG, and (3) a claim for injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA against SMG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 26, 2018, Defendants SMG, the LSED, and France filed the instant motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff opposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this order, the Court addresses Defendants' argument that the LSED is entitled to sovereign immunity on Plaintiff's claim for damages under Title II of the ADA. The Court also addresses\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   whether the LSED is entitled to sovereign immunity on Plaintiff's Title II claim for injunctive relief against it and whether France, sued in his official capacity, is entitled to sovereign immunity on Plaintiff's Title II damages claim against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate only \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"An issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   When assessing whether a material factual dispute exists, the Court considers \"all of the evidence in the record but refrain[s] from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   All reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no genuine issue of material fact if, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, no reasonable trier of fact could find for the non-moving party, thus entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[A] party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" To satisfy Rule 56's burden of production, the moving party must do one of two things: \"the moving party may submit affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim\" or \"the moving party may demonstrate to the Court that the nonmoving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party's claim.\" If the moving party fails to carry this burden, the motion must be denied. If the moving party successfully carries this burden, the burden of production then shifts to the non-moving party to direct the Court's attention to something in the pleadings or other evidence in the record setting forth specific facts sufficient to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does indeed exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If the dispositive issue is one on which the non-moving party will bear the\n   burden of persuasion at trial, the moving party may satisfy its burden of production by either (1) submitting affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of the non-movant's claim, or (2) affirmatively demonstrating that there is no evidence in the record to establish an essential element of the non-movant's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the movant fails to affirmatively show the absence of evidence in the record, its motion for summary judgment must be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the non-moving party may defeat a motion for summary judgment by \"calling the Court's attention to supporting evidence already in the record that was overlooked or ignored by the moving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[U]nsubstantiated assertions are not competent summary judgment evidence. The party opposing summary judgment is required to identify specific evidence in the record and to articulate the precise manner in which that evidence supports his or her claim.

Whether the state statutes and case law view the agency as an arm of the state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   2.

The Court must determine whether the LSED functions as an arm of the state. Under Louisiana law, determining whether an entity is an arm of the state \"requires a fact intensive inquiry, investigating the entity's powers and functions, as well as its interrelationship with the state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    The history of the LSED weighs in favor of finding it is an arm of the state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A brief overview of the history of the LSED is instructive in determining the LSED's status under state law. The LSED was created in 1966 by amendment to the Louisiana Constitution of 1921.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The constitutional provision creating the LSED, codified at Article XIV, \u00a7 47 of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921, and continued as a statutory provision under the Louisiana Constitution of 1974,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifies that the LSED is a \"body politic and corporate and political subdivision of the State of Louisiana composed of all of the territory in the Parishes of Orleans and Jefferson.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the constitutional provision as enacted, the LSED was to be governed by a Board of Commissioners composed of six\n   <em>\n    ex officio\n   </em>\n   members and five members appointed by local and state officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Louisiana Constitution of 1974 mandated the reorganization of the state government into not more than twenty departments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 1976, the legislature passed Act 541 of the 1976 Regular Legislative Session (\"Act 541\"), restructuring the Board of Commissioners of the LSED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Act 541 provided all members of the Board were to be appointed by the Governor from each of the public service districts in the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 10 of Act 541 provides, \"[i]t is the intent of this Act that the state of Louisiana, through the Governor, hereby takes over and assumes full responsibility for the management of the properties\" of LSED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Executive Reorganization Act, passed in 1977,\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   the legislature cited Act 541 and transferred to the Office of the Governor the \"powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities\" of \"Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District, Board of Commissioners.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   This transfer of the LSED to the Office of the Governor weighs in favor of finding the LSED is an arm of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Inclusion of the LSED in the section of the Louisiana Revised Statutes organizing the Executive Branch weighs in favor of finding the LSED is an arm of the state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Slowinski v.

Section 47(B) of the provision of the Louisiana Constitution of 1921 originally creating the LSED provided the Board of Commissioners of the LSED would include six\n   <em>\n    ex officio\n   </em>\n   members-\"the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President\n   <em>\n    pro tem\n   </em>\n   of the Louisiana Senate, the Mayor of the City of New Orleans, the presiding Councilman at Large of the City Council of New Orleans and the Parish President of the Parish of Jefferson\"-and five appointed members-three appointed by the Mayor of the City of New Orleans, one by the Parish President of the Parish of Jefferson and one by the Governor of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Act 541 repealed \u00a7 47(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n   All members of the Board are now appointed by the Governor and serve at his pleasure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    90\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the board may appoint officers, the Governor selects the Chairman of the Board.\n   <footnotemark>\n    91\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State is divided\n   into five public service districts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Act 541 requires that one member of the Board of Commissioners of the LSED be appointed \"from each of the public service districts in the state.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board of Commissioners of the LSED is composed of five people from different parts of the entire state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n   The structure of the Board weighs in favor of finding the LSED is an arm of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   vi.\n   <em>\n    The LSED's powers weigh in favor of finding it is an arm of the state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Act 541 states the legislature's intent for the Governor to \"take[ ] over and assume[ ] full responsibility for the management of the properties\" of LSED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    95\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act delegates to the Governor the authority to \"exercise all power and authority over the management of the properties\" of LSED, to \"delegate the management of the properties to an executive director or to a professional management organization,\" and to \"negotiate for the sale of and sell the properties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Act also specifies and limits the \"purposes, powers, and duties\" of the LSED, which are largely administrative or advisory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The LSED has some of the same powers as the EEIDD, including the authority to enter into contracts, to incur debt and issue bonds in its own name and behalf, and to acquire property by \"expropriation, purchase, lease or otherwise,\" and to levy and collect hotel occupancy taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    98\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, unlike the EEIDD, these powers are ultimately exercised by the Governor through the Board of Commissioners of the LSED. As a result, the Court finds the LSED is not governed from within Orleans and Jefferson Parishes and is not emancipated from state control and oversight. Instead, the LSED is governed by the Office of the Governor and is within state control. This weighs in favor of finding the LSED is an arm of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The sources of the LSED's funding weigh in favor of finding the LSED is an arm of the state.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"The most important\n   <em>\n    Hudson\n   </em>\n   factor, the source of the entity's funding, requires a two-part inquiry:\" (1) the state's liability for a judgment against the officer sued in his official capacity and (2) the state's liability for the entity's general debts and obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that, because a judgment in this case will be paid by the Louisiana Office of Risk Management (\"ORM\"), the LSED is an arm of the state. The LSED filed an affidavit by Mark Joseph, the State Risk Underwriting Supervisor of ORM, which manages insurance covering property and liability exposure of the State of Louisiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   Joseph testified ORM provides insurance for damages and attorney's fee awards in actions against the LSED brought under the ADA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that payments for such awards will be made from the \"Self-insurance Fund,\n   which was created within the [Louisiana] Department of the Treasury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   According to the affidavit Defendants filed on February 7, 2019, ORM issues a self-insurance coverage document to the LSED that expressly covers tort actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n   Payments for judgments against the LSED are made from the Self-Insurance Fund in the Louisiana Department of the Treasury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    104\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under Louisiana statutory law, ORM \"manage[s] all state insurance covering property and liability exposure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    105\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Self-Insurance Fund, \"created in the Department of the Treasury,\" is described as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   The fund shall consist of all premiums paid by state agencies under the state's risk management program as established by this Chapter, the investment income earned from such premiums and commissions retained in accordance with the provisions of this Title.

The LSED is not included among the entities covered even though they are not instrumentalities of the state. As a result, the only statutory provision under which the Self-Insurance Fund could insure judgments against the LSED is the provision that the fund be used \"for the payment of losses incurred by state agencies under the self-insurance program.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ORM treats the LSED as a state agency. This is confirmed by a July 1991 opinion from the Louisiana Attorney General stating that the LSED is \"a[n] agency under the executive branch\" and, as a result, is \"obligated to accept the insurance coverage and premium costs\" assigned by ORM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court finds the state pays judgments against the LSED\n   <em>\n    directly.\n   </em>\n   The Court also analyzes \"whether the state will\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   fund a judgment against the [defendant] because the state either is responsible for general debts and obligations\n   or provides the lion's share of the [defendant]'s budget.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The provision of the 1921 Constitution creating the LSED, continued as a statute, provides the LSED's \"books and records shall be subject to audit annually by the Legislative Auditor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    110\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court takes judicial notice of the Financial Statement Audit for the year ending on June 30, 2018, issued by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Audit, \"[l]osses arising from judgments, claims, and similar contingencies are paid through the state's self-insurance fund operated by the Office of Risk Management, the agency responsible for the state's risk management program, or by the General Fund appropriation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n   The General Fund \"administers and accounts for legislative appropriations provided to fund the general administrative expenditures of the District and those expenditures, including sports franchise annual payments, not funded through other specific legislative appropriations or revenues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    113\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the audit, for the year ending on June 30, 2018, the General Fund paid $ 281,954 in insurance costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    114\n   </footnotemark>\n   The General Fund had $ 46,199,171 in revenues, of which $ 29,533,161 came from the hotel occupancy tax the LSED levies directly, and $ 9,437,025 from the New Orleans Sports Franchise Fund,\n   <footnotemark>\n    115\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is a legislative appropriation for LSED payments to sports franchises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    116\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no indication on the General Fund income statement of any appropriation for the general administrative expenditures of the LSED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    117\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Audit also states hotel tax revenues increased in the year ending on June 30, 2018, and the increase \"reduced the District's dependency on the state's General Fund appropriations to meet the contractual obligations of the District.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    118\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Legislative Audit shows that, although a majority of the revenues for the LSED's general operating fund comes from the hotel tax it levies, the state appropriates funds for the LSED to pay some of its debts and obligations. The New Orleans Sports Franchise Fund appropriations, although intended to support LSED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   payments to sports franchises, are placed in the same General Fund from which insurance payments are withdrawn. The fact that an increase in hotel taxes reduces the LSED's dependency on appropriations suggests that, were hotel tax revenue to decrease, the State's appropriations would increase. As a result, the Court finds the State provides indirect funding for the LSED's general debts and obligations.

To recover monetary damages, a plaintiff must prove that the discrimination was intentional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    145\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   It is undisputed Plaintiff has a qualifying\n   disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    146\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the pretrial order, the parties agree the following are contested facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   a. Whether the SMG staffer who escorted Ms. Smith to her ticketed seats indicated, implied, or otherwise led Ms. Smith to believe that transferring out of her wheelchair and into her ticketed seat was necessary for Ms. Smith to view the concert.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   b. Whether the SMG staffer who took Ms. Smith's wheelchair did so in accordance with SMG's policies for patron wheelchair storage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   c. Whether Ms. Smith's wheelchair was securely stored during the Concert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    147\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court finds these disputed facts are material to the elements of the Title II claim. They create a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Plaintiff was denied the benefits of a program for which the LSED is responsible\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   or she was otherwise discriminated against by the LSED. They also create a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the alleged discrimination was by reason of her disability and whether it was intentional. Because Plaintiff has established genuine issues of material fact as to the elements of her Title II claim, the Court proceeds to the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Georgia\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Fourteenth Amendment Violation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Georgia\n   </em>\n   test requires a court to determine the extent to which the state government entity's alleged violation of Title II of the ADA also violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that \"Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions\" of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Equal Protection Clause and the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   This permits Congress to create private remedies against the states for violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, \"insofar as Title II creates a private cause of action for damages against the States for conduct that\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Title II validly abrogates state sovereign immunity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The alleged Title II violations in this case relate to (1) a failure to allow Plaintiff to use the elevator, (2) a failure to provide Plaintiff accessible seating after she bought inaccessible seats through the secondary ticket market, and (3) a failure to store Plaintiff's wheelchair securely. Under the Equal Protection Clause, \"[d]isabled persons are not a suspect class.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, classifications on the basis of\n   disability are subject to rational basis scrutiny, meaning they violate the Equal Protection Clause \"if they lack a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the uncontested facts in this case, Plaintiff cannot show the LSED subjected her to a classification on the basis of physical disability that lacked a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose. As a result, there is no violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Due Process Clause guarantees certain fundamental rights, and a violation of Title II violates the Due Process Clause when it prevents people with disabilities from exercising those rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, when physical barriers prevent people with disabilities from exercising their fundamental right of access to the courts, an ADA violation also may violate the Due Process Clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is unaware of any cases, and the parties cite none, in support of the proposition that Plaintiff was unable to exercise a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause. As a result, the Court finds no Fourteenth Amendment violation and proceeds to the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Georgia\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Implication of Fourteenth Amendment Right\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Courts reach the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Georgia\n   </em>\n   test on summary judgment only in cases in which there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a defendant's conduct violated Title II of the ADA, but the alleged conduct did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, in this case, the Court must consider whether, as to the alleged conduct, Title II of the ADA was a valid exercise of Congressional authority under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    City of Boerne v.

Lane\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs were a wheelchair-bound man forced to crawl up two flights of stairs to reach a court hearing on the second floor of a courthouse and a wheelchair-bound certified court reporter who alleged she had lost work because of her inability to access courthouses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addressing whether Congress validly abrogated state sovereign immunity, the Supreme Court outlined the purpose of Title II of the ADA. The Court noted that the purpose of Title II is not limited to prohibiting\n   state governments from violating of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by classifying people based on disability without a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   Title II also \"seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, infringements of which are subject to more searching judicial review ... includ[ing] some, like the right of access to the courts at issue in [\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   ], that are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    164\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Court explained that \"Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.\" The Court listed a plethora of examples, including\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [prohibitions on] engaging in activities such as marrying and serving as jurors[;] ... unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of settings, including unjustified commitment; the abuse and neglect of persons committed to state mental health hospitals; irrational discrimination in zoning decisions[; and] ... a pattern of unequal treatment in the administration of a wide range of public services, programs, and activities, including the penal system, public education, and voting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    165\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court found \"Title II unquestionably is valid \u00a7 5 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finding Title II's requirement of program accessibility \"congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts,\" the Court held Title II validly abrogated sovereign immunity as to cases involving access to the courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    167\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court explicitly did not address whether Title II validly abrogates sovereign immunity in \"private suits for money damages for failing to provide reasonable access to hockey rinks, or even to voting booths.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    168\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Plaintiff does not explicitly state the Fourteenth Amendment right she argues is implicated by Defendants' conduct. Rather, she cites\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   to argue the alleged Title II violation is \"within the universe of rights grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment because 'the sheer volume of evidence demonstrating the nature and extent of unconstitutional discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    169\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent Plaintiff identifies \"discrimination against persons with disabilities in the provision of public services\" as the fundamental right identified by the\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   court, she misconstrues\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   's holding. \"\n   <em>\n    Lane\n   </em>\n   identified a narrow category of state action that focused the analysis on a specific individual\n   right-the right of access to the courts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    170\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is aware of no cases, and the parties cite none, creating a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause to freedom of access to stadiums, concerts, or all governmental buildings. As a result, the Court finds the alleged Title II violations do not implicate a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Congress did not validly abrogate sovereign immunity for Plaintiff's claim under Title II of the ADA.
