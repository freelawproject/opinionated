(DE 129, 133, 140). Also before the court are the motions for summary judgment by defendants Michael J. Howington (\"Michael Howington\") and Wendy A. Howington (\"Wendy Howington\") (DE 137, 142).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   These motions have been briefed fully. In this posture, the issues raised are ripe for ruling. For the following reasons, the motions are granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action arises out of alleged wage and hour violations and improper conduct by a supervisor while plaintiff was working at HBG construction projects in and around Apex, North Carolina. On December 22, 2014, plaintiff filed pro se an application to proceed in forma pauperis and a proposed complaint with exhibits, asserting claims against HBG and MH &amp; WH, as alleged joint employers, together with alleged employees thereof, defendant Wendy Howington and former defendant Terry Stanley (\"Stanley\"). Plaintiff also asserted claims against former defendant A. Humphries (\"Humphries\"), a police sergeant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court upon frivolity review construed the complaint to assert viable claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (\"Title VII\"); the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.; the North Carolina Wage and Hour Act (\"NCWHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2095-25.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 95-25.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq.; assault; and battery. On recommendation of a magistrate judge, in order entered August 12, 2015, the court allowed plaintiff to proceed on Title VII claims against MH &amp; WH and HBG; FLSA and NCWHA claims against MH &amp; WH, HBG, and Wendy Howington; and assault and battery claims against Stanley, MH &amp; WH, and HBG. Defendant Humphries was dismissed from the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a period of time for service, defendants HBG, MH &amp; WH, and Wendy A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Howington, answered the complaint on March 9, 2016. Former defendant Stanley filed a motion to dismiss for insufficient service. Upon magistrate judge recommendation, on February 9, 2017, the court dismissed without prejudice claims against Stanley for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Case management order entered March 16, 2017, initially provided for discovery to be completed by June 30, 2017. On May 23, 2017, the court amended the case management order to clarify that the case is not automatically selected for mediation, and the court struck notice filed by defendants of mediator choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On May 31, 2017, counsel entered an appearance for plaintiff, and plaintiff's filings have since that time been made through counsel. Upon plaintiff's motion to amend case management order, on July 14, 2017, the court extended the discovery deadline to November 30, 2017, and allowed plaintiff until September 1, 2017, to file a motion to amend pleadings. Plaintiff timely moved to amend her pleadings, and the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to amend on November 3, 2017. Plaintiff's first amended complaint, filed November 9, 2017, contains the following claims against defendants HBG, MH &amp; WH, Wendy Howington, and newly-added defendant Michael Howington:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1) FLSA claim for failure to pay proper overtime wages, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against all defendants (Count One).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2) NCWHA claim for failure to pay all owned, earned, and promised wages, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2095-25.6\">\n    N.C.

For additional violations, plaintiff seeks back pay, front pay, past pecuniary losses, compensatory damages, consequential damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and interest. Plaintiff demands a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The instant motions for summary judgment and partial summary judgment all were filed on March 23, 2018. In its motion for partial summary judgment, defendant HBG seeks dismissal of plaintiff's NCWHA, assault, battery, and IIED claims; as well as claims for damages comprising actual medical damages, lost wages, and pain and suffering.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant HBG relies upon a statement of material facts and memorandum of law, as well as the following materials: 1) depositions of defendants HBG, MH &amp; WH, and Michael Howington; former defendant Stanley; and plaintiff; 2) declaration of Eric Rifkin (\"Rifkin\"), acting assistant vice president of HBG; 3) a \"Vendor Ledger\" produced by HBG; 4) plaintiff's paystubs; 5) an \"Employee Contact List\" for defendant\n   MH &amp; WH; 6) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") documents pertaining to plaintiff; and 7) plaintiff's first supplemental initial disclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In its motion for partial summary judgment, defendant MH &amp; WH adopts and incorporates by reference the arguments raised by defendant HBG in support of dismissal of plaintiff's NCWHA, assault, battery, and IIED claims; as well as claims for damages comprising actual medical damages, lost wages, and pain and suffering. Defendant MH &amp; WH also moves for summary judgment on plaintiff's FLSA claim on the ground that it did not have sufficient volume of business to meet a statutory threshold of liability. Defendant MH &amp; WH relies upon its answer to plaintiff's second set of interrogatories. Defendant MH &amp; WH also adopts and incorporates by reference the statement of facts of defendant Wendy Howington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In her motion for summary judgment, defendant Wendy Howington seeks dismissal of the FLSA and NCWHA claims asserted against her, on the basis that she is not an employer for purposes of such claims. Defendant Wendy Howington relies upon a statement of material facts, depositions of HBG, MH &amp; WH, Michael Howington, Wendy Howington, and plaintiff, as well as a declaration of Wendy Howington and plaintiff's paystubs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In his motion for summary judgment, defendant Michael Howington seeks dismissal of the FLSA and NCWHA claims asserted against him, on the basis that they are time barred. Defendant Michael Howington relies upon a statement of material facts and depositions of plaintiff and MH &amp; WH.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In her motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiff seeks a determination as a matter of law that defendants MH &amp; WH and HBG jointly employed plaintiff for purposes of each of plaintiff's claims. Plaintiff relies upon a statement of material facts and depositions of MH &amp; WH, HBG, Michael Howington, and Terry Stanley, as well as 1) daily timesheets sample, 2) photos of HBG attire, and 3) a HBG holiday card. In opposition to defendants' motions, plaintiff relies upon opposing statements of material facts and the same depositions relied upon in those motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In joint opposition to plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment, filed April 13, 2018, defendants HBG and MH &amp; WH rely upon an opposing statement of material facts. They also rely upon 1) the depositions relied upon in their motions, 2) declaration of Michael Howington, 3) second declaration of Rifkin, 4) plaintiff's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notice for MH &amp; WH, 5) plaintiff's time sheets and pay stubs, and 6) a HBG gift card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff replied in support of her motion for summary judgment, and defendant HBG replied in support of its motion, on April 26, 2018. No other defendants filed replies in support of their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As pertinent to the instant motions, the undisputed facts and other facts viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff may be summarized as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Defendants' business activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant MH &amp; WH provides construction labor. (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant HBG is a general contractor for residential homes and apartment complexes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At times relevant to the instant case, in 2012-2013, Michael Howington and Wendy Howington were owners and members of MH &amp; WH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   W. Howington Dep. at 7, 19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant MH &amp; WH supplied labor to HBG for construction projects. (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6 5). They maintained the same business address. (Def. HBG Stmt. (DE 150) \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). Defendant Michael Howington was responsible for management of HBG's construction, and he had an ownership interest in HBG. (Pl's Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9). He formed HBG in 2006 with non-party Warren Halle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (MH &amp; WH Dep. (30(b)(6) by M. Howington) pp. 27-28). His management responsibilities for HBG included design, site work, and \"construction management,\" including visiting construction sites to check on the quality of work performed by subcontractors, including MH &amp; WH. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 37-39; Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11). If there was \"something that wasn't going on correctly\" at a job site, he would tell the \"respective supervisors\" on the job site what they needed to do to change it or fix it. (MH &amp; WH Dep. p. 39). HBG held out to the public that defendant Michael Howington was acting in the capacity of a vice president for HBG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   An employee of MH &amp; WH who worked on HBG job sites, Moises Hernandez (\"Hernandez\"), acted as a manager to laborers on HBG job sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 69). Former defendant Terry Stanley was an employee of HBG in the position of a \"superintendent\" on HBG job sites, who supervised twelve MH &amp; WH laborers on HBG job sites and \"told the laborers what to do.\" (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6 15; M. Howington Dep. p. 72; HBG Stmt. (DE 131) \u00b6\u00b6 17-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant Wendy Howington's work for MH &amp; WH included payroll duties; handling insurance and workers compensation; maintaining personnel files for employees of MH &amp; WH; and filling out forms when former employees filed for unemployment. (W. Howington Dep. pp. 11-12, 14-15, 20). MH &amp; WH did not have any other designated employees who performed human resources functions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Defendant Wendy Howington also hired employees to work at a gas station owned by MH &amp; WH, and she supervised those employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Defendant Michael Howington hired non-gas station employees of MH &amp; WH, and he had authority to discipline and fire them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). Defendant Michael Howington, in conjunction with defendant Wendy Howington made a determination whether to classify an employee as exempt or nonexempt for purposes of qualification for overtime pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's employment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In or about the summer of 2012, while plaintiff was working for a construction contractor at an apartment complex building site in Apex, North Carolina, defendant Michael Howington asked plaintiff if she wanted to work for him. (Pl.'s Dep. pp. 31-33). Warren Halle also that same date\n   asked plaintiff if she wanted to work for his company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She responded yes, to both. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She started working at that job site and others, under the direction and supervision of different individuals, including: 1) Mark Gramling (\"Gramling\"), who was a project manager for defendant HBG; 2) Wesley Stanley, who was a supervisor who worked for defendant HBG; 3) Bill Torgeson, who was a supervisor for new home construction for defendant HBG; 4) Rick Cattano, who was a supervisor for new home construction for defendant HBG; 5) Hernandez, who as noted previously was a MH &amp; WH employee working on projects for defendant HBG; and Martin Arias, who was a supervisor who worked on projects for defendant HBG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40; MH &amp; WH Dep. (30(b)(6) by M. Howington) pp. 69, 75, 77, 83, 85). All of these supervisors were able to instruct plaintiff to modify her work and had the ability to terminate plaintiff. (MH &amp; WH Dep. (30(b)(6) by M. Howington) p. 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff filled out daily timesheets captioned \"HALLE BUILDING GROUP DAILY TIME SHEET,\" which recorded her hours and description of work. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 136-2). Plaintiff received a holiday bonus from Warren Halle and Martha Halle, owners of defendant HBG, in an envelope with her name typed on the front of it. (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   DE 136-4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   HBG Dep. (30(b)(6) by Eric Rifkin) pp. 41-43). It was common for defendant HBG to provide a holiday bonus to workers doing work for defendant HBG on its projects. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43). Plaintiff received work clothing marked \"Halle Companies.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , DE 136-3). Gramling led weekly safety meetings for workers at HBG work sites, including plaintiff. (MH &amp; WH Dep. (30(b)(6) by M. Howington) pp. 111-113). Defendant HBG provided to all workers at HBG work sites, including plaintiff, equipment, such as hard hats, gloves, working tools, materials, brooms, shovels, cleaning supplies, and eye protection, as needed for the work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114-116).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In February, 2013, Bill Torgeson and Martin Arias directed plaintiff to work at an apartment complex job site in Holly Springs, and to look for former defendant Stanley and someone named \"Mark\" who would be her supervisors. (Pl's Dep., p. 44). When plaintiff arrived at the Holly Springs job site, Stanley directed her to work on exteriors and set mulch, even though Bill Torgeson and Martin Arias had told her prior to transfer she was going to be \"the sheetrock and paint supervisor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 45). On her second day at the Holly Springs job site, Stanley called plaintiff over to a portion of the job site and, along with Warren Halle and Michael Howington, accused her of \"something having been done wrong that [she] had nothing to do with.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 47). They said \"I worked for them, and I was in charge as a supervisor for the paint and sheetrock[,] and if I could not do my job, to let them know and they would hire somebody else.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Starting about that time, Stanley engaged in a number of practices offensive to plaintiff while supervising and directing plaintiff's work. According to plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [He] grabbed the top of his zipper and then rubbed his part in front of everybody and said in front of everybody that what I needed was that. I needed that to be able to work there. That there only men worked and that women were useless, and that we were only useful for cleaning and having children. And the people around us, I didn't see faces. I just knew they were there. I heard the laughter and the giggling. And people, some of them came up to me and said, \"Well, if\" - you know, they would touch theirs, touch their - their area and say\n   if I needed it, they'd loan it to me, that they'd loan me theirs such that I could work there. That was the first time he did it. I've got that well recorded because it was so humiliating and made - made me a laughing stock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 78). Immediately prior to this incident, plaintiff was sealing wood framing for inspection, and Stanley had directed plaintiff to \"get up on a ladder and seal it properly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 80). They disagreed about whether it had been sealed properly, and \"he said, `No. it's not fine,' and he touched his part. He cackled, and he went all red when he touched his part.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They were in a building working at the time this happened, engaged in sealing the frame. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff reported this incident to defendant Michael Howington, two days later, when she saw him at the MH &amp; WH gas station job site, where she was doing maintenance work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 81). She told him that she \"sensed aggression, that [she] felt harassed, that what [Stanley] had done to [her] when he had touched his part.... And [she] showed him what he had - how he had done it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 82). Michael Howington responded \"Okay, I'll check. Thank you, Maday.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   According to plaintiff, Stanley made \"constant\" offensive comments about gender and gestures of a sexual nature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73). On various occasions he said \"Look, this is why women shouldn't work here. Women can't work here because they can't do the job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"He'd say this to [plaintiff] when he touched his [private] part.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He touched his private area in front of her \"[o]n repeated occasions, including once where \"he grabbed his part and he said to [plaintiff] `Touch, touch, it's good for you. Do you need this?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83). \"When others couldn't do their job, he blamed [plaintiff], [and] he said `Women are only useful for having children and doing cleaning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   One time, when plaintiff used a portable toilet at the construction site, Stanley started banging on the door, and said \"I need you right now. What are you doing in there?\" and \"There shouldn't be bathrooms for women here. These bathrooms are for men, just for men.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). When she got out of the bathroom, he told her to get to work on in prepping for a plumbing and electrical inspection. Plaintiff said \"This is the work of the plumbers,\" and he responded \"Well, this is why you're here. This is what the women are for, to do that which we can't do. And that's how we work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to plaintiff, Terry Stanley also threw tools and items to the ground near plaintiff when directing her to work. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   He called me on the phone and said, \"I need you.\" And I was in the bathroom. I told him \"I'm in the bathroom.\" And he said, \"You come right now.\" I mean, I couldn't even go to the bathroom. It was my break. I didn't eat that day. I showed up and he said, \"We have to turn this over for inspection.\" And I said, \"Look, I've got my food in my hand. Let me go leave it in the truck.\" And he threw the ladder to the floor. And he said, \"No, you work now.\" I said to him, \"I haven't even eaten.\" And he said, \"That's not my problem.\" He said, \"Get to work,\" and he threw my ladder to the floor. Two electricians were there. One of the carpenters there said to me, \"Don't let them treat you like that.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 62). At another time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   It was time to get off, to get off work. And he looked to me. He says, \"Overtime.\" And I said, \"I can't.\" I didn't argue with him. It was obligatory. So he said, \"Well, if you can't, then tomorrow don't come back in.\" So we stayed. He\n   said inspection tomorrow, so we stayed. We were on the lower level. When my coworker was carry - was carrying the ladder as we walk - as - with me.\u00b7 And then he grabs the ladder and throws it to the -throws it down. And says, \"Look, carry it yourself.\" I had my tool bucket. And as I was putting my tool bucket down he says, \"Hurry up, get to work.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 65-66). At another instance when they were working on repairs for an inspection, plaintiff asked him what he wanted her to do, Terry Stanley grabbed a hammer from a set of tools, threw it to the floor in front of plaintiff, looked at plaintiff and \"holler[ed], `Think.'\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 68). On another occasion in discussing a job needing to be done, he threw a hammer on the floor in front of plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 69). According to plaintiff,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   it wasn't just hammers. It wasn't just tools.... it was brooms, buckets, containers. It was always some kind of aggression. He would look at me and say, \"He[y] get it.\" I mean, I'd look at him and he enjoyed it. I can honestly tell he enjoyed it. He laughed. He'd make other people laugh. He enjoyed that. And even when other people weren't around, he would still do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   According to plaintiff, by April 2013, plaintiff tried regularly to avoid direct contact with Terry Stanley while working. One day around that time, according to plaintiff,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Hernandez] was with me that day. And I - I just remember when the other workers said, \"Look, look, here comes Terry, here comes Terry.\" And so I hid. I hid behind a column. And [Hernandez] was with me. And I urinated. I started to cry and I started to shake. And [Hernandez] says to me, he says, \"Calm down.\" That's when I said to him, \"I don't know what's happening to me. This has never happened to me.\" I said, \"I need a change. I just can't bear it.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87).

Plaintiff was working with a co-worker sealing a roof on one portion of the job site about 1:45 in the afternoon, when she got a call from Hernandez, who said that \"Terry Stanley wanted to talk to [plaintiff] and that he was very angry,\" and wanted her to come over to another area of the job site. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90). Plaintiff started to shake and was agitated, but her co-worker, Arturo, offered to come with her and to \"take care of everything.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91). Plaintiff describes the encounter that ensued with Stanley as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   It had been two weeks since I had worked there. He says to me, \"This is\n   your fault.\" I said to him, \"I didn't work here today. Victor was here.\" And he says, \"No, you're the one that's responsible.\" He never called Victor, and he had been - he had been the one who had been working there all day. There was no reason for him to get on me for that work. He says, \"Look, this - this is all trash work. This - this isn't good for anything. This is all trash.\" He says, \"Tomorrow there is an inspection. You're not going to move away from this until you're done with this.\" Arturo had a - a gun with a gas cylinder in it. We both had our sealers. They were new cylinders. We had just loaded them. Arturo had the ladder and he said, \"Don't worry about it. I'll get up there.\" He said, \"I'll seal it.\" Terry Stanley said, \"No, not Arturo. You.\" And I said to him, \"But he's already sealing. Arturo's working.\" He said to me, \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   That's when he got upset, when I said Arturo is already up there sealing. That's when he got upset. And I had the sealer here in this hand, the sealer with the cylinder.

Plaintiff drove herself home, left her truck running, got inside, had a \"terrible headache,\" and felt chills, and pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-95). She tried to get up and she \"couldn't feel\" her body, lost movement in half of her body, and she fell down, hitting herself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant Michael Howington called plaintiff the next day to ask what happened, suggesting that he heard that she cried, and he directed Hernandez also to call plaintiff. Plaintiff talked to Hernandez several times. Hernandez came to see plaintiff several days later and said \"Mike says he can't help you anymore and that you can't count on him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110).

(Compare Compl. Stmt. (DE 6) at 2 with Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 68, 74-75). The second requirement also is met because defendant Michael Howington had notice of the action such that he will not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense to the claim. Defendant Michael Howington was identified in the original complaint by name, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl.

She had a financial interest in MH &amp; WH. (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6 3). Her work for MH &amp; WH included payroll duties; handling insurance and workers compensation; maintaining personnel files for employees of MH &amp; WH; and filling out forms when former employees filed for unemployment. (W. Howington Dep. pp. 11-12, 14-15, 20). MH &amp; WH did not have any other designated employees who performed human resources functions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Defendant Wendy Howington also hired employees to work at a gas station owned by MH &amp; WH, and she supervised those employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). Defendant Michael Howington hired non-gas station employees of MH &amp; WH, and he had authority to discipline and fire them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18). In either case, defendant Michael Howington, in conjunction with defendant Wendy Howington made a determination whether to classify an employee as exempt or nonexempt for purposes of qualification for overtime pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   In addition, according to plaintiff, Wendy Howington managed determination of plaintiff's pay and credit for hours worked. For example, \"Wendy Howington ... said that she wasn't going to pay me for my time because the sheets had disappeared, so there was no way to prove the time I had worked.\" (Pl's Dep. p. 173). According to plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   I always noted where I was, what I was doing, how long I had been there. Because Wendy Howington had told me, \"No sheets, no pay.\" ... And [Wendy Howington] would always say to me, \"Sorry. If there's no way to account for the time, if there's nothing justifying the time on the sheet, we can't pay you for it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174). In addition:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   It was never the right amount. I told her it wasn't the right amount. That's why\n   the secretary here even made note of it. And ... I said, \"No, this is not the right amount. I'm owed more. This is a mockery.\"\n   <em>\n    The secretary said, \"Let me check with Wendy and see what she says\n   </em>\n   .\" And she just said, \"I'm sorry. That's all we're going to give you.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177) (emphasis added). Furthermore:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   I talked to Wendy Howington about it, and she said, \"Well, you're not working.\" I said, \"I am working.\" She said, \"No. You go to the gas station, so those hours get shorted because that's not work.\" I said, \"I am working. I'm told to do that. I'm told to go to the gas station to do maintenance work there.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 178). At one point, plaintiff asked Hernandez about her time sheets and hours, and she asked him \"What's happening with the overtime that I'm owed? ... Can you help me resolve my problem?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190). He responded: \"I'll take care of stuff that I am noting presently.\n   <em>\n    All that, you take of that with Wendy [Howington]\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (emphasis added). At another point, she went to Michael Howington and said, \"Look, why is it that you're asking me to work overtime, I work it, and I'm not getting paid?\" He said, \"\n   <em>\n    Look you fix that with Wendy [Howington]\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192) (emphasis added). When plaintiff then talked to Wendy Howington, she said \"\n   <em>\n    I don't pay extra hours\n   </em>\n   ,\" and, according to plaintiff, she kept saying \"\n   <em>\n    I'll fix it next week\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192-93) (emphasis added). Wendy Howington also stated that plaintiff's hourly records were \"lost.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194). According to plaintiff, \"Wendy would grab whatever available pretext to discount time and money from my checks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In sum, drawing inferences in the light most favorable to plaintiff, defendant Wendy Howington was intimately involved in determining the extent of plaintiff's compensable time, setting policies and procedures for time recording, and acting as the final arbiter of time and pay grievances. She maintained employment records, and she also told plaintiff that her hourly records were lost. She thus had considerable control over whether and how much plaintiff would be paid for her work for defendant WH &amp; MH and at HBG construction sites. Accordingly, based on the totality of the circumstances, plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issues as to whether defendant Wendy Howington was an employer within the meaning of the FLSA and NCWHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defendant Wendy Howington argues, nonetheless, that she was not an employer based upon several factors. For example, she notes she was employed in a \"clerical capacity\" on a part time basis, and did not have any input over employee work schedules or conditions of employment. (W. Howington Mem. (DE 138) at 6, 8). But, in so characterizing her work, she draws inferences in a light favorable to her, and not to plaintiff, based upon plaintiff's testimony as set forth above. She also notes she had no authority to hire or fire plaintiff. But, that factor alone is not determinative to the analysis of whether she was acting in the capacity of plaintiff's employer. Crediting plaintiff's testimony, there is sufficient evidence of Wendy Howington's control over time records, determining plaintiff's pay, and addressing issues with pay and time records, coupled with ownership interest in WH &amp; MH, to create a genuine issue of fact over her status as an employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Therefore, defendant Wendy Howington's motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    4. FLSA Claim Against Defendant MH &amp; WH\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendant MH &amp; WH argues that is not subject to the FLSA because it did not\n   have a sufficient annual gross volume of business done during the relevant time period to qualify as a covered entity under the statute. As set forth below, however, plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence for trial that defendants HBG and MH &amp; WH operated as a single enterprise for purposes of her FLSA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The FLSA imposes minimum wage and maximum requirements for employees employed \"in an enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207.

Defendant MH &amp; WH supplied labor to HBG for construction projects. (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6 5). They maintained the same business address. (Def. HBG Stmt. (DE 150) \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4).

He formed HBG in 2006 with non-party Warren Halle. (MH &amp; WH Dep. (30(b)(6) by M. Howington) pp. 27-28). His management responsibilities for HBG included design, site work, and \"construction management,\" including visiting construction sites to check on the quality of work performed by subcontractors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   pp. 37-39; Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11). HBG held out to the public that defendant Michael Howington was acting in the capacity of a vice president for HBG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62-63). An employee of MH &amp; WH who worked on HBG job sites, Moises Hernandez (\"Hernandez\"), acted as a manager to laborers on HBG job sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 69).

Indeed, every alleged interaction plaintiff describes with Stanley occurred at an HBG job site where Stanley was directing, supervising, and correcting, work by plaintiff and other laborers on the job site. (Pl's Dep. pp. 44-48, 62, 65-66, 68, 72-74, 78, 80, 86-93). Plaintiff describes Stanley directing her to start work, carry out tasks in particular ways, fix issues, and continue working to prepare for inspections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The last interaction between plaintiff and Stanley, where Stanley allegedly assaulted and battered plaintiff, took place directly in the course of Stanley directing plaintiff to climb a ladder to fix a sealing issue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86-93).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Defendants HBG and MH &amp; WH argue that Stanley was not acting in the course of their business because he was not actually authorized to supervise plaintiff and he was mistaken in believing that plaintiff was a HBG employee. They rely upon, for example, a declaration by Rifkin, wherein he states \"Stanley should not have supervised or directed Plaintiff's work,\" and he \"should have instructed a subcontractor's supervisor if [he] identified an issue with the quality of work performed by a subcontractor's laborers.\" (Rifkin 2nd Decl. (DE 151-8) \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Rifkin, however, commenced his position with defendant HBG in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). In light of other evidence in the record bearing upon Stanley's authority in 2012, Rifkin's declaration is not determinative as a matter of law on whether Stanley was acting within the scope of his employment and implied authority in 2012. Equally probative, for example, is the testimony of defendant Howington, who in 2012 was acting in the position of vice president of defendant HBG, responsible for management of HBG's construction, including visiting construction sites to check on the quality of work performed by subcontractors. ((Pl's Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9); MH &amp; WH Dep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   (30(b)(6) by M. Howington pp. 37-39, 62-63; (Pl's Stmt. (DE 145) \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11). According to him, if there was \"something that wasn't going on correctly\" at a job site, Stanley would tell the \"respective supervisors\" on the job site what they needed to do to change it or fix it. (MH &amp; WH Dep. p. 39). According to Michael Howington, Stanley supervised laborers on HBG job sites and \"told the laborers what to do.\" (M. Howington Dep. p. 72).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Rifkin's statement also conflicts with Stanley's own testimony and plaintiff's testimony about what he actually did and was expected to do at that time. Stanley testified that he supervised about twelve people, including plaintiff, in his position of \"supervisor\" for defendant HBG in 2012. (Stanley Dep. (DE 136-7) at 14, 18, 27).

This undisputed fact satisfies the second FLSA factor that \"\n   <em>\n    as a matter of practice\n   </em>\n   , the putative joint employers jointly ... allocate the power to - directly\n   <em>\n    or indirectly\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    modify the terms or conditions\n   </em>\n   of the worker's employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n    848 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   Third, there is a significant \"degree of permanency\" and \"common control\" between the putative joint employers,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   as demonstrated through defendants' own statement of facts. They operated out of the same office. (HBG Opp. Stmt. (DE 150) \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4). Defendant \"MH &amp; WH supplied labor to [defendant HBG] for construction projects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). Michael Howington, owner and member of MH &amp; WH, \"was a limited partner in [HBG],\" and \"owned a financial interest in [HBG]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8; HBG Stmt. (DE 131) \u00b6 3;). Michael Howington \"was responsible for management of [HBG's] construction,\" and he \"visit[ed] construction sites to check on the quality of work performed by the subcontractors,\" one of which was MH &amp; WH. (HBG Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 11). HBG managers and supervisors, such as Gramling, Stanley, Torgeson, and Cattano, were \"responsible for supervising ... MH &amp; WH\" on HBG construction sites. (HBG Opp. Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13-16). Stanley reported to Gramling, who reported to Michael Howington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Fourth, plaintiff's work was performed on a premises \"controlled by\" defendant HBG, where the defendant HBG supplied \"facilities, equipment, tools, or materials necessary to complete the work.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n    848 F.3d at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular plaintiff worked at HBG \"construction sites.\" (HBG Opp. Stmt. \u00b6 11). HBG, \"as a general contractor, held weekly safety meetings for all subcontractors on the jobsite.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28). HBG \"makes available for all subcontractors certain equipment and materials, such as skid steer, a forklift, gloves, hardhats, eye protection, nails, and brooms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). HBG \"had the authority to direct a subcontractor that one of its laborers could not work on the jobsite.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32). On occasion, \"Warren Halle and Martha Halle would distribute holiday gift cards at jobsites.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   In light of these facts satisfying components of each of the FLSA factors, plaintiff has demonstrated as a matter of law that defendants HBG and MH &amp; WH are \"not completely disassociated\" with respect to plaintiff such that they \"codetermine - formally or informally, directly or indirectly - the essential terms and conditions of [plaintiff's] employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n    848 F.3d at 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   The court recognizes that some components of the FLSA factors are not met by application of the facts viewed in light most favorable to defendants, particularly functions such as \"handling payroll; providing workers' compensation insurance; paying payroll taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n    848 F.3d at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The weight of the factors, however, support a determination as a matter of law of joint employment liability under the FLSA, particularly where several factors as set forth by the court in\n   <em>\n    Salinas\n   </em>\n   contain qualifications, including \"as a matter of practice,\" \"direct or indirect,\" and other alternative means of satisfying each factor, with the ultimate focus on \"whether two entities are `\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   independent' or `not\n   <em>\n    completely\n   </em>\n   disassociated.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277286\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/125/#p133\">\n    at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). This low bar, as articulated by the Fourth Circuit, is met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Accordingly, summary judgment for plaintiff is warranted on the issue of joint employer liability for purposes of the FLSA. That determination also applies to the remaining portion of plaintiff's NCWHA claim, in light of the incorporation of FLSA law therein, as set forth above at section B.5. of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   By contrast, joint employer liability under Title VII is not so expansive as it is under the FLSA to permit a determination as a matter of law on this issue. Many of the Title VII factors are stated in less qualified manner than FLSA factors, or are more specific, setting up a genuine issue of fact as to their resolution based on the same record. Where many FLSA factors can be satisfied by alternative means, Title VII factors are not so broadly worded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   For example, the factors \"authority to hire and fire the individual\" and \"formal and informal training,\"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277811\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/404/#p414\">\n    793 F.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , do not resolve as a matter of law in favor of plaintiff where \"Stanley never fired or disciplined any laborers,\" \"Hernandez trained Plaintiff,\" and \"Howington hired plaintiff.\" (HBG Opp Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 27; HBG Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14). Regarding \"possession of and responsibility over the individual's employment records, including payroll, insurance, and taxes,\" HBG \"did not create, maintain or keep any time records for MH &amp; WH laborers.\" (HBG Opp. Stmt. \u00b6 18). Whether plaintiff's \"duties are akin to a regular employee's duties\" invites comparison between plaintiff and undisputed employees of defendant HBG, such as Stanley, who had much different duties than plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36). Whether plaintiff \"is assigned solely to the putative employer\" heightens the importance of the fact that plaintiff reported for work regularly at a gas station owned by MH &amp; WH, which had nothing to do with HBG. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   While, of course, there is some overlap between portions of FLSA and Title VII factors and facts pertinent thereto (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FLSA: \"direct, control, or supervise the worker\"; Title VII: \"day-to-day supervision of the individual, including employee discipline\"), summary judgment is precluded under the stricter Title VII standard emphasizing \"common-law element of control\" and \"application of traditional agency law principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277811\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/404/#p414\">\n    793 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   412 n. 10 &amp; 414. Therefore, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is denied in this part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   For the same reason, given the incorporation of common law into Title VII, summary judgment on this issue for plaintiff's common law claims is not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    McCown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135925\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/353/683/#p688\">\n    353 N.C. at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=549%20S.E.2d%20175\">\n    549 S.E.2d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, published cases cited by plaintiff pertaining to her tort claims concern the question of whether an employee was an independent contractor for purposes of Title VII and North Carolina law.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Farlow v.

These cases do not analyze whether two entity defendants are \"joint employers,\" and they do not provide a basis at this time for grant of summary judgment on an issue of \"joint employer\" liability for purposes of plaintiff's common law torts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In sum, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of \"joint employer\" liability is granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on those parts of her FLSA and NCWHA claims raising the issue of whether defendants HBG and MH &amp; WH were\n   joint employers for purposes of FLSA and NCWHA liability. Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on the issue of joint employer liability is denied in remaining part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court orders as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   1) Motions for partial summary judgment by defendants MH &amp; WH and HBG (DE 129, 140) are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.
