INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Spangler Candy Company moved for a preliminary injunction against Defendant Tootsie Roll Industries, LLC. (Doc. No. 17). In response, Tootsie opposed the injunction, (Doc. Nos. 25 (sealed) &amp; 26 (redacted) ), and moved to exclude expert testimony and reports introduced by Spangler in its motion for preliminary injunction. (Doc. No. 24). Spangler then filed a memorandum in opposition to expert exclusion, (Doc. Nos. 39 (sealed) &amp; 40 (redacted) ), and a reply in support of injunctive relief sought. (Doc. Nos. 37 (sealed) &amp; 38 (redacted) ). Following this briefing and at the request of the parties, I held oral argument on these matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This litigation is centered upon the two lollipop bags pictured above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bag on the left is manufactured by Spangler, the one on the right by Tootsie. The undisputed facts are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011, after spending 20 months and more than $220,000 in an effort to \"refresh its DUM DUMS packaging,\" Spangler began using the packaging shown above. (Doc. No. 17-2 at 3-4). Since that time, DUM DUMS have been continuously sold in this packaging. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, CHARMS MINI POPS , which then appeared in the packaging above, held only 0.04% of the lollipop market. (Doc. No. 25-1 at 2). Because Spangler had been gaining market share and was approaching that of Tootsie's, Tootsie developed a strategy in which CHARMS MINI POPS would compete with DUM DUMS. (Doc. No. 36-8, Doc. No. 36-13). Although the price and value competition strategy was introduced in January 2017, the idea of changing the packaging was not considered until May 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Doc. No. 36-8; Doc. No. 36-12 at 23). By July 2017, the red packaging first appeared in Tootsie materials, and by September 2017, the design had been approved for use. (Doc. No. 36-3 at 4, Doc. No. 36-5, Doc. No. 36-6). Although Tootsie enlisted the services of a third-party consultant, Cassata &amp; Associates, to develop initial designs, none of Cassata's proposed designs were used.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 36-1; Doc. No. 36-12 at 17-18). Instead, with knowledge of DUM DUMS trade dress and using no market research, Tootsie completely redesigned the package in only five months. (Doc. No. 36-4; Doc. No. 36-12 at 31-32; Doc. No. 36-13 at 39, 41, 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Spangler learned of the new CHARMS MINI POPS packaging in March 2018 and sent a cease-and-desist letter on April 3, 2018. (Doc. No. 25-2 at 20; Doc. No. 37-2 at 2-3). Tootsie promptly rejected Spangler's demand on April 12, 2018. (Doc. No. 37-2 at 4-6). After concluding Tootsie intended wide distribution, Spangler filed suit in May 2018. (Doc. No. 1; Doc. No. 37 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

STEVE ULINE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Tootsie moves to exclude the report of Steve Uline on grounds that it will not help the trier of fact, alleging the report states only conclusory opinions \"based on no relevant data or reliable methodology.\" (Doc. No. 24-1 at 15). In part, I agree. But because Uline has the expertise necessary to testify to the product development process through his background and experience in marketing and branding, this section of the report is admitted. (Doc. No. 17-3 at 7-15; Doc. No. 24-6 at 12-13). Conversely, the remainder of his report must be excluded. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 16-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The sections to be excluded are based upon unverified methodology and questionable sources rather than \" 'a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant] discipline.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kumho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p147\">\n    526 U.S. at 141, 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/#p147\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    509 U.S. at 592, 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/#p592\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). First, Uline has no \"specialized knowledge\" of many of the topics on which he opines. (Doc. No. 24-6 at 7, 9). Instead, his opinion is informed by various blogs\n   and articles he discovered through internet searches conducted in preparation of this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6). Second, though he quotes extensively to these articles and blogs in the report and bases his opinion on them, Uline did not know many of the sources or authors and was unable to attest to their reputation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-14). Finally, Uline did not verify the underlying data and methodology used to reach the conclusions upon which he relies and quotes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Therefore, Tootsie's motion to exclude in granted in part as to Uline's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Tootsie argues the\n   <em>\n    Squirt\n   </em>\n   survey\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   conducted by Spangler expert, Mark Keegan, must be excluded because the flaws are too great.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Keegan's survey, conducted through online interviewing, began with several screener questions to identify the survey population. Tootsie challenges neither these questions nor the survey population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After performing screener questions and receiving general instructions, respondents were shown the DUM DUMS package and instructed, \"Imagine that you are shopping for candy in a store or online. Please consider this product as you would if you encountered it while shopping for candy and are deciding whether to purchase it.\" (Doc. No. 18 at 47). Although Keegan testified he was \"satisfied\" respondents viewed the product for a sufficient amount of time to consider the product as instructed, (Doc. No. 24-2 at 9), no evidence was produced to indicate how long respondents viewed this screen before clicking \"Next\" to continue. This was the only time respondents were able to view the DUM DUMS product during the survey. (Doc. No. 18 at 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Before proceeding to the likelihood-of-confusion measurement questions, respondents were directed to a screen that possessed no question but only the instruction, \"Again, imagine that you are shopping for candy in a store or online. You will now be shown several additional candy products and asked your opinions about them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After clicking \"Next\" again, respondents performed two likelihood-of-confusion measurement questions. Both began with an instruction to \"think of the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     first\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   candy product you saw earlier in this survey.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17,19, 49, 51) (emphasis in original). The first question asked, \"For each candy product shown below, please drag and drop each product into the boxes on the right to indicate whether you believe that the product is put out by the\n   <strong>\n    same company\n   </strong>\n   that puts out the first product you saw, a\n   <strong>\n    different company\n   </strong>\n   from the company that puts out the first product you saw, or you\n   <strong>\n    don't know\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, 49) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Respondents then proceeded to the second screen and were asked, \"For each candy product shown below, please drag and drop each product into the boxes on\n   the right to indicate whether you believe that the product is put out by a company that is\n   <strong>\n    affiliated, connected, or associated\n   </strong>\n   with the company that puts out the first product you saw; a company that is\n   <strong>\n    not affiliated, connected, or associated\n   </strong>\n   with the company that puts out the first product you saw; or you\n   <strong>\n    don't know\n   </strong>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 51) (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The controls pictured above were arranged vertically below each question, along with the experimental stimulus - the red CHARMS MINI POPS bag. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, 20, 49-52). Next to the column of products was the column of three boxes, which were headed with the boldfaced language of the three options for each respective question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). For each question, respondents were able to \"click on each product to view a larger image.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17,19, 49, 51). Additionally, \"[t]he presentation order of the products was randomized across all respondents in each question to minimize the potential for order bias.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Following these two close-ended questions, the survey \"concluded with several standard demographic questions regarding household income and education level, as well as a final attention filter question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Controls\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In support of exclusion, Tootsie first makes a two-part challenge to the controls used in the survey. Tootsie first claims Keegan should have used a \"control group\" rather than multiple \"control products\" in a sample group. But while the use of proper controls is necessary, a control\n   <em>\n    group\n   </em>\n   is not mandated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the\n   <em>\n    Reference Guide on Survey Research\n   </em>\n   , cited by Tootsie, states, \"Control groups and, as a second choice, control questions are the most reliable means for assessing response levels against the baseline level of error associated with a particular question.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shari Seidman Diamond,\n   <em>\n    Reference Guide on Survey Research\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 359, 401 (3d ed. 2011) (attached as Doc. No. 24-3 at 47). Therefore, Keegan's choice to use controls products rather\n   than a control group is not grounds for exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Turning to Tootsie second control-related challenge, Tootsie argues the control products chosen produced unreliable results since they resembled neither DUM DUMS nor CHARMS MINI POPS . In response, Spangler relies on Keegan's compliance with the\n   <em>\n    Reference Guide on Survey Research\n   </em>\n   , which states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In designing a survey-experiment, the expert should select a stimulus for the control group that shares as many characteristics with the experimental stimulus as possible, with the key exception of the characteristic whose influence is being assessed....Nor should the control stimulus share with the experimental stimulus the feature whose impact is being assessed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Diamond,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 399-400 (cited by Doc. No. 39 at 7). This instruction makes the task of selecting control stimuli especially difficult when many characteristics of the experimental stimulus are being assessed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacoby, 92 Trademark Rep. at 928-29 (acknowledging the complexity of the issue of \"how to design a 'fair' and proper control when deleting one allegedly confusing (or diluting) element would leave many others intact\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There is a fine line between finding a control which is similar enough to provide accurate results as to likelihood of confusion but not\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   similar so as to cause confusion itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 931. \"Strong\" controls have more common features with the product at issue but are more likely to cause confusion themselves, resulting in a \"conservative estimate of 'net confusion.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 935-37. \"Weak\" controls with fewer common features have the opposite result and are \"likely to yield inflated estimates of 'net' confusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 932-33. Ultimately, \"[p]roper controls will approximate 'background noise,' the amount of confusion existing due to reasons unrelated to similarities in trade dresses. Those controls must sufficiently account for factors legally irrelevant to the requisite confusion, so that confusion 'caused by' similarities in the trade dresses can be isolated.\"\n   <em>\n    Cumberland\n   </em>\n   , 32 F.Supp.2d at 574-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Due in part to the complexity and arbitrariness of control choice, courts have been reluctant to exclude a survey based on inadequate controls alone.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Innovation Ventures, LLC v.

(Doc. No. 37 at 7). Further, with respect to advertising, Spangler asserts that, while it \"lacks the scale necessary for television and mass media advertising,\" the trade dress in itself should be considered the\n   principle vehicle for advertising in support of this factor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; Doc. No. 25-2 at 21). Because Spangler does not advertise in any way other than by placing its product on a shelf, this factor need not be considered, either. Therefore, four factors remain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The amount-of-sales and established-place-in-the-market factors weigh in Spangler's favor, since DUM DUMS is \"the best-selling lollipop brand in the United States, with significant sales\" and strong brand loyalty. (Doc. No. 37 at 9; Doc. No. 25-3 at 2; Doc. No. 25-4 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Regarding the exclusivity, length, and manner of use, Spangler concedes that it has been using this specific packaging only since 2011 but asserts it \"has used red packaging and many of the same graphic elements to market and sell DUM DUMS \u00ae for over 23 years.\" (Doc. No. 17-1 at 13). Tootsie does not dispute this but contends Spangler has not had\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   use of this trade dress since that time, pointing to the numerous candies packaged in red bags with windows and violators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 26-1). To rebut Tootsie's argument and prove this factor, Spangler states that while other candy bags possess some of the same elements, the combination of these elements is exclusive to the DUM DUMS trade dress. This is true. But due to the similarities between the DUM DUMS bag and others on the market, I find that though this factor weighs in favor of Spangler due to its length of use\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and possible exclusivity, it must be given little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, to prove intentional copying, Spangler points to the obvious resemblance between the new CHARMS MINI POPS bag and the DUM DUMS bag. (Doc. No. 17-1 at 15). Tootsie offers little in the way of rebuttal, other than to conflate intent to copy with intent to deceive. (Doc. No. 25 at 22). But, as Spangler correctly notes, the intent to\n   <em>\n    copy\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the intent to\n   <em>\n    deceive\n   </em>\n   ; secondary meaning requires intent to copy alone. (Doc. No. 37 at 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Groeneveld Transp. Efficiency, Inc. v. Lubecore Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702479\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/494/#p514\">\n    730 F.3d 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514 (6th Cir. 2013) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Here, Tootsie's Charms Division Director of Marketing testified Tootsie's intent in the redesign was to develop a bag that was better than its primary competitor - DUM DUMS - and ultimately obtain\n   market share at the expense of DUM DUMS . (Doc. No. 36-12 at 21, 28-30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. Nos. 36-2, 36-3, 36-4, Doc. No. 36-13 at 20, 22-23). Without market research and with full knowledge of the appearance of the DUM DUMS bag, Tootsie chose a package with elements that were nearly identical to that of the DUM DUMS bag. (Doc. No. 36-4; Doc. No. 36-12 at 31-32; Doc. No. 36-13 at 39, 41, 45-46). Tootsie specifically recognized the similarity between the violators' color scheme, had multiple other options, and chose to proceed with the similar design anyway. (Doc. No. 25-1 at 5; Doc. No. 36-13 at 46-47, 61-62).

Likely Degree of Purchaser Care\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As acknowledged by Tootsie, there is a \"general proposition that the average customer is likely not to exercise a high degree of care in purchasing relatively inexpensive and fungible products, such as snack food.\"\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411797\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/295/641/#p646\">\n    295 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   649-50 (citing cases).

Accordingly, applying the logic articulated in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , due to the anticipated proximity on shelves coupled with the fact that lollipop buyers are unlikely to exercise a high degree of care with selection, this factor weighs strongly in Spangler's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    v.

(Doc. No. 25-1 at 5-6; Doc. No. 36-13 at 46-47, 49-50, 61-62). While Tootsie Roll alleges the \"Shop &amp; Compare\" violator along with the CHARMS name evinces an intent to compete rather than deceive,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   I do not agree. Tootsie\n   admits its consumers spend merely seconds picking out the package, basing the decision on recognition, possibly without even reading the package. (Doc. No. 36-13 at 48-49). Further, Tootsie made no attempt to introduce the same competitive pricing scheme with the old yellow package before investing nearly $1 million in the packaging redesign and the new product launch. (Doc. No. 25-1 at 6; Doc. No. 36-13 at 55, 59, 62). Finally, the product redesign process used by Tootsie did not consist of market research and was complete in a quarter of the time Spangler used to redesign the DUM DUMS trade dress years prior. (Doc. No. 17-2 at 3-4; Doc. No. 36-4; Doc. No. 36-12 at 31-32; Doc.

This intent along with other evidence also supports a conclusion that Tootsie acted with the intent to deceive.

(Doc. No. 25-1 at 6-7). First, Tootsie has already invested $1 million in the product redesign and launch and would have to invest more money and time into a second redesign. Second, Tootsie claims a second redesign so soon after the first could damage the company's image as a whole. Spangler challenges the legitimacy of these claims, stating that since CHARMS MINI POPS are already sold in a different package at Wal-Mart, the cost would not be as great as Tootsie alleges. (Doc. No. 37 at 21). I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Tootsie has already designed and is using an alternative bag for one of its three nationwide distributors. (Doc. No. 36-12 at 40, 50-51; Doc. No. 36-13 at 34-35, 59-60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Therefore, while Tootsie may experience some hardship in repackaging the existing inventory into the white Wal-Mart bags, it would not be burdened with a complete redesign. Because Tootsie's burden in transferring inventory to an existing package is substantially less than Spangler's loss of goodwill and reputation, this factor weighs in Spangler's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Spangler alleges a preliminary injunction will halt customer confusion in the marketplace. Tootsie claims the injunction would have a chilling effect on competition. After considering both arguments, I agree with Spangler. As stated above, I do not find merit in Tootsie procompetitive argument in this case of aesthetic packaging trade dress infringement. Competition is not threatened if Tootsie continues to offer CHARMS MINI POPS at the same competitive pricing in the already-existing alternative packaging. Therefore, this final factor weighs in Spangler's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Although Tootsie is correct in its assertion that the court ultimately found the mark in question had not acquired a secondary meaning, the court noted that the \"exclusivity, length, and manner of use\" factor weighed in the plaintiff's favor because plaintiff had been using the mark \"exclusively and consistently for approximately 20 years.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316357\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/612/269/\">\n     612 F.

Second, finding the functional product\n    <em>\n     design\n    </em>\n    had not been copied with the intent to deceive,\n    <em>\n     Groeneveld\n    </em>\n    relied upon the procompetitive interests served by giving consumers an alternative option which presumably operated in the same manner as the original but was simply offered by a different manufacturer.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702479\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/494/#p514\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 511-16 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    1 McCarthy \u00a7 8.5 (distinguishing \"product design\" from traditional trade dress). Here, the trade dress at issue is not functional product\n    <em>\n     design\n    </em>\n    but a nonfunction product\n    <em>\n     packaging\n    </em>\n    . Thus, in providing an alternative in the marketplace, the trade dress alone would not serve the same procompetitive purpose of alerting the consumer that the product operated in the same manner. As such, this case appears to be more of a \"masquerade\"\n    <em>\n     Groeneveld\n    </em>\n    cautioned against than an attempt to \"us[e] a functional product's look to promote a competitive offering.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702479\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/494/#p514\">\n     730 F.3d at 514-15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Following\n    <em>\n     Wynn Oil II\n    </em>\n    which found a two-year delay did not preclude injunctive relief, I find Spangler's months-long delay does not preclude injunctive relief either.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855901\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/943/595/#p608\">\n     943 F.2d at 607-08\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
