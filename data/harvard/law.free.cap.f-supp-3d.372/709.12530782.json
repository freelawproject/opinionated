Defendant Interstate Warehousing filed its \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to the Enforceability of the Limitation of Liability Contract Clause and Plaintiff's Spoliation of Evidence Claims\" on August 29, 2018 (ECF 35), to which Plaintiff Aspen American Insurance filed a response on October 29, 2018 (ECF 42) and Interstate filed a reply on December 12, 2018 (ECF 48). Aspen filed its motion for partial summary judgment on October 29, 2018 (ECF 40), to which Interstate filed a response on December 26, 2018 (ECF 51) and Aspen filed a reply on January 9, 2019 (ECF 53). For the reasons explained below, Defendant Interstate's motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, and Plaintiff Aspen's motion is DENIED.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Eastern Fish Company sells and distributes frozen seafood and contracted to store some of its products-about $ 2.5 million worth-in Interstate's cold-storage warehouse in Hudsonville, Michigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 1-2. The frozen seafood was then distributed to grocery stores for sale to consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 1. On March 8, 2014, part of the roof of Interstate's Hudsonville warehouse collapsed due to heavy snow, \"subjecting the temperature-sensitive products within the Warehouse to temperature damage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 2.

Aspen \"paid Eastern Fish for [its] loss in return for subrogation rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Aspen brought this suit to recoup its money, contending that the loss of Eastern Fish's products was Interstate's fault. Aspen contends that Interstate knew or should have known that the warehouse in Hudsonville was structurally unable to handle the weight of excessive snow and therefore Interstate should be made to pay the loss incurred by Eastern Fish as a result of what Aspen alleges was a preventable incident. Interstate, however, insists that \"Eastern Fish ... and Defendant entered into a warehouse contract and rate quotation ... which contained a standard, industry-wide used, liability and limitation of damages provision ... which limits the liability for damages claimed in Plaintiff's Complaint to approximately $ 128,400, if Defendant is found legally liable.\" Defendant's Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF 36), p. 1. Interstate also insists that the roof collapse was the result of an \"Act of God, occurring without the fault of Interstate.\" Defendant's Response in Opposition (ECF 51), p. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Interstate argues that the limitation of damages provision included in its contract with Eastern Fish is valid and enforceable, and the company seeks summary judgment on that issue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Interstate also seeks summary judgment on Aspen's \"claims of spoliation of evidence and intentional spoliation of evidence [because they] are not recognized independent causes of action under either Indiana or Michigan laws[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Aspen argues that Interstate cannot limit its liability because the actions of its employees and agents before and after the roof collapse constituted \"breach of bailment, conversion and gross negligence.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support (ECF 41), p. 3. Aspen maintains it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on those three claims and that the Court should award Plaintiff more than $ 2.6 million for the loss of its food products, nearly $ 8 million in treble damages, and several hundred thousand more in prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Summary judgment is not appropriate if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. We must look therefore at the evidence as a jury might, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and avoiding the temptation to decide which party's version of the facts is more likely true.

The case is before this Court on diversity jurisdiction because Plaintiff Aspen \"is a Texas corporation with its principal place of business located in Rocky Hill, Connecticut ... [and] Defendant, Interstate, is an Indiana corporation with a principal place of business in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\" Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 3. However, the events giving rise to this lawsuit occurred at Interstate's warehouse in Hudsonville, Michigan. In its brief in support of its motion for partial summary judgment, filed on August 29, 2018, Interstate stated that \"[i]t has yet to be determined whether Michigan or Indiana law will apply to the facts of this matter[ ]\" but added that \"Defendant asserts that Michigan law applies[.]\" Defendant's Memorandum in Support, p. 1. At that point, Interstate\n   presented its arguments \"under Michigan and Indiana law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107579\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/767/#p770\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 2. Aspen, in its memorandum in support of its own motion for partial summary judgment filed on October 29, 2018, also argued that Michigan law applies. Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, pp. 12-15. By the time Interstate filed its reply brief in support of its motion on December 12, 2018, the parties apparently had concluded and agreed that Michigan law applies, since Interstate discusses only Michigan law in that brief. Defendant's Reply Brief (ECF 48). The final round of briefs, including Defendant's Response in Opposition (ECF 51) filed on December 26, 2018, and Plaintiff's Reply in Support (ECF 53) filed on January 9, 2019, apply and discuss\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   Michigan law. The Court agrees and will apply Michigan law for the reason argued by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Memorandum in Support, pp. 1-2 (\"Michigan law applies because it is the state with the most intimate contacts to the facts and location of the alleged property damage\"); Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 15 (\"The place of all of the wrongs complained of, including the final destruction of the Food Products ... occurred in Michigan.\").

Interstate insists there are no material disputes about the contractual language or that spoliation allegations cannot be brought as independent causes of action and so Interstate is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on both issues.

Amended Complaint (ECF 3), pp. 3-14. All of those claims are based on Aspen's allegations that Interstate was negligent-grossly negligent, in fact-in not preventing the roof collapse at its warehouse. The factual foundation for all of Aspen's claims is summarized in the following excerpts the Complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [D]efendant breached its duties and obligations under the agreement of the parties, and breached its obligations as bailee of the food products, in one or more of the following ways:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) Failing to deliver the food products to Eastern in good order and condition;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (b) Failing to take reasonable measures to prevent a roof collapse on the premises;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (c) Failure to take reasonable measures to safeguard the food products while in its care, custody and control; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (d) Otherwise failed to perform pursuant to the agreement of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=871%20N.W.2d%20136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 14 (\"Count X (Bailment)\").

B (Warehousing Contract). Interstate maintains the clause is enforceable under the circumstances and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue. Aspen responds by arguing that Interstate was grossly negligent, for the reasons already set forth in detail above, which nullifies the limitation clause (or at least creates \"questions of material fact regarding whether defendant can limit its liability[ ]\"). Plaintiff's Response in Opposition, p. 1. The Court agrees with Aspen. To understand why Interstate is not entitled to summary judgment on the limitation of liability issue, it is necessary to turn the focus to the issue of gross negligence as presented in Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment (a result of the aforementioned intertwined or interdependent nature of the issues).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Interstate concedes that \"pursuant to Michigan common law, contractual provisions that limit liability do not apply to gross negligence[ ]\" and states that it \"does not contest [Aspen's] recitation or understanding of Michigan common law with respect to the non-application of limitation of liability provisions in cases of gross negligence[.]\" Defendant's Reply in Support (ECF 48), p. 6. In other words, Interstate concedes that it cannot limit its liability under the contract if its own gross negligence was the proximate cause of the loss of Eastern Fish's products. Nonetheless, Interstate insists that Aspen has it all wrong on the underlying facts and that the actions of Interstate's employees before and after the roof collapse demonstrate a good faith effort to deal with a potential problem, as well as their inability to do anything following an historic amount of snowfall (i.e., the Act of God). Interstate claims that Aspen \"makes purported statements of material fact that are not supported by the evidence, are gross misstatements of the evidence and/or testimony in this matter, or are simply false[.]\" Defendant's Response in Opposition (ECF 51), p. 3. Notwithstanding those objections, Interstate also states that \"[d]espite the various inconsistencies and omissions of [Aspen] described above, [Aspen's] statement of material facts is largely consistent with [Interstate's] understanding of the material facts in this matter. However, there remain significant and genuine disputes as to what the material facts establish, and [Interstate] contends that [Aspen] is not entitled to summary judgment on its claims of breach of bailment, conversion, and/or gross negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457078\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For example, Interstate challenges Aspen's assertion that Interstate had no plans, policies or procedures regarding snow removal at the warehouse.

However, earlier in the same deposition, Mr. Tippmann described the\n   <em>\n    informal\n   </em>\n   verbal snow removal policies, those being that warehouse personnel would routinely remove snow from around the opening of the scuppers (drains) and drainage paths when the accumulation would exceed an estimated ten (10) inches.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457078\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Interstate also argues that Aspen \"fails to recognize that during winter months, Hudsonville, Michigan, and thus, the subject warehouse, had historically received great amounts of lake effect snow.

During the months of January and February 2014, alone, more than 70 inches of snow fell in Hudsonville with an additional three inches of snow falling in the week leading up to the collapse.... Therefore, due to the unusual amount of snowfall during the winter of 2013/2014, Interstate determined that the loss was occasioned by an Act of God, and issued a letter to Eastern [Fish] stating such on March 14, 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457078\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Interstate also insists that Aspen's factual recitation \"leads the Court to believe that no one [at Interstate] inspected up close the steel joists that ultimately failed after becoming concerned of the snow load on the warehouse roof and before the collapse.... However, [Aspen] conveniently fails to disclose that, on February 24, 2014, Andy Bobay, corporate engineer for Interstate, inspected the steel joists that ultimately failed up close using a scissor lift[ ]\" and \"indicated that he did not see any deflection or waviness in the steel joists at that time. Thereafter, Nate Tippmann and Leroy Lozada continued to look for signs of structural strain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457078\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 5-6. Interstate argues that these facts demonstrate that it attempted to deal with the snow accumulation issue-and that those attempts were for naught due to an Act of God. Therefore, Interstate argues, its actions leading up to the roof collapse were reasonable and not negligent, let alone grossly negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Aspen's factual recitation, standing alone, is damning. Aspen contends that Interstate knew that the accumulating snow on the warehouse roof was a problem weeks before it collapsed but failed to take affirmative action to prevent it. However, Interstate's response in opposition to Aspen's motion not only fills in the back story but also supports Interstate's argument that \"there remain significant and genuine disputes as to what the material facts establish.\" The facts giving rise to this case, in very large part, are either undisputed or undisputable. The actions of Tippmann, Lozada and other Interstate officers and employees both before and after the roof collapse are documented in deposition testimony, letters and emails. The overarching issue is whether those actions (or lack of action) constituted gross negligence. If so, the limitation of damages clause is nullified; if not, Aspen's recovery is limited to a fraction of the damages it seeks in this lawsuit. The issue of gross negligence, however, requires a determination as to the reasonableness of Interstate's conduct under the circumstances-a quintessential jury inquiry since it requires weighing the\n   evidence (and, to a slightly lesser extent, credibility determinations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[A] valid claim for gross negligence under Michigan law requires allegations of conduct 'akin to willful, wanton, or reckless misconduct.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fletcher v.

In any event, Aspen contends that Interstate destroyed or allowed to be destroyed the structural parts of the Warehouse that collapsed, and that an appropriate sanction would be for this Court to deny Interstate's motion for partial summary judgment. In short, Aspen wants the Court to find that Interstate committed spoliation\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   and sanction it for that conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   What Aspen does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   do in its response brief is defend its ability to bring independent causes of action for spoliation. Instead, Aspen states that trial courts \"may 'impose many different kinds of sanctions for spoliated evidence, including dismissing a case, granting summary judgment, or instructing a jury that it may infer a fact based on lost or destroyed evidence.' \" Plaintiff's Response in Opposition,\n   p. 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Coach, Inc. v.

Mich. May 16, 2013) ). This is an accurate representation of the law, but it misses the point. Aspen doesn't address the viability of its spoliation \"claims,\" arguing instead that it \"is entitled to an adverse inference due to defendant's spoliation of the evidence related to the collapse. As a sanction, defendant's motion for partial summary judgment should be denied and defendant should be prohibited from seeking limitation of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%202152038\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 20-21. In other words, Aspen does not argue that it can bring independent causes of action for spoliation, choosing instead to insist it has\n   <em>\n    proven\n   </em>\n   spoliation and the Court should deny Interstate's motion for summary judgment as a sanction. This argument misses the mark since the issue of whether Interstate committed spoliation of evidence is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   before the Court. The issue before the Court is whether Aspen can maintain\n   <em>\n    independent causes of action\n   </em>\n   for spoliation (it cannot), not whether Interstate\n   <em>\n    committed\n   </em>\n   spoliation or what sort of sanction should be imposed if it did. The Court grants Interstate's motion for that reason-Aspen cannot maintain independent causes of action for spoliation. At the end of the day, this might be a Pyrrhic victory for Interstate, since the\n   <em>\n    issue\n   </em>\n   of spoliation survives even though Aspen's\n   <em>\n    causes of action\n   </em>\n   for spoliation perish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   There is a secondary issue here that warrants discussion. As stated above, when presenting its arguments concerning spoliation Aspen relied on the federal law of the Sixth Circuit. Plaintiff's Response in Opposition, p. 20. This is likely because one of the cases on which Aspen relies is\n   <em>\n    Adkins v. Wolever\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683341\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/650/\">\n    554 F.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2009), in which the Sixth Circuit, overruling circuit precedent, held that spoliation sanctions are governed by federal law. The Sixth Circuit concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   In contrast to our persistent application of state law in this area, other circuits apply federal law for spoliation sanctions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Silvestri v.

We believe that this is the correct view for two reasons.

Sept. 28, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Aspen correctly represents the Sixth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   , but its application of Sixth Circuit law to the issue of spoliation is likely in error and Indiana law would apply in this case. Interstate does not jump into this choice of law question, resting on its premise that Aspen cannot maintain independent claims for spoliation under regardless of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In the end, this Court's conclusion is the same whether the issue is analyzed under Indiana law, Michigan law, Sixth Circuit law, or Seventh Circuit law. Aspen's claims of spoliation and intentional spoliation are not cognizable as independent causes of action regardless of the jurisdiction. The allegations that Interstate destroyed evidence, even if accepted as true, do not entitle Aspen to assert causes of action for spoliation. That said, the granting of Interstate's motion for summary judgment does not preclude Aspen from pursuing the issue of whether Interstate spoliated evidence. All this Court's ruling does is to preclude Aspen from bringing independent causes of action or \"claims\" for spoliation, not from pursuing sanctions for the alleged destruction of evidence. Accordingly, Interstate's motion for partial summary judgment is granted as to Aspen's claims for spoliation (Count V) and intentional spoliation (Count VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As stated above, Aspen seeks judgment as a matter of law on three of its 10 claims\n   against Interstate-breach of bailment, gross negligence and conversion. As the Court also stated above, Aspen's motion must be denied for the same reasons Interstate's motion on the issue of the limitation clause was denied, which is that a jury must determine the reasonableness of Interstate's conduct both before and after the roof collapse. That overarching issue, which can only be resolved by a jury after it assesses testimony and weighs all the evidence, precludes granting summary judgment on Aspen's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Gross negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Aspen bases its claims on its contention that Interstate knew about the danger created by the accumulating snow and failed to take any action to prevent the roof collapse, which Aspen says constitutes gross negligence. Interstate insists it acted prudently in light of the circumstances, that its warehouse had endured 17 Michigan winters without a roof collapse, and that Eastern Fish's food was destroyed by an Act of God. The Court has already ruled on this issue above, holding that the issue of Interstate's alleged gross negligence is a jury question. Therefore, Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of gross negligence must be denied for the same reasons Interstate's motion for summary judgment on the limitation clause issue was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   It bears repeating that \"[o]n summary judgment a court may not make credibility determinations, weigh the evidence, or decide which inferences to draw from the facts; these are jobs for a factfinder.... [the court must] look therefore at the evidence as a jury might, construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and avoiding the temptation to decide which party's version of the facts is more likely true.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Advocate Health &amp; Hosps.

Pauley\n   </em>\n   , 337 F.3d at 770 ). The issue of Interstate's alleged gross negligence must be determined by a jury and Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Breach of bailment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Aspen also seeks summary judgment on its claim for breach of bailment. A federal district court sitting in Michigan recently summarized Michigan law on breach of bailment, explaining as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A bailment exists when a bailor delivers personal property to a bailee \"in trust for a specific purpose, with a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be faithfully executed and the property returned or duly accounted for when the special purpose is accomplished.\"\n   <em>\n    Goldman v.

To establish a prima facie case of negligence on behalf of the bailee, the bailor must establish the existence of a bailment and that the property is returned in a damaged condition, thus creating a presumption of negligence.\n   <em>\n    Columbus Jack Corp. v. Swedish Crucible Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1940513\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/393/478/#p483\">\n    393 Mich. 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483-484 [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20N.W.2d%20506\">\n    227 N.W.2d 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] (1975).

Mich. Jan. 10, 2018). Aspen argues that since its insured's food products were delivered to Interstate in good and sellable condition, and were then destroyed while in Interstate's custody, Aspen has established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claim for breach of bailment. Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Interstate responds by arguing that it \"has produced evidence of the actual circumstances surrounding the collapse\n   and the undisputed evidence in this matters shows that the collapse was an Act of God, occurring without the fault of Interstate. Therefore, any presumption of negligence on the part of Interstate has been adequately rebutted.\" Defendant's Response in Opposition, p. 8. Whether the presumption has been \"adequately rebutted\" so as to defeat Aspen's breach of bailment claim is for a jury to decide, since it involves the same material issues regarding the reasonableness of Interstate's conduct. For purposes of summary judgment, the rebuttal is \"adequate\" in that it raises a material fact issue as to Interstate's liability. Interstate summarizes its argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [Aspen] is not entitled to summary judgment on its claim of breach of bailment because [Interstate] has overcome the presumption of negligence by producing evidence of the actual circumstances of the collapse. Such evidence indicates that [Interstate] acted as a reasonably careful warehouse operator would have acted under similar circumstances, and that the subject collapse was occasioned by an Act of God and that the event occurred without the fault of [Interstate]. Further, at the very least, the designated evidence creates a question of fact for the jury as to whether the presumption has been refuted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=871%20N.W.2d%20136\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 10. Interstate is correct that a jury must decide Aspen's breach of bailment of claim since it embraces the same material issues that preclude summary judgment on the parties' other claims (and requires a weighing of the evidence). For these reasons, Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment on its claim for breach of bailment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Aspen moves for summary judgment on its conversion claim. Aspen notes that \"Michigan law allows for both common law and statutory conversion ... [and] defines common law conversion as 'any distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another's personal property in denial of or inconsistent with his rights therein.' \" Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support, p. 13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Aroma Wines &amp; Equip, Inc. v.

The argument is a bit convoluted, beginning with its foundation, which Aspen states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Interstate never had the right to subject the Food Products to ammonia and temperature damage. Interstate never had the right to deny Eastern Fish access to the Food Products. Interstate never had the right to allow a third-party to seize the Food Products.

In\n   <em>\n    Aroma\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff wine distributor contracted to store wine at the defendant's temperature-controlled warehouse. The plaintiff fell behind on payments so the defendant asserted lien rights over the wine. The defendant then moved the wine to an area that was not temperature-controlled so it could renovate the area where the wine was previously stored. The move rendered the wine unfit for sale and the plaintiff sued the defendant for conversion (among other claims). The case ended up at the Michigan Supreme Court, which held that the defendant's act of moving the wine for purposes of renovating part of its warehouse satisfied the \"own use\" requirement and therefore constituted statutory conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Aspen insists that by destroying Eastern Fish's products to fulfill legal duties imposed on it by governmental entities, Interstate converted the products to its \"own use,\" just as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Aroma Wines\n   </em>\n   did. The only way this argument could be a winning one is if Aspen had authority to support its implied contention that the notices from Michigan state and county authorities\n   <em>\n    directing\n   </em>\n   Interstate to destroy the food products are irrelevant to the analysis. Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Aroma\n   </em>\n   , who made a deliberate choice to move the plaintiff's wine to accommodate defendant's warehouse renovation project, Interstate was mandated by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and the Ottawa County Department of Health to destroy Eastern Fish's seafood after determining that it was potentially contaminated as a result of the roof collapse. Interstate distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Aroma Wines\n   </em>\n   from the present case as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Aroma Wines\n   </em>\n   , the defendant moved wine from a temperature-controlled storage area to an uncontrolled storage area, thereby destroying the wine, in order to renovate its refrigerated storage area.... Therefore, it was the defendant's act of moving the wine that destroyed the wine.... In the instant action, [Aspen] now argues that [Interstate] converted the Food Products \"to its own use\" when it disposed of the already destroyed Food Products[.] ... Interstate's only remedy available to it under the law was to comply with the seizure notice.... Further, in the case at bar, Interstate's compliance with the [Michigan Dept. of Agriculture's] Notice of Seizure was not a conversion of the Food Products \"to its own use.\" While [Aspen] attempts to confuse the Court by manipulating compliance with the Notice of Seizure to mean satisfying is \"own obligations,\" [Aspen] fails to recognize that compliance was not a purpose personal to [Interstate's] interests.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Defendant's Response in Opposition, pp. 12-13. Interstate also argues that Aspen's\n   conversion claims are based on a faulty premise. Interstate insists that \"unlike the destruction of the wine in\n   <em>\n    Aroma Wines\n   </em>\n   , in the present matter, [Aspen's] loss for which it is now attempting to recover was not caused by [Interstate's] alleged acts of conversion (i.e., the disposal of the Food Products) .... The Food Products were destroyed as a result of the roof collapse and the resulting Notice of Seizure ..., not [Interstate's] disposal of the seized Food Products.\" Put another way, Interstate's argument is that Aspen is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and all it the tort of conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court, after \"constru[ing] all facts in a light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw[ing] all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party,\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 477 U.S. at 255,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , concludes that Aspen has failed to establish as a matter of law that Interstate committed conversion. Aspen fails to cite any authority to support its argument that Interstate committed conversion when it destroyed the food products after being directed to do so by Michigan state and county authorities. And as Interstate points out, it was the roof collapse, not Interstate's compliance with agency orders, that was the proximate cause of the loss for which Aspen seeks to recover. For these reasons, Aspen's motion for summary judgment on its claim for conversion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, Defendant Interstate's \"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to the Enforceability of the Limitation of Liability Contract Clause and Plaintiff's Spoliation of Evidence Claims\" (ECF 35) is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part; Plaintiff Aspen's motion for partial summary judgment (ECF 40) is DENIED; and Defendant Interstate's Request for Oral Argument (ECF 50) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Also before the Court is Defendant Interstate's Request for Oral Argument (ECF 50), to which Aspen did not respond. The Court concludes that the pending motions can be resolved on the briefs and supporting evidence and that oral argument is not necessary. The Request for Oral Argument is DENIED.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    The parties agree that Michigan law applies to this case, as discussed below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    For the sake of brevity and clarity, Aspen's internal citations to evidence, including the depositions of Tippmann and Lozada, have been omitted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Interstate insists that Aspen \"was provided with, and took advantage of, numerous opportunities to inspect the post-collapse warehouse premises.\" Defendant's Memorandum in Support, p. 8. Any factual disputes about the spoliation issue are irrelevant now, however, since the issue is not before the Court on the merits of Aspen's allegations.
