But in Defendants' view, the Atmel Plan had expired.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Nevertheless, \"to resolve the continuing dispute with these Atmel employees,\" Defendants offered employees the opportunity to receive different severance benefits if they were terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was the \"Second Atmel Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Employees had 45 days to decide whether to accept it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

This release is as broad as the law allows and includes a release of claims under federal and state laws, such as anti-discrimination, harassment and retaliation laws and expressly includes any claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. This release also includes a release of any tort and contract claims, and any other claims that could be asserted under federal, state or local statutes, regulations or common law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Amended Class Action Complaint, Dkt.

In Defendants' view, Plaintiffs violated the terms of the Second Atmel Plan when they ignored (or fraudulently contravened) the release agreement and brought this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 21-27, 31-35. But whatever the effect of this release may be when it comes to assessing the merits of Plaintiffs' claims (which is for a later day), one thing is certain at this stage: it is not a covenant not to sue. And because the Second Atmel Plan does not bar Plaintiffs from filing suit, they have not violated its terms by doing so. Thus, Defendants have not satisfied the first element of Section 502(a)(3), because there is no wrong to remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In accepting the Second Atmel Plan, Plaintiffs agreed to a release that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-35\">\n   You agree to\n   <em>\n    release\n   </em>\n   the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its and their officers, agents and employees from any liability related to or arising out of your employment with any of them.

This\n   <em>\n    release\n   </em>\n   also includes\n   a\n   <em>\n    release\n   </em>\n   of any tort and contract claims, and any other claims that could be asserted under federal, state or local statutes, regulations or common law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dkt.

The four-sentence release provision uses the term \"release\" six times.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 33-1, Ex. 4 at 2. In contrast, it uses the term \"covenant not to sue,\" \"agreement not to sue,\" or equivalent language precisely zero times.

But they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Because Plaintiffs never agreed not to sue Defendants, they have not violated any term of the Plan by doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Isbell v.

And since there is no violation of the Second Atmel Plan's terms, Defendants do not have a basis for equitable relief under Section 502(a)(3). Of course, Defendants may continue to pursue their affirmative defense that Plaintiffs agreed to release them from liability under the terms of the Second Atmel Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937579\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/788/#p797\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that Defendant \"received the benefit of its bargain-an affirmative defense\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bukuras v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds that, as a matter of law, Defendants have not alleged (nor could they allege) that Plaintiffs violated any provision of the Second Atmel Plan. Therefore, Defendants have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under ERISA. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss Defendants' counterclaim, without leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court\n   <strong>\n    SETS\n   </strong>\n   a further case management conference for 2:00 p.m. on April 2 in Oakland, Fourth Floor, Courtroom 2. At the case management conference, the parties should be prepared to discuss a schedule for the prompt resolution of this matter and the proposed form and timing of ADR efforts, including the possibility of a magistrate judge settlement conference. The parties are directed to file a joint case management statement addressing these and any other issues by March 26.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    For simplicity, this order will cite to Microchip's Answer and Counterclaim, Dkt.
