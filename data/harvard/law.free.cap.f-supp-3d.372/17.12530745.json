On July 27, 2007, the Court sentenced Pierre to 188 months' incarceration as to each count, to run concurrently; supervised release of 8 years on Count I and 6 years on Count II, also to run concurrently; and\n   a special assessment of $ 200.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment, ECF No. 25.

After serving upwards of 144 months disciplinary-action free, Pierre was incarcerated at the Houston House, a Bureau of Prisons Residential Reentry Center, with an expected release date of July 4, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 404 of the Act states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) DEFINITION OF COVERED OFFENSE.-In this section, the term\n   <em>\n    \"covered offense\" means a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\n   </em>\n   (Public Law 111-220;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%202372\">\n    124 Stat. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), that was committed before August 3, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (b) DEFENDANTS PREVIOUSLY SENTENCED.-A court that imposed a sentence for a covered offense may, on motion of the defendant, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the attorney for the Government, or the court, impose a reduced sentence as if sections 2 and 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-220;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20Stat.%202372\">\n    124 Stat. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) were in effect at the time the covered offense was committed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Defendant argues that the Court has the discretion to impose a reduced sentence under the Act because he was convicted of a covered offense. His conviction falls within the definition of a \"covered offense,\" he says, because he was convicted of violating a statute (\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) ) that was \"modified by section 2 or 3 of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.\" As explained above, the pertinent part of the Fair Sentencing Act increased the quantity that triggers a 5 year mandatory minimum sentence from 5 grams to 28 grams of crack cocaine.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) (2005),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Government counters that the exact violation for which Pierre was convicted under Count I, according to the change of plea colloquy and unobjected-to PSR, was possession with the intent to distribute 28.77 grams of crack cocaine. Had Pierre been indicted after the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 went into effect, the Government reasons, the indictment would have charged him with 28 grams or more of cocaine base, as opposed to 5 grams or more, and Pierre would have been subject to the same mandatory minimum as before.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Resp. in Opp'n 3, ECF No. 57. In advancing its position, the Government argues that finding Pierre eligible for a sentence reduction would amount to \"an unjustified windfall,\" because identically-situated defendants sentenced under the Fair Sentencing Act would not have been eligible for the same relief.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Reasonable minds could disagree about whether, in the phrase \"a violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were modified by [the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010],\" it is \"[the defendant's specific] violation of a Federal criminal statute [as supported by the underlying record],\" or the \"violation[, for which the defendant was charged and pled guilty,] of a Federal criminal statute\" that the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 must modify in order to deem it a covered offense under the First Step Act. Put differently,\n   in determining a defendant's eligibility for relief under the First Step Act of 2010, it is not clear whether Congress intended the district court to look to the actual offense conduct for which the defendant was convicted (for example, using the transcript from the change of plea colloquy to determine drug quantity), or to look simply to the offense of conviction (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the federal criminal statute the defendant violated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Both the Government's and Defendant's arguments are plausible on their face, and there is no legislative history available on Section 404 to lend clarity to Congressional intent. But ultimately, joining other courts that have weighed in on the issue, the Court concludes that Defendant's construction is more sensible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Mar. 6, 2019). Moreover, where a criminal statute is ambiguous, as it is here, the rule of lenity informs the Court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

The Court holds that, in determining whether a defendant is eligible for relief under \u00a7 404 of the First Step Act, the sentencing court should look to whether the offense of conviction was modified by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to determine eligibility; it should refrain from delving into the particulars of the record to determine how this specific defendant committed his or her offense of conviction, and how those facts would have hypothetically affected the charges brought against the defendant under the new statutory regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Government's approach, while reasonable, is problematic in several ways. First, it effectively requires the Court to employ a prosecutor-friendly \"way-back machine\" to conjure how the charge, plea, and sentencing would have looked had the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 been in effect. For example, here, the Court is not confident that a well-counseled defendant caught with 28.77 grams of crack cocaine and a reasonable prosecutor from this District would have reached a plea deal of 28 grams or more of crack cocaine, thereby triggering the mandatory minimum by a mere .77 grams of crack cocaine. Indeed, it seems likely in this Court's experience the parties would have agreed to a plea to a lower quantity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, this approach does not reflect the on-the-ground realities of federal sentencing. Following the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the new Guidelines mirror the new statutory minimums. For a defendant like Pierre, who was sentenced above the statutory minimum, it is the change in the Guidelines that drives, as a practical matter, any change in sentence.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dorsey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407151\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/260/#p265\">\n    567 U.S. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407151\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/260/#p265\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding persuasive that Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act to apply to offenders who committed the offense before, but were not sentenced until after, the effective date of the law, because otherwise \"the 1986 Drug Act's old minimums would trump those new Guidelines for some pre-Act offenders but not for all of them\"). Third, relief under the Act is ultimately within the discretion of the Court; there is no automatic reduction. It makes sense that Congress intended to give a certain\n   <em>\n    class\n   </em>\n   of defendants -- those who were sentenced\n   under a statute for which the penalties changed in 2010 -- a do-over. Accordingly, the more sensible interpretation of the statute favors erring on the side of allowing the sentencing court to determine whether a specific defendant is entitled to relief given several factors, including the underlying drug quantity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Government is correct that Congress could have simply stated \"the sentencing court may reduce the sentence of any defendant convicted of a cocaine base offense who was sentenced prior to the effective date of the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Supp. Resp. in Opp'n 3, ECF No. 60. But the fact that Congress could have been clearer does not mean it meant something else that is both awkward and unfair. Much of the federal judiciary's work revolves around figuring out what Congress meant when it could have phrased something more clearly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Robert A. Katzmann,\n   <em>\n    Judging Statutes\n   </em>\n   104-05 (Oxford Univ. Press 2014) (\"When judges interpret the words of statutes, they are not simply performing a task. They are maintaining an unspoken covenant with the citizenry on whose trust the authority and vitality of an independent judiciary depend, to render decisions that strive to be faithful to the work of the people's representatives memorialized in statutory language.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For these reasons, the Court found Defendant eligible for relief under the First Step Act and entered the March 8, 2019 Order, ECF No. 63, reducing Defendant's sentence to time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The so-called \u00a7 851 enhancement is a uniquely powerful prosecutorial cudgel: it allows the Government, at its sole discretion, to file an additional charge by information that a defendant has been previously convicted of a drug trafficking offense thereby ratcheting up the mandatory minimum applicable from 5 to 10 years, or 10 to 20 years, or 20 years to life. The threat of this upward ratchet on defendants is obvious. And during the administration of Attorney General Ashcroft, local U.S. Attorney's Offices were directed as a matter of policy to charge the offense that would \"generate the most substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines\" and were strongly encouraged to use statutory enhancements, including under \u00a7 851, \"in all appropriate cases.\" Mem. from Att'y Gen.
