Acting Commissioner of Social Security Nancy Berryhill does not take much issue with Bradshaw's conclusion about the validity of the ALJ's appointment but claims that Bradshaw waived this argument by not raising it before the ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This controversy arises from the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucia v.

In\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court determined that the SEC's ALJs were officers of the United States instead of merely employees of the federal government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2054\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result, the Constitution required that the President, a court of law, or a head of a department appoint them to their position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 2050 (citing U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2.). Because the SEC had not appointed the ALJ who ruled against Lucia as required by the Appointments Clause, the Supreme Court held that he was entitled to a new hearing before a properly appointed official.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Particularly relevant to this dispute is the Supreme Court's statement that Lucia was entitled to a new hearing because he made \"a timely challenge\" to the constitutionality of the ALJ's appointment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court explained that Lucia \"contested the validity of [the ALJ's] appointment before the Commission, and continued to press that claim in the Court of Appeals and this Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    at 2056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Acting Commissioner claims that Bradshaw did not make a timely challenge because she did not raise the Appointments Clause issue before the ALJ. But neither the statutes nor the regulations that govern Social Security proceedings required Bradshaw to do so. And the court will not impose an issue-exhaustion requirement because both precedent and constitutional concerns counsel against it. Thus, Bradshaw's Appointments Clause challenge is timely and the court will address it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After considering the merits of this matter, the court concludes that the appointment of the ALJ who issued the decision below did not comply with the Appointments Clause. The ALJ was an inferior officer of the United States and she was not appointed by the President, a court of law, or the head of a department. Thus,\n   the court vacates the decision below and remands the matter to the SSA for proceedings before a validly appointed ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2013, Bradshaw filed a claim for disability insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration. Admin. Tr. at 16, D.E. 10. After the SSA denied her initial claim and her request for reconsideration, Bradshaw filed a written request for a hearing before an ALJ.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-102, 104-07, 108. In her request, the only reason provided for her appeal was that she was disabled and could not work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At that time, representatives of both the Office of Personnel Management and the Social Security Administration evaluated applicants who wished to become ALJs. Gehlken Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 3-10, D.E. 28-1. Ultimately, the Social Security Administration's Director for the Center for Personnel Policy and Staffing was responsible for appointing ALJs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early December 2015, an ALJ held a hearing to review Bradshaw's claim. Admin. Tr. at 38. Ultimately, the ALJ decided in March 2017 that Bradshaw was not disabled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-32. Bradshaw then unsuccessfully sought review before the Appeals Counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bradshaw filed a civil action in March 2018 seeking review of the ALJ's decision. Compl.\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   , D.E. 5. Both parties moved for a judgment on the pleadings in their favor. D.E. 15, 18. As part of her motion, Bradshaw urged the court to vacate the decision because the ALJ's appointment did not comply with the Appointments Clause. Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 23-26, D.E. 16. In response, the Government claimed that Bradshaw waived this issue by not raising it before the ALJ. Def's Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. at 12-21, D.E. 19. The court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   held a hearing on the Appointments Clause issue in December 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As noted at the outset, this case presents two issues. The court must first address whether Bradshaw's Appointments Clause challenge is timely. If it is, then the court must turn to whether the SSA violated the Appointments Clause when it appointed the ALJ who issued the ruling under review here. Bradshaw prevails on the timeliness issue because there is no requirement that claimants raise constitutional issues before an ALJ to preserve them for federal court review. And she also prevails on the merits of her claim because the ALJ was an inferior officer who was not appointed by the President, a court of law, or the head of a department. Thus, the court will remand this matter for further proceedings before a validly appointed ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Was Bradshaw required to raise the Appointments Clause issue to the ALJ?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Government relies heavily on the statement in\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   that \" 'one who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case' is entitled to relief.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ryder v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    515 U.S. 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 182-83,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563883\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/177/#p182\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995) ). While this language makes clear that a timely challenge is a prerequisite to the relief Bradshaw seeks, it provides no guidance-no matter how many times the Acting\n   Commissioner invokes it-about what constitutes a timely challenge in the Social Security context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Sims v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   does.\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   considered \"whether a Social Security claimant waives judicial review of an issue if he fails to exhaust that issue by presenting it to the Appeals Council in his request for review.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    530 U.S. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Although\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   dealt with issue exhaustion at the Appeals Counsel level, it provides a roadmap for the court's analysis of whether issue exhaustion is required at the ALJ level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Supreme Court began by noting that a claimant may only seek review in federal court of a final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ). To properly obtain a final decision, the Court explained, the claimant must ask for review of an ALJ's decision from the Appeals Counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    at 106-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If a claimant does not seek Appeals Counsel review, there is no final decision and thus no right to \"judicial review because he has failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sims sought review from the Appeals Counsel, and had thus exhausted her administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But when she sued in the district court, she relied on an argument that she had not presented to the Appeals Counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So what happens when a claimant obtains a final decision from the Commissioner and then raises an issue before a federal court they did not raise to the Appeals Counsel? In other words, does the Social Security Act's administrative exhaustion requirement also require issue exhaustion at the Appeals Counsel level?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In answering this question, the Supreme Court noted that \"requirements of administrative issue exhaustion are largely creatures of statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, the Supreme Court explained, neither a statute nor \"SSA regulations ... require issue exhaustion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Even without a statute or regulation requiring issue exhaustion, a court can still impose one based on the analogous provision \"that appellate courts will not consider arguments not raised before trial courts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    at 108-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To begin with, the court notes that in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court found that \"SSA regulations do not require issue exhaustion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    530 U.S. at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite this statement (or perhaps because\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   dealt with matters before the Appeals Counsel), the Acting Commissioner claims that several \"regulations require a claimant to raise all issues-including constitutional issues-to the agency at the earliest possible juncture.\" Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 16, D.E. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Yet at the hearing on this matter, the Acting Commissioner conceded that no regulation explicitly required Bradshaw to raise the Appointments Clause issue with the ALJ. Hr. Tr. at 26:21-24 (\"[O]ur argument is not, per se, that there is a specific regulation that says you, claimant, must raise an appointment challenge ... with the ALJ.\"), 27:6-12 (\"I don't know that there's a regulation directly on point, Your Honor.\").

Although the court noted that \"the regulations require the claimants to state the reasons why the adverse decision was incorrect[,]\" this language did not create an issue-exhaustion requirement because \"there is no express requirement in the regulations that a party must list the specific issues the reviewing court will consider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078255\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/1247/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078255\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/1247/\">\n    at 1255-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With these cases in mind, the court will turn to its consideration of the regulations relied on by the Acting Commissioner to support her position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The SSA's regulations explain the process that a claimant must go through to obtain review by an ALJ and the process for reviewing a denied claim. To begin with, the SSA's regulations limit the scope of the issues a claimant may raise before the ALJ. They explain that a party may only request a hearing before an ALJ if they are \"dissatisfied with one of the determinations or decisions listed in \u00a7 404.930.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.929\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The matters listed in \u00a7 404.930 focus on initial, revised, and reconsidered decisions made by the Administration, and do not mention constitutional issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The regulations also set out a limited scope of review for ALJs.

The regulations provide for an expedited appeal process that a claimant \"may\" use if the claimant argues and the SSA agrees \"that the only factor preventing a favorable determination or decision is a provision in the law that you believe is unconstitutional.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.924\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Ignoring the language making the expedited appeals procedure optional, the regulation still would not require Bradshaw to raise her Appointments Clause challenge before the ALJ because it does not affect the merits of her claim for benefits. Instead, it only impacts whether the ALJ can address her claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   It is also worth noting that the SSA's regulations provide a mechanism for a claimant to raise issues before the Appeals Counsel that they did not raise to the ALJ.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.970\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). This suggests that the SSA does not consider there to be an\n   issue-exhaustion requirement at the ALJ level for all types of issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Perhaps the most compelling evidence of the Administration's approach to constitutional challenges is how it handled the very type of challenge that Bradshaw raises. In an emergency message issued in early 2018, the Administration told ALJs that if a claimant challenged the constitutionality of the ALJ's appointment, they were only to acknowledge that the claimant had raised the issue and note that neither the agency nor the ALJ had authority to resolve constitutional issues. Pl. Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 25 (quoting Social Security Administration EM-18003, Important Information Regarding Possible Challenges to the Appointment of Administrative Law Judges in SSA's Administrative Process).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The SSA's regulations provide no support for the Acting Commissioner's position. There is nothing in the SSA's regulations that explicitly require a claimant to raise constitutional issues before an ALJ. And the language the SSA uses in its regulations is similar to language courts have found to be inconsistent with the existence of an issue exhaustion requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.933\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) &amp; (a)(2). After considering the text of the SSA's regulations, the court concludes that there is no requirement that claimants raise constitutional questions before the ALJ to preserve them for review in a federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Should the court impose an issue-exhaustion requirement on Social Security proceedings before ALJs?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Without a statute or regulation requiring issue exhaustion, the court still can impose an issue-exhaustion requirement. But, as the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the \"the desirability of a court imposing a requirement of issue exhaustion depends on the degree to which the analogy to normal adversarial litigation applies in a particular administrative proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    530 U.S. at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Fourth Circuit precedent controls the court's resolution of this question. In\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals explained that \"the administrative hearing process is not an adversarial one[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060343\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/204/#p210\">\n    810 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (4th Cir. 2015). The court's independent review of the procedures involved in proceedings before an ALJ bolster the conclusion that it is an inquisitorial process and not an adversarial one. Thus, it would not be appropriate to impose an issue-exhaustion requirement for constitutional claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Other Cases Addressing this Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Acting Commissioner also points out, correctly, that most courts to address this question have found that claimants waive their Appointments Clause challenges by not raising them before the ALJs. Despite the number of cases that have addressed this issue in the Acting Commissioner's favor, two factors limit the strength of this argument. First, none of the cited cases are binding on this court because the Fourth Circuit has not yet addressed this issue. And, second, most of the cases cited by the Acting Commissioner only address issue exhaustion in passing, which limits their persuasive authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   When pressed on which cases the Acting Commissioner believed most strongly supported her position, she pointed the court to\n   <em>\n    Mills v.

In determining that the claimant had waived this argument by not raising it before the ALJ, the Court of Appeals relied on its own pre-\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   precedent that required represented parties to raise issues before an ALJ to preserve them for later review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516040\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1102/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1109 (citing\n   <em>\n    Meanel v.

Because the decision in\n   <em>\n    Shaibi\n   </em>\n   was compelled by circuit precedent it provides no guidance for a court outside the Ninth Circuit addressing the issue after\n   <em>\n    Sims.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Efficiency Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As a final argument, the Acting Commissioner argues that the court should surrender its ability to address Bradshaw's constitutional claim in the first instance because of efficiency concerns. She claims that a decision in Bradshaw's favor would lead to \"thousands\" of cases being remanded to the agency for reconsideration. This result, the Acting Commissioner claims, \"would further burden an already-stressed system and add even more months to the wait times for first time claimants.\" Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for J. on the Pleadings at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Acting Commissioner points to two cases in support of this proposition:\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298706\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/33/#p38\">\n    344 U.S. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298706\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/33/#p38\">\n    73 S.Ct. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20L.%20Ed.%2054\">\n    97 L.Ed. 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1952). The\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   citation directs the court to the portion of the opinion that says a timely objection is necessary to receive relief on an Appointments Clause challenge. As the court noted at the outset, this is true, but it does not explain what constitutes a timely objection in a Social Security proceeding. Reliance on\n   <em>\n    L.A. Tucker\n   </em>\n   presents a similar problem. There, the Supreme Court explained that a party must make an objection \"at the time appropriate under [the administrative body's] practice.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298706\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/33/#p38\">\n    344 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298706\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/344/33/#p38\">\n    73 S.Ct. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As noted above, the SSA's regulations for practice before an ALJ do not require issue exhaustion. Thus these cases do not compel or persuade the court to give up its ability to address Bradshaw's constitutional challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court is also not persuaded by the parade of horribles that the SSA claims will result from a ruling in Bradshaw's favor. To begin with, the Acting Commissioner has provided no concrete facts in support of her claims. And any inefficiencies or extended wait times resulting from a ruling in Bradshaw's favor are problems of the SSA's own making. Nearly two decades have passed since the Supreme Court noted that the SSA's regulations did not include an issue-exhaustion requirement, but that it was \"likely that the Commissioner could adopt a regulation that did require issue exhaustion.\"\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    530 U.S. at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The SSA could have addressed this issue at any time but did not do so. The complications arising from its failure to act do not justify judicial imposition of an issue-exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Even assuming the SSA's efficiency argument was compelling, the separation of\n   powers concerns arising from its position outweigh efficiency considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The SSA is asking the judicial branch to voluntarily cede its authority to address constitutional questions unless and until an administrative agency first addresses the issue. And it makes this request without a statutory or regulatory basis and outside the traditional circumstances that justify a court imposing an issue-exhaustion requirement. The SSA's position, if adopted, would have serious implications for the allocation of power between the three branches of our Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   If the judicial branch were to impose an issue-exhaustion requirement when the legislative and executive branches have declined to do so, the courts risk usurping the authority of these other branches. As the Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , issue-exhaustion requirements are principally creatures of statute or regulation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    530 U.S. at 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413232\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/103/#p106\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, deciding questions of constitutional law and assessing whether the branches are complying with the Constitution's requirements are at the core of the judicial power.

The court cannot approve of this tradeoff and will not impose an issue-exhaustion requirement for constitutional questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   After applying the framework set out by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Sims\n   </em>\n   , the court cannot find that Bradshaw needed to raise her Appointments Clause challenge before the ALJ to preserve it for review in federal court. No statute or regulation requires a claimant to raise constitutional issues before an ALJ. Because Bradshaw has complied with the SSA's regulations, there is no reason to bar her from raising her Appointments Clause challenge in this court. And given that proceedings before the ALJ are non-adversarial and the attendant constitutional concerns present here, it would be inappropriate for the court to impose an issue-exhaustion requirement for constitutional issues. Thus, the court concludes that Bradshaw has raised her Appointments Clause challenge in a timely manner and it is appropriate for the court to consider its merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Did the appointment process for the ALJ who decided Bradshaw's case comply with the Appointments Clause?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Constitution provides two methods for appointing officers of the United States. To begin with, the President may, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint \"ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not ... provided for\" in the Constitution. U.S. Const. art. II \u00a7 2. And the Constitution also allows Congress to \"vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587356\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1225/#p1255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, when it comes to the appointment of officers, the Constitution allows two methods (and only two methods) for those appointments to take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The court must initially determine whether SSA ALJs are inferior officers of the United States or federal government employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reaching its decision in\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   that SEC ALJs were inferior officers, the Supreme Court applied the \"significant authority\" test.\n   <em>\n    Lucia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612807\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2044/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2051-52 (citing\n   <em>\n    Freytag v.

Justice Thomas noted in his concurring\n   opinion that it would be more appropriate to apply a standard based on the Appointments Clause's original public meaning, which would focus on whether the official \"perform[ed] an ongoing, statutory duty-no matter how important or significant the duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2056 (Thomas, J. concurring) (citing Jennifer Mascott,\n   <em>\n    Who Are \"Officers of the United States\"?\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20443\">\n    70 Stan. L. Rev. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 564 (2018) ). But the court need not spend much time on determining the appropriate standard because the SSA does not dispute Bradshaw's contention that SSA ALJs are inferior officers. Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. at 13 n.1. Given that the Acting Commissioner has conceded this issue, the court will find that SSA ALJs are inferior officers for Appointments Clause purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Since SSA ALJs are inferior officers, the Appointments Clause requires that the President, a court of law, or the head of a department appoint them. The SSA has not challenged Bradshaw's contention that the SSA improperly appointed the ALJ who issued the decision below and the SSA's post-hearing submission confirms this fact. Gehlken Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 3-10, D.E. 28-1. Thus the court finds that the appointment of the ALJ who issued the decision below violated the Appointments Clause. Bradshaw is entitled to have the court remand this matter to the SSA for consideration by a validly appointed ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the court finds that Bradshaw's Appointments Clause challenge is both timely and meritorious. The court thus grants Bradshaw's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (D.E. 15), denies the Acting Commissioner's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (D.E. 18), and remands this matter to the SSA for consideration by a validly appointed ALJ.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The parties consented to having a United States Magistrate Judge conduct all proceedings under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).
