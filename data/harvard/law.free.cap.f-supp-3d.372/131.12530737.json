Chen, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On June 4, 2018, Plaintiff Michael Grecco Productions, Inc. (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Grecco Productions\") commenced this action for copyright infringement and violations of Section 1202(a) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") with respect to 27 copyrighted photographic images (\"the Copyrighted Works\"). (Complaint (\"Compl.\"), Dkt. 1.) On September 27, 2018, Defendant Alamy, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"Alamy\") filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Alamy was an improper defendant in this action and that the complaint failed to plausibly allege any copyright infringement or violation of the DMCA. (Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 25; Defendant's Brief (\"Def.'s Br.\"), Dkt. 26.) For the reasons stated herein, Defendant's motion is denied in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Grecco Productions is a California-based photography studio owned and operated by Michael Grecco, a commercial photographer and film director. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7.) In its complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Alamy is a Brooklyn-based company that owns and operates the website, http://www.alamy.com (\"the Alamy website\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6, 8.) Through the Alamy website, Defendant allegedly \"reproduces, displays, distributes, and purports to offer license rights to photographic images and other content[,] the copyrights in which are owned by others.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Defendant receives at least some portion of the fees paid by Alamy website customers to acquire license rights through the website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2012, Grecco Productions entered into two agreements, an Exclusive Contributor Agreement and a Non-Exclusive Contributor Agreement (collectively, \"the Agreements\") with a Florida-based company, RGB Ventures LLC d/b/a Superstock\n   (\"Superstock\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The terms of the Agreements granted Superstock limited licenses to certain materials in Grecco Productions' portfolio, including 1,700 copyrighted images. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) Among the materials licensed to Superstock were the 27 Copyrighted Works at issue in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agreements, in turn, authorized Superstock to sublicense Grecco Productions' images through specified agents, called \"Third Party Distributors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Alamy is identified in the Agreements as a Third Party Distributor for Superstock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, Superstock maintains a distribution agreement with Alamy, whereby Alamy obtains photographic images and other content licensed to Superstock for the purpose of reproducing, promoting, distributing, and sublicensing that content. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Through this distribution agreement, Alamy obtained the Copyrighted Works. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about December 2, 2013, the Agreements were terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) The terms of the agreement provided for an 18-month \"Survival Term,\" which allowed Superstock and its Third Party Distributors, including Alamy, to continue exercising licensing rights in Plaintiff's materials for 18 months after the termination date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) Through its status as a Third Party Distributor for Superstock, Alamy also retained the right to reproduce, display, distribute, and license the materials subject to the Agreements for this 18-month period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Based on the alleged termination date, the Survival Term would have expired on June 2, 2015. Nevertheless, Plaintiff discovered that Alamy was reproducing, displaying, distributing, and offering to license the Copyrighted Works through the Alamy website as late as 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As its first cause of action, Plaintiff Grecco Productions alleges that Defendant Alamy's continued display and offer to license the Copyrighted Works beyond the Survival Term constitutes infringement of a copyright in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 27.) In its second cause of action, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant placed visible watermarks, such as \"Alamy,\" \"alamy,\" and \"a,\" on the Copyrighted Works in order to conceal its infringement and induce potential customers to believe that Defendant, not Plaintiff, held exclusive rights in them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 35.) According to Plaintiff, this runs afoul of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which prohibits,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the provision of false copyright management information (\"CMI\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). As a remedy, Plaintiff seeks damages and a permanent injunction against Defendant and its agents further infringing on its rights in the Copyrighted Works.

In the alternative, Defendant argues that, even if it is a proper defendant in this action, Plaintiff's claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) must be dismissed because watermarks are not CMI within the meaning of the DMCA. Defendant further asserts that it is an Internet service provider under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and is thus immune from liability for the display of one of the Copyrighted Works, which it asserts to be user-generated content hosted on the Alamy website. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Identity of the Proper Defendant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As its principal argument, Defendant contends that the complaint must be dismissed in its entirety for failure to state a claim because Plaintiff has sued the wrong entity. (Def.'s Br., at 7.) According to Defendant, it is merely a subsidiary of Alamy Ltd. (\"UK Alamy\"), an English corporation for which Defendant operates as a sales office that interfaces with U.S.-based customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant maintains that it played no role in the copyright violations alleged in the complaint, as the Alamy website, on which the Copyrighted Works were allegedly displayed and marketed, is owned and operated by UK Alamy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant further argues that any amendment to name the proper party would be futile, as the Court would lack personal jurisdiction over UK Alamy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 8-10.) These arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[O]n a motion to dismiss, the [C]ourt must ask whether any set of facts consistent with [the] complaint would give the plaintiff a right to recover....\"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Ill. Mar. 22, 2005). The answer to this question cannot be, to paraphrase Defendant's submissions, \"No, because the allegations are false.\" To dismiss the complaint based on Defendant's motion, the Court would need to credit facts asserted by Defendant that are directly contradicted by the complaint. These disputed facts include Defendant's alleged role in the operation of the Alamy website and the copyright infringements alleged in the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15, 20-23,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br., at 4, 7-8.) In other words, Alamy's argument boils down to simple denial of the complaint's factual contentions and any wrongdoing. While this argument may ultimately succeed at a later\n   point in the litigation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , after some discovery has occurred, it is not an appropriate ground on which to dismiss the complaint at the pleadings stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Survivor Productions, LLC v.

In brief, the complaint alleges that, through the Alamy website, Defendant reproduced, distributed, displayed and held out the Copyrighted Works for license without legal right to do so, and that Defendant sought to cloak these actions by providing false CMI in the form of watermarks placed on the Copyrighted Works. If Plaintiff produces evidence establishing that Defendant-rather than or in concert with UK Alamy-engaged in these actions, then Plaintiff would be entitled to recover against Defendant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20501\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Based on this text, the Court identifies three elements required to state a claim under \u00a7 1202(a). A plaintiff must allege (1) the provision or distribution of CMI; (2) that the defendant knew that the CMI was false; and (3) that the Defendant acted with the intent to cause or conceal copyright infringement.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Krechmer v.

Mar. 27, 2018) (\"[T]o state a claim under ... \u00a7 1202(a), [the plaintiff] must allege that the defendant both knew that the CMI was false, and provided or distributed the false CMI with the intent to induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal infringement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant does not dispute that in 2016 it had no copyright interest in the Copyrighted Works, so only the first and third elements are placed in dispute by Defendant's motion. Defendant's primary argument is that its alleged placement of watermarks on the Copyrighted Works does not satisfy the first element because the watermarks do not indicate authorship or copyright ownership and thus are not CMI. (Def.'s Br., at 11.) Rather, Defendant asserts, the watermarks identify \" 'the originator of the website' on which the photos appeared.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 1202(c) provides the statutory definition of CMI as it is used in subsection (a) of the statute. It defines CMI as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [A]ny of the following information conveyed in connection with copies or phonorecords of a work or performances or displays of a work, including in digital form, except that such term does not include any personally identifying information about a user of a work or of a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display of a work:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) The title and other information identifying the work, including the information set forth on a notice of copyright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) The name of, and other identifying information about, the author of a work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) The name of, and other identifying information about, the copyright owner of the work, including the information set forth in a notice of copyright.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (7) Identifying numbers or symbols referring to such information or links to such information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Few courts have meaningfully interpreted \u00a7 1202(c), but most courts that have considered the issue have found that the meaning of CMI is broad and, at least in some circumstances, includes watermarks. The Honorable Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland held in\n   <em>\n    Goldstein v. Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   that CMI need not include all of the elements of a notice of copyright, but\n   could be only a subset of those elements. No. TDC-15-2400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204257457\">\n    2016 WL 4257457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (D. Md. Aug. 11, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20401\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (defining a notice of copyright as including (1) the symbol (c), the word \"Copyright,\" or the abbreviation \"Copr.\"; (2) the year of the first publication of the work; and (3) the name of the owner of the copyright or any recognizable abbreviation or alternative designation thereof). Consistent with this understanding of CMI, the Middle District of Tennessee held in\n   <em>\n    Executive Corp. v. Oisoon, LLC\n   </em>\n   that watermarked text on an image stating \"The Executive Advertising\" constituted CMI. No. 3:16-cv-898,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204310113\">\n    2017 WL 4310113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 28, 2017). Likewise, the Honorable William H. Pauley III of the Southern District of New York held that the notation of a photographer's last name next to a photograph on Twitter constitutes CMI.\n   <em>\n    Agence France Presse v. Morel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3808156\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/769/295/#p305\">\n    769 F.Supp.2d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305-06 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court agrees with this more expansive view of CMI. Because a watermarked corporate name or symbol may refer to the author or copyright owner when displayed on a copyrighted work in connection with the marketing of that work for sale or license, such watermarks do constitute CMI for the purpose of stating a violation of \u00a7 1202(a).\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)-(3), (7). This conclusion is consistent with how courts have applied \u00a7 1202(b) of the DMCA, which prohibits the intentional removal or alteration of CMI without authorization from the copyright owner and with the knowledge that the removal/alteration will induce or conceal infringement of a copyright.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Myeress v. Elite Travel Group USA\n   </em>\n   , the Court found that the watermarked name of the copyright owner-plaintiff constituted CMI and that the alleged removal of the watermark by the defendant established a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for a \u00a7 1202(b) violation. No. 18-CV-340 (AJN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205961424\">\n    2018 WL 5961424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 14, 2018). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts from which the Court can plausibly infer that the watermarks described in the complaint and shown in Exhibit C constitute CMI for the purpose of the alleged \u00a7 1202(a) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The cases cited by Defendant do not dictate a different result. Defendant cites\n   <em>\n    Michael Grecco Photography, Inc. v. Everett Collection, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n    589 F.Supp.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), another action brought by Plaintiff, in which the Honorable Colleen McMahon rejected Plaintiff's claim based on the placement of the defendant's logo on images to which Plaintiff held a copyright. There, Judge McMahon found that the logo simply identified the defendant, Everett Collection, Inc. (\"Everett\"), as the originator of the website on which the images appeared.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n    at 387-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Plaintiff's claim in that case was that the logo falsely designated the origin of the images in violation of \u00a7 43(a) of the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 386-87 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Indeed, in granting summary judgment on this issue, Judge McMahon described Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims as \"no more than ...\n   <em>\n    copyright infringement\n   </em>\n   disguised as Lanham Act claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Everett Collection\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n    589 F.Supp.2d at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The facts of that case are even further distinguishable, as Plaintiff admitted in its 56.1 Statement that Everett's logo did not constitute a claim to be the author or copyright owner of the images at issue, and it acknowledged that Everett's website expressly stated that \"Everett is not the copyright holder of the images.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3176199\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/589/375/#p387\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, the holding in\n   <em>\n    Everett Collection\n   </em>\n   is consistent with the Court's holding here that Plaintiff has stated a claim for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also cites to a case in which Alamy and others were accused of violating\n   \u00a7 1202(a),\n   <em>\n    Highsmith et al. v. Getty Images (US), Inc. et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 16 Civ. 5924 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 28, 2016). In that case, the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff granted Defendant's motion to dismiss all claims under \u00a7 1202(a). Though Judge Rakoff's order dismissing the plaintiff's claims stated that a memorandum explanation of the dismissal would be forthcoming,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Dkt. 68, no such memorandum appears to have been published on the public docket. Thus, the Court cannot discern the reasons for dismissal in that case. Nevertheless, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    Highsmith\n   </em>\n   to be highly distinguishable, as the parties in that case disputed the nature of the plaintiff's copyrights in the images at issue because she had gifted all rights in the images to the United States Library of Congress.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 31, \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 67, at 2-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, Defendant cites the Second Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Authors Guild, Inc. v. HathiTrust\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064297\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/87/#p95\">\n    755 F.3d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2014), in which, Defendant argues, the panel authorized Defendant's display of low-resolution, watermarked copies of the Copyrighted Works on its website under the fair-use doctrine. (Def.'s Br., at 11.) But\n   <em>\n    Authors Guild\n   </em>\n   does not address Alamy's use of the watermarked images alleged in the complaint; it merely approves of an Internet search engine's display of \"low-resolution versions of copyrighted images in order to direct the user to the website where the original [can] be found.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064297\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/87/#p95\">\n    755 F.3d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Second Circuit constrained its fair-use holding in\n   <em>\n    Authors Guild\n   </em>\n   in an important way, stating that even if a particular use of the copyrighted work could fall under the fair-use doctrine, that use \"must not excessively damage the market for the original by providing the public with a substitute for that original work.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064297\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/755/87/#p95\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This market competition damage is precisely what Plaintiff complains of here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 35.) Accordingly, even if the placement of watermarks on low-resolution copies of the Copyrighted Works could, under some circumstances, constitute a fair use,\n   <em>\n    Authors Guild\n   </em>\n   does not shield Defendant from liability at the pleadings stage of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   To the extent that Defendant challenges the adequacy of Plaintiff's pleading of the scienter elements of a \u00a7 1202(a) claim, the Court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded that Defendant acted with knowledge and intent in placing watermarks on the Copyrighted Works in order to conceal copyright infringement. Rule 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows intent and knowledge to be alleged generally, and the Second Circuit requires district courts to be lenient in allowing scienter issues to survive motions to dismiss \"because such issues are 'appropriate for resolution by the trier of fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3481681\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/677/#p693\">\n    585 F.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Press v.

Here, Plaintiff has alleged that Defendant was informed by Superstock that the Survival Term had expired, and that Defendant knew the expiration deprived it of the authority to further license and display the Copyrighted Works without further permission from Plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant placed watermarks on the Copyrighted Works in order to facilitate its continued marketing and sale of licenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.) While the truth of these allegations must be ascertained at a later stage of litigation, they are sufficient as stated to survive a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because the Court finds that Plaintiff has adequately pleaded that (1) Defendant provided CMI that (2) it knew was false (3) for the purpose of concealing copyright infringement, the complaint states a claim for relief under \u00a7 1202(a) of the DMCA. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss Count II of the complaint is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Immunity Under Section 512(c)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Defendant seeks to dismiss all of Plaintiff's claims with respect to one of the 27 Copyrighted Works, a photograph of Bob Marley registered with the Copyright Office under Registration Number VA 1-736-729 (\"the Marley photograph\"). Defendant argues that the exhibits attached to the complaint make clear that this photo was posted by a third-party participant in an online message board hosted on the Alamy website. (Def.'s Br., at 13.) Defendant claims that because Alamy is an Internet service provider within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20512\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), it cannot be held liable for copyright infringement claims arising from user-generated content.

Without addressing the merits of Defendant's claim that it is entitled to the protection of the DMCA's safe harbor provision for Internet service providers, the Court finds that Defendant's entitlement is not apparent on the face of the complaint or its attachments, even as to the Marley photograph. Defendant bases its motion to dismiss on a screenshot attached as part of Exhibit C to the complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 13-14; Exhibit C, Dkt. 1-3, at ECF\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   2.) Yet the complaint expressly characterizes this exhibit as containing \"exemplary screenshots or printouts,\" rather than detailing each instance of alleged copyright infringement. (Compl. \u00b6 23.) While the screenshot referenced by Defendant does appear to show a user-generated post featuring the Marley photograph, this fact would not preclude liability for alleged instances where Defendant, rather than a user of the Alamy website, displayed the Marley photograph and offered copies for prospective license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Agence France Presse v.
