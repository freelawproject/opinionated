This unusual employment case, however, arises from\n   Plaintiff Kristina Vonderhaar's allegations that she was\n   <em>\n    forced\n   </em>\n   to take FMLA leave after reporting that her co-workers were making unauthorized changes to customer accounts. Shortly after returning to work, Plaintiff alleges she was mistreated. As a result, she voluntarily resigned and brought this lawsuit nearly two years later, asserting the following eight (8) counts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Count I:\n   </strong>\n   Interference with Rights Under the FMLA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II:\n   </strong>\n   Retaliation for Exercising FMLA Rights,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Count III:\n   </strong>\n   Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (\"IIED\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Count IV:\n   </strong>\n   Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (\"NIED\")\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Count V:\n   </strong>\n   Negligence/Vicarious Liability\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VI:\n   </strong>\n   Wrongful Termination Based Upon Constructive Discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VII:\n   </strong>\n   Punitive Damages\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Count VIII:\n   </strong>\n   Causation and Damages\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This matter is now before the Court on Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doc. 36).

(Doc. 36-4, \u00b6 3). Throughout her employment with AT &amp; T, Vonderhaar worked as a Retail Sales Consultant at the Maysville, Kentucky location.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 6). There, Vonderhaar reported to Jessica Webb, the store manager, until sometime in 2014 when Fred Hoskins took over as store manager. (Doc. 38-5, Pl.'s Dep. 31-32). The store managers reported to Amy Waymire, the area retail sales manager.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 30-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2014 and 2015, employee requests for FMLA leave time were processed by AT&amp;T's FMLA Operations team located in San Antonio, Texas. (Doc. 36-6, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5). This team was tasked with determining whether to approve or deny FMLA leave and would notify both the employee and their supervisor of the decision via e-mail. (Doc. 35-8 at 46-48). Significantly, an employee's supervisor or manager does not have access to medical documentation; nor do they have any input into the decision to approve or deny a request for FMLA leave. (Doc. 36-6, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November and December of 2014, Vonderhaar underwent multiple hysterectomy surgeries. (Doc 38-5 at 44-45). Around this same time, the FMLA Operations team received a certification from Vonderhaar's health care provider regarding the surgery. (Doc. 36-6, \u00b6 11). The medical certification stated that intermittent leave was medically necessary for two days per week. (Doc. 36-6, Ex. 1). In due course, the FMLA Operations team approved Vonderhaar's FMLA request.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She then took continuous FLMA leave from November 24, 2014 to February 2, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (Doc. 38-5 at 115); (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 9). When Vonderhaar returned, she resumed working in her same previous position, performed her usual duties, and earned the same salary. (Doc. 38-5 at 115); (Doc. 36-5, \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Vonderhaar testified that sometime near the end of 2014 or early 2015, AT &amp; T's management informed employees of a change in policy, which was that going forward, adding temporary phone lines to customer accounts without authorization was prohibited. (Doc. 38-5 at 60, 68). Notwithstanding\n   the policy change, in February 2015 Vonderhaar alleges her co-workers added unauthorized temporary phone numbers to customer accounts. (Doc. 38-5 at 60-61); (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Vonderhaar, she informed the assistant store managers, Hannah Eves and Tabitha Everman, that employees were making unauthorized changes to customer accounts. (Doc. 38-5 at 65-66). Vonderhaar, however, did not report the alleged misconduct to Waymire, AT &amp; T's Ethics Hotline, or any public entity. (Doc. 38-5 at 65, 67, 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Roughly a month later, on March 6, 2015, the FMLA Operations team received a second medical certification from Vonderhaar's health care provider, signed March 2, 2015, indicating that Vonderhaar suffered from heart palpitations and was incapacitated from February 19, 2015 to March 13, 2015. (Doc. 36-6, Ex. 2);\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This certification, however, stated that intermittent leave was not medically necessary. (Doc. 36-6, Ex. 2). Nonetheless, the FLMA Operations team approved Vonderhaar for intermittent FMLA leave on nine (9) dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On or about April 8, 2015, Vonderhaar verbally reported to Eaves that a co-worker had added an extra line to an existing customer's account by signing a two-year contract without the customer being present at the store. (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 11); (Doc. 38-5 at 57-58). Contrary to company policy, the transaction took place over the phone. (Doc. 38-13 at 11). On April 8, 2015, after her conversation with Eaves, Vonderhaar utilized AT &amp; T's anonymous, third-party operated Ethics Hotline to report the incident. (Doc. 38-5 at 74-75); (Doc. 36-4, \u00b6 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, AT &amp; T's HR department launched an investigation on April 28, 2015. (Doc. 36-7, \u00b6 6). After Eaves and the accused co-worker were interviewed, it was concluded that the allegations were unsubstantiated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (Doc. 36-4, \u00b6 12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Vonderhaar's Workplace Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Vonderhaar, like other AT &amp; T employees, received regular training on AT &amp; T's Code of Business Conduct (\"COBC\") and was aware of her obligation to treat others professionally and respectfully in the workplace. (Doc. 38-6 at 35-36). AT &amp; T also maintained a progressive discipline and attendance policy. Under AT &amp; T's Attendance Guidelines, infractions were assigned a point value in \u00bc increments depending on the degree of tardiness, ranging from \u00bc to 1 full point. (Doc. 36-5,\n   Ex. 1 at 118).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discipline was carried out by issuing the employee: a Counseling Notice at 4 points; a Written Warning at 5 points; a Final Written Warning at 6 points; and Termination at 7 points.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, 180 days after an attendance infraction, the associated point value is extinguished.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 16, 2015, Vonderhaar received a Counseling Notice for four unexcused absences. (Doc. 38-8 at 10). A Written Warning was sent to Vonderhaar on March 6, 2015, after an additional unexcused absence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But attendance was not the only issue. On March 25, 2015, Vonderhaar's store manager at the time, Hoskins, reported an incident to AT &amp; T's HR department, in which Vonderhaar was reported to have yelled and directed profanity toward another co-worker. (Doc. 36-5, \u00b6 9); (Doc. 38-12 at 2-3). Vonderhaar was never disciplined for this incident. (Doc. 36-5, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on March 27, 2015, Hoskins was informed that Vonderhaar had again used profanity with two different co-workers in a conversation about the company's new attendance policy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vonderhaar does not recall this incident. (Doc. 38-5 at 93). It is undisputed, however, that Hoskins met with Vonderhaar. According to Hoskins, he discussed the incident with Vonderhaar, reminded her of appropriate workplace behavior, and documented the conversation. (Doc. 36-5, \u00b6 10); (Doc. 38-4 at 1). Vonderhaar recalls differently, and claims she was \"singled out\" by Hoskins to discuss the new attendance policy because she was concerned about how it would affect her FMLA. (Doc. 38-5 at 93, 155). Vonderhaar alleges that in that meeting, Hoskins told her \"not to worry about [the new attendance policy], we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Don't worry about the FMLA, [and] how that will affect you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 93, 154-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In either event, Vonderhaar was not disciplined for this incident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That same day (March 27), Vonderhaar states she experienced a panic attack at work and Eaves drove her to the hospital. (Doc. 38-5 at 94). She was prescribed anxiety medication and released the same day.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 94, 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 16, 2015, Vonderhaar received a Final Written Warning for having accrued a total of six unexcused absences between November 15, 2014 and April 2, 2015. (Doc. 38-8 at 16). The next day, Waymire met with Vonderhaar, Hoskins, and Eaves. In the meeting, Vonderhaar recalls her managers repeatedly asking, \"what was going on\" and whether she was \"having issues\" or \"problems.\" (Doc. 38-5 at 100). In addition, Vonderhaar alleges she was told that she was \"resentful to the company,\" her \"hormones were not in check,\" and that she should take an unpaid leave-of-absence so that she did not lose her job. (Doc. 38-5 at 99-101); (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 13). When Vonderhaar refused because she could not afford to go without a paycheck, Waymire allegedly suggested she take the leave-of-absence in the form of FMLA leave and short-term disability in\n   order to cover her wages. (Doc. 38-5 at 100). Vonderhaar eventually agreed and that day took 4.82 hours of intermittent FMLA leave. (Doc. 36-2, Ex. 7 at 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Thereafter, Vonderhaar took continuous FMLA leave from April 21, 2015 to May 27, 2015. (Doc. 36-6, \u00b6 17); (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, Vonderhaar received short-term disability benefits from April 28, 2015 to May 27, 2015. (Doc. 36-6, \u00b6 17). While on leave, Vonderhaar phoned AT &amp; T's Ethics Hotline on May 21, 2015, and reported that Waymire had forced her to take a leave of absence in retaliation for reporting the unauthorized changes to customer accounts. (Doc. 38-5 at 122-23). An investigation was conducted by AT &amp; T's HR department and was eventually closed when Vonderhaar's allegations of retaliation and violations of company policy could not be substantiated. (Doc. 36-8, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When Vonderhaar returned to work, she was reinstated to her previous position, performing the same job duties and earning the same salary. (Doc. 38-5 at 119). At this time, Vonderhaar alleges she witnessed multiple instances where her co-workers added the cost of insurance to customer accounts without authorization. (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 15). Vonderhaar testified that she informed Waymire and Hoskins that \"fraud was still being committed on the accounts\" but never stated the specifics of the alleged misconduct. (Doc. 38-5 at 82-84). Indeed, Vonderhaar admits that she never filed a complaint via the Ethics Hotline; nor did she contact a public agency to report that insurance charges were being added without authorization.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 84-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After returning from her \"forced\" FMLA leave of absence, Vonderhaar admits that she was never denied FMLA leave. (Doc. 38-5 at 121). In fact, Vonderhaar requested and was approved to take 5.7 hours of FMLA leave on May 30, 2015, and 8 hours of FMLA leave on June 5, 2015. (Doc. 36-2, Ex. 7 at 63, 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Vonderhaar avers that after she returned to work at the end of May 2015, she \"was being treated different.\" (Doc. 38-5 at 143-44). In particular, Vonderhaar claims that: (1) she was \"verbally attacked by a customer in the middle of the sales floor\" and Hoskins failed to intervene, (Doc. 38-5 at 139-41); (2) she was not receiving \"coaching sessions\" from Hoskins and was not informed of her sales goal for the portion of May 2015 when she returned from her FMLA leave,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 141, 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) she felt like Waymire was indifferent toward her and would ignore her and \"not even make eye contact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 142-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the other hand, Vonderhaar also testified that when she returned to work, she was never demoted; her job responsibilities were never reduced; she received the same salary; and management never told her she was being terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202615\">\n    at 119, 139, 148-149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, on June 10, 2015, Vonderhaar sent an e-mail to Waymire\n   and others, informing them she was resigning, effective June 24, 2015. (Doc. 38-15). The reason for her decision, she explained, is that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [C]ertain individuals have been allowed to cross certain boundaries that the rest of the staff and myself would never dare cross resulting in fraud to the be perpetrated on customer accounts with no repercussions....

The rule prohibiting this tactic is especially applicable in this case because the Complaint only vaguely mentions in passing that \"Defendants denied [Vonderhaar] FMLA benefits\" when they \"forc[ed] [Vonderhaar] to take FMLA leave.\" (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 26). And in her deposition, Vonderhaar testified that\n   <em>\n    all of her\n   </em>\n   FMLA requests \"were approved\" and that Defendants were simply defending an \"involuntary\" FMLA leave claim. (Doc. 38-5 at 52, 121).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 38. at 15-25). Rather, Vonderhaar simply asserts that she was denied FMLA leave on February 4, 11, and 19. (Doc. 38 at 16). A review of the record, however, reveals there is no medical certification, e-mail, or request form before the Court concerning these dates.\n   <em>\n    Festerman v.

In fact, Vonderhaar's FMLA leave documents plainly demonstrate that her absence on February 19, 2015, was later approved as FMLA leave and removed from her discipline record\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she was issued her Final Written Warning. (Doc. 38-10 at 7; Doc. 38-8 at 16). The record is simply devoid of any evidence to support the notion that Vonderhaar was denied FMLA leave. Thus, the factual contentions Vonderhaar has raised for the first time at this stage are not properly before the Court and will not be considered. Consequently, where appropriate, the Court will consider the facts asserted by Defendants as \"undisputed for purposes of the motion.\" 11 MOORE'S \u00a7 56.81(2) (citing Fed. R. Civ.

Thus, Vonderhaar's naked proffer is insufficient to defeat summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Vonderhaar, however, contends there are four additional facts that show that she was constructively discharged. The law holds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   First, Vonderhaar avers that Hoskins failed to intervene when she was \"verbally attacked by a customer in the middle of the sales floor.\" (Doc. 38-5 at 139-41). But this is merely an isolated incident involving the actions of a third-party, and therefore does not amount to constructive discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v. S.

(Doc. 38-5 at 141, 150). To constitute an adverse employment action, the act of an employer failing to train an employee must result in \"a deprivation of increased compensation,\"\n   <em>\n    Clay v.

Moreover, the record demonstrates that Vonderhaar was treated no differently than other similarly situated employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In other words, Vonderhaar has presented no evidence to refute the fact that: (a) managers provide \"coaching sessions\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   only for those employees on \"an active step of discipline for job performance,\" which Vonderhaar was not, (Doc. 36-5, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15); and (b) all of AT &amp; T's sales consultants are able to access their sale goals and metrics on a\n   <em>\n    daily basis\n   </em>\n   via the company's intranet system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. Thus, Vonderhaar was not constructively discharged simply because she did not receive \"coaching sessions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Next, Vonderhaar states that she felt like Waymire was indifferent toward her and would ignore her and \"not even make eye contact.\" (Doc. 38-5 at 142-43). But \"[h]urt feelings,\" without more, is insufficient to constitute intolerable working conditions.\n   <em>\n    Festerman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4312589\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/611/310/#p315\">\n    611 F.

Putting aside the conclusory nature of the statement, the only \"harassment\" that can presumably be gleaned from the record is again an isolated incident that Vonderhaar testified occurred in a meeting, in which Vonderhaar's managers allegedly told her that her \"hormones were not in check.\" (Doc. 38-5 at 99-101); (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 13). This \"fleeting\" comment, as opposed to remarks that span the course of Vonderhaar's employment, cannot not form the basis of a colorable FMLA retaliation claim even if the comment was construed to be related to the \"exercise of her FMLA-protected rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Weigold v.

That is, Vonderhaar asserts that she was \"constructively discharged for her failure and/or refusal to violate\" various State and federal laws or otherwise remain \"complicit with fraud.\" (Doc. 1-1, \u00b6 46; Doc. 38-5 at 143, 147).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vonderhaar's theory fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In limited circumstances, requiring an employee \"to engage in activity she considers illegal and immoral\" may create intolerable working conditions necessary to sustain allegations of constructive discharge.\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

(Doc. 36-4, \u00b6 12; Doc. 36-8, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   And most significantly, Vonderhaar, unlike\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to make unauthorized changes to customer accounts \"or otherwise [become] entangled in her coworkers' failure to [adhere to company policy]\" by virtue of her position as a retail sales floor associate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20F.%20App%27x%20100\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As such, the conduct of Vonderhaar's co-workers has no impact on her working conditions in this case, and her wrongful-termination claim therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   To be sure, Vonderhaar's claim falters because the basis for her claim does not fit within the applicable \"well-defined public policy\" exception.\n   <em>\n    Grzyb v.

App'x at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff was terminated outright for \"discovering and reporting\" illegal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 506. On appeal, he maintained he would become complicit in unlawful activity by signing off on engine blocks he knew were defective, a practice he witnessed, objected to, and refused to follow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 508-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In this case, Vonderhaar testified that she was never asked by her managers to: (1) sign a contract for a customer without the customer being present at the store, (Doc. 38-5 at 79, 69); (2) add the cost of insurance to customer accounts without informing the customer,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-84; or (3) \"violate the law in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86. Instead, the basis for her claim is that she became aware of assistant manager Eaves discounting a transaction for a co-worker who, while speaking to a customer over the phone, had signed a two-year agreement in the customer's name and added a line of service to an electronic device that Vonderhaar had originally sold. (Doc. 38-5 at 57, 70-72; Doc. 38-13 at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As a result, Vonderhaar brought the information to assistant manager Eaves's attention and then later reported the incident via AT &amp; T's anonymous Ethics Hotline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74; (Doc. 38-13, Rep. &amp; Investigation at 7, 10). Vonderhaar reasons that by refusing to remain \"complicit in another employee's forging of a customer's signature ... she set off a chain of events that culminated in her constructive discharge.\" (Doc. 38 at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The defect in Vonderhaar's theory, as in\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , is that it is not evident from this isolated incident that she \"would have inevitably been forced to participate or become complicit in any illegal activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413202\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/714/504/#p509\">\n    714 F. App'x at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if Vonderhaar\n   were the sole sales consultant at her store location, and unauthorized changes to customer accounts were \"systematic,\" it would be \"unreasonable to infer\" that somehow Vonderhaar was complicit simply because the fraudulent activity involved a customer with which Vonderhaar previously had dealings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413202\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/714/504/#p509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Thus, like\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , \"although [her] coworkers may have been engaging in illegal activity, [Vonderhaar, herself], was never affirmatively asked to violate the law, nor did [her] position make it inevitable that she would be forced to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12413202\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/714/504/#p509\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Simply put, the conduct of Vonderhaar's co-workers is separate and apart from her job responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Therefore, Kentucky's public policy exception to the employment-at-will doctrine does not embrace Vonderhaar's claim, and therefore Vonderhaar has failed to show that she was constructively discharged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    V. VICARIOUS LIABILITY/NEGLIGENCE (COUNT V), PUNITIVE DAMAGES (COUNT VII), AND CAUSATION AND DAMAGES (COUNT VIII), ARE NOT INDEPENDENT CAUSES OF ACTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In Count V, Vonderhaar asserts a claim for vicarious liability based on the negligence of Defendants' agents. But the doctrine of \"\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   is not a cause of action. It is a basis for holding the [Defendant] responsible for the acts of its agents.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Bryan v.

Therefore, Count V is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Count VII sets forth a claim for punitive damages. Again, \"a claim for punitive damages is not a separate cause of action, but a remedy potentially available for another cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    PNC Bank, N.A. v. Merenbloom\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 15-6361, 16-5277,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203973962\">\n    2017 WL 3973962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (6th Cir.

But\n   <em>\n    Chesley\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable because that case involved a specific Kentucky statute that \"treat[ed] punitive damages as a 'claim.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385845\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385845\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/524/471/\">\n    at 481-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
