In filing this suit, Plaintiff Jonathan Dowling lays bare his family's difficult journey. Dowling asserts that the embryology practice where Dowling and his wife sought assistance caused the couple unwittingly to agree to a high-tech in-vitro fertilization procedure which, in their view, led to their infant son's severe and ultimately fatal birth defects. Before this opinion unfolds, it is important to recognize the depth of the Dowlings' suffering and loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now the Court must review the Complaint for legal sufficiency. Defendants A.R.T. Institute of Washington, Inc. and Erika Cullingford (collectively, \"Defendants\") have moved to dismiss the Complaint or in the alternative for summary judgment. ECF No. 7. Dowling has opposed the motion and moves for partial summary judgment in his favor. ECF No. 21. The Court held a hearing on February 25, 2019. For the following reasons, the Court denies Defendants' motion and grants Dowling's motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jonathan Dowling (\"Dowling\") is a Lieutenant Commander in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the United States Navy. ECF No. 1 at 2. For quite some time, he and his wife Kathryn had wanted a baby, and tried a variety of fertility treatments to no avail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. At some point, the couple chose to pursue in vitro fertilization (\"IVF\") at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (\"WRNMMC\") in Bethesda, Maryland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   WRNMMC contracted with the A.R.T. Institute of Washington, Inc. (\"A.R.T.\") to provide embryology services to military servicemembers and their families.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In pursuit of IVF, the Dowlings met with medical staff from WRNMMC and A.R.T. on February 21, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. At this meeting, the Dowlings signed a written consent form pertaining to IVF generally and to a specific type of embryological service called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (\"ICSI\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. ICSI is a procedure where trained medical personnel identify from the male partner's sperm sample a single sperm that provides the best opportunity for fertilization, and then injects that single sperm via a pipette directly into the egg. ECF No. 1-6 at 6. ICSI is often used when \"the sperm may\n   not be judged adequate to achieve fertilization using conventional insemination (putting the eggs and sperm closely together).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the initial meeting with the Dowlings, A.R.T. presented the ICSI consent form for their review and signatures. The form memorialized that the Dowlings understood how ICSI worked, in that prior to an IVF-ICSI cycle, Dowling would provide a semen sample \"for analysis by the andrology laboratory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. If the sample was \"not judged adequate to achieve fertilization using conventional insemination\" or \"where fertilization has failed or was substantially reduced in prior IVF cycles,\" ICSI would offer a better chance of conceiving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As part of the ICSI consent form, the Dowlings were apprised of several risks and precautions. Specifically, under a prominent heading in boldface type which read \"\n   <strong>\n    We understand that ICSI may involve the following risks or disadvantages,\"\n   </strong>\n   the consent form expressly warned that \"[t]his technology is relatively new (started 1992), and there may be unknown risks to the baby or mother.\" ECF No. 1-6 at 6-7. The consent further warned that \"[w]hile there seems to be no higher overall incidence of congenital malformations in children born after ICSI ... the risk cannot be totally ruled out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. The consent form confirmed that the Dowlings knew and understood all the terms: \"We hereby attest that we have read the above referenced consent forms, or that they have been read to us, so that we understand it completely. We further attest that any and all questions of ours regarding all procedures have been answered to our complete satisfaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 7, 2012, Dowling provided a semen sample for evaluation to A.R.T. junior embryologist Erika Cullingford (\"Cullingford\"). ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28, 47. Dowling noted on the accompanying Semen Analysis Form that he had begun taking paroxetine, commonly known as Paxil, that same day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. Cullingford and another A.R.T. employee analyzed his sample and found the sperm's \"pre-wash motility\" to be 39%, with the \"normal value\" noted as &gt;40%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47; ECF No. 1-9. The form also noted a finding of \"ICSI Low initial motility.\" ECF No. 1-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Dowlings then began their IVF procedure, which included Kathryn Dowling taking hormone stimulants to promote maturation of several eggs at once. Prior to beginning this phase of the IVF process, A.R.T. invoiced the Dowlings for their upcoming IVF cycle, which included a separate charge for ICSI. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 31, 48. When Kathryn Dowling asked A.R.T. about the charge for ICSI, she was told that the \"low initial motility\" finding from the March 7, 2012 sperm sample warranted the use of ICSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The Dowlings paid the invoice in full.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 6, 2012, the Dowlings returned to WRNMMC for the clinic to retrieve Kathryn Dowling's eggs and collect another semen sample from Dowling for fertilization via ICSI.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Before this day, Dowling had researched the effects of Paxil on conception. Specifically, Dowling had read that using Paxil may lead to increased DNA fragmentation in sperm that could complicate pregnancy and risk abnormalities in the fetus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Dowling shared these concerns with the WRNMMC medical providers who responded that the risk of Dowling's recent Paxil use was \"negligible\" in terms of fertilization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 54. Dowling again filled out the A.R.T. Semen Analysis Form, noting that he was taking Paxil and that \"Doctor did not provide information on impacts on sperm. Discovered study last night on internet.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. According to the study Dowling had found, the likely DNA fragmentation\n   in his sperm in July 2012 was 42%, well above the 30% threshold for abnormal DNA fragmentation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. In contrast, when Dowling underwent semen analysis in February 2013, after discontinuing Paxil in October 2012, his DNA fragmentation level was 26%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. In other words, an abnormally high percentage of the sperm sample used for ICSI included damaged sperm attributable to using Paxil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Dowlings proceeded with egg retrieval and fertilization. Dowling provided a sperm sample which Cullingford analyzed as having a \"prewash motility of 48%\" and a \"prewash progression of 40%.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Cullingford noted on the Semen Analysis Form that \"[t]he sample that has been prepared is of ICSI standards ... due to [l]ow initial motility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dowling reviewed this form prior to agreement to use ICSI for fertilization. He understood Cullingford's note to mean that the sample he had given that day (July 6, 2012) had low motility. Consequently, he and his wife consented to the ICSI procedure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A.R.T. selected twelve individual sperm cells to fertilize twelve eggs retrieved from Kathryn Dowling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. On July 11, 2012, an embryo was transferred to Kathryn Dowling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Several days later, the Dowlings learned they were pregnant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In Kathryn's six month of pregnancy, doctors diagnosed the fetus with a rare disorder called pentalogy of Cantrell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. The disorder spans a broad spectrum of severity and may involve major defects to five areas of the body: the sternum, heart, pericardium (heart lining), diaphragm, and abdominal wall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 1-11 at 3. Although the exact prevalence is not fully known, an estimated 5.5 of every 1 million babies suffer from pentalogy of Cantrell of varying severity. ECF No. 1-11 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When J.A.D. was born, doctors determined that J.A.D. suffered from a particularly severe case of the disorder. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 73; ECF No. 1-11 at 4-5. Among other life-saving measures, J.A.D. underwent open-heart surgery, chest closure surgery, and three catheter procedures. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 76. In total, J.A.D. spent roughly half his young life in the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On October 26, 2013, J.A.D. died as a result, at home and in his parents' arms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After losing J.A.D., the Dowlings filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Washington on behalf of themselves and J.A.D.'s estate against the WRNMMC physicians and Washington state military medical personnel pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1-12; ECF No. 1 \u00b6 87 (\"Washington case\"). In the Washington case, the Dowlings asserted claims for lack of informed consent, wrongful death and survivorship based on WRNMMC's participation in the consent and fertilization process. The Washington Complaint also included medical negligence claims against the military physicians who failed to diagnose J.A.D.'s pentalogy of Cantrell in a timely manner. The Washington Complaint, however, did not name A.R.T. or Cullingford as defendants, but rather described them as \"independent contractor[s]\" that provided embryology services to the military medical personnel at WRNMMC. ECF No. 7-8 \u00b6 15. The Washington Complaint also alleged that WRNMMC and A.R.T. medical personnel played various roles in obtaining consent from the Dowlings to undergo IVF-ICSI.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-17 (describing an IVF orientation administered by A.R.T. where\n   the Dowlings signed consent forms);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (Dowling signed consent forms for semen collection and analysis for IVF/ICSI on July 6, 2012 wherein he noted concern about Paxil damaging sperm).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June of 2016, the Dowlings executed a settlement and release with the United States (the \"Settlement Agreement\"). ECF No. 7-2. The Settlement Agreement expressly states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties [the Dowlings and the United States] do hereby agree to settle and compromise each and every claim of any kind, against all persons, in their individual or official capacities, and\n   <strong>\n    against the United States of America and all of its agencies\n   </strong>\n   , whether known or unknown, arising directly or indirectly, from the acts or omissions that gave rise to the above-captioned action under the terms and conditions set forth in this Stipulation for Compromise Settlement and Release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1 (emphasis added). The Settlement Agreement further provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The\n   <strong>\n    United States of America\n   </strong>\n   agrees to pay the sum of [REDACTED] ... which sum shall be in full settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims, demands, rights and causes of action of whatsoever kind and nature, arising from, and by reason of, any and all known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen bodily and personal injuries, damage to property and the consequences thereof, resulting, and to result, from the subject matter of this settlement, including any claims for wrongful death, for which Plaintiffs or their guardians, heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, and each of them, now have or may have hereafter acquire\n   <strong>\n    against the United States of America, its agents, servants and employees\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2 (emphasis added). The agreement finally contemplates possible future litigation against parties not involved in the Washington case, stating\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs ... further agree to reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the United States of America, its agents, servants, and employees from and against any and all such causes of action, claims, liens, rights, or subrogated or contribution interests incident to or resulting from\n   <strong>\n    further litigation or the prosecution of claims by the plaintiff ... against any third party or against the United States, including claims for wrongful death.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). The United States and Dowling consummated this agreement, and the Washington case was dismissed. ECF No. 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 12, 2018, Dowling, individually and as the personal representative of the estate of J.A.D. and to the use of Kathryn Dowling, brought suit against A.R.T. and Cullingford asserting largely, but not wholly, similar claims to those raised in the Washington case. ECF No. 1. Dowling brings suit on his own behalf for failure to provide Dowling adequate informed consent, as well as wrongful death and survivorship claims premised on the same consent failures. The Complaint also pleads negligent misrepresentation against Cullingford for misreporting the results of Dowling's semen analysis and constructive fraud as to both Defendants. Dowling further asks this Court to declare that the Settlement Agreement does not completely bar this suit proceeding against A.R.T. and Cullingford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants contend that dismissal of the Complaint is warranted on several grounds, to include that the Settlement Agreement reaches these claims and parties; that the Washington doctors' negligence in failing to diagnose J.A.D.'s disease sooner constitutes an intervening cause that bars relief; and that the informed\n   consent claims must fail as a matter of law. ECF No. 7. Dowling has cross-moved for partial summary judgment regarding whether the FTCA bars this suit. ECF No. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although the parties urge this Court to review this case under a summary judgment standard, the Court notes that the Complaint incorporates by reference the documents necessary for the Court to treat the Defendants motion as one to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Goines v. Valley Cmty. Servs. Bd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055057\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/159/#p166\">\n    822 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (4th Cir. 2016). Because no formal discovery has taken place, the Court reviews Defendants' motion under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A motion to dismiss is designed to test the sufficiency of the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Presley v. City of Charlottesville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729851\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/480/#p483\">\n    464 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (4th Cir. 2006). The Court accepts \"the well-pled allegations of the complaint as true,\" and construes all facts and reasonable inferences most favorably to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibarra v.

To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint's factual allegations \"must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

This is because the action, as pleaded in both the Washington case and this Complaint, renders the Government actors and A.R.T. Defendants joint tortfeasors. Under Maryland law, joint tortfeasors are \"two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\" Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-1401. Put differently, when reading the Complaint most favorably to Dowling, WRNMMC, A.R.T. and Cullingford participated in the same consent process which Dowling now asserts was negligently conducted. In that respect, the WRNMMC physicians and Defendants in this case are, together, responsible for the consent process and so, together, are joint tortfeasors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Importantly, under Maryland's iteration of the Uniform Contributions Among Tort-Feasors Act, settling against one joint tortfeasor does not, by operation of law, settle against all.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"270358\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/366/660/#p667\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3-1404 (\"A release by the injured person of one joint tort-feasor, whether before or after judgment, does not discharge the other tort-feasors unless the release so provides....\"). However, a settlement with one tortfeasor \"reduces the claim against the other tort-feasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release or in any amount or proportion by which the release provides that the total claim shall be reduced, if greater than the consideration paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, the Settlement Agreement in the Washington case, at\n   worst, may reduce any eventual award.

In this sense, the Dowlings have been \"made whole for identical injury/damages claims,\" and so any recovery is barred by the one satisfaction rule.

However, the plain language of the Settlement Agreement cannot be read to cover all claims for all time arising out of the Dowlings' consent and fertilization process. In fact, the Agreement plainly limits the recovery to all claims\n   <em>\n    as to the United States.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Further, to read the Agreement as Defendants suggest would render useless the provision requiring Plaintiff to indemnify or hold harmless the United States for any downstream \"contribution interests incident to or\n   <strong>\n    resulting from further litigation or the prosecution of claims by the plaintiff ... against any third party\n   </strong>\n   or against the United States, including claims for wrongful death.\" ECF No. 7-2 \u00b6 3 (emphasis added). Indeed, if the Settlement Agreement were to have accorded full satisfaction for all claims arising from the consent and fertilization process, including those against a \"third party\" (A.R.T. or Cullingford), then the parties would have no need for this provision. But the United States and the Dowlings, evidently in recognition that future litigation may arise, negotiated accordingly.

ECF No. 7-1 at 15. In support of this contention, the Defendants primarily rely on the Dowlings' averments in the Washington Complaint.

Undergirding these claims, Dowling avers two main failures in the informed consent process. First, that Defendants failed to inform him of the sperm motility measures used for selecting ICSI, or that his sperm motility measurement on July 6, 2012, the day of fertilization, was above A.R.T.'s threshold for ICSI. Dowling contends that had he known the July 6 sample was above threshold, even only by a few percentage points, the Dowlings would not have chosen ICSI. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 113-115. Second, Dowling contends that Defendants failed to warn the Dowings about the known medical risk of birth defects associated with ICSI. Based on these alleged failures, Dowling brings a claim on behalf of himself (Count II), on behalf of himself and his wife as use plaintiff for wrongful death of J.A.D (Count III), and a survivorship claim on behalf of J.A.D.'s estate (Count IV).

The Court finds that as pleaded, the informed consent claim survives challenge. According to the ICSI consent form, the Dowlings were told that as of July 2012, ICSI may involve \"\n   <em>\n    unknown\n   </em>\n   risks to the baby,\" and that \"[w]hile there seems to\n   <em>\n    be no higher overall incidence of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    congenital malformations\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    in children born after ICSI\n   </em>\n   ... the risk cannot be totally ruled out.\" ECF No. 1-6 at 7\n   (emphasis added). However, during that same time, the scientific and medical community had grown increasingly aware that ICSI produced adverse outcomes regarding congenital malformation. ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 80-84. Scientific and medical literature as early as 2006 had noted that an \"increased rate of birth defects is shown by the trend for increased spontaneous abortions in several ICSI studies where pregnancies were obtained ....\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 82. By 2010, studies reported \"a statistically significant negative effect on embryo quality and pregnancy outcomes in ICSI patients,\" and \"[a]n increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities has been shown in ICSI offspring.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. By 2011, a meta-data study assessing the outcomes of 28 other studies concluded that \"the influence of sperm DNA damage on embryo quality/development may be more significant in ICSI compared to IVF cycles\" because with ICSI the \"natural selection barriers are bypassed entirely and fertilization with highly DNA fragmented sperm is possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The consent form never mentioned any such risk, and in fact stated the opposite: that the risks were \"unknown\" at the time. The failure to advise the Dowlings of the risks for congenital defects associated with ICSI is the very kind of information that could change whether parents like the Dowlings proceed with ICSI or instead use conventional IVF. This would be especially important to individuals like Dowling. He was taking medication with a known complication of increased DNA fragmentation which, when combined with ICSI, further increased the risk of birth defects. The Complaint, taken as true and most favorably to Dowling, therefore, states a sufficient claim for failure to obtain informed consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court similarly denies dismissal on Dowling's alternative informed consent theory-that Defendants failed to inform Dowling that the recommendation for ICSI was based on the initial March 2012 semen sample, not the sample taken on the day of fertilization which exceeded the ICSI motility threshold. Viewing the Complaint allegations as true and most favorably to Dowling, A.R.T. recommended ICSI because of the \"low initial motility\" of the original March 2012 sample. Yet the forms provided to Dowling at the time of fertilization failed to explain this distinction and did not disclose that the sample to be used for ICSI actually exceeded the ICSI motility threshold. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 48.

Certainly, it would be a strange result that A.R.T. must secure informed consent to perform a medical procedure which literally creates life, yet escape liability if its consent process is lacking. Because the Court finds at this stage that Defendants have assumed the duty to obtain informed consent in the context of the medical procedures for which Defendants were responsible, Dowling's informed consent claim survives challenge. After the parties generate a more robust factual record on the roles that A.R.T. and Cullingford played in the consent process, and their involvement in the provision of health care to the Dowlings, the Court will revisit this question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Survivorship and Wrongful Death Claims (Counts III and IV)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court next addresses whether the wrongful death and survivorship claims brought on behalf of J.A.D. may proceed. Dowling asserts that the same failures of consent caused the Dowlings to unwittingly choose ICSI which proximately caused J.A.D. to be born, suffer, and die from severe congenital defects. Dowling brings a wrongful death claim on behalf of himself and his wife for the losses of support and companionship resulting from J.A.D.'s death. Dowling also brings a survivorship claim as the personal representative of his estate for the injuries that J.A.D. could have pursued had he survived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants lodge an array of attacks primarily aimed at the survivorship claim. Defendants principally contend that the survivorship claim is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempted to assert a \"wrongful life\" tort claim unavailable in Maryland. Alternatively, Defendants urge dismissal because the survivorship claim is barred by limitations. To best understand this Court's decision on these arguments requires preliminary discussion of the interplay between wrongful death and survivorship actions under Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Both wrongful death and survivorship actions are creatures of statute.

Dowling does not identify J.A.D.'s injuries as those\n   discussed in\n   <em>\n    Kassama\n   </em>\n   -the difference between being born with pentalogy of Cantrell versus not being born at all. Rather, J.A.D.'s claim is that because the failed consent process caused the parents to use ICSI as opposed to traditional IVF, the injury is the quantifiable difference between J.A.D. being born with or without defects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At first blush, Dowling's argument seems to rest on an intellectual sleight of hand not warranting reflection beyond\n   <em>\n    Kassama.\n   </em>\n   If a successful consent process would have caused the Dowlings to\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   choose ICSI, then query how Dowling will also demonstrate that J.A.D. would have been born through IVF. If he cannot prove as much, then J.A.D.'s claim remains in the same posture as\n   <em>\n    Kassama\n   </em>\n   -J.A.D.'s injury is measured by comparing his life with defects against never being born at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Upon deeper reflection, however, the Court recognizes that in\n   <em>\n    Kassama,\n   </em>\n   the nature of the child's disability contributed to the court's reluctance to find a cause of action, and that as to J.A.D., the court may not approach the matter with the same hesitancy. Unlike a child with Down Syndrome, J.A.D. suffered physical injury because of how he was conceived. His disability necessitated multiple life-threatening surgeries and prolonged hospital stays, ending unquestionably in his death. These are the very kind of injuries which juries are accustomed to weighing, judging and, if liability is found, monetizing. In this respect, the factfinder here need not wrestle with whether J.A.D. \"can lead [a] useful, productive, and meaningful [life]\" in that he could \"be educated, that [he is] employable, that [he] can form friendships and ... get along in society.\"\n   <em>\n    Kassama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455059\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/113/#p137\">\n    368 Md. at 148-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"455059\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/368/113/#p137\">\n    792 A.2d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . J.A.D. clearly could not, and did not, ever enjoy most of these quintessentially human experiences.

Where an active servicemember brings a claim on his own behalf, the time for filing may be tolled during the plaintiff's active service. However, where, as here, the servicemember brings claims in a representative capacity, the SCRA's applicability is not as straightforward. At least one other court has read the SCRA to cover survivorship claims brought by the servicemember as the estate's personal representative where the plaintiff servicemember was the sole surviving heir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilcox v.

The Fourth Circuit has since extended what has become known as the \"\n    <em>\n     Feres\n    </em>\n    doctrine\" to family members of servicemen where the negligence of military personnel as to the serviceman was also the \"genesis\" and \"but for\" cause of the injuries to the family members.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Minns v.

Accordingly, argues Dowling, if the Government is immune from suit on the informed consent claims, it cannot be a joint tortfeasor. Although this argument may, in the end, be correct, the Court cannot decide this issue now. No liability finding against Defendants is before the Court, so any determination as to potential satisfaction stemming from such theoretic liability amounts to an improper advisory opinion. Additionally, the precise contours of\n    <em>\n     Feres'\n    </em>\n    application to this case will require additional factual development.
