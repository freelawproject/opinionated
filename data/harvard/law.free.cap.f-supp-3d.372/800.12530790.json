(Doc. 19). After carefully considering Taylor's petition, Respondent's brief (Doc. 29), the underlying record (Doc. 29, Ex. A-JJ), and Taylor's reply (Doc. 46), I will deny the petition for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    1. Investigation &amp; Arrest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the evening of December 3, 2004, police investigated the St. Louis County home of Angela Rowe and her three children at the request of family members and school officials. (Doc. 29, Ex. P at 23) The investigating officers observed that the front yard \"was covered with the daily paper[,]\" \"[the] [mailbox] was full of mail[,]\" and that all the windows and doors were locked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With the assistance of the fire department, the investigating officers forced entry into the house through a window. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Inside, they discovered the bodies of Rowe and her children: Alexus Conley, age ten; Acqreya Conley, age six; and Tyrese Conley, age five. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P at 24) Each had sustained gunshot wounds to the head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rowe had sustained additional gunshot wounds to the torso and left arm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Q at 28) The officers observed that the temperature inside the house was \"very cold,\" that the television was on, and that there were no indications of burglary or previous forced entry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. P at 25) Based on information from Rowe's family that a fifth person, Taylor, lived at the house, the officers searched the residence and found no one else present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Taylor then became a person of interest within the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Q at 12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The investigation quickly established a) that Taylor had an outstanding arrest warrant for a parole violation; b) that he had a wife, Debrene Williams, in California; c) that he had been driven to Lambert International Airport by his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Williams, on November 26; and d) that he had departed St. Louis that day on a flight to California under the alias \"Louis Bradley.\" (Doc. 29, Ex. P at 21) Using cell phone records, the investigating officers determined that Taylor subsequently traveled from California to Kentucky. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In conjunction with United States Marshals, the investigating officers set up surveillance of several residences in Madisonville, Kentucky that Taylor had been known to frequent in the past. (Doc. 29, Ex. R at 11) On the morning of December 9, 2004, members of the surveillance team observed Taylor attempting to leave one of the residences by hiding on the floorboard of a car's passenger compartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12) The car was stopped and Taylor was subsequently arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15) At the time of his arrest, Taylor was traveling under the alias \"Jason Lovely\" and possessed pamphlets, documents, and other materials laying out procedures for creating additional aliases and fraudulent vital documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. at 15-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Taylor was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and four counts of armed criminal action for the killings of Angela Rowe and her children. (Doc. 29, Ex. A at 55-58) While awaiting trial for their murders, Taylor was tried and convicted on an unrelated charge of forcible rape and sentenced as a persistent sex offender to a prison term of one hundred years without parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362244\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/238/145/\">\n    238 S.W.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. 2007) (summarizing underlying facts and affirming conviction on direct review);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

App. 2011) (noting length of sentence and affirming denial of post-conviction relief). After multiple continuances were granted to Taylor's defense team to ensure adequate representation, his murder trial began on February 25, 2008. (Doc. 29, Ex. P at 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The guilt phase of Taylor's trial for first-degree murder and armed criminal action concluded on February 28, 2008. The jury deliberated for four and half hours before finding Taylor guilty on all counts. (Doc. 29, Ex. S at 59-60) The jury reconvened the next day, February 29, 2008, for the penalty phase of the trial. (Doc. 29, Ex. T) The jury heard evidence of Taylor's prior convictions, testimony from the victim in the aforementioned forcible rape case, and testimony from family members of Angela Rowe and her children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-12) On Taylor's orders, his trial team did not present any argument in mitigation and entered as their sole evidence a written stipulation of Taylor's good conduct while incarcerated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6, 12, 19) The jury deliberated for three hours before recommending the death penalty on each of the four counts of first-degree murder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20) On April 17, 2008, the trial court sentenced Taylor to death on each of the four murder charges and imposed consecutive sentences of life imprisonment on the armed criminal action charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    3. Direct Appeal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Taylor raised eleven grounds in his direct appeal. (Doc. 29, Ex. U at 2) I briefly outline Taylor's arguments on direct appeal as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his first, second, third, and fourth grounds, Taylor argued that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding certain witness statements and other evidence as hearsay. (Doc. 29, Ex. U at 36, 62, 77, and 84)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his fifth ground, Taylor argued that the trial court erroneously admitted forensic test results \"that lacked probative value and [were] unreliable, speculative, and misleading.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his sixth ground, Taylor argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motions to exclude those forensic test results based on the timing of their disclosure to the defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Seventh, Taylor argued that his speedy trial rights under Missouri state law and under the Missouri and United States Constitutions were violated by the multiple continuances granted to his defense counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Eighth, Taylor argued that the trial court erroneously admitted a conversation between his brother Perry and the police, during which Perry stated that Taylor had confessed to the murders of Angela Rowe and her children, because the interrogating detective allegedly expressed an opinion as to Perry's credibility as a witness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 118)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ninth, Taylor argued that the trial court erroneously allowed a cause strike of a potential juror who had expressed reservations about her ability to consider capital punishment during voir dire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Tenth, Taylor argued that the State made improper arguments during closing\n   and that the trial court plainly erred by not intervening\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. 29, Ex. U at 129)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Taylor argued that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a mistrial when, upon being found guilty by the jury, he was handcuffed in view of the jury while being removed from the courtroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 133)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Missouri Supreme Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   addressed each of Taylor's claims on the merits and affirmed the trial court's judgment on October 27, 2009.\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299439\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/298/482/\">\n    298 S.W.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    4. Post-Conviction Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Taylor raised eighteen grounds in his amended motion for post-conviction relief, which incorporates his prior pro se motion for post-conviction relief. (Doc. 29, Ex. Z at 42-114, Ex. AA, Ex. BB at 5-27) Two of these grounds are related to claims Taylor raises in his habeas petition. The first is that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his defense team failed to adequately examine phone records used at trial and adduce allegedly favorable evidence from cross-examination of the phone records' custodians. (Doc. 29, Ex. AA at 5) The second ground that Taylor's waiver of evidence / counsel at the penalty phase of the trial was not knowing, voluntary, and unequivocal is related to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim Taylor raises for the first time in his habeas petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The post-conviction court conducted an evidentiary hearing on May 20, 2011, on three of Taylor's claims: two ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims and a claim that the death penalty as administered in Missouri is unconstitutional. (Doc. 29, Ex. DD, Ex. EE) The post-conviction court denied Taylor's motion for relief on September 19, 2011. (Doc. 29, Ex. CC at 38-69)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    5. Appeal of Post-Conviction Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Taylor appealed the denial of post-conviction relief to the Missouri Supreme Court. (Doc. 29, Ex. FF) He raised four grounds in his appeal. His first and second grounds disputed the post-conviction court's findings on claims raised at the evidentiary hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-40, 43-82, 83-116) His third and fourth grounds alleged that the post-conviction court erred in refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on additional claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-42, 117-129, 130-138) The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the post-conviction court's decision on October 30, 2012. (Doc. 29, Ex. II)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    6. Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Taylor raises eight claims in his petition for habeas relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, that his speedy trial rights under Missouri state law and under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution were violated by the delay of approximately thirty-one months between his invocation of his speedy trial right in July of 2005 and his trial in February 2008. (Doc. 19 at 5-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, that his constitutional right to present a complete defense under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments was violated by the exclusion of allegedly favorable evidence as hearsay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of phone records and for failing to adequately investigate those records to identify their utility for cross-examination, and that his rights to due process of law and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment under the Fourteenth\n   and Eighth Amendments were violated by allegedly false testimony given by a phone records custodian. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-42)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Fourth, that his constitutional rights to due process of law and a fundamentally fair trial under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated when the trial court denied his motion to exclude forensic test results on the basis of their late disclosure and allegedly misleading nature. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-50)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Fifth, that his constitutional rights to due process of law and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments were violated by the exclusion of a prospective juror on the basis of her views on capital punishment, because those views allegedly did not impair her ability to abide by her duties as a juror. (Doc. 19 at 50-54)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Sixth, that his constitutional rights to due process of law and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment were violated by the State's allegedly improper arguments during voir dire and at closing, and that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to those arguments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-58)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Seventh, that his constitutional rights to due process of law and to be free of cruel and unusual punishment were violated when he was handcuffed in front of the jury at the conclusion of the guilt phase of his trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Eighth, that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to disregard Taylor's directive to not make a closing argument at the penalty phase of the trial. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-62)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A federal district court's power to review state court criminal decisions in a federal habeas corpus proceeding is limited.\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

In February 2005, private counsel entered his appearance on Taylor's behalf. The complaint was superseded by an indictment filed on March 30, 2005.

Taylor objected to this request. The court granted the request, and trial was set for October 11, 2006.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   In November 2005, the State filed a motion to reconsider the order extending the trial date, arguing that Taylor properly filed his speedy trial request and that as a result, the case should be tried before January 21, 2006. The State was also concerned with whether Taylor's counsel's caseload was sufficient good cause to continue the case. After a hearing was held, the trial court denied the State's request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In July 2006, Taylor's trial counsel filed a motion to continue, requesting additional time for investigation and preparation for trial. After a hearing, the trial court overruled the motion. A motion to reconsider this denial was filed and included \"Defendant's Consent to Continuance\" signed by Taylor, requesting that the case be continued, \"as additional time is needed for defense counsel to prepare for trial.\" Judicial notice was taken of the arguments raised at the previous hearing, and the case was continued to May 2007.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In September 2006, the case was transferred to a different judge.

The Court addressed the prejudice prong as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Prejudice, of course, should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. This Court has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.

In its analysis of prejudice as a result of the trial continuances the Missouri Supreme Court considered\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the fact that Taylor was incarcerated at that time as the result of an unrelated conviction. This is only one of three interests the right to a speedy trial was meant to protect. Yet Taylor fails to establish any interest that was prejudiced by the delay. His conclusory assertion in his reply brief that the delay \"deprived him of the exculpatory evidence contained in the videotaped statements of Gerjuan Rowe, Beverly Conley, and Sherry Conley\" does not suffice. (Doc. 46 at 30) Taylor fails to explain how the videotaped statements would have differed, if at all, from the in-person testimony Beverly &amp; Sherry Conley actually provided at trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 29, Ex. S at 31-33 (Beverly Conley) and 34-37 (Sherry Conley) ) Nor does he explain how they would have differed, if at all, from the excerpts of Gerjuan Rowe's deposition that were read to the jury at trial.

The length of the delay was considerable, though not \"presumptively prejudicial\" as Taylor asserts. (Doc. 19 at 13) \"[The] length of delay that will [generate presumptive prejudice] is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.

The statement was about Rowe's location at a specific time in response to a question from Gerjuan. The statement did not concern an event or describe or explain an event that Rowe perceived. Further, the statement lacks indicia of trustworthiness. Taylor did not offer any evidence corroborating the statement that Rowe made the call from a pay telephone on November 28th. Although Gerjuan's cell phone records show an\n   <em>\n    outgoing\n   </em>\n   call to the pay telephone at 4:36 a.m. on November 28th, the statement was offered to prove that [Rowe]\n   <em>\n    placed the call\n   </em>\n   from the pay telephone. There is no record of an incoming call from the pay telephone to Gerjuan's cell phone or any telephone, and there is no evidence of outgoing calls from the pay telephone. Lastly, neither Rowe nor Gerjuan was subject to cross-examination to resolve the confusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   The statement is also not admissible pursuant to the constitutionally based hearsay exception in the due process clause because it lacks circumstances of reliability. The statement was not against Rowe's interest or spontaneously made, and most importantly, as discussed above, this statement is not sufficiently corroborated by other evidence in the case. In addition to the lack of evidence in the phone records, Gerjuan's testimony regarding the dates of events\n   prior to the murders, such as when she last saw Rowe, was conflicting,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the circumstances of this telephone call were also unclear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Finally, the curative admissibility doctrine does not apply.

In the alternative, he argues that if the \"check\" does contain hearsay, it is admissible as a statement of Rowe's state of mind of her \"belief that she was alive and physically able to write a check on that date\" or admissible as verbal conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

(Doc. 29, Ex.

(Doc. 29, Ex. AA at 13-14) This contradicted the testimony of Cathy Herbert, records custodian for Charter, who had testified at trial that the Charter records contained all outgoing calls. Herbert was again called to testify at Taylor's post-conviction hearing. (Doc. 29, Ex.

Christopher Avery, senior counsel for Charter, was called to testify. (Doc. 29, Ex. DD at 92-102) Avery testified that Charter began using a standard disclaimer in March or April of 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. DD at 95) Avery testified that prior to that, Charter's disclaimer policy was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   Q. ...

Victim's children did not return to school Monday, November 29 following the Thanksgiving break. Newspapers in victim's yard started accumulating November 26, and her mailbox was full of mail. All of the windows and doors of victim's home were locked when the police entered December 3, and there were no signs of forced entry. The police found [Taylor's] fingerprints on a can of Glade air freshener in victim's kitchen. They recovered 10 bullets from the home, victim[,] and her children. All had been fired from the same gun - a .38 or .357-caliber revolver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-329\">\n   In addition to the evidence found in victim's home, [Taylor] confessed to his brother that he killed victim and her children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Taylor's] brother gave a taped interview to the police on December 8. In that interview, he stated that [Taylor] called him on November 24 and asked to borrow money. [Taylor] said that he needed to get away and that he had killed victim after she came at him with a knife. He killed her children because they were witnesses. The next day, [Taylor] again spoke with his brother, telling him that he was still in victim's home with the bodies because he was waiting for a letter from his\n   wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police found an opened, unsigned letter in victim's home dated November 22 and postmarked from California. The letter contained four short sentences: \"Is your man faithful? ? ? Eventually it all comes out. Enjoy it now. Because he's not yours.\" In addition to telling his brother about the letter, [Taylor] also said that he had turned on the air conditioning in victim's home. When the police entered and located the bodies December 3, they noticed that the thermostat was set to the lowest setting, the air conditioning was on and it was noticeably cool inside the home, unusual for December in Missouri. All of this evidence supported the jury's verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-330\">\n   [Taylor's] actions just prior to leaving St. Louis November 26 also permitted an inference of guilt. [Taylor] went to his sister-in-law's home November 26 asking for a ride to the airport. His sister-in-law saw him throw what appeared to be a long-barreled revolver into the sewer near her home. [Taylor] told his sister-in-law that he was leaving town because people were trying to kill him and that she would not see him alive again. He also warned her that she would hear things about him that were not true. After she dropped him off at the airport, he boarded a flight to Phoenix, then California, traveling under the name Louis Bradley.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-331\">\n   The vehicle [Taylor] drove to his sister-in-law's home presented additional evidence of guilt. He had parked the vehicle, his brother's Chevrolet Blazer, outside his sister-in-law's home prior to leaving for the airport. The next day, [Taylor's] wife called her sister ( [Taylor's] sister-in-law). [Taylor] could be heard in the background yelling that the Blazer should be put into the garage. Later that week, [Taylor's] brother picked up the Blazer. The police found a partial box of Winchester .38 special ammunition inside the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-332\">\n   [Taylor] was arrested December 9 as he tried to leave another girlfriend's home in Kentucky. He attempted to avoid authorities by lying on the floorboard of a car leaving the home. After his arrest, he gave the police a false name and Missouri identification with that name. The police found additional identification with yet another false name, as well as pamphlets about creating a new identity, in [Taylor's] belongings. A pair of glasses he had been seen wearing before the murders was found in his luggage. Forensic testing revealed the possible presence of blood on one of the nose guard areas. The sample was too small for further testing, but a partial DNA profile extracted from the area eliminated the children, but not victim, as a source. The DNA profile was found in 1 in every 12,930 African-American persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n   These facts indicate overwhelming evidence of guilt and demonstrate that [Taylor] is unable to show that,\n   <em>\n    but for\n   </em>\n   any alleged unprofessional errors of counsel, the result in his trial would have been different. Having failed to meet the \"but for\" prejudice test of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , it is unnecessary to review [Taylor's] claims of ineffective assistance of counsel under the alternative prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   [Taylor] also urges this Court to reexamine the law as to when a defendant is denied due process because he was convicted through the use of false testimony. The Court declines. For [Taylor] to\n   prevail on his claim that due process was violated and post-conviction relief is warranted, he must show that: 1) the testimony given was false; 2) the State knew it was false; and 3) his conviction was obtained as a result of the perjured testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Statler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10168103\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/383/534/#p537\">\n    383 S.W.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (Mo. 1964). [Taylor] asks that the second requirement of the burden be eliminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   Such a change would lead to the nonsensical result of expecting the State to be able to read the mind of its witnesses to refrain from having convictions overturned when a witness gives testimony that he later learns is false. Additionally, such a change would not be helpful to [Taylor.] In this case, as the basis of his due process violation, [Taylor] alleges that the Charter representative's trial testimony regarding its landline records showing all outgoing calls from victim's Charter landline was false testimony. At the post-conviction hearing, the Charter representative acknowledged that when she testified at trial, she was under the impression that Charter records did contain all outgoing calls; only later did she discover that was not true. There is no dispute that, at the time of trial, the State believed that her testimony was true. Even if this Court chose to revise the burden as [Taylor] urges, he still would be unable to demonstrate that his conviction was obtained as a result of the \"false\" testimony for the reason already thoroughly discussed: there was overwhelming evidence of [Taylor's] guilt without the testimony of the Charter representative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   (Doc. 29, Ex. II at 5-9) (emphasis and footnotes in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Respondent argues that this determination is reasonable and entitled to deference under \u00a7 2254(d). (Doc. 29 at 35) Respondent also argues that this claim is meritless, because despite the discrepancies in the records discovered during post-conviction review, \"[Taylor]\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   can point to no evidence of outgoing calls from the victim's home after Taylor left the state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36) (emphasis in original) Respondent argues that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-338\">\n   Counsel did not act unreasonably in failing to tire the jury by nitpicking inaccuracies in phone records that do not ultimately support Taylor's defense theory.... Even had the trial court known that the phone records contained minor errors, there is no support for the proposition that it would have excluded them for \"insufficient foundation\" ( [Doc. 19 at] 35). No evidence comes with a guarantee of \"one hundred percent accuracy\" ( [Doc. 19 at] 34). As Taylor can point to no evidence to prove his assertion that the victim was,\n   <em>\n    in fact, alive\n   </em>\n   after he left the state, he cannot show prejudice in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   As to Taylor's due process claim, he does not assert, as he must, that the State knew their witness's testimony was false at the time it was given.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Napue v.

Also... the Missouri Supreme Court assigned great weight to [Taylor]'s alleged \"confession.\" Again, this is an unreasonable determination of the facts because this alleged \"confession\" was to [Taylor]'s brother who later recanted his statements and testified at [Taylor]'s trial that he had been coerced into giving this statement by the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-343\">\n   Similarly, the other \"overwhelming\" evidence that the Missouri Supreme Court lists is purely circumstantial, (e.g., [Taylor]'s fingerprints on air freshener, bullets found at victim's home, [Taylor] allegedly throwing something into the sewer, [Taylor] parking his vehicle at his sister-in-law's house, circumstances surrounding [Taylor's] arrest in Kentucky), and not direct evidence of petitioner's guilt. Finally, regarding the speck taken from [Taylor's] glasses, the chemical analysis made no definitive determination that this genetic material was blood... Given the romantic relationship between [Taylor] and the victim, she could have left a speck of DNA on petitioner's glasses in any number of ways.

That could mean the Charter records are less complete than they were represented to be at trial, but it could also mean the same of the Sprint records, or of both simultaneously. Critically, it does not logically refute the central point for which the State admitted the records: that after November 25, 2004, the complete absence of outgoing calls from the victims' home phone supported the proposition that they had been killed prior to Taylor's departure from St. Louis on November 26. Taylor's trial counsel argued at trial that the phone records were incomplete and could not be relied upon to prove a lack of activity at the victims' home; the jury considered that argument and rejected it.

S at 58)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   Respondent argues that this claim was denied on the merits by the Missouri Supreme Court and that this decision is reasonable and entitled to deference. The Missouri Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-522\">\n   At trial, Gerjuan Rowe's deposition was read into evidence. The trial court found Gerjuan's testimony that Rowe called Gerjuan from a pay phone on November 28th was hearsay and inadmissible. However, testimony as to the phone call was permitted. During closing arguments, the State argued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-523\">\n   ... what you know from these facts is that the... last outgoing call to Gerjuan Rowe was on the 24th at 12:22 a.m.... from the victim[.] And if you look at the records... you will not find the victim's number after 11/23.... there's absolutely no communication between these two women, sisters, from 11/24 after the - after twenty-two minutes after the hour ever again...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-524\">\n   The State did not refer to the inadmissible statement in Gerjuan's testimony that Rowe had told Gerjuan that she was calling from a pay telephone. In making its closing arguments, the State referred to Gerjuan's and Rowe's telephone records to refute Gerjuan's testimony that she spoke to Rowe after November 24th. The telephone records as\n   well as Gerjuan's testimony that she spoke to Rowe on November 28th were admitted as evidence. It was not plain error to allow these statements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-525\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-526\">\n   Dr. Burch, the medical examiner, testified on direct examination that Rowe and her children had been deceased for two to three weeks before being discovered on December 3rd. On cross examination, Dr. Burch acknowledged that he previously stated in his first deposition that the victims had been deceased for two to three days before being discovered and that it was unlikely they had been deceased since November 23rd. Dr. Burch explained this discrepancy, stating that his testimony in the first deposition did not account for the fact that the air conditioner was turned to 50 degrees, which affected the temperature in the house and his assessment as to time of death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-527\">\n   During closing arguments, Taylor argued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-528\">\n   ... What does Dr. Burch say in his initial deposition before he got prepared by learning that [Taylor] left on the 26th? Most likely time of death was two to three days before they were discovered. They're discovered on the 3rd, what did Dr. Burch say? Most likely time are [sic] these two to three days before they're discovered. That is his medical opinion ... [Taylor continues to discuss the condition in which the bodies were found] ... And Dr. Burch wanted to make some distinction which maybe you understood, about 50 degrees. Well, my opinion changed when I realized that here was an air conditioner running in that house.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-529\">\n   In rebuttal, the State argued:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-530\">\n   ... And believe me if there's somebody else that could refute Dr. Burch they would have put them on the stand. And in his deposition he said three to ten days. It happens on the tenth day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-531\">\n   It is permissible for the State to make retaliatory arguments at closing in response to issues raised by the defense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the State's argument responded to Taylor's argument regarding the credibility of Dr. Burch's testimony.

This was the truth. The fact that Gerjuan Rowe's phone records show that\n   <em>\n    she called\n   </em>\n   a gas station on that date does not corroborate her testimony that the victim\n   <em>\n    called her\n   </em>\n   from a gas station.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-534\">\n   As for Taylor's argument that the state unfairly commented on the failure of the defense to hire an expert to refute the State's expert evidence, \"the government may comment on the failure of the defense, as opposed to the defendant, to counter or explain the evidence [unless] the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Taylor suggests that calendar entries made by the victim show that Taylor did not call simply because he was routinely negligent in calling her. Taylor did not raise this claim in his direct appeal ( [Doc. 29,] Ex. U, pp. 26-37) or on appeal from denial of post-conviction relief ( [Doc. 29,] Ex. FF, pp. 37-42).

The inescapable fact remains that petitioner did absolutely nothing to disrupt the proceedings either before or after he was shackled at the completion of the guilt phase of trial. Therefore, there was no essential state interest to justify the bailiff's shackling of the defendant, and any finding to the contrary is unreasonable under 2254(d)(2). In\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   , the [United States Supreme Court] held that shackling is \"inherently prejudicial\" and is only permissible in \"exceptional case[s]\" where there are \"indisputably good reasons for shackling.\"\n   <em>\n    Deck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869317\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/622/\">\n    544 U.S. at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869317\" index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/622/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ].

(Doc. 46 at 54) The jury had, by that point, observed gruesome photographic evidence of the murders of four victims by gunshot wounds to the head, three of whom were children aged ten and younger. (Doc. 29, Ex. P at 59-62, Ex. Q at 46-50) At sentencing the next day, the jury heard evidence of Taylor's prior convictions, including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, forgery, and two forcible rapes, one of which was perpetrated against his\n   sixteen-year-old stepdaughter.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-11) Because Taylor forbade his trial counsel from arguing a case in mitigation at the penalty phase, this testimony was unopposed. The argument that the jury's decision to impose the death penalty was \"very likely\" influenced, amidst this evidence, by a momentary glimpse of Taylor being handcuffed as a precursor to transport is without merit. As a result, I will deny Taylor's seventh ground for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-585\">\n   <em>\n    8.

[W]hen counsel has failed to conduct a reasonable investigation into possibly mitigating evidence, he cannot possibly advise his client as to the propriety of a particular course of action.... In this case, there is no indication that [defense counsel] alerted [defendant] to the fact that unless he presented some mitigating evidence, a death sentence was certain. Moreover, [counsel] was incapable of adequately advising [defendant] as to value of potentially mitigating evidence, since he had conducted no investigation.... Given that [defendant] faced an almost certain sentence of death, counsel was remiss in not presenting some evidence of mitigation on his behalf, and his failure to do so constituted deficient performance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-643\">\n   <em>\n    Gramley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7835950\" index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/883/225/\">\n    883 F.Supp. at 242-244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-644\">\n   However, the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Gramley\n   </em>\n   and the underlying relationship between Emerson and his trial counsel are factually distinct from the circumstances and relationship between Taylor and his trial counsel in the present case.

There is nothing in the record that indicates that Taylor had a bad relationship with his trial counsel. His counsel vigorously defended him in pretrial proceedings and in the guilt phase of the trial. Taylor's counsel objected to the introduction of evidence and testimony, advocated for the admission of evidence that was excluded, diligently crossexamined the State's witnesses, and called and examined witnesses in Taylor's defense. At the penalty stage of the trial Taylor's counsel objected to the admission of evidence, made an opening statement, and raised objections to the State's examination of a witness. There are indicia in the record that Taylor's trial counsel discussed investigating mitigating evidence with him \"months before trial,\" and refrained from gathering such evidence only because Taylor expressly ordered them not to. (Doc. 29, Ex. AA at 92) Taylor's argument in his amended post-conviction motion appears to acknowledge that his trial team had begun investigating mitigation evidence as a matter of course, and ceased to do so only after receiving Taylor's orders to that effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Taylor unequivocally informed the trial court of his religious based decision directing his counsel not to put on mitigating evidence or make a closing argument at the penalty phase of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-646\">\n   Unlike the turbulent circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Gramley\n   </em>\n   , Taylor's decision was not the result of the ineffective preparation of his trial counsel, it was a knowing and voluntary decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-647\">\n   Taylor's citation to\n   <em>\n    Kubat\n   </em>\n   on this claim is inapposite. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Kubat\n   </em>\n   had specifically asked his counsel to present mitigation evidence at the penalty phase and named an \"impressive array of character witnesses,\" including neighbors, co-workers, and a deputy sheriff, all of whom were willing to testify on his behalf.\n   <em>\n    Kubat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525342\" index=\"478\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/867/351/\">\n    867 F.2d at 366-367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel disregarded defendant's directions, called no witnesses, and presented only a closing argument that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-648\">\n   ... cannot, even charitably, be called a plea for mercy. The argument was, as the district court said, \"a rambling, incoherent discourse... that may actually have strengthened the jury's resolve to impose a death sentence.\"...

But the one thing [a forensic scientist] was consistent on, it's the victim's blood, it's not the kids it's the victim -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-712\">\n    [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, that's a misstatement of the testimony.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-713\">\n    THE COURT: The jury will recall the testimony.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-714\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-715\">\n    [PROSECUTOR]: Remember that, the one nose piece is where they swab, and detected I mean it .03 nanograms of blood, but that's one -\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-716\">\n    [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor, I have to object, nobody testified that it's blood.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-717\">\n    [PROSECUTOR]: I will take that back, Your Honor. It was presumptively tested for blood. There wasn't enough to take a chance on not being able to test a confirmatory test without doing DNA. That was a call by [a forensic scientist], that was the right call to make. It was presumptive blood. We have a bloody room, a bloody struggle, and a piece of blood of Angela Rowe's on his glasses...\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-718\">\n    Taylor's closing argument on this point is:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-719\">\n    ... Now, [the prosecutor] wanted to keep calling that blood on those glasses. Oh, no. Nobody can tell you that. The best you have is a lab technician who runs this phenolphthalein test where she adds some chemicals and she watches it, and then she gets to decide independently if there's a change in color after she applies those chemicals. There's no machinery, there's no computer, there's no chart to gauge a color change but it's a judgment call... What do we know about that phenolphthalein test? What did you learn about that science? Blood is not the only thing that reacts. Horse radish, potatoes, vegetables, rust, bleach, nickel, mental alloyed [sic]. What was in the bag that they claim those glasses came out of? Batteries. What's in batteries? Nickel. Where did these glasses come from? You're going to have to answer that question...\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-720\">\n    This appears to be a reference to another venireperson's prior statement that the economic cost of life imprisonment would influence that venireperson's willingness to impose the death penalty.
