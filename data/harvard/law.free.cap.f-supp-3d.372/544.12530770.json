LAWSON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Following a jury trial, petitioners Gerald Duval and his son Jeremy Duval were convicted of violating the Controlled Substances Act. The convictions were based on the petitioners' operation of a marijuana operation, which was curtailed after two searches of their family farm resulted in the seizure by federal drug task force agents of a total of more than 200 marijuana plants. Gerald Duval was sentenced to concurrent prison terms totaling 120 months. Jeremy was sentenced to 60 months in prison. Supervised release was ordered to follow in both sentences. The convictions were affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Duval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071238\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/246/\">\n    742 F.3d 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir. 2014). Each petitioner then filed a motion to vacate their sentences, alleging government misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The petitioners also argue that the government should be barred from opposing these motions because of a prohibition contained in an appropriations bill relating to marijuana prosecutions. Because none of these claims justifies the relief they seek, the Court will deny both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I. Facts and Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Sixth Circuit included the following comprehensive recitation of the factual and procedural background of the case in its opinion affirming the defendants' convictions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   In May and June 2011, Monroe County Sheriff's Deputy Ian Glick investigated tips from a confidential informant (CI) that led him to conduct surveillance on Gerald [Duval]'s farm and ultimately to apply for and execute two separate search warrants that are at issue in this case. The government contends that Deputy Glick simply conducted a routine investigation to corroborate information supplied by the CI, but the Duvals argue that as duly registered marijuana patients and caregivers under state law, they were the targets of an investigation for which the conclusion was never in doubt. According to the Duvals, Deputy Glick and other law-enforcement officers knew that the Duvals possessed and grew marijuana because agents from the Office of Monroe Narcotics Investigations (OMNI) visited the farm in 2010 and offered advice on how to comply with the MMMA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Deputy Glick was assigned to OMNI, an alliance of state and local law-enforcement officers directed by the Drug Enforcement\n   Agency (DEA), from 2004 to 2007, but was a Task Force Officer working directly with the DEA when his office received a tip that Gerald was growing marijuana on his farm. The tip came from a CI who claimed to have seen marijuana growing in two greenhouses on the farm and to have heard Gerald bragging about growing and selling marijuana. Moreover, the CI claimed that the greenhouses were surrounded by tall chain-link fences and patrolled by Rottweilers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputy Glick took immediate action to substantiate the CI's tip. He consulted the Law Enforcement Information Network (LEIN) and learned that Gerald had a federal felony conviction for cocaine trafficking. This prior conviction prohibited Gerald from qualifying as a caregiver under Michigan law,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20333.26423\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 333.26423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (2008), a status that Gerald never claimed. Deputy Glick then decided to conduct surveillance on the farm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Along with Reserve Deputy Joe Schumaker, Deputy Glick traveled to a tract of land adjacent to the farm. From that vantage point, the officers saw two greenhouses matching the CI's description. Eight-foot-high chain-link fences topped with barbed-wire surrounded the greenhouses. The greenhouses themselves were constructed from opaque plastic slats and were almost completely bordered by a three-foot-tall layer of burlap that ran along the perimeters of the buildings. Open ventilation windows located slightly above the layer of burlap material provided a view into the interiors of the greenhouses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Using binoculars to peer through the ventilation windows from a distance of approximately 75 to 100 yards, Deputy Glick and Reserve Deputy Schumaker observed a \"large quantity\" of marijuana plants. In addition, Reserve Deputy Schumaker testified that open doors on the southern sides of the greenhouses provided an unobstructed view of the marijuana. Deputy Glick subsequently prepared a search-warrant affidavit based on the CI's now-corroborated tip and his own personal observations. A Monroe County magistrate issued a search warrant on June 15, 2011.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Deputy Glick's affidavit in support of the June 15 search warrant included a description of the greenhouses. The two opaque structures, surrounded by barbed-wire fences, were allegedly constructed after OMNI officers told the Duvals in September 2010 that secure facilities were needed to comply with the MMMA. Although the Duvals claim that Deputy Glick provided this advice, other officers testified that Deputy Glick was neither a member of OMNI in September 2010 nor on duty on the date of the visit. Deputy Glick himself denied being present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Regardless of whatever prior encounters occurred between OMNI and the Duvals, law-enforcement officers searched the farm on June 16, 2011. In particular, the officers searched a two-story house, the two greenhouses, and a large pole barn, seizing 144 live marijuana plants, seven firearms, and various other items related to marijuana cultivation. No criminal charges, however, were brought against the Duvals under state or federal law at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   But the June 16 search did not end the investigation. On July 18, 2011, the CI again contacted Deputy Glick and reported that the Duvals had replanted marijuana in the greenhouses. Agent Brendan Gillen and Task Force Agent Jeremy Langenderfer subsequently traveled to the same tract of land adjacent to the farm and saw marijuana \"growing the length of both greenhouses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   After verifying the information, Deputy Glick obtained another warrant to search the farm - only this time he sought the warrant in federal court based on probable cause for federal narcotics violations. Law-enforcement officers executed this second search warrant on August 9, 2011, seizing 67 live marijuana plants from the two greenhouses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In November 2011, the Duvals jointly requested a hearing under\n   <em>\n    Franks v. Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    57 L.Ed.2d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), for the purpose of suppressing the evidence gathered during the June 16 and August 9 searches. The district court held a hearing on the Duvals' motion to suppress in January 2012, ordering the parties to file supplemental briefing and provide additional photographic evidence related to the searches.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A second evidentiary hearing was held in March 2012. The district court denied the motion to suppress at the conclusion of the second evidentiary hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   After a nine-day trial in April 2012, the jury found the Duvals guilty on the drug-related counts in the indictment, but not guilty on the counts related to the firearms. On October 1, 2012, the district court sentenced the Duvals, who shortly thereafter filed timely notices of appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Duval\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071238\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/246/\">\n    742 F.3d at 249-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal, the Sixth Circuit rejected on the merits the defendants' arguments that (1) \"the June 15, 2011 search warrant [was] invalid because Deputy Glick made deliberate 'material omissions' concerning the Duvals' status as registered patients and caregivers under Michigan law in order to obtain the warrant,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071238\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/246/\">\n    742 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   250 ; and (2) \"the June 15 search warrant [was] invalid because Deputy Glick applied to a state magistrate rather than to a federal magistrate judge, allegedly in violation of Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071238\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/246/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071238\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/246/\">\n    at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    833 F.3d 1163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016), the Ninth Circuit addressed \"whether criminal defendants may avoid prosecution for various federal marijuana offenses on the basis of [the riders] that prohibit[ ] the United States Department of Justice from spending funds to prevent states' implementation of their own medical marijuana laws.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That court held that injunctions might be appropriate in certain cases, if not to enjoin the marijuana law prosecutions themselves, then at least \"to enjoin the DOJ from\n   <em>\n    spending funds\n   </em>\n   from the relevant appropriations acts on such prosecutions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But nothing in the December 2014 and following appropriation acts has any impact on these 2012 prosecutions and convictions, which were completed\n   <em>\n    more than two years before\n   </em>\n   any marijuana-related restrictions were imposed by Congress on the DOJ. Certainly nothing in the appropriations riders supplies any support for a conclusion that the convictions were unsound or that relief is warranted now under section 2255 ; no federal court ever has held that the rider provides any species of affirmative defense to a charge under the Controlled Substances Act.\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350591\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1163/\">\n    833 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1179 n.5 (\"To be clear, [the appropriations rider] does not provide immunity from prosecution for federal marijuana offenses. The CSA prohibits the manufacture, distribution, and possession of marijuana. Anyone in any state who possesses, distributes, or manufactures marijuana for medical or recreational purposes (or attempts or conspires to do so) is committing a federal crime.... Nor does any state law 'legalize' possession, distribution, or manufacture of marijuana. Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, state laws cannot permit what federal law prohibits. U.S. Const. art VI, cl. 2. Thus, while the CSA remains in effect, states cannot actually authorize the manufacture, distribution, or possession of marijuana. Such activity remains prohibited by federal law.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, the petitioners have not cited any authority for the remarkable proposition that the government is foreclosed from opposing a motion to vacate a conviction\n   and sentence by a subsequent enactment that does not even suggest that the prosecution or conviction was unauthorized when it was completed, years before that enactment. And the petitioners' present incarceration by the Bureau of Prisons is not implicated by the funding rider, because there is no suggestion that any funds appropriated to the Department of Justice are involved there.\n   <em>\n    Sandusky v.

Cal.

Petitioner's continued incarceration simply does not violate [the appropriations act] because it is not an expenditure of funds by the Department of Justice that prevents California from implementing laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. Petitioner's [funding rider] claim therefore fails on the merits.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As this Court and others have observed, the rider permits a defendant, at most, to seek limited relief in the form of a\n   <em>\n    pretrial\n   </em>\n   evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendants were in \"strict compliance\" with all aspects of the applicable state laws, and, if so, whether an injunction against continuation of a pending prosecution should be granted.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He also believes that upon showing such\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence, he is entitled to present an affirmative defense to the charges to the factfinder. That is incorrect. The sole purpose of the evidentiary hearing to which the\n   <em>\n    McIntosh\n   </em>\n   court referred is for the court to decide whether the DOJ is violating the appropriations rider, thus providing a basis for enjoining the spending of funds.\n   <em>\n    The hearing is not a forum for the defendant to present an affirmative defense to the federal charges brought against him.\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even if they had sought such a hearing, these petitioners certainly could not have prevailed under enactments that did not even exist in 2012. Moreover, given the vast quantities of marijuana plants seized from their farm, there is no plausible possibility that the petitioners could have demonstrated that they ever were in \"strict compliance\" with Michigan's MMA; and Gerald Duval admittedly was not because he never maintained that he was authorized as a grower under state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pertinent here is the fifth condition, which requires that \"not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(5). \" 'The defendant bears the burden of showing eligibility for the safety valve by a preponderance of the evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But even if he could show deficient performance stemming from his lawyer's disregard of instructions to arrange a meeting with the government, he cannot show prejudice. Gerald offers nothing to support the empty assertion that he would have given a \"truthful and complete account\" of his participation in the growing operation. And nothing in the record suggests that he would have offered anything beyond his trial testimony, in which he denied any involvement. That testimony, of course, indisputably was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   complete or truthful, since it is plain that the jury found him guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In his motion, Gerald Duval asserted, without elaboration, only that if he \"had been given the opportunity to satisfy the final requirement of \u00a7 3553(f), he would have offered the Government all of the information and evidence he had concerning the charged offenses.\" His sketchy affidavit attached to the motion posits little more, where he merely stated that he had \"read the facts supporting my Motion to Vacate and Set Aside [his] Sentence under 28 U.S.C. 2255 and can attest to the truth and accuracy of those facts.\" Gerald Duval decl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 121-4, PageID.3747. Those vacant assertions are nowhere near the sort of comprehensive account of a compelling allocution that a defendant must advance to support his claim that he likely would have received relief under the safety-valve provision if he had been permitted to confess. As the Tenth Circuit has explained, a district court cannot find prejudice from a debriefing denied absent a compelling and specific recitation of what information would have been offered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [E]ven if Mr. Herrera-Zamora had been able to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would have cooperated, we conclude that he still would not be entitled to a [certificate of appealability on the question whether his trial lawyer was ineffective].

Mr. Herrera-Zamora never told the district court in the instant case what information he would have disclosed to the government to qualify for safety-valve relief. As a result, he left the district court powerless to conclude that there was a reasonable probability that the sentencing court would have granted such relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
