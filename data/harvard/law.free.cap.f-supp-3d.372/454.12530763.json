For the following reasons, the Motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Ticket Reserve, Inc. (\"TTR\") developed software to allow sports fans of particular teams to purchase options for tickets to major sporting events such as play-offs or final games so that, if their team was involved, the sports fans could buy tickets to that sporting event. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 7). In March of 2007, Defendant CBS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Corporation paid $ 8,400,000 for 10,000,000 shares of TTR preferred stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; ECF No. 13 at 4). On December 31, 2012, CBS sold the shares back to TTR for $ 1.5 million. (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 12; ECF No. 13 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 24, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint against TTR, alleging, among other things, that TTR violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. (\n   <em>\n    See SEC v. Narayan et al.\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-01417-M, ECF No. 2). This Court appointed Michael Napoli as Receiver over TTR. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF No. 12). The Receiver was given the authority to \"pursue and preserve all of [TTR's] claims\" and \"to institute such actions and legal proceedings for the benefit and on behalf of the Receivership Estate as the Receiver deems necessary or appropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF No. 12 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 26, 2017, the Receiver filed this suit against CBS, seeking to recover the $ 1.5 million that TTR paid to CBS to repurchase its stock. On May 23, 2018, due to a potential conflict of interest resulting from the Receiver's move to a different law firm, the Court appointed Ferdose al-Taie as Special Receiver over this action. (ECF No. 43). The Special Receiver alleges that TTR's repurchase of TTR stock from CBS is invalid because TTR was insolvent when the redemption occurred. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1). The Special Receiver asserts four counts: (1) a claim under Illinois common law to recover payment to a shareholder by an insolvent corporation; (2) a claim for money had and received; (3) a claim for unjust enrichment; and (4) claims under Sections 5(a)(1), 5(a)(2) and 6(a) of the Illinois Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Chapter 740, Act 160 \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Fraudulent Transfer Act\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 20, 2018, the Special Receiver filed her Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, requesting that the Court grant summary judgment on the Special Receiver's claim under Illinois common law. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on August 27, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 60). At the hearing, the parties agreed to a bench trial. (Hearing Tr. at 7:11-13, 61:2-4) (The Special Receiver waived her \"right to a jury trial on the issues of insolvency\").

To succeed on summary\n   judgment, the Special Receiver must show that there is no genuine issue of material fact that (1) TTR was insolvent when it repurchased its stock from CBS, and (2) TTR's redemption of its stock injured a TTR creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Special Receiver and CBS submitted expert reports on the issue of TTR's insolvency. However, at the hearing before this Court and in briefing submitted after the hearing, the Special Receiver stated that \"TTR's financial statements\" alone prove that TTR was \"unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.\" (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66 at 2). The Special Receiver references an Independent Auditors' Report for the Year Ended December 31, 2012,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32-1 at APP. 39-54, and A/P Aging Summaries for TTR,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%201186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at APP. 55-95. CBS objects to the Special Receiver's reliance on the A/P Aging Summaries, arguing that the Special Receiver failed to establish a foundation for the A/P Aging Summaries. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 67 at 5-6). The Court agrees. The Special Receiver's expert has not established that the underlying materials on which the A/P Aging Summaries are based are admissible or that the underlying materials were made available to CBS for inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 1006. The Court declines to consider the A/P Aging Summaries for the purposes of determining the Special Receiver's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on the Independent Auditors' Report alone, the Court finds that it cannot determine as a matter of law whether TTR was able to pay its debts in the ordinary course of business as of December 28 and December 31, 2012, and that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether TTR was insolvent at the time of the redemption. At trial, the parties should be prepared to present the Court with evidence as to whether TTR was insolvent-as defined by Illinois common law-at the time TTR repurchased its shares from CBS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether the Redemption Injured a TTR Creditor\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Special Receiver has not submitted sufficient evidence that TTR's redemption had an adverse effect on a TTR creditor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 58 at 5, 7). CBS presents evidence that \"TTR's liquidity did not change materially between the December 28 and December 31, 2012 dates and/or as a result of the CBS December 31, 2012 Redemption Transaction,\" and that \"[t]he funds paid to CBS were given to TTR by an investor earmarked specifically for the purpose of redeeming CBS's shares and the funds would not have been invested in TTR if CBS's shares had not been redeemed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47-2 at 3). The Court finds there is a fact issue as to whether TTR's redemption of its shares from CBS injured a TTR creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that the Special Receiver's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (ECF No. 30) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Special Receiver cites\n    <em>\n     American Heritage Inv.

However, these cases are inapposite because they analyze Section 6 of the Illinois Business Corporations Act of 1975 (now Section 9.10 of the current BCA), which establishes liability for directors, and they do not analyze the common law rule, which establishes liability for shareholders.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
