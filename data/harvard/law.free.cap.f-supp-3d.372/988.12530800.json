In December 2017, Dialpad launched Dialpad Free, which purports to be a zero-cost Web-based free business VoIP phone system for businesses with five employees or less.

But RingCentral cites to nothing in the claims or specification of the '367 patent that supports its assertions that its identified problem is new to virtual PBX systems, or that its claimed arrangement of elements yields any specific technical improvements over the prior art, and it is to that language that courts must look to determine whether the patent \"constitutes a concrete implementation of the abstract idea in the form of an inventive concept.\"\n   <em>\n    Affinity Labs\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1271 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

As Dialpad persuasively argues, these are functions that humans have routinely performed and are therefore abstract.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 1316-18 (finding a claim \"receiving, screening, and distributing e-mail\" to be abstract);\n   <em>\n    Twilio, Inc. v.

Cal. 2017) (\"[S]electing the best message routing option based on separately-transmitted feedback is a fundamental human activity, applied to a specific technical environment,\" and is \"an abstract idea.\"). For example, corporate executives might tell their assistants that calls be directed to their office phone number during certain hours, their mobile phone number during other hours, and their home phone number during still other hours. RingCentral makes much of the claim's user interface to update those routing parameters, but the method describes nothing more than an automated way of an executive calling his or her assistant to make those changes. In both scenarios, the control is in the user's hands, and someone or something else actually makes the modifications. The claimed method is not directed to any \"specific asserted improvement in computer capabilities,\" nor is it \"necessarily rooted in computer technology.\"\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/#p1338\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1336 ;\n   <em>\n    DDR Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055750\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/773/1245/#p1257\">\n    773 F.3d at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court also finds the claim to be patent ineligible under step two. As with the '367 patent, RingCentral does not contend that the elements at issue in the '496 patent - virtual PBX systems and user interfaces - are inventive. Instead, it argues that the patent survives step two because of its \"non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces.\"\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n    827 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In particular, RingCentral argues that \"the '496 patent departs from prior art\n   virtual PBX systems by relocating the provisioning of a user's time-based call-handling settings to each user.\" ECF No. 31 at 20. However, unlike the patent at issue in\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   , nothing in the '496 patent requires location of any tool at any specific location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BASCOM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n    827 F.3d at 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The inventive concept described and claimed in the '606 patent is the installation of a filtering tool\n   <em>\n    at a specific location\n   </em>\n   , remote from the end-users, with customizable filtering features specific to each end user. This design gives the filtering tool both the benefits of a filter on a local computer and the benefits of a filter on the ISP server.\" (emphasis added) ). In this case, although the claim refers to a \"user request,\" \"user interface,\" and \"user command,\" neither it nor the specification provide that these be housed in any particular location or describe how the claimed method improves any computer capabilities. ECF No. 24-2 at 33. In fact, the written description explains that \"[a] user\n   <em>\n    or an administrator\n   </em>\n   can access the user interfaces using, for example,\n   <em>\n    a web browser available on a mobile device or personal computing platform\n   </em>\n   , and access the corresponding account through the user interfaces after successful authentication.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (emphasis added). Thus, the language of the patent explicitly provides that an administrator, in addition to a user, can access the user interfaces, and that the interfaces may be accessed through any web browser, including one on a mobile device. This is not inventive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   RingCentral's reliance on a single sentence in the patent does not change this result. The patent states that \"[s]ervices and features typically are provisioned by the telecommunications network or on-premise servers and not the telephone device itself.\" ECF No. 24-2 at 21. But, as Dialpad correctly observes, \"typically\" is not equivalent to \"exclusively.\" Similarly, as discussed above, the written description explains that the user interface is accessed via a web browser - a technique that is not unconventional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, RingCentral argues that dependent claims 8, 10, and 16 contain an inventive concept \"by allowing the user to configure enhanced 911 [ (\"E-911\") ] registration.\" ECF No. 31 at 21 n.7. \"E-911 services ... route an emergency call to a 911 dispatcher and provide[ ] the dispatcher with a geographic location (e.g., street address) from which the call is originated, while traditional 911 services route[ ] an emergency call to a 911 dispatcher without providing the dispatcher with geographic location information indicating where the call is originated.\" ECF No. 24-2 at 31.

The functions described in the claims could all be performed by humans. For example, imagine a person who has two mobile devices (i.e., clients), which can receive both voicemail and fax messages, but who also keeps a master copy of his or her voicemail and fax messages on a desktop computer (i.e., the equivalent of a server copy). Imagine further that messages on all of those devices are stored in various electronic folders or mailboxes (i.e., clusters).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That person could decide at any time to synchronize the messages stored on the desktop with the messages on one or both of the mobile devices. To do so, the person - or an assistant to whom he or she made a synchronization request - could compare each folder or mailbox on the desktop with each folder or mailbox on the first mobile device, noting any discrepancies, including when the desktop and mobile device showed different read or unread statuses for a particular message. The person could then synchronize the desktop copy with the copy on the first mobile device, making changes only where required, and then repeat the process for the second mobile device. Thus, \"with the exception of generic computer-implemented steps, there is nothing in the claims themselves that foreclose them from being performed by a human.\"\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I v.

The claims are directed to patent-ineligible abstract ideas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Nor does the step two analysis render the claims patent eligible. RingCentral contends that \"the claim limitations of both the '363 and '669 patents specify multiple inventive concepts, including an unconventional cluster-wide discrepancy-based synchronization process, synchronization of multiple types of messages (including, specifically, fax or voicemail messages), and the ability to synchronize message clusters across multiple client devices.\" ECF No. 31 at 15.
