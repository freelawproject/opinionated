Nos. 211, 212\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, United States District Court Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently pending before the Court are cross motions for summary judgment by third-party plaintiff Old Republic General Insurance Corporation (\"Old Republic\") and third-party defendant Motorists Mutual Insurance Company (\"Motorists\") regarding the latter's duty to defend in an underlying construction case. (Dkt. Nos. 211 and 212.) The Court heard oral argument on the motions on February 5, 2019. Having duly considered the parties' written and oral arguments, and the admissible evidence submitted, and for the reasons set forth herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   as follows: (1) the cross-motion of Motorists for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   ; and (2) the motion of Old Republic for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . The Court finds that the undisputed material facts show that there was no potential for coverage under the Motorists policy at issue with respect to additional insureds Architectural Glass and Aluminum Co., Inc. (\"AGA\") and Webcor Construction, LP dba Webcor Builders (\"Webcor\") for claims raised in the underlying litigation. Accordingly, a duty to defend did not attach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. SUMMARY OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Underlying Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The instant third-party complaint stems from an underlying construction defect action filed in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of San Francisco captioned\n   <em>\n    CDC San\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francisco LLC v. Webcor Builders. Inc. et al.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CGC15-546222. The complaint in the underlying action alleged that plaintiff therein, CDC San Francisco LLC, entered into a construction agreement with Webcor, the general contractor, to build a project known as the Intercontinental Hotel. (Old Republic Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. A [Complaint in Case No. CGC15-546222, hereinafter \"ORRJN Exh. A\"].) The agreement, in part, called for Webcor to design and build an exterior curtainwall system that would serve as the exterior wall of the hotel. The exterior curtainwall system is \"an interconnected system of azure-blue glass that forms the building's entire exterior such that the Hotel appears in the San Francisco skyline as a 32[-]story translucent blue tower of glass.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) AGA was the \"curtainwall contractor\" for the project, and was responsible for designing, engineering, testing, fabricating, delivering, and installing the curtainwall system. (Motorists Fact\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The underlying action, filed on June 9, 2015, alleged that the curtainwall glazing system was comprised of a structural frame into which insulated glass units (IGUs) were fastened. (ORRJN Exh. A \u00b6 12.) The IGUs were comprised of two panes of glass, a spacer bar, structural silicone sealant to secure the panes of glass and metal spacer together, and polyisobutylene (\"PIB\") sealant to form a vapor barrier or hermetic seal around the interior perimeter of the module. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Motorist Fact 7.) AGA also subcontracted with Viracon, Inc. to manufacture the IGUs. (Motorist Fact 6.) AGA subcontracted with Midwest Curtainwalls, Inc. (\"Midwest\") to (1) design and manufacture the curtainwall frame; (2) glaze (or glue) the IGUs into the frame; and (3) ship the completed curtainwalls to San Francisco where AGA installed them at the project site. (Motorists Fact 9, 10.) The project included 6,400 IGUs. (Old Republic Fact 8.) The project was completed around February 27, 2008. (Old Republic Fact 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the underlying action, CDC San Francisco LLC alleged that migration or movement of the PIB sealant had caused a gray film or \"mottling\" in the interior space of the IGUs, as well as discoloration of the structural silicon to a brownish color on the visible edges of the IGUs. (Motorists Fact 12; ORRJN Exh. A \u00b6 14.) The complaint therein alleged \"there is no way to repair the PIB without damaging the [IGUs] and the exterior Curtain Wall glazing system to access the film formation.\" (ORRJN Exh. A at \u00b6 14.) The complaint explained in considerable detail the defects with the curtain wall system and the warranties associated therewith. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-25.) In addition to these factual allegations, the underlying complaint alleged potential damages based upon the \"substantial costs to repair the deficient work\" and the \"costs to repair\n   <em>\n    property damaged by\n   </em>\n   deficient work....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 34, 41, 45, 51, 57, 61, 67, 72, 77, 81, 86, 90, and 95 (emphasis supplied).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subcontractor Midwest obtained a commercial general liability policy from third-party defendant Motorists, with an effective policy period of June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007 (Motorists policy number 33.261515-90E or \"the Policy\"). (Motorists Fact 19.) The Policy included as additional insureds both AGA and Webcor.

Defense of the Underlying Action\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Both AGA and Webcor tendered their defense to Motorists, and Motorists denied a duty to defend them. (Old Republic Facts 39-41 and 45-47.) Motorists provided a defense to Midwest under the Policy, though it did so under a reservation of rights. (Old Republic Facts 29-30.) Old Republic provided a defense for AGA and Webcor in the underlying action. The underlying action settled on April 24, 2017. (Old Republic Fact 28.)\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    Old Republic filed the instant third-party complaint against Motorists for contribution toward the costs of defense paid by Old Republic on behalf of Webcor and AGA on July 12, 2017.

Summary Judgment\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The parties each have filed motions for summary judgment on the issue of whether Motorists had a duty to defend Webcor and AGA. Summary judgment is appropriate when \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is mandated \"against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n    <em>\n     Celotex Corp. v.
