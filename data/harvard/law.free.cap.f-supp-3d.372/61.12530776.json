However, the statute contains no provisions expressly creating a private right of action for consumers aggrieved by such violations. Citing <em>Alexander v. Sandoval</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">532 U.S. 275</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">121 S.Ct. 1511</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301210\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/275/\">149 L.Ed.2d 517</extracted-citation> (2001), the Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer one based on a congressional finding that spam may be used to \"perpetrate fraudulent schemes.\" <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207703\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703</extracted-citation>(c)(1). Nothing about this finding supports the inference that Congress intended to create a private remedy. Indeed, it appears that Congress contemplated that the Federal Trade Commission and related regulatory agencies would carry out the enforcement of the statute. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207706\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7706</extracted-citation>(a) (stating that the \"chapter shall be enforced by the Commission as if the violation of this chapter were an unfair or deceptive act or practice proscribed under section 57a(a)(1)(B) of this title.\"); S.Rep.

AS TO WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF STATED A CLAIM UNDER GBL SECTION 369E.</strong></p><p id=\"p-29\">Section 369e prohibits the use of false, deceptive or misleading advertising in the sale of consumer products or services sold in connection with the opportunity to receive gifts, prizes or gratuities from a game, contest or other promotion. The statute does not expressly provide a private right of action. Absent an express private right of action, New York courts will only conclude that \"a private right of action may fairly be implied\" where: (1) the plaintiff is one of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was enacted; (2) recognition of a private right of action would promote the legislative purpose; and (3) creation of such a right would be consistent with the legislative scheme. <em>Sheehy v.

However, in <em>Cruz v.

Thus, the Second Circuit concluded that an out-of-state victim possesses standing to sue under Section 349 so long as \"some part of the underlying transaction occurred in New York State.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058510\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/115/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058510\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/115/\"> at 124</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Mountz v.

They assert that their claims fall within Section 349 because \"a substantial amount of the acts and omissions complained of occurred in this District (New York).\" ECF 22 at 18. However, the Plaintiffs support this conclusory assertion with no specific facts showing that any part of the transactions occurred in New York. As a result, the Complaint fails to articulate a sufficient connection to New York even under the more lenient <em>Cruz</em> standard.</p><p id=\"p-37\">In an attempt to create such a connection, the Plaintiffs analogize their claims to those in <em>Cruz</em> because, as in <em>Cruz</em> , the parties agreed that New York law will govern the claims against the Defendants. <em>Cruz</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058510\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/115/\">720 F.3d at 124</extracted-citation>. But that fact was only one of many considered by the Second Circuit, which predominately focused on whether the transaction itself occurred in New York. Although the existence of a New York choice-of-law provision somewhat weighs in the Plaintiffs' favor, the Court disagrees that this fact standing alone constitutes a sufficient transactional nexus to New York. Parties enter into choice-of-law clauses for a whole host of reasons, such as their views on the favorability of the law of a particular jurisdiction. Stretching Section 349 to apply to all cases where the parties agree on New York as their law of choice would depart from <em>Cruz</em> 's instruction to focus on the strength of New York's connection to the transaction at issue. <em>See</em> <em>Cline v. TouchTunes Music Corp.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272129\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/211/628/#p633\">211 F.Supp.3d 628</extracted-citation>, 633 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (finding transaction fell outside of Section 249's reach when \"only connection[ ]\" alleged in the complaint was the choice of \"New York as the governing law and forum selection provision, the location of [the defendant's] servers, and the electronic transmission of the users' music choices.\").</p><p id=\"p-38\">That being said, it is also not the case that the Plaintiffs' allegations are so inadequate that any attempt to obtain standing under Section 349 would be futile. Without commenting on the merits of any future amendments, it seems likely that the Plaintiffs possess some specific transactional nexus to New York omitted from the Complaint, given the Defendants' residency in New York and the parties agreement to apply New York law. Accordingly, the Court will provide the Plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint addressing the problems identified by the Court.</p><p id=\"p-39\"><strong>2. As to the Sufficiency of the Allegations in the Complaint.</strong></p><p id=\"p-40\">To state a claim under Section 349, \"a plaintiff must allege that a defendant has engaged in (1) consumer-oriented conduct that is (2) materially misleading and that (3) plaintiff suffered injury as a result of the allegedly deceptive act or practice.\" <em>Koch v.

The Court finds that the allegations in the Complaint lack the particularity required to satisfy the notice pleading requirements of Rule 8.</p><p id=\"p-41\">The Complaint generally asserts that the Defendants engaged in materially misleading behavior without setting forth any facts tying that behavior to the Plaintiffs' specific claims. It fails to identify the specific advertisements seen by each plaintiff and provides no explanation why those advertisement created a mistaken belief that purchasing a product would increase that plaintiff's chance of winning. Without this information, the Plaintiffs cannot state a Section 349 claim. <em>See</em> <em>Abraham v. Am. Home Mortg. Servicing, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233508\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/947/222/#p235\">947 F.Supp.2d 222</extracted-citation>, 235 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (dismissing Section 349 claim that \"contain[ed] only general allegations about disclosures to all Plaintiffs and does not contain any allegations about the specific disclosures [the individual plaintiff] did or did not receive\").</p><p id=\"p-42\">The Plaintiffs provide a number of explanations why the vagaries in the Complaint suffice to withstand a motion to dismiss. None are persuasive. The Plaintiffs cite previous lawsuits and Congressional findings where the Defendants were accused of engaging in deceptive behavior. These other allegations are tangentially relevant at best. While the Defendants' history of misconduct might theoretically add context to whether the advertisements were materially misleading, it sheds no light on whether the Plaintiffs, in particular, were misled. Similarly, the Plaintiffs contend that the Complaint contains examples of deceptive marketing materials sent by the Defendants. However, the Plaintiffs cannot recover for any deceptions in those materials unless they, in fact, received and/or viewed them. Moreover, the Court cannot determine whether the advertisements are materially misleading without knowing exactly what representations each plaintiff saw.</p><p id=\"p-43\">Stated otherwise, Section 349 does not create a strict liability scheme in which consumers may pursue private remedies simply because a defendant sent deceptions into the marketplace. To succeed, plaintiffs must tether that deception to their individual circumstances. As the Complaint lacks any such connection, it cannot survive a motion to dismiss. <em>See</em> <em>Nelson v. MillerCoors, LLC</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274726\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/666/\">246 F.Supp.3d 666</extracted-citation>, 674 n.4 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (refusing to consider advertisements that the plaintiff \"never claim[ed] he saw-let alone relied on\" when assessing Section 349 claim).</p><p id=\"p-44\">Lastly, with respect to injury, the Plaintiffs fail to articulate how purchasing products from the Defendants injured them. It appears that the Plaintiffs believe they were injured because they purchased products they did not need in an attempt to increase their chances of winning a prize. However, it is well-settled that violations of Section 349 do not entitle aggrieved consumers to a refund merely because the defendant procured the plaintiff's purchase through deception. <em>See</em> <em>Small v. Lorillard Tobacco Co.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"109780\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/94/43/#p56\">94 N.Y.2d 43</extracted-citation>, 56, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"109780\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/94/43/#p56\">698 N.Y.S.2d 615</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"109780\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/94/43/#p56\">720 N.E.2d 892</extracted-citation> (1999) (rejecting the theory that \"consumers who buy a product that they would not have, absent a manufacturer's deceptive commercial practices, have suffered an injury under General Business Law \u00a7 349\").</p><p id=\"p-45\">The rationale for this rule is that \"deceived consumers may nevertheless receive-and retain the benefits of-something <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"68\" href=\"#p68\" id=\"p68\">*68</a>of value, even if it is not precisely what they believed they were buying.\" <em>Servedio v. State Farm Ins. Co.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321461\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/889/450/#p452\">889 F.Supp.2d 450</extracted-citation>, 452 (E.D.N.Y. 2012). In other words, plaintiffs do not suffer a cognizable injury unless they can articulate an actual pecuniary harm, such as paying a higher price for the product than it was worth. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Kacocha v. Nestle Purina Petcare Co.</em> , No. 15-cv-5489, <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204367991\">2016 WL 4367991</extracted-citation>, at *14-16 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 12, 2016) (finding that complaint stated a claim by alleging that the Plaintiff \"would not have paid the premium price he paid\" to buy the products at issue absent the misrepresentation). As the Complaint is without such an allegation, it fails as a matter of law.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Therefore, the Court grants the Defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to the Plaintiffs' Section 349 claims, but grants the Plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint addressing the problems identified by the Court.</p><p id=\"p-47\"><strong>II. CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-48\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the Defendants motion to dismiss as follows. The Court dismisses the Plaintiffs' CAN SPAM, DMPEA, and Section 369e claims with prejudice. The Court dismisses the Plaintiffs' Section 349 claim without prejudice. Because the Plaintiffs have no surviving claims, the Court denies the Defendants' motions to strike and compel as moot.</p><p id=\"p-49\">The Plaintiffs are directed to file an amended complaint consistent with this opinion no later than 30 days from the issuance of this opinion.</p><p id=\"p-50\">It is <strong>SO ORDERED</strong> .</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
