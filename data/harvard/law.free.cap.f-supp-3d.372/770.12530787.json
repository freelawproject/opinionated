No. 63) for summary judgment filed by defendants City of Cedar Rapids, Nathan Juilfs, Lucas Jones, Brandon Boesenberg and Bryson Garringer. Plaintiffs have filed a resistance (Doc. No. 90) and defendants have filed a reply (Doc. No. 101). Also pending is defendants' motion (Doc. No. 102) to strike portions of plaintiffs' resistance to the motion for summary judgment. Oral argument is not necessary to resolve the pending motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Iowa L.R. 7(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs commenced this case by filing a petition (Doc. No. 2) in the Iowa District Court for Linn County. Defendants filed a notice of removal on November 28, 2017. Doc. No. 1. The petition asserts the following claims for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Iowa law, all arising from an arrest and subsequent events on October 20, 2015, that resulted in the death of Jonathan Gossman:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Count I: Stop without probable cause (Juilfs, Garringer and Boesenberg);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Count II: Seizure of vehicle and Gossman without probable cause (Juilfs, Garringer and Boesenberg);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Count III: Arrest of Gossman without probable cause (Juilfs, Garringer and Boesenberg);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Count IV: Use of excessive force against Gossman (Jones, Juilfs, Garringer and Boesenberg);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Count V: Unconstitutional policy or custom, failure to train, and failure to supervise (City of Cedar Rapids);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Count VI: Ratification of constitutional violations (City of Cedar Rapids);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Count VIII: Assault and battery (Juilfs, Jones, Boesenberg and Garringer);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Count IX: False arrest (Juilfs, Jones, Boesenberg, Garringer and City of Cedar Rapids).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Doc.

Defendants filed the present motion for summary judgment on December 18, 2018. After receiving an extension due to an ongoing discovery dispute, plaintiffs filed their resistance to the motion for summary judgment on January 24, 2019. Portions of plaintiffs' resistance prompted the defense motion to strike, which was filed on February 13, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

No. 2 at \u00b6 14. This lawsuit was brought by Gossman's mother, Twyla McElree, as the administrator of Gossman's estate, and by Mikaela Gossman and her two children as his surviving family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The City of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is a municipal corporation under Iowa Code chapter 670. Nathan Juilfs, Lucas Jones, Brandon Boesenberg and Bryson Garringer are police officers employed by the Cedar Rapids Police Department, and each were involved in the altercation between Gossman and the CRPD on October 20, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b66, 11-16. Boesenberg and Garringer conducted surveillance on the night in question that led to Gossman's detention. Juilfs was involved in stopping Gossman's vehicle and Jones - a K9 officer partnered with a police dog named Bane - was called to the scene for a narcotics search. Garringer and Jones ultimately shot Gossman, resulting in his death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Arrest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 20, 2015, Boesenberg and Garringer were on duty conducting surveillance of pseudoephedrine purchases\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in an unmarked police vehicle.

No. 64-5 at 6-7, 12, 14. They backed into a stall in the Northeast corner of the parking lot so that the front of the vehicle pointed towards the entrance of the Walgreens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. The parking lot was illuminated, and the officers were able to see their surroundings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They monitored pseudoephedrine purchases using an iPad connected to the Internet and displaying the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx), a web-based application that tracks sales of methamphetamine precursors. The NPLEx allows officers to monitor, in real-time, all pseudoephedrine purchases at a specified location.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, Doc. No. 64-7 at 3. When a pseudoephedrine purchase was attempted, the time, location, and purchaser's driver's license information appeared on the screen, as well as the frequency of the individual's pseudoephedrine purchases and whether any purchase had been blocked.

Doc. No. 64-2 at 16. Graf and Santos testified that everyone in the group used methamphetamine before they left in Graf's Ford F-150 truck.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Graf described the group traveling to a few different stores to purchase pseudoephedrine,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   flash lights and zip ties, and to an apartment complex where Gossman showed some \"old biker guys\" a gun he wanted to sell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6, 14.

No. 76-3 at 51.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eventually, the group went to the Walgreens where Boesenberg and Garringer were conducting surveillance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Ford F-150 truck caught the officers' attention because Turner and Gutierrez were outside of it talking to the occupants and the other members of the group were in and out of the truck. Doc. No. 64-5 at 6. Boesenberg and Garringer recognized Turner and Gutierrez as involved in methamphetamine manufacturing based on previous investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 11.

Santos purchased pseudoephedrine at 9:55 p.m., and Boesenberg and Garringer identified Santos as she exited the Walgreens with Graf. Doc. No. 64-5 at 13, Doc. No. 64-7 at 4, Doc. No. 64-19 at 21. At 9:59 p.m., the officers received an alert that Steven Rittger purchased pseudoephedrine at the CVS pharmacy across the street. Doc. No. 64-5 at 13, Doc. No. 64-20 at 8. A moment later, Hass walked to the truck from the parking lot of the CVS pharmacy. Doc. No. 64-5 at 13. Boesenberg testified that he was familiar with Hass due to his involvement in methamphetamine use and dealing prior to this incident. Doc. No. 64-7 at 4. The officers believed that Rittger may have purchased pseudoephedrine on behalf of Hass, although they did not have direct evidence that this had occurred. Boesenberg Recording at 4:54-5:42.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At 10:12 p.m. (17 minutes after the Santos purchase and 13 minutes after the Rittger/Hass purchase), Gossman exited the truck, entered the Walgreens and successfully purchased pseudoephedrine. Doc. No. 64-5 at 15, Doc. No. 64-7 at 5, Doc. No. 64-20 at 2. Boesenberg and Garringer observed this purchase on NPLEx and identified Gossman as the purchaser based on a mugshot from a prior arrest. Doc. No. 64-5 at 15, Doc. No. 64-7 at 5. Meanwhile, Graf was in and out of the truck as he \"messed with\" something in the back seat and under the truck. Graf testified that he was attempting to fix a \"glow light\" attached to the underside of the truck (Doc. No. 76-3 at 53), but apparently that fact was not evident to Boesenberg and Garringer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At some point, Turner and Gutierrez walked away from the Ford F-150 to a Road Ranger gas station, also on 16th Avenue. Doc. No. 64-2 at 14. Garringer and Boesenberg called Officers Christy and Whitaker to observe and follow those two, while Garringer and Boesenberg stayed with the truck. Doc. No. 64-5 at 15, Doc. No. 64-8 at 9. After the final pseudoephedrine purchase, Graf, Santos, Hass and Gossman drove in the truck to the nearby Road Ranger and dropped Hass off before driving away. Doc. No. 64-5 at 20. Christy and Whitaker observed Hass, Gutierrez and Turner speaking briefly before they walked off in different directions. Doc. No. 64-8 at 11-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While monitoring all of this, Boesenberg and Garringer developed the belief that the group was purchasing pseudoephedrine\n   to manufacture methamphetamine and that there was possibly a \"one-pot\" lab in the truck.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Boesenberg Recording. They thought that the number of people associated with the Ford F-150 - three of whom were known to be involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine - was suspicious. They believed that the pattern of pseudoephedrine purchases - two to three people in the same vehicle staggering their buys over approximately 20 minutes - was not consistent with legal pseudoephedrine use. Doc. No. 64-5 at 17; Doc. No. 64-7 at 5. They further believed that there could be a one-pot lab in the truck because of the way people were milling about in the truck, getting in and out, as if they were playing musical chairs. Doc.

Garringer recalls hearing Juilfs inform Gossman that he would be removed from the truck, and hearing Gossman yell \"No.\" Doc. No. 64-6 at 9.

He testified that after he heard there was a gun in the truck, his objective was to get Gossman out of the truck and away from the gun. Doc. No. 64-7 at 7. By this point, Boesenberg had also drawn his firearm for safety purposes. Jones intended to have Bane perform a sniff of the truck, which was an additional reason to ask Gossman to get out. Doc.

Boesenberg tried to wrap his left arm around Gossman to keep him from running away, but his service weapon was in right hand and Boesenberg testified that it was not safe to put his right arm around Gossman while holding the weapon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, 9. Due to the struggle, he was unable to either holster his weapon or control Gossman with one arm. Doc. No. 64-4 at 3; Doc. No. 64-7 at 9-10. At the same time, Jones told Boesenberg to let go because, in his opinion, it would be safer under the circumstances to allow Bane to do a take-down. Doc. No. 64-5 at 5. Boesenberg testified that he did not hear this instruction. However, he let go and Gossman took off running, pursued by Bane, Jones and Garringer. Doc. No. 64-7 at 9-10. Garringer ordered Gossman to stop but Gossman kept running. Doc. No. 64-4 at 8. Boesenberg and Juilfs stayed back with Santos and Graf.

Doc. No. 64-4 at 3; Doc. No. 64-6 at 12. This concerned them because, according to their training, this indicated that Gossman may be armed, particularly in light of the fact that they knew there was a shotgun in the back seat of the truck. Doc. No. 64-4 at 3; Doc. No. 64-6 at 12. As they were chasing Gossman, they kept Bane in front of them to complete a take down as they followed close behind.

As Gossman was falling, Garringer saw him twist and draw a firearm from his waistband. Doc. No. 64-6 at 13. Garringer testified that when he saw that, he immediately stopped running, because he did not want to run towards a handgun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. He yelled \"gun\" or \"Jesus, gun.\" Garringer heard a clap and saw a flash of light and believed Gossman had fired his gun in his direction.

He saw Gossman holding the gun and, believing Garringer may have fallen because he was shot, Jones \"swung wide\" and fired his service weapon at Gossman. Doc. No. 64-4 at 11-12. Jones testified to his reasoning for firing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The threat presented itself when Mr. Gossman displayed a loaded handgun. So I felt at that point I wanted that threat to end immediately. Because of his resisting with the other officers, because of his running down the sidewalk, he'd already demonstrated to us that he was going to [do] whatever it takes to get away, including fleeing from a police K9.

Other Information\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Both parties have submitted information related to the officers' training and CRPD policy that need not be fully summarized here. Plaintiffs have also submitted several documents related to prior suits against the City of Cedar Rapids for excessive use of force, as well as attorney-authored documents. This information will be discussed where relevant below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion to Strike\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants have objected to several portions of plaintiffs' statement of material\n   facts (Doc. No. 90-1) for failing to comply with L.R. 56(b)(2)-(3) because it (1) does not correspond with the numbering used by defendants in\n   <em>\n    their\n   </em>\n   statement of material facts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) fails to expressly admit, deny or qualify the corresponding numbered facts set forth by defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) sets forth argument and speculation\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   rather than statements of additional material facts which preclude summary judgment, and (4) is not adequately supported by citations to the records. For the most part, I agree with defendants' description of plaintiffs' statement of material facts. The motion to strike plaintiffs' statement of material facts is granted. As a result, rather than relying on plaintiffs' flawed and improper statement of facts (Doc. No. 90-1) to determine whether there is a disputed fact, I have relied on the record submitted by plaintiffs as well as any inconsistencies between the record evidence submitted by defendants. Thus, in considering the arguments for summary judgment, I will highlight where plaintiffs have submitted record evidence which contradicts a fact asserted by the defendants and explain whether that evidence establishes that a fact is disputed and whether that fact is material to the resolution of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendants have also objected to several portions of plaintiffs' appendix as not properly authenticated, not disclosed in discovery, not relevant, and/or pertaining to matters not appropriately addressed in the pending motion. I will consider whether each of the objected-to portions of the appendix should be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Unauthenticated Transcripts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants argue that the documents \"Transcript of All Radio Traffic Related to Gossman Surveillance and Death\" (Doc. No. 90-14 at 1-7), \"Summary of other Audio Files for Exhibits from CRPD Joint Communications 911 Calls\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-19), \"Summary of All Radio Traffic Cross-Matched with Audio Related or Unrelated\" (plaintiffs' version of the Boesenberg recording transcript,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-54) should be stricken because they are unauthenticated. Defendants further contend that these transcriptions were not provided to defendants in discovery and that large portions of the transcripts are irrelevant for resolving\n   the present motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs do not contest the fact that they did not attach an authenticating affidavit to any of these transcripts within the appendix. Doc. No. 108 at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. Rather, they assert that \"the customary manner to authenticate a transcript of an audio is to compare the written document to it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs argue that because they have submitted the audio from which the transcripts were generated, the transcripts are sufficiently \"authentic\" for the court to consider them for the purposes of a summary judgment motion. Doc. No. 108-1. Plaintiffs also argue that\n   <em>\n    defendants'\n   </em>\n   version of the transcript\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   is both inaccurate and inadmissible in evidence at trial. Finally, plaintiffs have filed an affidavit stating that plaintiffs' counsel prepared the transcripts herself in a belated attempt to properly authenticate the document. Doc. No. 108-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 1-5. Plaintiffs attempt to excuse the failure to disclose the documents by stating that the audio files from which the transcripts were created were disclosed. They do not respond to defendants' argument that the transcripts are irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \" Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a) provides that the requirement of authentication is satisfied by 'evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.' \"\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Nat'l Am.

R. Evid. 901(a) ). In the summary judgment context, \"documents must be authenticated by and attached to an affidavit made on personal knowledge setting forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence or a deposition that meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Documents that which do not meet these requirements cannot be considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Stuart v. Gen.

Moreover, the failure to disclose this purported evidence supports my decision to sustain defendants' objection to these documents. Without earlier disclosure, there was no opportunity for defendants to judge the accuracy of these transcripts. Plaintiffs' argument that defendants can do so now by listening to the audio notwithstanding, the failure to disclose evidence intended to be used in this case is inexplicable. Finally, I note that I do not find that any particular portions of plaintiffs' transcripts, even if properly part of the summary judgment record, would affect the outcome of the summary judgment motion. Defendants' motion to strike will be granted as to the unauthenticated transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Documents Authored by Plaintiffs' Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants next object that several documents authored by plaintiffs' counsel, Judith O'Donohoe, must be struck as speculative, irrelevant and argumentative. Simply put, defendants contend these items are not evidence and cannot be used to create a disputed issue of fact in resistance to the summary judgment motion. This objection includes a \"Response to Defendant's Chronology at Appendix 1751-1758\" (Doc. No. 90-15 at 80-95), two affidavits authored by O'Donohoe (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 123-25, 126-28), and a discovery dispute letter sent by\n   O'Donohoe to defense counsel (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 130-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The document \"Response to Defendant's Chronology\" was apparently authored by O'Donohoe. However, it is undated, unsigned and unauthenticated by any accompanying documents. It was not disclosed during discovery. It states that \"[t]he Gossman chronology, found at Defendants' appendix 1751-1758, is not a factual matter which is not [sic] appropriately placed in an appendix. There is no attribution in the chronology to the source of the information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80. It goes on to explain, with citations to both the plaintiff and defense appendices as well as argument, why the Gossman chronology is not competent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Gossman chronology (Doc. No. 64-62 at 11-18) itself is also unsigned, undated and unattributed to any particular author, although it is at least clear that it was generated as part of the DCI investigation into Gossman's death. For what it is worth, I have not relied on the Gossman chronology in resolving the present motion. However, filing a competing and argumentative chronology is not the proper way to object to evidence improperly included in a summary judgment appendix. Defendants' motion to strike plaintiffs' response to the Gossman chronology is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The first O'Donohoe affidavit (Doc. No. 90-15 at 123-25) sets out the basis for her opinion that Turner or Gutierrez may have been acting as confidential informants. O'Donohoe states that the defendants have refused to produce evidence related to these two, and that although Garringer and Boesenberg have stated that they were not working with confidential informants on the night in question, this explanation does not make sense based on the timing of certain events.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   O'Donohoe's opinion as to whether Turner or Gutierrez were confidential informants is not relevant. She does not have personal knowledge regarding the events and her speculation as to the motivations of the officers involved is both inadmissible and insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Defendants' motion to strike the first O'Donohoe affidavit is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second O'Donohoe affidavit (Doc. No. 90-15 at 126-28) details the K9 training materials and records that were or were not disclosed during discovery. O'Donohoe implies that some materials were improperly withheld. The pending motion for summary judgment is not the appropriate place to resolve that dispute. Rather, plaintiffs should have filed a timely motion to compel or, at least, a motion for leave to file a late motion to compel. As I noted earlier in this case, they did neither.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second affidavit does not contain competent evidence that is relevant for resolving the pending summary judgment motion. Therefore, defendants' motion to strike the second O'Donohoe affidavit is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, O'Donohoe's letter to defense counsel (Doc. No. 90-15 at 130-35), dated December 9, 2019, describes O'Donohoe's attempt to resolve discovery disputes related to officer training and K-9 training. As with the second O'Donohoe affidavit, this letter relates to matters that are not appropriately considered in the context of a motion for summary judgment and does not contain relevant facts related to resolving the pending motion. Defendants' motion\n   to strike the O'Donohoe letter is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. The Beacon Report\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants move to strike the Beacon Report (Doc. No. 90-15 at 96-99) because \"neither the investigator nor Beacon ... were ever disclosed at any stage of the litigation as witnesses, parties with knowledge, or experts.\" Doc. No. 102-1 at 13. As noted earlier, the Beacon Report describes surveillance conducted at the Walgreens location to determine whether hair color, eye color, height, weight and other facial features would be visible from a distance given the conditions on the night in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs do not explain why this report was not disclosed prior to the motion for summary judgment, other than to state it was disclosed when it was available and that \"[t]he experts' reports are not required to be totally updated per the Magistrate's order until after a ruling on this motion for summary judgment is made.\" Doc. No. 108 at 4-9. Plaintiffs further explain that this report was provided to their expert, Aaron Westrick, to aid his determination of whether the defendants had probable cause to stop the Ford F-150 based on what they observed in the Walgreen's parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2) governs the disclosure of expert witnesses. Initial expert disclosures were due from the plaintiffs on May 1, 2018, and Plaintiffs' rebuttal expert disclosure deadline was August 15, 2018. Doc. No. 39. As with all other types of discovery, the parties are under an ongoing duty to supplement expert disclosures under Rule 26(e). Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(E). On September 13, 2018, plaintiffs agreed to supplement discovery of any material provided to plaintiffs' expert witnesses, but no date was specified. Doc. No. 45. Plaintiffs' statement that the expert reports are not yet \"required to be totally updated\" appears to refer to a scheduling matter discussed during a December 10, 2018, status conference with Judge Mahoney. The minutes include the following statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs and defendants agree that defendants need not supplement their expert report (including any training relied upon by the expert in forming his opinion) until after the motion for summary judgment is ruled upon. Any supplemental expert reports (by either side) are due two weeks after the court's issuance of its order on summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Doc. No. 56. The operative word in this statement is \"supplement.\" There is no indication that Judge Mahoney granted leave for any party to disclose\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   experts after the summary judgment order is filed. Instead, she referenced the supplementation of existing expert reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In any event, it is not entirely clear whether the Beacon Report constitutes a \"new expert report,\" which would clearly be untimely, or a \"supplement\" to the body of information provided to plaintiffs' already-disclosed expert in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, and while I find that the defendants have raised valid concerns, I find that it is unnecessary to strike the report. Unlike the improper materials discussed in Sections V(A)(1) and V(A)(2), above, the Beacon Report is legitimate evidence and does provide some relevant information. While the information in the Beacon Report does not affect the final analysis of the summary judgment motion, I decline\n   to strike it. The defendants' motion to strike is denied as to the Beacon Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. Statement of Jeffrey Hass\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants move to strike the statement of Jeffrey Hass (Doc. No. 90-15 at 117-118) on grounds that it is not notarized and that plaintiffs have failed to provide contact information for Hass upon request despite identifying him as a person with knowledge of the events. The argument concerning lack of notarization fails, as the statement substantially complies with the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As for defendants' other concerns, I note that the statement was signed on December 26, 2018, one week after defendants filed their motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The affidavit describes the basis for Hass' belief that Turner was working as a confidential informant for law enforcement during the relevant events.

Defendants contend that Westrick's opinions are impermissible because (1) they purport to instruct the jury as to whether the officers' actions met the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   definition of reasonableness and (2) they are based on alleged facts that are not present in the record.

The only (potentially) admissible evidence to support the statement that the officers were clearly utilizing an informant is the Hass affidavit. Determining that the use of an informant was \"clear\" is a determination of a factual issue which invades the province of the jury.

No witness to the incident testified that Gossman was ever secured with either of his hands behind his back. In fact, every eyewitness testified to the opposite. Further, the statements that Boesenberg had Gossman \"from the behind in a 'big ole' bear hug' \" around the belt area, and that Jones told Boesenberg to let Gossman go from this position (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112) is not consistent with any witness's testimony in this case and takes multiple citations from the Garringer and Jones depositions out of context. These statements are also stricken, as they invade the province of the jury by apparently deciding that the officers are not credible. I note that an expert's recitation of facts as to which he does not have personal knowledge does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   generate a material disputed fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   4. \"Gossman's 'pointing' of the gun is unlikely given the apparent continuous motion of him being pulled to the ground by the attacking K-9.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112. This statement is a determination that an eyewitness to the event could form, but as Westrick was not an eyewitness, this factual conclusion must be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Turning to Westrick's opinions, two opinions must be stricken for invading the province of the court to instruct the jury on the law. Westrick states (1) that there was a lack of reasonable suspicion to stop the Ford F-150 and (2) that the police action on the night in question was \"unreasonable.\" As Judge Bennett explained in\n   <em>\n    Clay\n   </em>\n   , Westrick can testify as to \"routine and acceptable\" police practices based on his training and expertise, he can \"respond to\n   <em>\n    abstract\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    hypothetical\n   </em>\n   questions by opining\" that the police action described \"was or was not reasonable in the circumstances described in such a question,\" and can \"opine as to whether he\n   <em>\n    personally\n   </em>\n   believed that\" the police action was reasonable, but he cannot opine as to whether police action met the legal standard for reasonableness.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4052700\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/982/904/\">\n    982 F.Supp.2d at 917-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In short, defendants' motion to strike Westrick's entire report is denied.

Additionally, I find as a matter of law that the stop of the vehicle\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   supported by reasonable suspicion. Boesenberg and Garringer were monitoring purchases of pseudoephedrine, a known ingredient in the manufacture of methamphetamine. Three people who were known by the officers to be involved in the manufacture of methamphetamine were associated with the Ford truck. There were two - and potentially three - separate pseudoephedrine purchases associated with the truck, spread out across approximately 20 minutes and two pharmacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The back-seat passenger was using a flashlight and bent over in the back seat in a manner that suggested to the officers that he could be hiding something under the back seat or perhaps assembling a one-pot device for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine.

Further, Gossman was only partially cooperative when he was questioned, refusing to provide his address and refusing\n   to exit the truck until Juilfs unlocked the door and opened it.

Gossman had a knife on a lanyard around his neck. Graf surrendered a similar knife while he was being questioned and informed officers that there was a shotgun in the back seat of the car. Gossman was ordered out of the vehicle with his hands on his head to move him away from the shotgun and to continue the constitutionally justified investigation. He refused. After Juilfs unlocked and opened the door, Gossman did not simply exit as instructed but took off running from the truck with his hands at his waistband. Both Garringer and Jones testified that this concerned them because weapons are commonly worn in waistbands. As the officers pursued Gossman, he kept his hands at his waistband even though he was running. Finally, as Bane latched onto Gossman and he began to fall, Garringer saw the firearm emerge from Gossman's waistband and point in Garringer's direction. Garringer heard and saw what he thought was a gunshot, fell to his knee, and yelled \"gun.\" Jones saw Garringer fall and believed Garringer had been shot. The officers began to fire at that point until - as they testified - they could perceive that the threat had ended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Under these circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for Garringer and Jones to believe that Gossman posed a serious threat to their safety. Although the crimes for which Gossman was being investigated were relatively minor, he was actively fleeing and attempting to evade police, the officers had been advised that a firearm had been present near Gossman in the truck, Gossman was running while keeping his hands near his waistband and he appeared to pull a firearm as Bane took him to the ground. Garringer and Jones testified that they were acting in compliance with their training by shooting at someone who appeared to be aiming a gun at them. Although they did not warn Gossman before they shot him, they had previously yelled at him to stop running. Once officers perceived a gunshot from Gossman's firearm, it was not unreasonable to shoot without further warning. There is no question that Gossman knew they were police officers and that he was not free to leave the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments that the police action was unreasonable constitute an attempt to view the scene \"with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\" Plaintiffs argue that Gossman did not draw his gun, but rather the gun slipped out of his waistband as his jeans fell while he was falling. This hypothesis could be true, but it is ultimately irrelevant in light of the officers' consistent testimony that they saw a firearm in hand and believed it had been fired. Plaintiffs further focus on the fact that Gossman never actually fired his gun, diminishing the threat to the officers. Again, the issue is not whether the officers accurately perceived the events as they unfolded, but\n   whether their perception was reasonable. In this case, for the reasons discussed above, it was. Under these circumstances, considering the facts that the officers were aware of and what they could reasonably perceive, the officers are entitled to summary judgment on Count IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     5.

Each of these claims fails as a matter of law because there was no underlying constitutional violation. \"Without a constitutional violation by the individual officers, there can be no \u00a7 1983 or\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ... municipal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Hayek v.
