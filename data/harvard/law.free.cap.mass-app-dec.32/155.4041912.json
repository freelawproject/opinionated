Mc-Kenney, assigned to hear the case. It was the understanding of the trial justice gained at this conference: that the only contention pressed by the defendant was that the action was barred by an adjudication in another law action between the parties of the same issues raised in this action, that the facts with respect to this defense of res adjudicata were not controverted, and that there remained for the court only to decide questions of law based on orally agreed to facts. The trial judge requested counsel to submit memoranda of law. It was his understanding that he was to proceed to decide the case on those facts. Counsel for. the plaintiff, on the other hand, understood that a trial was to be held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">Memoranda of iaw were submitted and the trial judge on January 20, 1965 found for the defendant without taking evidence or holding any hearing other than in Chambers aforesaid. Counsel for both parties had appeared in court on January 15, 1965, with witnesses, ready for trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201cThis report contains all the facts material to the question presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">The plaintiff claiming to be aggrieved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the finding for the defendant, I hereby report the same to the Appellate Division for determination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"b163-8\">Garber &amp; Garber for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b163-9\">P.
