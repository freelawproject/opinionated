The defendant rested without putting on any witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-5\">\u201cAlthough the evidence was meagre, I .conclude there was enough to warrant a finding, and I so find, that there was negligence on the part of the defendant that was the sole proximate cause of the injury sustained by the plaintiff\u2014that the invitation extended to the public (men, women and children) to use the premises for a fee imposed a duty commensurate with the danger involved (including inspection and supervision) to keep the premises reasonably safe for such intended use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-6\">\u201cProcedurally, I find the burden of going forward shifted from the plaintiff to^the defendant and the plaintiff was not required to show or explain more precisely how the injury sustained by him arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-7\">\u201cI assess the plaintiff\u2019s injuries at $1,200.\u201d The defendant claims to be aggrieved by the following rulings of the trial judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-8\">(1) \u201cI conclude there was enough (evidence) to warrant a finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-9\">(2) \u201cThe burden of going forward shifted from the plaintiff to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b8-10\">(3) \u201cThe plaintiff was not required to show or explain more precisely how the injury sustained by him arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b8-11\">We are of the opinion that the trial judge was in error in his ruling \u201cI conclude there was enough (evidence) to warrant a finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6\">\u201cThe defendant owed to customers a duty to keep the premises reasonably safe for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>use. He, however, is not an insurer of safety. Where, without action for which he is responsible, a dangerous condition arises, the law allows him reasonable opportunity to become informed of the danger and to take measures to remedy it. He is not liable, in such a case, unless he is negligent in failing to inform himself and to take appropriate action.\u201d <em>White v. Mugar, </em>280 Mass. 73-75; <em>Deagle v. Great A </em>&amp; <em>P Tea Co., </em>343 Mass. 263.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b9-8\">Anthony W. DiCecca, of Somerville, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b9-9\">Hugh L. O\u2019Brien, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b9-5\">On the evidence here, particularly the lack of evidence as to when or how the glass got on the beach, we think that the negligence of the defendant is left to conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-6\">In view of the prejudicial error in the first ruling, it is unnecessary to consider the other two.</p>\n<p id=\"b9-7\">The finding for the plaintiff is vacated and a finding made for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
