We granted his application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>There was evidence before the grand jury and at trial that the defendant had been drinking alcoholic beverages shortly before he had a senseless argument with the victim, left and obtained his shotgun, unloaded it, then reloaded it, and shot the victim. No further facts concerning the commission of the crime are necessary to the presentation and resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">1. The defendant argues that the indictment should have been dismissed because, it is claimed, the prosecutor erroneously instructed the grand jury on a point of law. He makes no claim that the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient to support the indictment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>385 Mass. 160, 163 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">A police officer who had responded to the defendant\u2019s telephone call reporting that he had killed someone and later was present when the defendant made a highly inculpatory statement at the police station, testified before the grand jury. At the conclusion of his testimony, the prosecutor asked the jury if there were any more questions. The following then occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The juror: \u201cWas Mr. Kelcourse given a breathalyzer test? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The juror: \u201cThere was no blood test to ascertain the level of alcohol?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The witness: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cThat really isn\u2019t relevant to a murder indictment. Anything else of this witness? Okay. Thank you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">The defendant moved to have the indictment dismissed on the ground that the prosecutor\u2019s statement impaired the integrity of the grand jury process. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">We start with the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s statement was technically correct. Whether a blood test had been conducted to ascertain the level of alcohol in the defendant\u2019s blood was not relevant to a murder indictment. No such test need be performed as a condition precedent to such an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">The defendant argues that the jury reasonably could have inferred from the prosecutor\u2019s answer that evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication was not relevant to a murder indictment. He claims that his right under G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79 (1986 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ed.), to have the grand jury decide the degree of murder to be charged was impaired, as well as his right under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to a proper grand jury proceeding and his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process (cf. <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>447 U.S. 343, 345-347 [1980]).</p>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">A prosecutor may advise a grand jury on the law \u201cin appropriate instances.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>240 Mass. 264, 307 (1922). In so doing, he may not express his own opinion, make arguments, or state facts which are not relevant to the guilt or innocence of the person under inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 307-308. In presenting the law as well as the facts, he must \u201cscrupulously refrain from words or conduct that will invade the province of the grand jury or tend to induce action other than that which the jurors in their uninfluenced judgment deem warranted on the evidence fairly presented before them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Favulli, </em>352 Mass. 95, 106 (1967). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mayfield, </em>398 Mass. 615, 620-621 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The defendant has a heavy burden. In considering a claim that false or deceptive evidence was presented to a grand jury, we have said that a defendant must show that (1) the evidence was given to the grand jury knowingly or with reckless disregard for the truth and for the purpose of obtaining an indictment, and (2) that the evidence probably influenced the grand jury\u2019s determination to indict the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 621. Inaccurate testimony given in good faith does not by itself require dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 620. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Reddington, </em>395 Mass. 315, 319-320 (1985). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 449 (1984) (grand jury process impaired by prosecutor\u2019s deliberately excising exculpatory portions of a statement) with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGahee, </em>393 Mass. 743, 747-748 (1985) (grand jury process not impaired by prosecutor\u2019s failure to inform grand jury of a witness\u2019s inability to identify defendant at probable cause hearing). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petras, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 483, 487-489 (1988), cert. denied, U.S. (1989) (109 S.Ct. 1537 [1989]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 546, 552 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">There is no indication of an intentional or reckless misstatement by the prosecutor. The possibility that the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>might have drawn the wrong inference from a correct statement of law is speculative. It is most unlikely, in any event, that the grand jury would have decided to indict the defendant only for murder in the second degree if the prosecutor\u2019s remark had not been made. Even an assistant district attorney\u2019s misstatement of the law, suggesting that certain defendants had admitted in District Court proceedings that there was probable cause to believe that they had committed a crime, has not, in the circumstances, required dismissal of indictments. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seminara, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 793-794 (1985). See <em>Morrissette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>380 Mass. 197, 200 (1980). Here any chance that the grand jury would have decided differently was minimal where the evidence, including the defendant\u2019s confession to the police, overwhelmingly supported an indict.ment for murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">2. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that he is entitled to a new trial on the ground that the judge misinstructed the jury on the consequences of the consumption of alcohol in relation to the proof of malice. His claim is that, although the judge properly instructed the jury on the relevance of voluntary intoxication to the existence of malice (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470-471 [1987]), he should not have told the jury that they had to \u201cfind\u201d that the defendant was intoxicated before they could consider evidence of his intoxication. The voluntary consumption of alcohol bears on the defendant\u2019s capacity to have a specific intent to do something. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 809-810 (1988). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 Mass. 334, 336 (1987). The Commonwealth, however, did not have to prove that the defendant was not intoxicated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>392 Mass. 393, 405 (1984). Voluntary intoxication is merely \u201can evidentiary factor which the jury can consider\u201d on questions of premeditation and malice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 Mass. 334, 338 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 879-880 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Although there is \u201cfinding\u201d language in the jury instructions (i.e., \u201cif you find that he was voluntarily intoxicated\u201d), the charge as a whole made it abundantly clear that the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>wealth had the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s specific intent where specific intent was an element of malice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, supra </em>at 337-338; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, supra </em>at 880. The judge not only properly and repeatedly instructed on the burden of proof, he expressly told the jury \u201cif I\u2019ve used expressions in these instuctions such as \u2018If you find \u2014\u2019 or \u2018If you decide \u2014\u2019 or \u2018If it is determined \u2014\u2019 or \u2018If it is proved \u2014\u2019 I use such expressions always in the context of the prosecution having the burden of proof with respect to guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d There was not prejudicial error in the judge\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\"> The judge charged in part as follows: \u201cAnd as I\u2019ve told you, the law is that a jury should consider evidence of mental impairment whenever the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s specific intent to cause a particular result. Therefore, you should consider whether the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication, if you find such, so overcame the defendant or so substantially reduced his mental capacity that he was incapable of forming the required specific intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm. If so, and if the Commonwealth has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with malice aforethought under the third standard I just recited to you, then you must find the defendant not guilty of second degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Later, he said: \u201cAlso, if you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant unlawfully killed Terence Thatcher, and that he had the required specific intent to kill or to do grievous bodily harm, the defendant\u2019s intoxication, if any, does not reduce his crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
