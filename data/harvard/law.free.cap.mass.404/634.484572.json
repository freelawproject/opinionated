The plaintiffs brought suit against Driscoll for violation of Dobos\u2019s civil rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1979), as amended, and under the common law for assault and battery, false imprisonment, and the intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress. The supervisory defendants were sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; the Commonwealth was sued for negligence. G. L. c. 258 (1986 ed.). The wife and daughter sued for loss of consortium. Special questions were submitted to the jury, and a judgment was entered for the plaintiffs pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 58 (a), as amended, 371 Mass. 908 (1977).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We summarize the facts as they could have been found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">1. <em>Evidence against Driscoll. </em>At midday on September 4, 1978, Robert Dobos was driving, with his wife and daughters, on Route 128 near Framingham, when the driver of another vehicle, Bruce Mancinelli, began to harass Dobos. Mancinelli\u2019s vehicle eventually struck the passenger side of Dobos\u2019s vehicle. Dobos responded by gradually forcing Mancinelli to drive to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>halt in the breakdown lane. Mancinelli provided his name, address, and the necessary registration and insurance information. He then stated that he wished to leave. Dobos\u2019s wife insisted that he stay until they could obtain police assistance. Dobos and his wife (plaintiffs) then attempted to contact the police, first by means of their own two-way radio, then by means of a cab driver\u2019s radio, and finally by motioning to a passing police cruiser. Approximately five to ten minutes after the accident, another cruiser, driven by Trooper Driscoll, arrived at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Trooper Driscoll obtained statements from Mancinelli and Dobos, but Dobos refused to sign Driscoll\u2019s transcription of his statement because he believed it to be inaccurate. Driscoll refused to amend the statement. Instead, he obtained a statement from Donna Dobos, which she signed. Driscoll returned to his cruiser briefly and wrote out citations charging both Mancinelli and Dobos with violations of laws governing the highways. Mancinelli then departed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Upon handing Dobos his citation, Driscoll stated in a loud voice, \u201cYou are not the law. I am the law. You don\u2019t pull nobody off the road.\u201d Repeating the statement, Driscoll moved closer to Dobos until his saliva was spraying in Dobos\u2019s face. Driscoll also jabbed Dobos in the chest with his fingers. Dobos and his wife pleaded with Driscoll to stop, and Dobos put his hands up and said, \u201cThe children are watching. Please, Officer, your behavior will be difficult to explain. Don\u2019t scream.\u201d The plaintiffs\u2019 pleas had no effect. Dobos, who speaks broken English, then said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry/ Officer, I don\u2019t hear you.\u201d Driscoll said, \u201cIf you say that one more time, I\u2019m going to lock you up.\u201d When Dobos did repeat himself, Driscoll took him by the arm, marched him to the cruiser, frisked him, handcuffed his hands tightly behind his back, and roughly forced him into the cruiser. Dobos asked if he could have his glasses and if he could give his keys to his wife. Driscoll did not respond and drove away at a high speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Dobos was taken to the Framingham State police barracks. Driscoll removed the handcuffs with some difficulty, apparently because they were fastened too tightly to Dobos\u2019s wrists. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Dobos was taken to a cell. Some time later, Dobos stated that he did not feel well and requested medical attention. According to Dobos\u2019s testimony, the following exchange then took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Driscoll: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Nothing wrong with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Dobos: \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I like to find out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Driscoll: \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Dobos then gave his name and address and refused to say anything further. Dobos was informed that, unless he provided information necessary to be admitted to bail, he would be held in the cell overnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Shortly after these events, Donna Dobos arrived at the Framingham barracks. She encountered Driscoll and asked him why he had yelled at them. He responded, \u201cThat\u2019s the-way I talk.\u201d When Donna Dobos asked why he had refused to state where he was taking Dobos and why he had left before she could follow, Driscoll responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to play follow-the-leader.\u201d After some further exchanges between Driscoll and Donna Dobos, she was led to her husband\u2019s cell by Driscoll and the barracks commander, who then left her with her husband. She observed that he had been crying, that his hand was red and swollen, that his hand was shaking, and that he was pale. Dobos told <em>his </em>wife that he had requested medical help three times, and he asked her to request medical help for him again. She did so, and Driscoll responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t ask doctors to come here. If you insist on medical help we\u2019re going to send your husband to a mental hospital in a straitjacket if necessary for a minimum of ten days.\u201d Donna Dobos left the barracks in tears.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">After Donna Dobos left the barracks, Driscoll came into Dobos\u2019s cell. Driscoll brought with him a sheet of paper containing the bail information provided by Donna Dobos, and, according to Dobos, began yelling that \u201c[n]obody[\u2019s] yanking my chain. You s \u2014 . I show you, you don\u2019t go out so far you don\u2019t give me the information.\u201d Driscoll proceeded to tear apart the sheet of paper and to throw it before Dobos. Dobos began to sweat, his mouth became dry, and he asked Driscoll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>for some water, which Driscoll provided. Dobos stated, \u201cYou don\u2019t see, I need medical help,\u201d and fainted. He was taken to a hospital and then returned to the barracks, by which time his wife had retained an attorney who obtained Dobos\u2019s release that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">At trial Dobos presented testimony about his background and about the long-term effects of his encounter with Driscoll. Dobos was bom in Budapest, Hungary. He was subject to physical abuse as a child, from his military father and others. When he was twenty-one years old, he was taken from his parents\u2019 home by the Hungarian secret police and placed in a Communist labor camp for three years. He was subject to physical and mental abuse in the labor camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Dobos came to the United States in 1967. From 1967 until 1978, Dobos established a successful business as a dental technician. He travelled extensively, both with his family on vacations and by himself, either for his own education or to give professional presentations. After his encounter with Driscoll, however, Dobos began to avoid interaction with anyone outside his family and began to avoid activities outside of his home. In 1980, Dobos sought the aid of a psychiatrist. Dobos received treatment occasionally until 1982, and, although he received medicine to alleviate his fear of going out of the house, Dobos felt that it made him irresponsible. In 1982, Dobos began to receive regular weekly treatments by a clinical psychologist, David Cellani.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Cellani testified that Dobos had received 106 one-hour sessions and that he expected these sessions to continue, although they had become progressively less regular by 1986.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He further testified that Dobos \u201cclearly described being agoraphobic, that is, having fear of traveling freely and having fear, excessive fear of leaving his house. He described the fact that whenever he went out, that he would have one or more of his family members come with him.\u201d Cellani testified that Dobos had an \u201cunderlying psychological structure which could be called a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>dependent personality disorder,\u201d but that Dobos\u2019s agoraphobia \u201cdid not appear until it was proven to him once again that even in this country, where he came to live, you could be beaten and humiliated\u201d so that \u201cthose fears that were already in him were massively exacerbated by this incident [with Driscoll] and he became house-bound, more or less house-bound\u201d for the eight years since the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">2. <em>Evidence against the supervisory </em>defendants. The defendant Robert Hunt testified that he was a troop commander with the State police from July, 1977, until after the Dobos incident. In this position, he was responsible for the administration and management of approximately 170 to 190 officers. Driscoll had been removed from highway patrol in November, 1976, but had returned to highway patrol under Hunt\u2019s command in October, 1977. Hunt testified that he was not aware of the specific reasons for Driscoll\u2019s discipline but admitted that it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that Driscoll\u2019s captain had recommended that he \u201cbe removed from field operations and have no direct contact with the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Hunt also testified that, on receipt of civilian complaints, it was State police procedure to determine the seriousness of the allegations and to investigate the matter, whereupon the troop commander ordinarily would \u201cmake a judgment based on the information that was available to him.\u201d In extraordinary circumstances, he testified, the matter would be referred to the internal affairs department, which would make its own investigation and recommendation to the deputy superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Between the time that Driscoll was reassigned to highway duty under Hunt in October, 1977, and the Dobos incident in September, 1978, Hunt reprimanded Driscoll several times with respect to Driscoll\u2019s behavior toward motorists whom he had stopped on the highway. In all, he reprimanded Driscoll approximately five times for what Hunt characterized as \u201cminor infractions.\u201d He testified that, during his command, there were two substantiated complaints against Driscoll that concerned incidents with motorists. Hunt recommended, in a written report to Canty in March, 1978, that no disciplinary action be taken on the first complaint, by one Robert W. Mitchell, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>cause of the \u201cunusual conditions.\u201d That complaint, known to Hunt, involved Driscoll\u2019s use of abusive language and threat of injury against Mitchell during the blizzard of 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Mitchell testified with regard to this incident. He said that he had complained to two of Driscoll\u2019s supervisors at the Framingham barracks. Mitchell also testified that, when he attempted light conversation with a fellow passenger in Driscoll\u2019s cruiser, Driscoll pulled the cruiser over, opened the door beside Mitchell, and said, \u201c \u2018Open your f------mouth now,\u2019 and he had one of those case hardened flashlights] cocked behind his ear.\u201d Driscoll then yelled, screamed, and \u201cseemed to be totally out of control ... to the point that as he was yelling spittle was coming out.\u201d When Mitchell said nothing, Driscoll cocked the flashlight back again and demanded, \u201c[A]re you going to keep your G \u2014 d-----mouth shut?\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cYes,\u201d and they drove on in silence. These facts were included in the written report of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">The second complaint was received in July, 1978, from one Monty Bender. The record does not indicate the nature of this complaint, but in response to it Hunt recommended, in December, 1978, that Driscoll be enrolled in an \u201cattitude awareness program.\u201d Hunt testified that it was \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that Driscoll\u2019s former captain had recommended in 1974 that Driscoll \u201cbe removed from field operations and have no direct contact with the public.\u201d Despite this knowledge, Hunt did not investigate Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history. Hunt admitted that, when he later became aware of Driscoll\u2019s record, he expressed the opinion that Driscoll had not been fit to be on the highway on the date of his encounter with Dobos.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-15\">Dobos presented evidence of several incidents that Hunt might have discovered had he investigated Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history. In 1974, because of prior incidents, Charles Gilligan, Driscoll\u2019s commanding officer, had recommended in writing that Driscoll be assigned permanently to desk duty. Other testimony, given by a Norman Cans, was that he had complained orally about Driscoll in 1974 and had been assured by one of Driscoll\u2019s superiors that Driscoll \u201cwould not be on the road.\u201d Cans had complained of harassment and of being de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tained for twenty minutes by Driscoll for speeding, despite having explained that he would accept a ticket but needed to get to the hospital quickly because his wife had had emergency surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Dobos presented testimony that Driscoll had been removed from highway duty from February, 1975, to May, 1976. At that time, Driscoll was subject to numerous probationary conditions, approved by the Commissioner of Public Safety, John F. Kehoe, Jr., including provisions for evaluation every thirty days, the continuation of any medical treatment he was receiving, and the requirement of medical evaluations before he could be returned to highway duty. This discipline had been imposed in response to a substantiated complaint by Driscoll\u2019s girl friend that he had assaulted her and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">While Driscoll was removed from highway duty this first time, he had worked on a \u201cpaid detail\u201d at Shaeffer Stadium. In September, 1974, while at work as a guard, Driscoll responded to a radioed request by another trooper for jumper cables by driving \u201cin an emergency fashion\u201d the wrong way on a one-way street, and, when a police captain observed him and inspected his vehicle, the captain found \u201cunauthorized equipment,\u201d including blue police lights in the windows of his automobile, bulletproof clipboards and vests, and at least seventeen rounds of ammunition. In his written report, the captain characterized Driscoll\u2019s \u201ctotal lack of judgment\u201d as a \u201cthreat to the lives and safety of the traffic and pedestrians and our own men in the field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The defendant James Canty was a lieutenant colonel of the State police from June or August, 1977, until after the Dobos incident. He was in charge of assigning, disciplining, and supervising all of the uniformed State police officers on highway duty in the Commonwealth. Canty testified that, at the time that Driscoll returned to road duty under his command, he was not aware that Driscoll had been taken off the road previously. He testified that, prior to Dobos\u2019s complaint, he was aware of Mitchell\u2019s and Bender\u2019s complaints in 1978 but was unaware of any other incidents involving Driscoll. He also testified that he and the defendant Hunt \u201cagreed on disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>action\u201d concerning Mitchell\u2019s complaint and that the punishment \u201cwas supposed to be a verbal reprimand.\u201d Finally, he testified that, like Hunt, he did not investigate Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The defendant Frank J. Trabucco was a colonel in the State police from June, 1977, until after the Dobos incident. He testified that it was his responsibility, in that position, to bring Driscoll\u2019s request in 1977 for a transfer back to a road position to the Commissioner of Public Safety for approval, and to \u201cdo[ ] the administrative aspect of it.\u201d He further testified that, to his knowledge, the reasons for Driscoll\u2019s removal from highway duty from November, 1976, to October, 1977, were his tardiness and some inappropriate log entries. However, he also testified that he was aware that Driscoll had disciplinary problems, had been taken off the road twice before, had been reassigned so that he had no public contact, and had not been allowed to drive to work in a cruiser. Trabucco also knew that Driscoll\u2019s captain had recommended, prior to November, 1976, that Driscoll should be put in a position where he would have less contact with the public. Trabucco presented Driscoll\u2019s request to be reinstated to highway duty, without investigating whether Driscoll should have been put back on the road, to the Commissioner of Public Safety for approval. In justification of this conduct, Trabucco stated that Driscoll had been told, prior to Trabucco\u2019s tenure, that he would be punished by six months off the road, and he had, in fact, been off the road more than six months. At another point, however, Trabucco had testified that \u201cthe understanding [was] that it would be for a minimum of six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The defendant John F. Kehoe, Jr., was Commissioner of Public Safety from August, 1971, to August 1978, one month prior to the Dobos incident. He testified that he was aware of Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary problem, that Driscoll was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment, that Driscoll had been removed from road duty twice, and that Driscoll had been the subject of a court-martial in connection with an assault by him of his girl friend, which resulted in Driscoll\u2019s removal from road duty, and that Kehoe was aware of the stadium incident. Kehoe testified that he had removed Driscoll from road duty in Febra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ary, 1975, in response to the substantiated complaint by Driscoll\u2019s girl friend that Driscoll had abused her and her children. He did so subject to strict probationary conditions, in accordance with the recommendations of a court-martial board that was convened pursuant to his order. Kehoe was also responsible for removing Driscoll from highway duty the second time, and for returning him to highway duty on Trabucco\u2019s recommendation. Kehoe reinstated Driscoll by means of an order that the defendant Trabucco described as \u201c[n]ot usual\u201d because \u201c[tjhere was nobody else on the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">3. <em>Denial of Driscoll\u2019s motions for a separate trial and for a mistrial. </em>Driscoll challenges the judge\u2019s refusal to grant him a separate trial from that of his supervisors and the Commonwealth. Motions for a separate trial are governed by Mass. R. Civ. P. 42 (b), 365 Mass. 805 (1974), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">\u201cThe court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">See <em>Roddy &amp; McNulty Ins. Agency </em>v. A.A. <em>Proctor &amp; Co., </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 528 (1983) (discussion of rule 42 [b]). Driscoll moved for a separate trial because of prejudice from the anticipated admission in evidence of documents and testimony concerning his prior misconduct, as it might be relevant to his supervisors\u2019 alleged failure to supervise. Driscoll moved for a mistrial at several points on the same ground. Driscoll does not claim that this evidence was admitted improperly against his supervisors and the Commonwealth; nor does Driscoll claim that the judge failed to give proper cautionary instructions. However, he claims now, as he did before the trial judge, that his prior misconduct was inadmissible against him and that no possible cautionary instruction would remove the prejudice and the stigma of evidence of his prior misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Driscoll points to no case in this Commonwealth in which the decision of a judge not to bifurcate a civil proceeding has been the ground for reversal. Furthermore, Driscoll has cited no such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>reversal by any other jurisdiction. The matter is one within the sound discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Roddy &amp; McNulty Ins. Agency </em>v. A.A. <em>Proctor &amp; Co., supra </em>at 529. We recognize that there may be civil cases in which the refusal to grant separate trials would so prejudice a party that reversal is mandated. This is not such a case. The evidence admissible against Driscoll was strong, if not overwhelming. He points to no fact which would lead us to conclude that the jury did not abide by the judge\u2019s cautionary instructions. <em>See Harris </em>v. <em>Chanclor, </em>537 F.2d 203, 207 (5th Cir. 1976) (rejecting defendant police officer\u2019s claim of prejudice by being tried with police chief, where evidence of officer\u2019s propensity for violence was admitted to establish chief\u2019s negligence in hiring and retaining officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Driscoll also made various motions for a mistrial as the evidence was admitted; all were denied. In denying the pretrial motion for a separate trial, the judge stated, \u201cI can\u2019t see any theory under which [Driscoll\u2019s prior records] would be admissible against [Driscoll]. . . . [But] [i]n terms of the supervisory defendants, I would see these prior actions of [Driscoll] as being admissible on the matter of their knowledge. . . .\u2019\u2019This said, during the trial, the judge gave appropriate and timely instructions whenever requested. There was no error. \u201cThe declaration of a mistrial is within the sound judicial discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Davison Constr. Co. </em>381 Mass. 432, 444 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">4. <em>Immunity of the supervisors and of the Commonwealth. </em>The supervisors and the Commonwealth raise several claims of immunity. The supervisors rely on Federal law to assert that they are entitled to qualified or \u201cgood faith\u201d immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1979), as amended. The Commonwealth\u2019s claims of immunity are based on G. L. c. 258, \u00a7\u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and (c). We treat these claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>a. <em>Qualified immunity pursuant to \u00a7 1983. </em>Under <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982), the doctrine of qualified immunity applies only to \u201cdiscretionary functions.\u201d For this portion of our discussion, we shall assume that the supervisory defendants\u2019 acts were discretionary acts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Breault v. Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 33 (1987) (where acts are ministerial, no valid claim of qualified immunity can be raised), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiere </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988). Such an assumption does not end our inquiry. The doctrine of qualified immunity has both an objective and a subjective element. \u201cThe objective element involves a presumptive knowledge of the respect for \u2018basic, unquestioned constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harlow, supra </em>at 815, quoting <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 322 (1975). The subjective element involves the supervisors\u2019 actual knowledge whether the law forbade their conduct. <em>Harlow, supra </em>at 815-817. If the law was not clearly established, the supervisors cannot be held responsible for failing to know that their conduct was unlawful. <em>Id. </em>at 818. However, if the law was clearly established and the supervisors failed to prove extraordinary circumstances justifying their lack of knowledge of the law, then the immunity defense fails. \u201c[A] reasonably competent public official should know the law governing his conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819. Whether the law was clearly established is an objective question for the judge. <em>Id. </em>at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The supervisory defendants raised the issue below, and, hence, we consider whether the judge correctly determined that the relevant law was clearly established prior to Dobos\u2019s arrest in September, 1978. In considering what law is relevant, we bear in mind that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">\u201cThe operation of [the Harlow] standard . . . depends substantially upon the level of generality at which the relevant \u2018legal rule\u2019 is to be identified. For example, the right to due process of law is quite clearly established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>by the Due Process Clause, and thus there is a sense in which any action that violates that Clause (no matter how unclear it may be that the particular action is a violation) violates a clearly established right. Much the same could be said of any other constitutional or statutory violation. But if the test of \u2018clearly established law\u2019 were to be applied at this level of generality, it would bear no relationship to the \u2018objective legal reasonableness\u2019 that is the touchstone of <em>Harlow. </em>. . . It should not be surprising, therefore, that our cases establish that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \u2018clearly established\u2019 in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right. <em>This is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful, . . . but it is to say that in the light of preexisting law the unlawfulness must be </em>apparent\u2019 (emphasis supplied). <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639-640 (1987).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Thus, the law must have been clearly established prior to September, 1978, that conduct by public officers, comparable to the conduct of the police supervisors in this case resulting in the infliction of injuries by a subordinate, violated the constitutional rights of the injured individuals. We hold that, during the tenure of each of the supervisors, such law was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>established. We hold, also, that the evidence placed before the jury was sufficient to warrant the jury\u2019s verdicts. (See part 6, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In 1971, well before the first occasion on which Driscoll was removed from highway patrol, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided a case concerning police supervisory liability. In that case, <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>447 F.2d 358 (D.C. Cir. 1971), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>409 U.S. 418, modified, 489 F.2d 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1973), the complaint alleged that a police officer had arrested the plaintiff without probable cause and, as he was being held by two other officers, the first officer had proceeded to beat him with brass knuckles. <em>Id. </em>at 360. The complaint further alleged that the first officer\u2019s precinct captain and the chief of police had \u201cnegligently failed to train, instruct, supervise, and control [the officer] with regard to the circumstances in which (1) an arrest may be made, and (2) various degrees of force may be used in making an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court in that case held that, under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff \u201cwill be entitled to prevail if he can show that [the] Captain ... or Chief . . . was negligent in performing his own duty to supervise or train [the officer] . . . and that the negligence caused [the plaintiff] to be deprived by [the officer] of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. The <em>Carter </em>court also stated that supervisors might well be liable if the plaintiff could show that they \u201cknew, or should have known, that [the officer] was likely to use excessive force in making an arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The conduct of the supervisors herein meets this description exactly. Dobos presented ample evidence that the supervisors knew, of should have known, that Driscoll was very likely to violate constitutionally protected rights of members of the public. Driscoll\u2019s extensive history of abuse and assault, and his disregard of the rights of others, was unabated until his encounter with Dobos. The supervisory defendants knew, or should have known, that Driscoll had assaulted his former girl friend and her children; he had endangered the public and his fellow officers by his reckless driving while at Shaeffer Stadium, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>and by his possession of unauthorized ammunition and bulletproof vests and clijpboards, even though he was removed from road duty at the time; he had harassed Norman Gans; he had verbally abused Mitchell and had twice threatened to strike him, with no apparent provocation; and he had abused Bender sufficiently that Hunt, who had recommended no action on the Mitchell complaint, recommended that Driscoll be enrolled in an attitude awareness program. Additionally, it was known that Driscoll\u2019s history had prompted several of his former supervisors to recommend his removal from contact with the public. The supervisors herein knew, or should have known, of this extensive disciplinary history because each of them had disciplined Driscoll at least once, and the defendants Hunt and Kehoe testified that disciplinary action required a complete investigation of the officer\u2019s history. \u201c[A] complaint alleging that a police supervisor has notice of past culpable conduct of his subordinates and has failed to prevent a recurrence of such misconduct states a \u00a7 1983 claim.\u201d <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>537 F.2d 829, 832 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Other Federal Circuit Courts were in agreement that supervisors could be held liable in similar circumstances.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.2d 819, 830-831 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>404 U.S. 866 (1971) (allegedly negligent training of guard at prison farm); <em>Dewell </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>489 F.2d 877, 881 (10th Cir. 1974) (police chief\u2019s alleged failure to establish procedures or to provide personnel to detect and treat persons suffering from a diabetic condition); <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>(police supervisors who have notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>past culpable conduct of subordinates and have failed to prevent recurrence of such misconduct may be liable under \u00a7 1983). The above cases clearly established, prior to 1978, that Driscoll\u2019s supervisors could be liable under \u00a7 1983 for their failure to remove him from highway duty prior to his encounter with Dobos.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">b. <em>Immunity for the Commonwealth: State law. </em>The Commonwealth contends that the judge erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to the claims against it under G. L. c. 258. Under G. L. c. 258, the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, the Commonwealth \u201cshall be liable for . . . personal injury . . . caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any public employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,\u201d subject to certain limitations. G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2 (1986 ed.). The Commonwealth claims that this case falls within an exemption from such liability for \u201cany claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a public employer or public employee, acting within the scope of his office or employment, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>(1986 ed.). We consider this argument in the context of the well-established principle whether, construing the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing therefrom in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, a jury would be warranted in finding that the Commonwealth\u2019s agents were negligent in their performance of nondiscretionary duties, <em>von Henneberg </em>v. <em>Generazio, </em>403 Mass. 519, 520 (1988). <em>Cimino </em>v. <em>Milford Keg, Inc., </em>385 Mass. 323, 326 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The Commonwealth urges that, as matter of law, the decisions whether to discipline an officer and how much discipline to impose are discretionary, and in fact quasi-judicial. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>disagree. We have indicated previously that it is necessary to engage in a case-by-case determination of what is a discretionary function under \u00a7 10 <em>(b) </em>and what is not. <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 413 (1987). We hold, on the evidence before them, that the jury were warranted in finding that the supervisors\u2019 acts, or failures to act, were not pursuant to any \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We have stated that the following inquiries are relevant as to whether the act of a public employee involved discretionary conduct: \u201cWas the injury-producing conduct an integral part of governmental policymaking or planning? Might the imposition of tort liability jeopardize the quality and efficiency of the governmental process? Could a judge or jury review the conduct in question without usurping the power and responsibility of the legislative or executive branches? Is there an alternate remedy available to the injured individual other than an action for damages?\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 219 (1977). See <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 412-413, and cases cited. We consider first whether the injury-producing conduct was an integral part of governmental policymaking or planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The supervisors\u2019 alleged injury-producing conduct may be characterized as follows: The reinstatement of Driscoll to highway patrol despite the supervisors\u2019 knowledge (actual or constructive) of ample reasons for not doing so, the failure to follow established procedures resulting in failing to impose probationary conditions on Driscoll\u2019s return to highway patrol that would have assured his removal prior to his encounter with the plaintiffs, the failure to monitor Driscoll\u2019s activities, and the failure to remove Driscoll, or to investigate his record, as various substantiated allegations of his misconduct arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra, </em>we held that, although the adoption of a plan to integrate handicapped pupils fully into the public schools was discretionary, <em>id. </em>at 224, the implementation of that policy was not, <em>id. </em>at 222-223. \u201cDiscretionary acts are not those which involve \u2018the carrying out of previously established policies or plans.\u2019 <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>218. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>[392 Mass. 745, 753 (1984)].\u201d <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 467-468 (1986). The evidence put before the jury was sufficient to warrant a finding that the supervisory defendants failed to implement existing policy requirements.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was State police policy, the defendant Kehoe admitted, to conduct a thorough investigation in response to citizen complaints and in conjunction with imposing discipline. Yet, all the supervisors admitted that they conducted no investigation of Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history, either when disciplining him or after receiving citizen complaints against him. Furthermore, the jury had before them several of Driscoll\u2019s prior disciplinary proceedings from which established policies could be inferred. It is not necessary that a policy be written to be in effect. <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional School Dist., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 211, 215 (1983). Finally, there was testimony that Driscoll\u2019s reinstatement without probationary conditions was unusual. Thus, the jury could have found that the supervisors\u2019 conduct in reinstating Driscoll was an improper implementation of existing policy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Additionally, we cannot say that the imposition of tort liability in this case will jeopardize the quality and efficiency of the governmental process. There was testimony by some of the supervisors suggesting that Driscoll\u2019s position as a negotiator for his union may have led them to treat Driscoll differently from other officers. As we stated in <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 413, the \u2018\u201cquality and efficiency of the governmental process\u2019 requires, at a minimum, impartiality on the part of State employees.\u201d The imposition of tort liability in this case will, if anything, encourage such impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The power and responsibility of the legislative and executive branches are not usurped in this case. There is no administrative scheme that is being bypassed, cf. <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 413-414; nor is there any interference with the operation of police disciplinary policy or procedures. Rather, it is the failure to follow established procedures that was tested by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs have no alternate remedy other than an action for damages. They have no alternate judicial process, as in <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 414; they cannot be aided by equitable relief; and, absent damages, they cannot be compensated for the harm done. Therefore, the Commonwealth does not have immunity under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (b), based on a claim of the exercise of discretionary functions by the supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The Commonwealth claims, alternatively, that it falls within the exemption from liability for \u201cany claim arising out of an intentional tort, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, [or] intentional mental distress.\u201d G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c). The Commonwealth asserts that the plaintiffs raise claims \u201carising out of\u201d intentional torts because of Driscoll\u2019s intentional torts. We already have considered and rejected such an interpretation of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c). <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Blandford, </em>402 Mass. 831, 836-838 (1988). As we held in <em>Blandford, </em>where the supervisory officials allegedly had, or should have had, knowledge of a public employee\u2019s assaultive behavior, it is the supervisors\u2019 conduct, rather than the employee\u2019s intentional conduct, that is the true focus of the case. The claims were not barred by G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>5. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Counsel for the supervisors submitted requests for jury instructions and made timely objection to the judge\u2019s charge. As to the charge, the supervisors renew their claims of error on essentially two grounds. First, they claim that an instruction should have been given that, under \u00a7 1983, the supervisors could not be held liable on the basis of respondeat superior. Second, they claim that the jury were not adequately, apprised that \u201cmere negligence\u201d would not suffice to find the supervisors to be liable under \u00a7 1983. See <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347 (1986); <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-336 (1986). These arguments are not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">\u201cIf you find on this evidence that any or all of the defendants failed to supervise or discipline Driscoll, and said failure to supervise or discipline him constituted gross negligence <em>amounting to conscious indifference to the safety of the public, </em>and that this resulted in the violation of Robert Dobos\u2019s constitutional rights, then you should find that they are liable to Mr. Dobos\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">This charge tracks the language used by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Languirand </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>717 F.2d 220, 227 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Languirand </em>v. <em>Pass Christian, </em>467 U.S. 1215 (1985), wherein that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">\u201cWe conclude that if there is a cause of action under section 1983 for failure to properly train a police officer whose negligent or grossly negligent performance of duty has injured a citizen, that such failure to train must constitute gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">This language was implicitly approved by the Supreme Court in its recent decision in <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>U.S. (1989) (109 S. Ct. 1197 [1989]), which concerned municipal liability for failure to train police officers. In a unanimous portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the opinion, the Court cited <em>Languirand </em>as an example of a case applying the proper standard of liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id. </em>at n.7 <em>(Id. </em>at 1205 n.7).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>868 F.2d 9, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1989), where the court stated: \u201cCases in this circuit suggest that government officials may be held liable for a deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process if their conduct reflects a reckless or callous indifference to an individual\u2019s rights.\u201d Thus, the judge\u2019s charge fully complies with the latest Supreme Court precedent. We must assume that the jury followed these instructions. <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 110 (1982). The judge was not required to accept the phrasing of the instructions suggested by counsel. <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 394-397 (1980). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The supervisors also contend that the special questions suggested to the jury that \u201cmere negligence\u201d would suffice. It is true that the special questions did not refer explicitly to gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference. However, the judge is not required to repeat in the special questions those instructions given at an earlier point in the charge. See <em>Solimene </em>v. <em>B. Grauel &amp; Co., KG, </em>399 Mass. 790, 802 (1987) (special questions did not specifically refer to issue of proximate cause, but judge\u2019s thorough instructions on this issue enabled jury to understand their duty in answering each question).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The jury\u2019s question to the judge about the meaning of the words \u201ccausally negligent\u201d in one of the special questions does not convince us otherwise. There are many reasons why the jury may have asked their question, not the least of which is that one special question addressed the contributory negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>if any, of Dobos. We will not speculate that the jury were in fact confused about the distinction between ordinary negligence and gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference when that distinction had been explained previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">Finally, the supervisors contend that, because the judge\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question failed to mention gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference, it compounded any confusion that the jury may have had about the standard of culpability. This contention is speculative, and, in any event, there was no objection at trial, even though the judge asked counsel if they wished to discuss anything at side bar. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">6. <em>Motions for directed verdict and for judgments notwithstanding the verdict. </em>The defendant supervisors claim that the judge should have granted their motions for a directed verdict or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding either that they were consciously or deliberately indifferent to the safety of the public or that they proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. We apply the same standard in reviewing the judge\u2019s denial of these motions. <em>Service Publications, Inc. </em>v. <em>Goverman, </em>396 Mass. 567, 571 (1986). That standard is whether \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978), quoting <em>Raunela </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>361 Mass. 341, 343 (1972). We conclude that the jury properly could have found that each of the supervisory defendants (a) was consciously or deliberately indifferent to the safety of the public and (b) proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In the case before us, there was evidence that each supervisor \u2014 Hunt, Trabucco, Kehoe, and Canty \u2014 knew, or should have known, that Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history would determine his fitness to come in contact with members of the public. Furthermore, there was evidence that the State police had a policy of investigating an officer\u2019s history before imposing discipline, in part to protect the public from officers whose his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>tory might reveal serious misconduct demonstrating a propensity to violate the constitutional rights of members of the public. Thus, the need to investigate Driscoll\u2019s history, and to determine whether to reinstate Driscoll to road duty or what training or conditions should be imposed on him, based on that history, can be said to be so obvious that failure to do so could be found by the jury to constitute deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of members of the public with whom Driscoll would come in contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The defendant Hunt testified that he did not investigate the reasons for Driscoll\u2019s removal from highway duty, even though he disciplined Driscoll on at least five occasions, and even though he knew that Driscoll\u2019s former troop supervisor had recommended that Driscoll be removed from contact with the public. The defendant Trabucco also testified that he did not investigate the reasons for Driscoll\u2019s removal from highway duty, even though he recommended that Driscoll be returned to highway duty, and even though he knew that several of Driscoll\u2019s former supervisors had recommended that Driscoll be removed from public contact. The jury could find that the defendants Hunt and Trabucco chose to ignore Driscoll\u2019s history, even though they knew that his history was almost certain to reveal grave misconduct that threatened the public. Thus, the jury could conclude, Hunt and Trabucco each were deliberately indifferent to the constitutional rights of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The jury could find that the defendant Kehoe chose to ignore Driscoll\u2019s history and, consequently, Driscoll\u2019s substantial likelihood of violating constitutional rights of the public. Kehoe\u2019s testimony revealed that he was involved personally in Driscoll\u2019s discipline, that he had removed Driscoll from public contact on two occasions, and that he had been informed that, even while Driscoll was removed from the highway under strict probationary conditions, Driscoll had endangered the public and his fellow officers at Shaeffer Stadium. Thus, Kehoe knew that Driscoll was violent and abusive and that Driscoll had responded to discipline with more misconduct. Yet Kehoe never investigated Driscoll\u2019s history, he returned Driscoll to highway duty a second time without requiring that Driscoll be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>monitored, and he failed to impose any probationary conditions. On this evidence, the jury properly could find that Kehoe was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional rights of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Finally, the jury could find that the defendant Canty deliberately chose to ignore Driscoll\u2019s history, even though he decided with Hunt what would be Driscoll\u2019s discipline for the Mitchell incident, and, even though his primary responsibility, the jury could infer, was to conduct investigations in cases of this sort. Canty described his responsibilities as follows: \u201cI handled major incidents, discipline, make recommendations to the colonel.\u201d Canty testified that he and Hunt agreed that Driscoll\u2019s discipline for the Mitchell incident would be a \u201cverbal reprimand.\u201d Nevertheless, when Canty was asked, \u201cDid you ever learn of a complaint lodged against Trooper Driscoll on March 14, 1978 by Robert W. Mitchell,\u201d he responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t know his name was Mitchell until today.\u201d The jury properly could conclude that this conduct, by a supervisor whose primary responsibility was to recommend disciplinary action after an investigation, was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional rights of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">It is clear that the jury could have concluded that each of the supervisory defendants knew, or should have known, of Driscoll\u2019s propensities to abuse and assault members of the motoring public and that, deliberately indifferent to the public safety, they allowed Driscoll to return to highway duty without proper investigation or safeguards. The probability of an incident such as that here in issue, in the jury\u2019s view, could have been foreseen easily. In such circumstances, the failure of these supervisory defendants to take steps to prevent such an occurrence would warrant the jury\u2019s findings of liability under \u00a7 1983 as to each supervisory defendant. Also, their negligence warrants the finding against the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>affirm the judgments and remand the case so that the judge below, in his or her discretion, may award attorney\u2019s fees and costs for this appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-10\"> The jury awarded Donna and Laura Dobos zero dollars each for their claim of a loss of consortium. However, the docket reflects that judgments on the jury verdict were awarded to Donna and Laura Dobos in the amount of $1 each, with costs.

Considered in this light it is clear that the action of any of the supervisors was not particularized enough to give rise to liability. At the time of events complained of, no case had established liability for a supervisor\u2019s inadequate response as contrasted with failure to act at all. Neither the court nor Dobos points to any decision imposing liability for failure to impose a greater degree of discipline. This is so, I submit, because a decision to impose discipline can, by its very nature, only be made on a case-by-case basis. In addition, disciplinary procedures must not violate an officer\u2019s due process rights. See <em>O\u2019Hara </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Safety, </em>367 Mass. 376, 382-384 (1975). Moreover, determining the appropriate punishment would seem to require assessing an officer\u2019s entire service record and taking into account not only the officer\u2019s prior meritorious acts but also the officer\u2019s prior blameworthy acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In <em>Benson </em>v. <em>Allphin, </em>786 F.2d 268, 276 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 848 (1986), in discussing a State employer\u2019s qualified immunity defense, the court stated that courts have to balance the employer\u2019s and employee\u2019s competing interests and \u201c[i]t would appear that, whenever a balancing of interests is required, the facts of the existing caselaw must closely correspond to the contested action before the defendant official is subject to liability under <em>[Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800 (1982)].\u201d See <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Grahm, </em>845 F.2d 179, 183 (8th Cir. 1988). But see <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Tri-City Hosp. Auth., 696 </em>F. Supp. 1496, 1503-1505 (N.D. Ga. 1988). The supervisory defendants in this case had to consider not only that the public\u2019s civil rights should be protected, but also that Trooper Driscoll receive only that degree of discipline that his misconduct warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The decisions cited by the court do not establish that the defendants would be liable in this context. In <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>447 F.2d 358 (D.C.

Cir. 1973), on which the court relies heavily, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit did not reach the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but simply reversed the dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, the <em>Carter </em>decision took account of the fact that the Supreme Court had not yet read into \u00a7 1983 a broad immunity \u201cfor all government officers exercising discretionary functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 365. Subsequently, and prior to the acts complained of here, the Supreme Court decided that qualified immunity exists for government officials other than legislators and judges. <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Navarette, </em>434 U.S. 555 (1978) (prison officials). <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308 (1975) (school officials). <em>Scheuer </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232 (1974) (State executive branch officials). Even if <em>Carter </em>can be construed as giving notice to law enforcement officials regarding their potential \u00a7 1983 liability, <em>the Procunier, Wood, Scheuer </em>expansion of the governmental qualified immunity defense certainly pointed in the opposite direction. The <em>Carter </em>case also predates the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>423 U.S. 362 (1976), and thus any value it may have had in determining a supervisor\u2019s potential \u00a7 1983 liability was virtually eliminated by the Court\u2019s holding that a mere \u201cfailure to act\u201d on the part of supervisory officials in the face of constitutional violations by subordinate officers is not a sufficient basis for establishing \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Id. </em>at 375-376. See <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Jefferson County, </em>668 F.2d 869, 873 &amp; n.2 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 833 (1982) (recognizing the limited value of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carlson </em>in light of <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.2d 819 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>404 U.S. 866 (1971), also fails to support the liability of the supervisory defendants in this case. In <em>Roberts, </em>the liability of the prison farm superintendent for failing to train and supervise a guard rested on the superintendent\u2019s total failure to provide any training to the guard concerning the proper handling of the firearm entrusted to him. <em>Id. </em>at 822-823. <em>Roberts </em>offered supervisory officials no guidance as to their potential liability should the amount of training and supervision provided ultimately prove to be inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Dewell </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>489 F.2d 877 (10th Cir. 1974), and <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>537 F.2d 829 (5th Cir. 1976), decided prior to <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra, </em>also fail to provide a basis for concluding that supervisory liability exists here. In both cases, the courts merely reversed trial court decisions dismissing complaints for failure to state a claim. In addition, unlike this case, the plaintiffs in both <em>Dewell </em>and <em>Sims </em>alleged a total failure by police officials to take action, e.g., <em>Dewell, supra </em>at 880 (failure to establish regulations regarding diabetic prisoners); <em>Sims, supra </em>at 831-832 (failure to discipline subordinate officer). Even assuming these cases establish that police supervisors may be liable under \u00a7 1983 for their failure to act when they had a duty to do so, the cases do not clearly establish the incorrectness of the defendant supervisors\u2019 conduct here. As the Supreme Court has stated, officials are not \u201ccharged with predicting the future course of. . . [the] law.\u201d <em>Pierson </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>386 U.S. 547, 557 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Moreover, I am led to the conclusion in favor of the supervisors\u2019 immunity because at the time of these events supervisory officials were not clearly liable for failing to supervise their subordinates. See, e.g., <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode, supra </em>at 375-376; <em>Kostka </em>v. <em>Hogg, </em>560 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1977) (\u201c[a] police chief is under no constitutional duty to take positive action to reduce the incidence of unconstitutional conduct by police officers on the beat\u201d); <em>Leite </em>v. <em>Providence, </em>463 F. Supp. 585, 589 (D.R.I. 1978) (\u201c[t]he vast majority of those courts which have considered the issue [degree of culpability required under \u00a7 1983] have not held high level officials liable for failure to supervise, correct and control the actions of their subordinates\u201d); <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Dias, </em>415 F. Supp. 1351, 1353 (D. Mass. 1976), and cases cited. See generally Crocker, When Cops are Robbers \u2014 Municipal Liability for Police Misconduct Under Section 1983 and Bivens, 15 U. Rich. L. Rev. 295 (1981). Just two years prior to the acts complained of in this case, the court in <em>Delaney, supra, </em>stated: \u201cPublic officials cannot be held liable for monetary damages under [\u00a7] 1983 purely for an alleged failure to exercise proper supervisory control over their subordinates. Many cases, in the specific context of alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>abuse of police power, have held offending officers themselves liable, while dismissing complaints against supervisors who had no personal involvement in the alleged misconduct.\u201d Without a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court, the disagreement among the lower Federal courts regarding the scope of a supervisor\u2019s liability pursuant to \u00a7 1983 for the acts of his or her subordinates and the lack of decisions regarding a supervisor\u2019s liability after he or she takes disciplinary or supervisory action, can only be said to demonstrate that the law in this area was not \u201cclearly established.\u201d Therefore, I conclude that the supervisory defendants were improperly denied qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">2. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s immunity under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (b). </em>The court holds that a supervisor\u2019s disciplinary decisions, after an investigation into and determination of wrongdoing by a subordinate officer, is not a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b), </em>and thus, the Commonwealth is liable for the supervisors\u2019 acts. Since I believe that a supervisor, in determining appropriate punishment on an individual, case-by-case basis, is exercising a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d I conclude that the Commonwealth is immune from suit under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (b), in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The court seeks to distinguish the supervisory decision making in this case from that in <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional School Dist., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 211 (1983), where the Appeals Court held that \u201c[mjanagement of student imbroglios, <em>student discipline, </em>and school decorum fall readily within the discretionary function exception to the Tort Claims Act\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 217. Previously, we have cited <em>Cady </em>when discussing the discretionary function exception contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 <em>(b). </em>See, e.g., <em>A.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 234, 245 (1988); Pina v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 412-413 (1987); <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 468 (1986); <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>395 Mass. 659, 665 n.6 (1985). The court seeks to avoid the obvious applicability of <em>Cady </em>by stating that the jury could have found that reinstating Driscoll was contrary to an unwritten existing policy. The result of the court\u2019s reading of <em>Cady, </em>as I see it, is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>degree of discipline imposed by a supervisor is within the supervisor\u2019s discretion unless the jury decides that some unwritten policy would call for another form of discipline. I submit that is the same as saying that the jury can decide whether the degree of discipline imposed was appropriate. In such circumstances the discretionary function exception disappears. Because I believe that the process by which school administrators impose student discipline is strikingly similar to the process by which police supervisors discipline subordinate officers, I would hold that a police disciplinary process is also a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In determining that the school officials were acting pursuant to a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d the Appeals Court stated: \u201cSizing up the gravity of a school yard feud, deciding how best to defuse it, and maintaining school discipline involve judgment, experience, and the intuition which is the sum of experience.\u201d <em>Cady, supra </em>at 216. See <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Methuen, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 279, 280 (1988). The court went on to say that \u201c[standards for dealing with bullying, or other manifestations of disruptive student behavior, must be as variable as the personalities of the students and the settings in which disruption occurs.\u201d <em>Cady, supra. </em>A decision to discipline a police officer for infractions also involves a supervisor\u2019s judgment, experience, and intuition and the punishment imposed for a particular infraction will also be as variable as the officer\u2019s personality and the circumstances in which the infraction occurs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Pina </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 408, 415 (1987) (discretionary decisions are \u201cthose in which a government official determines what action to take based on an individual, case-by-case analysis and in which his decision includes elements of judgment and discretion\u201d), quoting <em>Bartel </em>v. <em>Federal Aviation Admin., </em>617 F. Supp. 190, 196 n.29 (D.D.C. 1985). The evidence which was presented to the jury regarding State police disciplinary procedures was that after completing an investigation the troop commander \u201cmake[s] a <em>judgment </em>based upon the information that was available to him\u201d (emphasis added). A supervisor\u2019s \u201cjudgment\u201d based upon the particular circumstances of an incident should not fall within the category of nondiscretionary acts for which the Commonwealth could be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Furthermore, I conclude that imposing tort liability in this situation will jeopardize the quality and efficiency of a disciplinary process. The \u201c \u2018quality and efficiency of the govermental process\u2019 requires, at a minimum, impartiality on the part of State employees.\u201d <em>Pina </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 413, quoting <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 219 (1977). Human nature indicates that, confronted with a \u201cclose call,\u201d the supervisor will impose harsher punishment for fear of judicial second guessing, and the imposition of liability, and thus \u201cthe impartiality of individual determinations [would] be threatened.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">It should be understood that what is significant is the nature of the disciplinary process itself and not the unfortunate misconduct of Driscoll which followed the imposition of discipline in this case, because \u201c[u]nder the [Tort Claims Act], the exception applies even where there has been abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Wightman, supra </em>at 281. See <em>Cady, supra </em>at 215 (\u201cIt is the nature of the governmental act, not the care with which it is performed, that determines whether the exception applies\u201d). See also <em>Dalehite </em>v. <em>United States, </em>346 U.S. 15, 35 (1953); <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 470 &amp; n.3 (1986). Because police disciplinary proceedings are \u201ccharacterized by the high degree of discretion and judgment involved in weighing alternatives and making choices,\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>373 Mass. 208, 218 (1977), I would hold that it falls within the discretionary function exception contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10 (b). Thus, the Commonwealth\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this issue were improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">3. <em>The supervisory defendants\u2019 liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. </em>The court apparently concedes that the supervisors\u2019 liability would require a showing of more than mere negligence. In light of <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986), and <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 347-348 (1986), as interpreted in <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>868 F.2d 9, 17-18 (1st Cir. 1989), I cannot agree that the culpability requirement has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The supervisory defendants will be liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, only if (1) the supervisory defendants acted under color of State law, and (2) their conduct deprived him of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States. See <em>Parratt </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981); <em>Voutour </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>761 F.2d 812, 819 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Saugus </em>v. <em>Voutour, </em>474 U.S. 1100 <em>(1986); Appleton v. Hudson, </em>397 Mass. 812, 818 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In this case, the constitutional deprivation relied on consisted of Trooper Driscoll\u2019s excessive use of force and verbal harassment while arresting and detaining Dobos. The gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim against the supervisory defendants is that their conduct caused Dobos to be subjected to the deprivation because they failed adequately to supervise and discipline Trooper Driscoll. See <em>Oklahoma City </em>v. <em>Tuttle, 471 </em>U.S. 808, 816-817 (1985). In <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 328, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe Due Process Clause is simply not implicated by a <em>negligent </em>act of an official causing an unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property\u201d (emphasis in original). See also <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, supra </em>at 347-348 (\u201clack of care simply does not approach the sort of abusive governmental conduct that the Due Process Clause was designed to prevent\u201d). While it is clear that an intentional deprivation would be actionable, <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 331, the Court left open the question whether a lesser culpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>bility standard would suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 334 n.3 (\u201cthis case affords us no occasion to consider whether something less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or \u2018gross negligence,\u2019 is enough to trigger the protections of the Due Process Clause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has responded that \u201c[c]oses in this circuit suggest that government officials may be liable for a deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process if their conduct reflects a reckless or callous indifference to an individual\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, supra </em>at 17-18. The court defined this culpability standard by stating that \u201c[a]n official displays such a reckless or callous indifference when it would be manifest to any reasonable official that his conduct was <em>very likely </em>to violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 18. In that court\u2019s view a reckless or callous indifference standard exemplifies \u201cthe arbitrary exercise of the powers of government,\u201d which the due process clause was designed to protect against, while \u201c[n]egligence ... no matter how \u2018gross\u2019 it may be [only] exemplifies lack of care. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18. Thus the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>becomes whether there was sufficient evidence to conclude that each supervisory defendant believed (or reasonably should have believed) that his conduct was <em>very likely </em>to result in Trooper Driscoll\u2019s violation of the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights. See <em>id. </em>at 18 n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In reviewing the evidence, it is important to note that the plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence that the four supervisory defendants maintained a custom, policy, or practice of failing to supervise or discipline Massachusetts State troopers from which the jury could infer that they encouraged, condoned, acquiesced in, or deliberately disregarded instances of civil rights violations by troopers under their command. See generally <em>Voutour </em>v. <em>Vitale, supra </em>at 820. Similarly, the plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence that excessive use of force or verbal harassment by Massachusetts State troopers was customary or prevalent, from which the jury could infer a policy authorizing or encouraging such action. See <em>id. </em>It was also undisputed that the supervisory defendants took disciplinary action on all substantiated complaints involving Trooper Driscoll. It is important to note, especially in regard to whether the defendants reasonably believed that putting Trooper Driscoll back on highway duty in 1977 was very likely to result in his committing constitutional violations, the fact that none of the prior complaints lodged against Trooper Driscoll involved false arrest, excessive force, or other \u201ccivil rights violations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Without evidence of widespread abuses by other troopers, and the fact that a supervisor\u2019s liability cannot be predicated simply upon a respondeat superior theory, <em>Monell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of the City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 663 n.7 (1978), the supervisory defendants\u2019 liability must rest solely on whether their returning Trooper Driscoll to road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>duty in 1977 without imposing probationary conditions was very likely to violate Dobos\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">As the court points out the evidence regarding the defendant Robert Hunt was that, while Trooper Driscoll was under Hunt\u2019s command, Hunt disciplined Driscoll for what Hunt described as five \u201cminor infractions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 640. Only two of these infractions involved complaints by motorists, and only one of the complaints was substantiated through an internal State police investigation. Hunt\u2019s culpability is said to rest on his failure to investigate Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history before determining appropriate \u201cdiscipline\u201d even though he knew Driscoll\u2019s former captain once recommended that Driscoll be removed from the road. However, Hunt look some type of disciplinary action on each complaint. Furthermore, the evidence regarding Hunt\u2019s opinion that Driscoll was not fit to be on the highway on the date of the Dobos incident and his recommendation that Driscoll be enrolled in an \u201cattitude awareness program,\u201d is irrelevant because both observations were made by taking into consideration the Dobos incident, and thus do not indicate anything about the propriety of Hunt\u2019s actions prior to September 4, 1978, much less that Hunt\u2019s conduct was very likely to violate Dobos\u2019s constitutional rights. Hunt\u2019s failure to investigate fully Driscoll\u2019s history does not, standing alone, provide a sufficient basis to impose \u00a7 1983 liability. Compare <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Bullins, </em>844 F.2d 269, 274-275 (5th Cir. 1988) (there was no gross negligence in town\u2019s failure fully to investigate police officer\u2019s arrest record before hiring him because \u201cto hold the town . . . liable here would march municipal liability too far down the path toward liability based on negligence\u201d). <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Houston Independent School Dist., </em>817 F.2d 351, 354 (5th Cir. 1987) (there was no evidence to support allegation that supervisors were grossly negligent or deliberately indifferent to student\u2019s constitutional rights for failing to train properly bus drivers without evidence of a \u201cwidespread problem mandating an official response\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The evidence of culpability against the remaining supervisory defendants is even more inadequate. The defendant Canty, unaware that Driscoll had been previously removed from road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>duty, testified that he knew of the two motorists\u2019 complaints in 1978, and agreed with Hunt that, in regard to one of the complaints, a verbal reprimand was sufficient punishment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Canty\u2019s culpable conduct, like Hunt\u2019s, was his failure to investigate Driscoll\u2019s disciplinary history. However, Canty\u2019s failure in light of his lack of knowledge of Driscoll\u2019s prior conduct, would not indicate \u201cto any reasonable official that [such] conduct was very likely to violate an individual\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Germany </em>v. <em>Vance, supra </em>at 18. Compare <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Bullins, supra. </em>Similarly, the defendant Trabucco\u2019s sole culpable act was that he recommended to the Commissioner of Public Safety that Driscoll be reinstated to road duty after serving a ten-month suspension because of inappropriate log entries and habitual tardiness. Again, Trabucco made this recommendation without determining, through his own investigation, whether Driscoll should have been put back on the road. Finally, the defendant Kehoe\u2019s only conceivable culpable conduct was that he reinstated Driscoll to road duty on Trabucco\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence that Kehoe was aware of any of the complaints which occurred from the time Driscoll was reinstated until the time of the Dobos incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">While the plaintiffs concede that the supervisory defendants disciplined Trooper Driscoll, they argue that the discipline was inadequate and that when Driscoll was returned to road duty in 1977, it should have been with probationary conditions and other restrictions which would prevent future misconduct. However, inadequate discipline sounds in negligence which cannot support a due process violation. Compare <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>784 F.2d 430, 434 (1st Cir. 1986) (complaint alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>that city provided inadequate security at high school football game sounded in simple negligence and thus could not support due process violation). Also, the plaintiffs failed to introduce any evidence on the adequacy of the supervision and discipline imposed and whether stricter discipline was warranted. See <em>Voutour </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>761 F.2d 812, 821-822 (1st Cir. 1985) (expert testimony that the defendant city\u2019s in-service firearms training was inadequate created an issue of fact precluding summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Based on this record I cannot agree that a jury could properly find that each of the supervisory defendants acted recklessly or was callously indifferent to the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights even if they had been properly instructed. Even if I agreed with the court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he probability of an incident such as that here in issue . . . could have been foreseen easily,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 658, that does not suffice because mere \u201cprobability\u201d is not enough. The constitutional violation must have been \u201cvery likely\u201d to occur. I do not think that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\"> The Supreme Court also stated that, if the parties could characterize the relevant legal rule in very general terms, they \u201cwould be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity that our cases plainly establish into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 639.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-5\"> Disciplinary procedures and supervisory responsibilities have been recognized to be \u201cdiscretionary.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>447 F.2d 358, 363 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (\u201c[t]he functions of training, supervising and controlling police officers subsume a variety of distinct duties .... No doubt some of these duties should be regarded as discretionary for the purposes of official immunity, but others are clearly ministerial for that purpose\u201d). See also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Scherer, </em>468 U.S. 183, 196 n.14 (1984) (\u201cthe decision to discharge an employee clearly is discretionary\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">I do not reach the question whether the jury instructions were in accord with this standard, see <em>ante </em>at 655 n.12. The issue is, in my mind, open to serious question. The supervisory defendants requested instructions, citing <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra and Davidson </em>v. <em>Cannon, supra, </em>that negligence was an insufficient basis for \u00a7 1983 liability and that the plaintiffs must prove that the supervisory defendants acted in a \u201ccallous, intentional, or deliberately indifferent manner.\u201d The judge charged that, if the \u201cfailure to supervise or discipline him constituted gross negligence amounting to conscious indifference to the safety of the public,\u201d then the defendants would be liable. The remainder of the jury instructions are replete with references to the supervisors\u2019 \u201cnegligence,\u201d which easily could have misled the jury into believing that negligence was a sufficient basis for \u00a7 1983 liability. For example, in explaining the special question regarding causal negligence the judge instructed, \u201c[T]he question is did [the supervisory defendants], by their act or omission, violate that duty by acting in violation of a standard of ordinary care.\u201d See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 332 (\u201c[L]ack of due care suggests no more than a failure to measure up to the conduct of a reasonable person. To hold that injury caused by such conduct is a deprivation within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment would trivialize the centuries-old principle of due process of law\u201d). Also, the judge refused the supervisory defendants\u2019 request to elaborate on the difference in culpability between simple negligence and gross negligence as defined in the instructions, and refused to instruct the jury that they could not find the supervisory defendants liable on a respondeat superior theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\"> The plaintiffs do not appear to take issue with the discipline imposed on Driscoll as a result of the one incident which involved physical violence. In response to a substantiated complaint by Driscoll\u2019s girl friend that he had assaulted her and her children Driscoll was removed from highway duty. Driscoll was returned to road duty only after a psychiatrist certified that he was fit for contact with the public, and he was subject to strict probationary conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\"> The investigation into the second complaint was not complete at the time of the Dobos incident, and therefore neither Hunt nor any of the other supervisory defendants could have \u201cimposed discipline\u201d on that complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">The court\u2019s reliance on Kehoe\u2019s removal of Driscoll from highway duty in 1976 and his subsequent reinstatement in 1977 without any probationary conditions is misplaced since that discipline was imposed because of Driscoll\u2019s inappropriate log entries and habitual tardiness and not because of any motorist\u2019s complaint.
