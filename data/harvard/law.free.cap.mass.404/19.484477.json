The defendant was sentenced to life in prison, to be served from and after consecutive life sentences he was then serving. The defendant moved for a new trial on the ground that the judge had erred in admitting the defendant\u2019s confession as evidence after finding it voluntary by a preponderance of evidence rather than voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge ruled that the confession was not voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt, excluded the confession, and granted a new trial. We affirmed this order. 399 Mass. 1001 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The defendant then, prior to the retrial, filed a motion to suppress preindictment statements made to his former attorney about Stokes\u2019s murder, and a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. A Superior Court judge denied both motions. The defendant filed, in the Supreme Judicial Court, an application for leave to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress, and a complaint under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1986 ed.), seeking review of the denial of the motion to dismiss. A single justice issued an order consolidating the two matters, allowing the application for interlocutory review, and reserving and reporting both to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">As to his motidn to suppress, the defendant argues that his statements to his attorney, offered through his attorney at \u00e1 midtrial voir dire hearing on the voluntariness of his confession, are inadmissible in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief on retrial. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the attorney\u2019s testimony on voir dire may not thereafter be admitted against the defendant on the issue of guilt. The attorney\u2019s testimony demonstrated the defendant\u2019s alleged belief that he had received immunity for Stokes\u2019s murder, and included personal knowledge of the attorney concerning the issue of immunity, as well as inculpatory admissions that the defendant had made to his attorney. Compare the principles concerning a defendant\u2019s own testimony on such a motion as established in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>388 Mass. 637, 647 (1983), quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 394 (1968). The motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements, offered at voir dire to prove the involuntariness of the defendant\u2019s confession, should have been allowed. We need not and do not decide whether, in some other circumstances, a defendant might be considered to have waived his rights as to the admission of his attorney\u2019s testimony on the issue of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">As to his motion to dismiss the indictment, the defendant argues that the Superior Court judge erroneously denied his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, because, according to the defendant, there was insufficient evidence at the first trial, apart from his confession, to warrant a guilty verdict. The Commonwealth\u2019s case, apart from the defendant\u2019s confession which must be excluded on retrial, suggested that the defendant approached the victim in the prison recreation room and talked to him for less than one minute. The victim then left the room, met the defendant, and went to the victim\u2019s cell. The two met another inmate and the three men went into the victim\u2019s cell for about ten minutes. The defendant left first, followed by the third inmate who left about three minutes later. The victim was found on his bed, with at least fifty-seven stab wounds. Testimony suggested that blood on the cell floor had been wiped up. The medical examiner concluded that the victim\u2019s multiple stab wounds had been produced by different instruments. Weapons consistent with those used to inflict the wounds were found in the prison yard. We conclude that this evidence, if offered at a retrial of the indictment, will be sufficient to take the case to a jury even without the defendant\u2019s confession. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>378 Mass. 680, 688-690 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Furthermore, dismissal is not now warranted. It would be premature to assume that the prosecution, on retrial, will not rely on evidence that has developed since the trial, or evidence that it elected not to pursue at the defendant\u2019s first trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillet, </em>389 Mass. 605, 608-609 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 283 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is to be allowed in the Superior Court. With respect to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, a judgment is to be entered in the Supreme Judicial Court for the county of Suffolk denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
