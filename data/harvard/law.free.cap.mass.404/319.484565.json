A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s application, under Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (b) (2), as amended, 397 Mass. 1225 (1986), for leave to appeal and trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>ferred the case to the full court. We now reverse the order allowing the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress. Our decision is based upon art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; any references to Federal case law are for purposes of analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In an affidavit in support of an application for \u00e1 search warrant, State trooper Carol Harding provided the following information. In July, 1987, Trooper Harding received information that confidential informant \u201cA\u201d was an alleged cocaine distributor. \u201cA\u201d had a record of criminal activity including robbery, larceny, and firearm convictions. As part of an undercover investigation, Trooper Harding made three cocaine purchases from \u201cA.\u201d Trooper Harding communicated with \u201cA\u201d via his electronic beeper, a device commonly used to disguise illegal activities. The third purchase, 112 grams, was in \u201crock\u201d form indicating that it had been broken off of a larger quantity. Trooper Harding arrested \u201cA\u201d for trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">After being informed of his rights, \u201cA\u201d told troopers that he had obtained the cocaine at a certain apartment at an address on Auburn Street in Cambridge. \u201cA\u201d stated that \u201cJose,\u201d a Hispanic male, was the occupant of that apartment, that Jose was only at the apartment between 7 and 10 p.m., that Jose was always \u201cstrapped,\u201d meaning carrying a weapon, and gave the apartment\u2019s telephone number. \u201cA\u201d also stated that \u201cClark\u201d was a runner for Jose, gave Clark\u2019s telephone number, said that Clark drove a blue Oldsmobile, said that Clark had a roommate named Donald Hill, and that both Hill and Clark had criminal records.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Telephone company records indicated that the telephone number \u201cA\u201d gave as Jose\u2019s was listed, as an unpublished number, to Leticia Sandoval, at the apartment on Auburn Street in Cambridge. The telephone number \u201cA\u201d gave as Clark\u2019s was listed as belonging to Clark Caraven, at an address on Hubbard Avenue .in Cambridge. Trooper Harding also learned that a 1984 blue Oldsmobile parked in front of the Hubbard Avenue address was registered to Clark, that Donald Hill had telephone service to him at that address, that both Clark and Hill had criminal records, and that Hill had a past record of narcotic violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cA\u201d had told Trooper Harding, before the sale, that he wanted the \u201cdeal to go down\u201d in Cambridge, because the \u201cstash pad\u201d (a location used by drug dealers to deal from and cut the product) was in Cambridge across the street from the Cambridge police department. Trooper Harding learned that Auburn Street is near the Cambridge police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">During surveillance of the Auburn Street building, two troopers observed numerous people enter the building and leave a short time later. The troopers opined, based upon the amount of traffic at the location, that there was a large scale drug operation there.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">At the same time troopers arrested \u201cA,\u201d they arrested confidential informant \u201cB.\u201d \u201cB\u201d took a trooper to the same building on Auburn Street, pointed out the door that \u201cA\u201d went into, showed the trooper where \u201cA\u201d parked the car, and said that \u201cA\u201d had gone into the building to get cocaine, and came out with cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">A judge issued a search warrant for cocaine, any controlled substances, and materials and equipment used to manufacture and distribute controlled substances. Troopers executed the warrant, seized cocaine, cash, and drug-related items, and arrested the defendants for trafficking in cocaine. A Superior Court judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress. The Commonwealth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">For an unidentified informant\u2019s information to pass muster under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, an affidavit must apprise the magistrate of facts and circumstances showing both (1) the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that contraband was where he or she claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was credible or the information reliable (the veracity test). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 375 (1985). <em>See Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 414-415 (1969); <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Each prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, the basis of knowledge and the veracity of the informant, must be separately considered and satisfied. If an informant\u2019s tip fails to satisfy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>one of the two prongs, independent corroboration in the affidavit may supplement the informant\u2019s tip to support a finding of probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 410 (1985), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, supra, </em>and <em>Spinelli, supra </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The basis of knowledge test is clearly satisfied here, and the defendants do not challenge the judge\u2019s findings below regarding the first prong. \u201cA\u201d had personally obtained the cocaine which he sold to Trooper Harding on three occasions from Jose at the apartment on Auburn Street in Cambridge. The informant concluded that contraband was at Parapar\u2019s apartment based upon his personal observations. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65, 70 (1988). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 795 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">To satisfy the veracity prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, the affidavit must establish either the general veracity of the informant or the specific reliability of his statement in this instance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, supra </em>at 794. The Commonwealth argues that \u201cA\u2019s\u201d statements were against his penal interest and therefore establish his credibility. We have previously stated that an informant\u2019s declaration against his or her penal interest is a factor that a magistrate may properly consider in determining probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 626 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17, 21 (1975). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 585 (1971). The Supreme Court has stated: \u201cPeople do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions. Admissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility \u2014 sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search.\u201d <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, supra </em>at 21 (incriminating admissions by one who participates in a crime carry their own indicia of credibility). \u201cA\u201d had made three cocaine sales to Trooper Harding and stated that he had obtained the cocaine from Jose thus indicating he had committed crimes. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, supra </em>at 626 (where informant C merely stated that he entered the defendant\u2019s apartment \u201cto get [turned on] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>with cocaine\u201d). The informant\u2019s statement against penal interest directly inculpated him in three trafficking offenses, a possible conspiracy offense, and was supported by established facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Furthermore, the extensive detail \u201cA\u201d gave about Jose\u2019s operation indicated the reliability of his statement. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 348 (1984) (an informant\u2019s assertion of \u201cfirst hand knowledge\u201d coupled with specificity of facts lends credence to informant\u2019s statements). \u201cA\u201d identified the exact location, gave Jose\u2019s name, described Jose as a Hispanic male, gave Jose\u2019s hours, said Jose always carried a gun, and gave Jose\u2019s telephone number. \u201cA\u201d gave detailed information about Clark, Jose\u2019s runner, including the color and make of his car, his roommate\u2019s name, Clark\u2019s telephone number, and the fact that Clark and his roommate had criminal records. \u201cA\u201d had also stated before the transactions, that he wanted the deal to \u201cgo down\u201d in Cambridge, near the \u201cstash pad\u201d which was across the street from the Cambridge police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Troopers verified the majority of the information given to them by \u201cA\u201d and thereby corroborated \u201cA\u2019s\u201d statements. Troopers learned that the telephone number \u201cA\u201d gave as Jose\u2019s was indeed listed to the apartment he had specified on Auburn Street. They found that the building on Auburn Street, the alleged \u201cstash pad,\u201d was near the Cambridge police department. Troopers saw a blue Oldsmobile, registered to Clark Caraven, parked outside the Hubbard Avenue address where telephone records indicated telephone service for Clark Caraven. Troopers also verified Clark\u2019s roommate\u2019s name and criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Troopers also conducted surveillance of the building on Auburn Street which further corroborated \u201cA\u2019s\u201d statement. The troopers observed numerous persons enter the building and leave a short time later, suggestive of a large scale drug operation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 166 (1988) (stating that independent police corroboration can compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The statements of informant \u201cB\u201d further corroborated \u201cA\u2019s\u201d statement. \u201cB\u201d took a trooper to the building on Auburn Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and told that trooper that \u201cA\u201d had gone to that building to get cocaine, and had obtained cocaine. \u201cB\u201d also indicated the door \u201cA\u201d had entered and showed the trooper where \u201cA\u201d had parked while at the building. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 627 (1983) (unnamed informants\u2019 detailed statements corroborating each other in significant detailed respects regarding criminal conduct establish the veracity of informants).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We conclude that the affidavit established probable cause to issue a search warrant. The order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to suppress is reversed and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
