We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">The action was commenced on October 23, 1987, by the filing of a complaint containing two counts. In count I, Renee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Boudreau, a minor, alleges negligence against the defendant, Dr. Landry. Count II is labelled \u201cLoss of Consortium\u201d and contains the same allegations of negligence against the defendant, but it is brought by Renee\u2019s mother, Janette Boudreau.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">At the time of the defendant\u2019s care, Renee Boudreau was fifteen years old. Her complaint alleges that she was taken to the emergency room at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital on or about June 28, 1983, where the defendant examined her and diagnosed her as suffering from acute appendicitis. He performed an appendectomy on the same day. As of the third postoperative day, she continued to exhibit several symptoms of disorder such as unusually high temperature, elevated white blood cell count, headaches and distended abdomen. On July 6, 1983, the defendant ordered liver and lung scans to be performed on Renee. Both scans showed abnormal results.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">A second surgical procedure was performed by the defendant on July 7, consisting, in the main, of a laparotomy to determine the cause of her distress. Believing this second procedure to have been \u201cnegligently and carelessly\u201d performed \u201cand in gross violation of good and proper medical care,\u201d the other plaintiff, Janette Boudreau, Renee\u2019s mother, on July 8, 1983, removed Renee to University Hospital where, on the same day, she underwent a second exploratory procedure, a laparotomy, which revealed a subhepatic abscess with peritonitis and salpingitis. After treatment, she was discharged on July 25, 1983, and returned home for a lengthy convalescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">1. <em>Summary judgment as to count I (Renee\u2019s count). </em>The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60D, as amended through St. 1979, c. 502, which provides in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section seven of chapter two hundred and sixty, any claim by a minor against a health care provider stemming from professional services or health care rendered, . . . shall be commenced within three years from the date the cause of action accrues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">There is another statute of limitations which vies for our attention. It is G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 7, which prior to its amendment by St. 1987, c. 522, \u00a7 19, provided that \u201cif the person entitled thereto is a minor, or is insane or imprisoned when a right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>bring an action first accrues, the action may be commenced within the time hereinbefore limited after the disability is removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In reviewing a judge\u2019s action on a motion for summary judgment, we are required to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). As we said recently in <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., ante </em>14, 17 (1989). \u201cThe party moving for summary judgment assumes the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that there is no genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue, even if he would have no burden on an issue if the case were to go to trial. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>386 Mass. 367, 371, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>459 U.S. 970 (1982). If the moving party establishes the absence of a triable issue, the party opposing the motion must respond and allege specific facts which would establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>O\u2019Brion, Russell &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>LeMay, </em>370 Mass. 243, 245 (1976).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) The defendant satisfied his burden under <em>Pederson. </em>Then, the plaintiffs responded to the defendant\u2019s motion by filing a memorandum in opposition, containing representations of facts and legal argument and an affidavit of a psychiatrist whose opinion was that Renee was in no condition to know her rights or to conduct normal activities or to manage her own affairs for the period \u201cfrom Summer, 1983 at least until the end of 1984 and through January, 1985.\u201d We treat the cause of action as having arisen during the period covered by the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">This affidavit creates a question of fact as to whether Renee was \u201cinsane\u201d for the purpose of tolling the statute. In <em>Pederson, supra </em>at 16, we described insanity for this purpose as any mental condition in which a person is precluded from understanding the nature or effects of his acts and which prevents the person from understanding his legal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In trying to harmonize the provisions of \u00a7 7 and \u00a7 60D, we are constrained to assume that the Legislature acted reasonably. <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, </em>387 Mass. 326, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>336 (1982). In \u00a7 60D, the Legislature seems to be referring only <em>to minority </em>and not to insanity and imprisonment, because it targets expressly only \u201cany claim by a minor against a health care provider . ...\u201d In this case, there is evidence of an insane minor, and \u00a7 7 provides for a tolling of an action by an insane person. No mention is made of insanity in \u00a7 60D, and hence, we may conclude that \u00a7 60D affects only minors, not insane minors. The meaning of \u00a7 60D is that a minor\u2019s medical malpractice action must be brought within three years from the accrual date, but such language does not govern a minor who is also insane. Moreover, our law provides that, where more than one disability exists at the time a cause of action accrues, the statute is tolled until the removal of the last disability. See <em>Eager </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Mass. 182, 188 (1808). Accordingly, we are left with the tolling provisions of \u00a7 7 for insane persons. There is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Renee was insane on July 8, 1983, the day on which her cause of action might have accrued. Therefore, it was error to allow summary judgment as to count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">2. <em>Summary judgment as to count II (Janette\u2019s count). A </em>separate judgment was entered as to count II which alleges a loss of consortium by Janette, Renee\u2019s mother. We have held that loss of consortium is a separate claim, independent of the underlying negligence claim for personal injury. <em>Feltch </em>v. <em>General Rental Co., </em>383 Mass. 603, 606-608 (1981). We need not consider whether Janette commenced her action seasonably because, as Renee\u2019s parent, she has no action for loss of consortium. <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 303, 306-307 (1988). Summary judgment was correctly allowed as to count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The judgment on count I is reversed and the judgment on count II is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
