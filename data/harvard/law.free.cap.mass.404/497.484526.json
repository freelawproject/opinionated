(Whitehall), and the defendants (Barletta) have filed cross appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court. We transferred the case on our own motion. We remand for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">In late 1978 and early 1979, Whitehall and C.A. Barletta, Inc., both Massachusetts corporations, entered into discussions with respect to the construction of a prefabricated steel building. The building, which would serve as Whitehall\u2019s warehouse and office space, would be constructed by Barletta on a site located in Norwood. On February 14, 1979, Whitehall signed a contract with Barletta for the construction of the building on a \u201ccost-plus\u201d basis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to the signing of the contract between Whitehall and Barletta, Barletta communicated with National Steel Products Company (National), a manufacturer of prefabricated buildings. Barletta negotiated with National a discount of 10%, plus an additional 6% discount on the total price of the prefabricated steel for the building, a saving of approximately $50,000. Whitehall, however, maintains that, during contract discussions and even upon signing the contract with Barletta, Barletta continued to quote a higher price for the building that did not reflect the additional discount National had given to Barletta. Whitehall essentially contends that Barletta fraudulently misrepresented the actual cost of the building so that Barletta, and not Whitehall, would gain the benefit of the discounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">When National learned that Barletta had never informed Whitehall of the additional discounts, National commenced an action against Barletta in the United States District Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>the District of Massachusetts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case was tried without a jury and the ultimate determination was adverse to Barletta. Barletta did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">When Whitehall learned of Barietta\u2019s concealment of the discounts, Barletta explained that it had intended to pass the discounts along to Whitehall upon written confirmation of the contract with National, as a \u201csurprise.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In July, 1979, Whitehall rescinded the contract with Barletta. Whitehall then commenced this action by filing a complaint against Barletta seeking damages resulting from Barietta\u2019s allegedly unfair and deceptive business practices under G. L. c. 93A (1986 ed.). The complaint also alleged deceit, breach of fiduciary duty, and two counts alleging breach of contract. Barletta\u2019s counterclaim sought damages from Whitehall allegedly due under the contract between the parties.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Barletta\u2019s counterclaim was tried to a jury; the jury acted in advisory capacity with regard to Whitehall\u2019s c. 93A claim. By a pretrial motion Whitehall attempted to preclude Barletta from relitigating facts determined adversely to it in the Federal court litigation, but the motion judge refused to apply collateral estoppel principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The jury returned an \u201cadvisory verdict\u201d against Whitehall on its c. 93 A claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge adopted the jury\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>and entered judgment consistent with it. Whitehall then filed a motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment, objecting to the judge\u2019s acceptance of the jury\u2019s advisory verdict on Whitehall\u2019s c. 93A claim. The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The judge, instructing on the issue of Barietta\u2019s counterclaim, charged that, even if Barietta breached the contract, Whitehall was required first to obtain an architect\u2019s certificate from the project architect stating that sufficient cause existed to justify termination. Whitehall objected to the instruction. The jury also returned a verdict for Barietta on its counterclaim, but awarded no damages. Barietta moved for a new trial with respect to damages only. Whitehall moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the breach of contract issue. The judge denied both parties \u2019 motions. The parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Whitehall raises four issues on appeal: (1) whether the motion judge erred in concluding that State law and not Federal law applied in determining the preclusive effect of a prior Federal court judgment against the defendant; (2) whether the trial judge erred in denying Whitehall\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment; (3) whether the judge erred in instructing the jury that Whitehall had no right to terminate its contract with Barietta without first obtaining an architect\u2019s certificate; and finally, (4) whether the judge erred in denying Whitehall\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Barietta raises one issue on appeal: whether the judge erred in denying Barietta\u2019s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">1. <em>Collateral estoppel. </em>Before trial, Whitehall moved for an order to preclude B arietta from relitigating facts resolved by National\u2019s case against Barietta in Federal District Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Superior Court judge denied Whitehall\u2019s motion, concluding: (1) that State law, and not Federal law, should be applied to determine the preclusive effect of a prior Federal court judgment; and (2) that this court\u2019s holding in <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>346 Mass. 336, 339-340 (1963), precludes persons who are neither parties to an action nor their privies from asserting collateral estoppel \u201coffensively.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In ruling that State and not Federal law governed whether collateral estoppel applied, the judge examined the facts as required by .this court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Phoenix Inv. Counsel of Boston, Inc., </em>387 Mass. 444 (1982). In <em>Anderson, </em>we stated that, \u201cif a set of facts gives rise to a claim based on both State and Federal law, and the plaintiff brings the action in a Federal court which had \u2018pendent\u2019 jurisdiction to hear the State claim but the plaintiff declines to assert such State claim, he may not subequently assert the State ground in a State court action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. Determining that the instant facts fell outside the scope of <em>Anderson, </em>the judge concluded that the State law of collateral estoppel applied. The judge then examined Whitehall\u2019s claim for collateral estoppel in light of <em>Albernaz </em>v. <em>Fall River, supra. </em>In <em>Albernaz, </em>we concluded that, absent mutuality of estoppel, a prior judgment could not be used offensively against a defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 339-340. Accordingly, since Whitehall sought to assert the doctrine offensively, the judge denied Whitehall\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">This court\u2019s decision in <em>Fidler </em>v. <em>E.M. Parker Co., </em>394 Mass. 534 (1985), decided subsequent to the order denying Whitehall\u2019s attempt collaterally to estop Barletta from relitigating facts determined by the Federal court, definitively established that Massachusetts courts, when considering the preclusive effect of a Federal court judgment, look to Federal law to determine whether to apply collateral estoppel. <em>Id. </em>at 540-541. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s application of State law requires us to remand for reexamination of the issue in light of the Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>While <em>Albernaz, supra </em>at 339-340, announced the Massachusetts law that, absent mutuality of estoppel and technical privity, this court would rarely allow collateral estoppel to be applied to a prior judgment offensively, the Federal law is somewhat more flexible. In <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326-333 (1979), the United States Supreme Court permitted nonmutual, offensive collateral estoppel. The Court enumerated certain arguments against applying collateral estoppel offensively but noted, however, that these concerns could be cured by affording the trial judge wide discretion in deciding whether to allow its application absent mutuality of parties. <em>Id. </em>at 331. The Court stated: \u201cThe general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined an earlier action or where ... the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Included in the judge\u2019s consideration, therefore, should be whether Barletta had a full and fair opportunity to litigate and whether equitable considerations otherwise warrant precluding relitigation. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94-95 (1980); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 29 (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In remanding, we do not attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>to usurp the power of the judge and, accordingly, do not, in any way, dictate or even suggest the outcome. Because we conclude that the motion judge\u2019s error may have prejudiced Whitehall\u2019s c. 93A claim, we remand the case for reconsideration in light of our opinion. If the trial judge determines that collateral estoppel does apply, Whitehall\u2019s c. 93A claim is to be tried anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">2. <em>Denial of Whitehall\u2019s posttrial motion on the c. 93A claim. </em>Whitehall argues that it presented overwhelming evidence that Barletta engaged in \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive and unscrupulous practices in failing to disclose the discount\u201d and that the judge erred in denying its motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment. Mass. R. Civ. P. 59(e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974). <em>See Bromfield </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>400 Mass. 254, 256 (1987). Whitehall asserts that, based on such evidence, the judge should have ordered judgment in its favor on the c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Whitehall contends that the evidence supported a determination that Barletta knew of and deliberately concealed the discount and had no intention of passing the discount along to Whitehall. This evidence, Whitehall maintains, would justify a finding in Whitehall\u2019s favor. While the record reflects such evidence, it also reveals evidence supporting Barletta\u2019s position. For instance, both the judge as fact finder and the jury in their advisory capacity could have determined that Barletta had a right to keep the monies until the end of the contract. Similarly, based on the evidence presented at trial, both the judge and the jury could have determined that Barletta did not have to inform Whitehall of the discount until it had been confirmed in writing. This evidence tended to negate the allegation and ultimately could have led to the conclusion that no unfair and deceptive practices had occurred. Conflicting evidence often exists at trial and judges and juries are in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Hurley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>Noone, </em>347 Mass. 182, 188 (1964). Based on the record before the judge, we cannot say that it was error to deny the motion and, therefore, the judge\u2019s decision should be left undisturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Whitehall next avers that the judge incorrectly relied on the jury\u2019s advisory verdict in reaching her decision on the c. 93A claim. We disagree. Not only was there ample evidence to support the judge\u2019s decision, it is clear from the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury that she understood that the jury\u2019s role was an advisory one only and that she was not bound by any determination reached by the jury.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">3. <em>The architect\u2019s certificate. </em>Whitehall asserts that the judge erred by instructing the jury on Barletta\u2019s counterclaim that, \u201cin order for Whitehall Company to properly terminate the contract, it was first required to obtain a certification from the project architect that sufficient cause existed to justify such termination.\u201d We need not reach this issue. Even if the instruction was erroneous, Whitehall was not prejudiced, since the jury awarded Barletta no damages. Accordingly, we decline to consider the correctness of the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">4. <em>Denial of Whitehall\u2019s posttrial motions on Barletta\u2019s counterclaim. </em>The final issue raised by Whitehall on appeal is whether the trial judge committed error in denying its motion for a directed verdict and its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Barletta\u2019s counterclaim. The standard of review to be employed on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a directed verdict is the same, <em>Toubiana </em>v. <em>Priestly, </em>402 Mass. 84, 85 (1988), that is, whether anywhere, from what ever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party on each element of his claim. <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. 593, 596 (1988). In reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the trial court, <em>Afienko </em>v. <em>Harvard Club, </em>365 Mass. 320, 322 (1974), we conclude that the trial judge\u2019s denial of Whitehall\u2019s motions was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Notwithstanding the instruction regarding the architect\u2019s certificate, there is ample evidence on the record to support the trial judge\u2019s denial of Whitehall\u2019s motions. For instance, the jury could have believed, based on the evidence presented at trial, that Whitehall repudiated the contract by its July, 1979, letter to Barletta. The jury could have determined based on the evidence presented at trial that Barletta did not wrongfully withhold monies under the contract and, therefore, Whitehall\u2019s actions did constitute a breach of contract. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial judge did not err in denying Whitehall\u2019s motions on Barietta\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">5. <em>Denial of Barletta\u2019s posttrial motion on its counterclaim. </em>In its consideration of B arietta\u2019s counterclaim against Whitehall for breach of contract, the jury found for Barletta, but awarded no damages. The judge denied Barietta\u2019s motion for a new trial on the issu\u00e9 of damages. Barletta now appeals the judge\u2019s denial of its motion for a new trial on damages alone. Ordering a new trial limited to damages is discretionary with the court, <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Keeler, </em>322 Mass. 114, 124 (1947), and is reversible on appeal only if the denial constituted an abuse of the judge\u2019s discretion, <em>Brogna </em>v. <em>Pioneer Petroleum Co., </em>344 Mass. 382, 385 (1962). A new trial on damages should be granted only where there is great disproportion between the amount of the award and the injury proved. The jury properly could have determined that, based on the evidence presented at trial, Barletta was not entitled to damages. The judge did not abuse her discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">6. <em>Conclusion. </em>On Whitehall\u2019s claim under c. 93A, we remand for action consistent with this opinion on the issue of collateral estoppel. The order denying Whitehall\u2019s motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, to alter or amend the judgment is affirmed. The order denying Barletta\u2019s motion for a new trial on the issue of damages and Whitehall\u2019s motions for a directed verdict and judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the breach of contract counterclaim is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-10\"> Whitehall\u2019s complaint describes this \u201ccost-plus\u201d basis contract as one wherein Whitehall would pay Barletta\u2019s actual costs in constructing the building, plus an agreed profit or fee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> Apparently, Barletta had induced National to give it the additional discounts in order to compete successfully for the contract and Barletta assured National that all discounts would be passed on to Whitehall. Indeed, Article 26 of the contract between Barletta and Whitehall provided that all trade discounts, rebates, and refunds would accrue to Whitehall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> In the Federal action, the trial judge specifically found that Barletta did not intend to pass the discounts along, but intended to keep for itself the difference between the price it quoted Whitehall and the discounted price at which it bought the prefabricated steel for the structure from National.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> Whitehall eventually waived all but the c. 93A claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\"> The judge instructed the jury: \u201cOn 93A aspect, which you have heard my charge about, and that has to do with Whitehall vs. J.
