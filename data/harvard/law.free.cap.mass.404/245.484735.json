L. c. 123, \u00a7 12 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff asserts claims for violation of her civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>rights under G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 111, for false imprisonment, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. A medical malpractice tribunal, convened under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B (1986 ed.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> found that the evidence the plaintiff presented was not sufficient to raise a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry. The plaintiff did not post a bond, and now appeals from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment of dismissal. We transferred the case here on our own motion, and conclude that it was error to refer the complaint to the tribunal, and to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The plaintiff alleges in her complaint that in November, 1984, she went to the emergency room at the Franklin Medical Center to consult with her therapist and the psychiatric staff concerning the possibility of a short voluntary admission to the center\u2019s psychiatric facility. She was interviewed by a staff social worker. The plaintiff later was informed that she was to be involuntarily committed to the Northampton State Hospital for up to ten days. The plaintiff was strapped in a stretcher, placed in an ambulance, and transported to the Northampton State Hospital. Approximately an hour after her arrival, the plaintiff was taken from the hospital to the emergency services facility at the Franklin/Hampshire Community Mental Health Center in Northampton. She was kept overnight at this facility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>and slept on a sofa in the office area. The next morning, the plaintiff was informed that her confinement had been a \u201cmistake,\u201d and that she was free to leave. It is undisputed that Dr. Stevens, who signed the order to hospitalize the plaintiff at Northampton State Hospital, failed to examine the plaintiff. It is also undisputed that the plaintiff never refused to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">After filing an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the defendants moved to strike the ad damnum clauses of the complaint and to refer the matter to a medical malpractice tribunal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. These motions were allowed, and a single justice of the Appeals Court denied the plaintiff\u2019s petition for interlocutory review of these decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">At the hearing before the medical malpractice tribunal, the plaintiff asserted that by committing her involuntarily without following the requirements of the civil commitment statute, Dr. Stevens violated her civil rights, falsely imprisoned her, and inflicted emotional distress. She based her claim against Dr. Bloomberg on an allegation that he established a policy that psychiatrists should examine a patient only at the patient\u2019s request. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence consisted solely of a report summary from the associate area director of the Department of Mental Health concerning an investigation, conducted pursuant to 104 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 24.00 (1986), into the circumstances surrounding her confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that her complaint should not have been referred to a medical malpractice tribunal and that, even if referral was proper, the proof she proffered was sufficient to raise a legitimate question appropriate for judicial inquiry. We agree that it was error to convene the tribunal, and therefore do not address the sufficiency of the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The function of a medical malpractice tribunal is to separate \u201cmalpractice claims into two groups: (1) those appropriate for judicial evaluation; and (2) those involving merely an unfortunate medical result.\u201d <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Nurses Assoc., </em>403 Mass. 754, 756 (1989). <em>Salem Orthopedic Surgeons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>377 Mass. 514, 521 (1979). We have discerned a strong legislative intent that the tribunal \u201cshould <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>evaluate only the medical aspects of a malpractice claim\u201d in performing this function. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 521. The tribunal procedure, therefore, is appropriate only where there is an \u201cissue of <em>medical </em>\u2018malpractice, error or mistake\u2019 \u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 577 (1978), quoting G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. <em>See McMahon </em>v. <em>Glixman, </em>379 Mass. 60, 67-68 (1979) (whether statute of limitations barred patient\u2019s claim not within jurisdiction of tribunal); <em>Quinn, supra </em>(whether doctor and patient entered into express contract beyond competence of tribunal).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">Here, the plaintiff does not claim the defendants were negligent or mistaken in terms of their medical judgment or treatment. Instead, she claims that she was harmed by the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the civil commitment statute. Sectian 12 (a) of c. 123 requires a physician to examine a patient before ordering hospitalization. A physician is excused from this requirement only if the case is an emergency, and the patient refuses to be examined. The defendant Dr. Stevens did not examine the patient before ordering her hospitalized. Even if her failure to examine was justified by the \u201cemergency nature of the case,\u201d it is undisputed that there was no \u201crefusal of the [plaintiff] to consent to such examination.\u201d G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 12. Failing to comply with the civil commitment statute was not a medical decision. Consequently, an evaluation of this decision is beyond the competence of the medical malpractice tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-24\">We conclude, therefore, that a tribunal should not have screened the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The judgment dismissing the action because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure to post a bond is to be vacated, and the case remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-28\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-19\">Chapter 123, \u00a7 12, as amended through St. 1986, c. 599, \u00a7 2, provides, in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any physician who, . . . after examining a person has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>reason to believe that failure to hospitalize such person would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness may restrain or authorize the restraint of such person and apply for the hospitalization of such person for a ten day period ....
