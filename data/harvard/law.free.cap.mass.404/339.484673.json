R. Crim. P. 34 and Mass. R. A. P. 4. In March, 1986, a Hampden County grand jury indicted the defendant, James Jones, on three counts of indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen years of age, two counts of rape of a child by force, and one count of threat to do bodily harm. The defendant allegedly sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>abused the three minor children, ages four, five, and ten, of the woman with whom he was living.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In October, 1986, the defendant filed in the Superior Court two pretrial discovery motions: (1) seeking to inspect and copy any and all records and reports concerning the alleged sexual abuse, filed by the Department of Social Services (DSS) with the district attorney\u2019s office pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B, and (2) requesting that the court conduct an in camera inspection of the DSS records pertaining to the care and protection petition brought by DSS on behalf of the alleged child victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The Superior Court judge allowed, under the explicit terms of G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 (f), the defendant\u2019s first motion seeking to inspect and copy DSS records filed pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B. This litigation concerns the defendant\u2019s second motion, requesting that the court conduct an in camera inspection of other DSS records. The defendant\u2019s motion did not state any particularized need or call the court\u2019s attention to any specific report or document which contained pertinent information. The defendant made the request, however, by stating that the record was \u201cvital to and consistent with his defense,\u201d and that being deprived of it would \u201cimpede preparation\u201d of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The judge ordered that a subpoena duces tecum be served on the DSS, requiring production of the DSS records for an in camera inspection. DSS delivered the entire case record to the court. This record details the DSS\u2019s involvement with the children. Neither the defendant nor the district attorney has examined the case record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">In April, 1987, the judge entered a memorandum and order, ruling that a conflict existed between the principles enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424 (1983), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>388 Mass. 483 (1984). The judge subsequently ordered that the defense attorney, the prosecutor, and the guardian ad litem for the children, solely as officers of the court, examine the records. The court would then entertain a motion for an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of any records the defense attorney wished to use at trial. The district attorney objected. The judge then rescinded his order, and reported the following question to the Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Court: \u201cWhere a defendant has made a request for information' (claiming it would be helpful to him) to be supplied to him from records otherwise confidential, should this be done by means of an in-camera inspection by a justice of the Superior Court or should the inspection be left to attorneys for the defendant and the Commonwealth?\u201d We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Determining whether the records can be disclosed to the defendant requires an examination of the scope of the statutory privilege for communications to social workers created in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Holyoke Hosp., </em>398 Mass. 372, 376 (1986). General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 135, prohibits a social worker, except in seven specified circumstances, from disclosing information acquired from persons consulting the social worker in a professional capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 376-377.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The issue raised by the defendant\u2019s first motion is specifically addressed by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 (f). Section 135 (f) creates an exception for information which \u201cthe social worker has acquired . . . while conducting an investigation pursuant to section fifty-one B of chapter one hundred and nineteen.\u201d General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 51B, requires that the department notify the district attorney of, and transmit a written report of, the investigation and evaluation of any child abuse or neglect case resulting in the death, sexual assault, brain damage, sexual exploitation, or serious bodily injury of a child. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B (4) (a)-(e). Sections 135 (f) and 51B, read together, allow a criminal defendant to obtain the investigation and evaluation reports which ultimately led to his indictment and criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The defendant in this case seeks further information, specifically \u201cthe records of the Care and Protection of the ... Children currently in the custody of the Department of Social Services.\u201d The defendant does not, and could not, successfully, argue that these records fall within any of the seven exceptions in G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135, which prohibits disclosure of such confidential information. Instead, the defendant argues that his right to a fair trial, as mandated by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, requires that he have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>access to all exculpatory material. The defendant does not raise, and we do not address, the cognate provisions of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or what the result would be under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In enacting \u00a7 135, the Legislature recognized that maintaining the confidentiality of communications acquired by a social worker is necessary for successful social work intervention. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Holyoke Hosp., </em>398 Mass. 372, 377 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, </em>387 Mass. 424, 428 (1982). The statutory exceptions to the social worker privilege reflect the legislative goals of protecting confidential relationships as well as protecting the well-being of children. <em>Petition of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>397 Mass. 659, 662 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, supra </em>at 434. \u201cChild abuse is one of the most difficult crimes to detect and prosecute,.in large part because there often are no witnesses except the victim. ... It therefore is essential that the child have a state-designated person to whom he [or she] may turn, and to do so with the assurance of confidentiality. Relatives and neighbors who suspect abuse also will be more willing to come forward if they know that their identities will be protected.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 60 (1987). We have, accordingly, carefully construed the scope of the privilege and its exceptions. See, e.g., <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Holyoke Hosp., supra </em>at 375-382 (stating that G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135, protects the confidentiality of communications to DSS workers by a child\u2019s grandparents and foster parents); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collett, supra </em>at 438 (concluding that a judge should conduct an in camera review to determine whether information falls within the G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 <em>[b], </em>exception for information which reveals the contemplation or commission of a crime or harmful act).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 135, does not establish an absolute privilege against disclosure. Contrast G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J (stating that confidential communications between a sexual assault counsellor and sexual assault victim \u201cshall not be subject to discovery and shall be inadmissible in any criminal or civil proceeding without the prior written consent of the victim\u201d);</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20A (stating that a member of the clergy \u201cshall not, without the consent of the person making the confession, be allowed to disclose a confession\u201d). Nor does \u00a7 135 create an explicit exception that allows release of confidential records to a court issuing a court order. Section 135, therefore, neither creates an absolute privilege, nor establishes guidelines for the release of confidential records to a court or to a defendant requesting information from the records. The statute does in general, however, prohibit disclosure of information given to social workers in their professional capacity. A judge, therefore, should tread very carefully, and should not lightly intrude upon the confidentiality of such records.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant was entitled to know whether a State agency\u2019s confidential and privileged files contained exculpatory evidence, but that Ritchie\u2019s interest in a fair trial would be adequately served by an in camera review by the trial judge. <em>Ritchie, supra </em>at 61. The Court\u2019s holding that Ritchie was constitutionally entitled to an in camera review was grounded at least in part on the well settled principle that \u201cthe government has the obligation to turn over evidence in its possession that is both favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97 (1976); <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Ritchie\u2019s assertion that the Pennsylvania agency\u2019s file might contain the names of favorable witnesses and other unspecified exculpatory evidence went no further than to demonstrate a realistic and substantial possibility that the file contained information helpful to his defense. That was enough, the Supreme Court ruled, to entitle him to an in camera inspection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>think it is clear that the defendant in the case before us made at least a similar showing. We conclude that <em>Ritchie </em>requires, in this case, an in camera inspection of the records by the judge for the purpose of determining whether the records contain information material to the defense. In recognition of the Legislature\u2019s determination that these are confidential records, and in recognition of the important reasons for confidentiality in such matters, we conclude that counsel should not at this stage be permitted to examine the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The defendant quotes language from <em>Commonwealth v. Liebman, </em>where we stated that we thought it was inappropriate for a judge to assume the role of counsel by trying to decide if a grand jury transcript benefits the defendant\u2019s case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Liebman, 388 Mass. 483, 489 (1983), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>365 Mass. 99, 105 (1974). <em>Liebman </em>is, however, inapplicable to this case because it did not concern a statutorily created testimonial privilege. Chapter 112, \u00a7 135, imposes the duty of confidentiality on a social worker and the DSS, and thus imposes a duty on a judge to discern the confidential nature of a particular communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">We answer the judge\u2019s question by stating that the judge should examine the DSS records in camera, and should make available for inspection by counsel, such parts of the records, if any, that the judge determines are material to the defendant\u2019s defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> We emphasize that the circumstances of this case are not exactly like the circumstances of <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>in which the State statute explicitly allowed disclosure of a protective service agency\u2019s report to a \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a court order.\u201d Nor is this case exactly like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261 (1986), in which the statutory prohibition against disclosure of the privileged information was absolute. The Supreme Court has determined that the intensity of the State\u2019s interest in nondisclosure is significant in testing the overriding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>force of a defendant\u2019s due process claim of a right to access. <em>Ritchie, supra. </em>In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Ritchie, </em>we believe that, in the somewhat different circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court would order an in camera inspection of the DSS records by the judge to determine whether they contain any exculpatory information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The parties state that, according to the practice in the Superior Court in Hampden County, if a trial judge determines on in camera inspection of DSS records that portions may be exculpatory to the defendant, an order of notice is issued to DSS ordering it to show cause why such portions should not be made available to both the prosecutor and the defendant. The judge then conducts a hearing to determine whether the confidentiality of the records is overridden by the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. This affords the DSS its first opportunity to be heard in any given case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aur\">(dissenting, with whom Nolan, J., joins). I would permit inspection by the defense attorney under controlled circumstances (such as contained in the judge\u2019s first order), followed by an in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of any records the defense attorney wished to use at trial. I agree with the court that this result is not mandated by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, </em>388 Mass. 483 (1983). However, <em>Liebman </em>does provide us with a beacon that illuminates the course to be followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At the outset, my analysis differs significantly from that of the court. This case is not about the extent of the privilege of confidentiality created by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135. The court correctly points out that \u00a7 135 \u201cneither creates an absolute privilege, nor establishes guidelines for the release of confidential records to a court or to a defendant requesting information from the records.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 343. The court concedes that a defendant is entitled to know whether a State agency\u2019s confidential records contain exculpatory evidence. What this case is about, therefore, is the method of ascertaining whether circumstances exist that rfequire disclosure. Someone must examine the records to make that determination. At this point, I return to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Liebman, supra </em>at 489: \u201c[W]hen a judge undertakes to decide if [evidence] benefits the defendant\u2019s case he is \u2018assuming vicariously and uncomfortably the role of counsel.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>365 Mass. 99, 105 (1974). We think it inappropriate for a judge to assume that role.\u201d If one concedes, as does the court, that there is nothing in the statute that prevents the judge from examining the records to determine if they should be made available to the defendant, then it follows inexorably that there is nothing in the statute that prevents the judge\u2019s designee (defendant\u2019s counsel) from making the inspection. An examination of the records in this manner creates a reasonable opportunity for the defendant to ask the judge, in camera, that some information in the records be made available at trial. It is a necessary reading of the statute that permits a judge to examine the records. Nowhere is a judge explicitly or impliedly prevented from delegating that task to the person most able to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>it, the defendant\u2019s attorney, while retaining his own traditional neutral role. It would be appropriate under such circumstances for the judge to bar the further disclosure to anyone, including the defendant, of the information in the records absent an order of the court. I do not base my view on the requirements of the Federal or State Constitution, but rather on what is fair and in recognition of the traditional roles of judge and attorney.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
