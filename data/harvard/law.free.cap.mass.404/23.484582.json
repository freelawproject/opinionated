G. L. c. 150E (1986 ed.). We agree, and we reverse the judgment entered in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We summarize the facts. Johnston was employed by the school committee as a custodian, working the \u201clate night shift\u201d from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. He was a member of the Custodians Local 540 of the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO (Local 540), which had entered into a labor agreement with the school committee, as the sole and exclusive agent for collective bargaining. At some point during his employment, Johnston asserted to Local 540 that, under the agreement, the school committee was required to give him overtime pay for his Saturday morning hours, from midnight until 7 a.m. The agreement provides, in art. X, \u00a7 B: \u201cThe work week shall be from Monday through Friday inclusive.\u201d In a different section (\u00a7 F [4]), it provides: \u201cOvertime is defined as any work in excess of the regular work day and work week as specified in Article X, Section A and B.\u201d Local 540 determined that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not meritorious. Thus, it refused to represent Johnston in pursuit of his claim. The agreement specifically provides that \u201c[njothing herein contained will be construed as limiting the right of any employee having a grievance . . . [from] having the grievance adjusted without [the] intervention of Local 540 . . . .\u201d Johnston admits that he did not fully comply with the agreement\u2019s four-step grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The trial judge ruled that Local 540 was obligated to pursue Johnston\u2019s grievance and that it wrongfully refused to do so. The judge also held, in purported reliance on our recent decision in <em>Leahy </em>v. <em>Local 1526, Am. Fed\u2019n of State, County, &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>399 Mass. 341 (1987), that Local 540\u2019s refusal enabled Johnston to bring an action against his employer notwithstanding his failure to comply with the contractual grievance procedure. The judge ruled further that Local 540\u2019s actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>enabled Johnston to pursue his claim in court rather than before the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">1. <em>The grievance procedure. </em>Even if we were to assume that Local 540 failed to fulfil its duty of fair representation by refusing to pursue Johnston\u2019s grievance, Johnston had the right, clearly expressed in the agreement, to pursue the grievance independent of Local 540. \u201c[An employee] may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by a person of his own choosing. When an employee is not represented by Local 540, Local 540 shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.\u201d See G. L. c. 150E, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">This case falls under the general rule that failure to pursue contractual grievance procedures bars suit against the employer. \u201cEmployees may not simply disregard the grievance procedures set out in a collective labor contract and go direct to court for redress against the employer. . . . They must initiate the grievance procedures as the contract provides and it is only when the union fails in its duty to represent them fairly in pressing the grievance . . . that the employees are free to try judicial remedies.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Balsavich </em>v. <em>Local Union 170, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>371 Mass. 283, 286 (1976). See <em>Azzi </em>v. <em>Western Elec. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 410 (1985) (\u201cTo permit employees to circumvent existing grievance and arbitration procedures, by bringing actions against their employers in the first instance, does not strike us as a commendable practice\u201d). See also <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 185 (1967) (under National Labor Relations Act, employee may seek judicial enforcement of contract rights if union wrongfully refused to process grievance <em>and </em>if \u201cunion has <em>sole </em>power under the contract to invoke the higher stages of the grievance procedure\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Leahy, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>in no way alters this result. That case involved an employee\u2019s suit against his union, and his employer was not a party to that action. <em>Id. </em>at 343. Additionally, in <em>Leahy </em>the union conceded that it was at fault in not pressing the employee\u2019s grievance. <em>Id. </em>at 350. Here, the union, not a party, had made no such concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">2. <em>Administrative remedies. Leahy, supra, </em>is relevant, however, to the judge\u2019s holding that Local 540\u2019s alleged breach of its duty of fair representation enabled Johnston to seek relief in court rather than before the commission. In <em>Leahy, supra </em>at 347, we stated: \u201cIn most cases concerning the duty of fair representation, we agree that the dispute should be presented in the first instance to the commission. General Laws c. 150E [1986 ed.] creates a scheme in which the commission is granted broad powers to resolve labor disputes, including those <em>over the duty of fair </em>representation\u201d (emphasis supplied). We address this issue to determine whether this case should be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings or should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In <em>Leahy, </em>we held that, while disputes of this kind usually should be initiated before the commission, the trial court did not lack jurisdiction notwithstanding the broad authority and discretion vested in the commission to deal with labor disputes. <em>Leahy, supra </em>at 346.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For three reasons we held that the general rule as to the commission\u2019s primary jurisdiction should not apply to the plaintiff employee. First, unlike here, in <em>Leahy </em>there was no genuine issue as to any material fact concerning the union\u2019s liability. <em>Id. </em>at 350. Second, in the absence of disputed facts the commission\u2019s expertise was not required. <em>Id. </em>Finally, in <em>Leahy, </em>the employee reasonably relied on prec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>edent indicating that courts had concurrent jurisdiction with the commission over cases concerning the duty of fair representation. <em>Id. </em>at 351. The case before us is readily distinguishable. Whether Johnston seeks to continue this action against his employer, or whether he initiates an action against Local 540 for alleged breach of duty of fair representation, there are genuine issues of material fact that require the commission\u2019s expertise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>397 Mass. 49, 53 (1986). Furthermore, Johnston cites no precedent on which he could have relied reasonably in failing to pursue his contractual remedies. Thus, this is an inappropriate case for the courts to assert their jurisdiction before the commission has had the opportunity to address the issues. The judgment of the Superior Court is therefore reversed, with the direction to enter a judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-16\"> Judgment was entered for the plaintiff on July 20, 1987, in the amount of $4,187.75, plus interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-6\"> In oral argument before this court, Johnston\u2019s appellate counsel asserted that Local 540 had prevented Johnston from exhausting his contractual remedies by failing to inform Johnston what they were. The record belies the assertion that Johnston was uninformed of his contractual remedies. Shortly after Local 540 refused to represent Johnston, the town of Watertown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>informed him, through his then counsel, \u201cPlease be advised that the collective bargaining agreement . . . contains a specific grievance procedure .... [We] would recommend . . . that your client file his grievance in accordance with the contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b40-8\"> See <em>Leahy, supra </em>at 346-347, where we discussed the differences between the doctrines of primary jurisdiction and exhaustion of administrative remedies. See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Admin., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-6\"> The agreement\u2019s provisions regarding overtime payment are by no means clear. For example, the agreement defines overtime as \u201cwork in excess of the regular work day <em>and </em>work week\u201d (emphasis added). There is an issue whether the word \u201cand\u201d is conjunctive or disjunctive. Furthermore, the same section in which this definition appears, entitled \u201cOvertime Rate,\u201d states that employees working the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift \u201cshall receive an extra ten percent.\u201d The plaintiff had received the additional 10%. There is an issue whether this provision for an \u201covertime rate\u201d is to the exclusion of any other overtime pay for the regular hours of the late night shift. Finally, on the issue of the alleged wrongful refusal to represent Johnston, it is relevant that Local 540 refused to pursue Johnston\u2019s grievance in part because it had followed an opposite interpretation of the agreement for the past ten years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
