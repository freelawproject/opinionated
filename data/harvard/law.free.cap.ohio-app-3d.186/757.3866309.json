Within an hour of talking with Tomasiak, Tomasiak discharged Sutton from his employment as an at-will employee. Tomasiak gave Sutton no affirmative reason for discharging him, but he did tell Sutton that it was not because of his work ethic or job performance or because Sutton had violated any work rule or company policy. Following his discharge, Sutton filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, ultimately receiving them. On July 1, 2008, Sutton sent a letter to Torneo telling it of his intent to file a claim under R.C. 4123.90, which prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee for filing a claim or initiating proceedings under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">{\u00b6 2} On September 18, 2008, Sutton filed a complaint against Torneo alleging that Torneo discharged him in order to avoid Sutton\u2019s being considered its employee when he filed for workers\u2019 compensation so as to prevent potential higher workers\u2019 compensation premiums. In his complaint, Sutton asserted two claims for relief. The first is a statutory claim for unlawful retaliation against Sutton under R.C. 4123.90 for initiating or pursuing workers\u2019 compensation benefits. And the second is a tort claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">{\u00b6 3} Torneo filed on December 9, 2008, a motion under Civ.R. 12(C) for judgment on the pleadings. It claimed that Sutton had not alleged facts that if true would entitle him to relief based on either claim. The trial court agreed and on April 15, 2009, sustained Tomco\u2019s motion. Sutton filed a timely notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>appeal, and he now presents two assignments of error, one for each claim in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that <em>Bickers </em>precluded appellant from pursuing a public policy wrongful discharge claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">{\u00b6 5} Before exploring the issue raised here, we must explain the standard we will use to review the trial court\u2019s decision to sustain Tomco\u2019s Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. When the nonmoving party can prove a set of facts entitling him to his requested relief under the law, a trial court ought not grant a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings. We will review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>Pinkerton v. Thompson, </em>174 Ohio App.3d 229, 2007-Ohio-6546, 881 N.E.2d 880, at \u00b6 18, citing <em>Hunt v. Marksman Prod. </em>(1995), 101 Ohio App.3d 760, 762, 656 N.E.2d 726. And we will accept as true the alleged material facts in Sutton\u2019s complaint and all reasonable inferences drawn from them. Id., citing <em>Gawloski v. Miller Brewing Co. </em>(1994), 96 Ohio App.3d 160, 163, 644 N.E.2d 731. We will reverse the trial court\u2019s decision if we conclude that the law permits Sutton to bring the claim and he has alleged facts that, when the law is applied, entitle him to the relief he seeks. See <em>State ex rel. Hanson v. Guernsey Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 545, 548, 605 N.E.2d 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 6} The issue raised by Sutton in the first assignment of error is one of first impression: when an employee suffers a work-related injury, tells his employer of the injury, and is discharged before having had an opportunity to file a claim or institute or pursue proceedings under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, does the law allow the former employee to bring a common-law claim against his former employer for wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy underlying R.C. 4123.90? We conclude that a narrow exception to the employment at-will doctrine exists in this situation, allowing such a plaintiff to bring the tort claim, because such a discharge would undermine the General Assembly\u2019s effort to proscribe retaliatory discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 7} Tomco argues first that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bickers v. W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201, bars Sutton\u2019s common-law claim, and it argues second that even if it does not, the law does not allow such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 8} Under the employment at-will doctrine in Ohio the law generally does not provide relief to at-will employees who are discharged without good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>cause. However, in <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, the Ohio Supreme Court carved out an exception for discharges based on reasons inimical to public policy. Employees discharged for such reasons may bring a common-law claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. A plaintiff must establish a prima facie claim based on the four elements, adopted by the court in <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 69-70, 652 N.E.2d 653, that constitute the tort of wrongful discharge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c1. That a clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the <em>clarity </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c2. That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the <em>jeopardy </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c3. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the <em>causation </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c4. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the <em>overriding justification </em>element).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">{\u00b6 13} The first two elements are questions of law to be decided by the court, and the last two are questions of fact, decided by the fact-finder. See <em>Collins </em>at 70, 652 N.E.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">{\u00b6 14} The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act proscribes retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim in R.C. 4123.90, which provides, \u201cNo employer shall discharge, demote, reassign, or take any punitive action against any employee because the employee filed a claim or instituted, pursued or testified in any proceedings under the workers\u2019 compensation act.\u201d Sutton cannot claim that Torneo violated this section by discharging him, because Sutton had not yet filed a claim or instituted proceedings before Torneo discharged him. After reviewing Ohio law on the legality of a common-law claim under this section, we note that a plaintiff was permitted to bring such a claim under this section for discharge in retaliation for his wife\u2019s pursuit of workers\u2019 compensation on her own behalf. See <em>Collins v. U.S. Playing Card Co. </em>(S.D.Ohio, 2006), 466 F.Supp.2d 954. The <em>Collins </em>court noted that although the Ohio Supreme Court had not decided the question, several Ohio appellate courts that had considered the issue recognized a common-law claim for wrongful discharge based on this statute. Id. at 974 (citing six Ohio appellate-court cases). The court cited one contrary decision. Id. at 974. It also found that several Ohio district courts have analyzed Ohio law and concluded that such a common-law claim exists. Id. (citing four federal-district-court cases). It did find an unpublished Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>to the contrary, but the court noted that such unpublished opinions are not binding upon it. Id. at 974-975.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">{\u00b6 15} The question is whether in the circumstances of this case, Sutton may bring a common-law claim against Torneo for violating the public policy that underlies R.C. 4123.90. Because the Ohio Supreme Court has not decided this question, to find the answer, we must examine each of the four elements of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">\n<em>The clarity element</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 16} The first element requires a manifest public policy. R.C. 4123.90 manifests a clear public policy against allowing an employer to discharge an employee solely in retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. This public policy is also expressed in <em>Coolidge v. Riverdale Local School Dist., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 141, 2003-Ohio-5357, 797 N.E.2d 61. The court explained there that \u201c[t]he recognition of a public-policy exception for wrongful discharge in retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, <em>whether derived from statutory or common law, </em>is built on the premise that inability to challenge retaliatory discharges would undermine the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statute by forcing the employee to choose between applying for the benefits to which he is entitled and losing his job.\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">\n<em>The jeopardy element</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 17} The second element requires that the circumstances of the discharge jeopardize this public policy. Under the jeopardy element, we must determine whether the absence of a public-policy claim \u201cwould seriously compromise the Act\u2019s statutory objectives.\u201d <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 240, 2002-Ohio-3994, 773 N.E.2d 526, at \u00b6 14 (referring to the Family Medical Leave Act). Permitting an employer to dismiss an employee before the latter has an opportunity to obtain the protections of R.C. 4123.90 would seriously compromise the act\u2019s statutory objectives by giving employers a perverse incentive to discharge the injured employee before he had the opportunity to trigger the protection of R.C. 4123.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">{\u00b6 18} We must also \u201cinquir[e] into the existence of any alternative means of promoting the particular public policy to be vindicated by a common-law wrongful-discharge claim.\u201d <em>Wiles </em>at \u00b6 15. Because the sole source of the public policy here is R.C. 4123.90, which provides the substantive right and remedies for its breach, we must examine the adequacy of the remedies available. See <em>Wiles v. Medina Auto Parts </em>at \u00b6 15 (\u201cWhere * * * the sole source of the public policy opposing the discharge is a statute that provides the substantive rights <em>and </em>remedies for its breach, the issue of adequacy of remedies becomes a particularly important component of the jeopardy analysis\u201d); see also <em>Bickers, </em>116 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201, at \u00b6 42 (Moyers, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cpublic policy is jeopardized only when there are no alternative means of enforcing the public policy or, if a particular statute applies, the remedies therein are inadequate\u201d). We find that an employee discharged under the circumstances in which Sutton was discharged has no remedy. No statutory remedy, therefore, adequately protects society\u2019s interests. See <em>Wiles </em>at \u00b6 15 (\u201cSimply put, there is no need to recognize a common-law action for wrongful discharge if there already exists a statutory remedy that adequately protects society\u2019s interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">{\u00b6 19} The inability to bring a tort claim would frustrate the legislative intent of R.C. 4123.90 to proscribe retaliatory discharges. As we point out in our review of the second assignment of error, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that an injured employee need not actually file a claim in order to claim the protections of the statute. See <em>Roseborough v. N.L. Industries </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 142, 143, 10 OBR 478, 462 N.E.2d 384. In <em>Roseborough </em>the court adopted the reasoning of Justice Brown\u2019s concurrence in <em>Bryant v. Dayton Casket Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 367, 23 O.O.3d 341, 433 N.E.2d 142. There, Justice Brown expressed his concern that \u201ca requirement that an actual filing of a claim is the only means by which a proceeding can be instituted or pursued would frustrate the legislative intent as evinced in R.C. 4123.90.\u201d <em>Bryant </em>at 372, 23 O.O.3d 341, 433 N.E.2d 142 (Brown, J., concurring). \u201cIf such a requirement was mandated,\u201d he continued, \u201can employer could, upon receipt of an employee\u2019s request to complete the form prior to filing, fire the claimant and thus avoid the consequences of R.C. 4123.90. * * * [S]uch a requirement would also result in a footrace, the winner being determined by what event occurs first \u2014 the firing of the employee or the filing of the claim with the bureau.\u201d <em>Bryant </em>at 372-373, 23 O.O.3d 341, 433 N.E.2d 142 (Brown, J., concurring). He concluded, \u201cThis scenario, in light of the fact that R.C. 4123.95 provides that R.C. 4123.90 should be liberally construed in favor of the employee, should not be encouraged by a decision from this court.\u201d <em>Bryant </em>at 373, 23 O.O.3d 341, 433 N.E.2d 142 (Brown, J., concurring). The same is true here. Were a tort claim not permitted, an employer upon hearing that an employee was injured could fire the employee to avoid the consequences of R.C. 4123.90. The exact footrace that Justice Brown identified would result between the injured employee\u2019s running to file a claim or initiate proceedings and the employer\u2019s running to fire the employee. And the employer may have a head start: upon learning of the injury the employer can discharge the employee almost immediately; an employee may not have time to file a claim or initiate proceedings. The perverse incentive such a rule creates would most hurt those workers most likely to be injured and therefore most in need of the statute\u2019s protection. Those working in physically demanding jobs often have an inherently greater chance for injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>\n<em>The causation element</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">{\u00b6 20} The third element requires the dismissal to have been motivated by conduct related to that prohibited by the public policy. According to the facts alleged in Sutton\u2019s complaint, his dismissal was motivated by the nexus created by Sutton\u2019s on-the-job injury and the right of injured employees to workers\u2019 compensation. This is related to retaliatory discharge, prohibited by public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">\n<em>The overriding-justification element</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">{\u00b6 21} The fourth element requires that the employer lacked business justification for the discharge. Sutton\u2019s complaint alleges that Torneo lacked any business justification for discharging him. As this is a question of fact, we accept, as we must, the allegation in the complaint as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">\n<em>The narrow exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">{\u00b6 22} Therefore we will recognize a very narrow exception to the at-will employment doctrine similar to the one recognized in <em>Moore v. Animal Fair Pet Ctr., Inc. </em>(1995), 81 Ohio Misc.2d 46, 674 N.E.2d 1269. The exception must be narrow because, ordinarily, \u201cmerely asserting that the discharge was in violation of a statutory right is insufficient.\u201d Cavieo, Employment At Will and Public Policy (1992), 25 Akron L.Rev. 497, 514. A tort claim for wrongful discharge is \u201cpremised on protecting employees who actively pursue rights and benefits they are entitled to by virtue of statutes.\u201d Id. An employee is not compelled to exercise this right but has the option to do so. So when the injured employee delays in exercising his right, he may not avail himself of this exception. Yet where the injured employee is discharged before he has an opportunity to exercise this right, the public policy underlying R.C. 4123.90 requires courts to give him the chance to obtain relief. The court has noted that \u201c[t]he basic purpose of any antiretaliation statute is to enable employees to freely exercise their rights without fear of retribution from their employers.\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>at \u00b6 43. Were an employer permitted to discharge an employee to circumvent the antiretaliation statute, the basic purpose of the statute would be frustrated. Incorporating all four elements of the tort of wrongful discharge, we conclude that when an employee suffers a work-related injury he may bring a claim of wrongful discharge if his employer discharges him so quickly that he has no reasonable opportunity to file a claim or institute proceedings under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act when the employer lacks an overriding business justification for the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">{\u00b6 23} Here, the material allegations in Sutton\u2019s complaint satisfy the requirements of the exception. First, Sutton was discharged so quickly after being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>injured that he had no reasonable opportunity to exercise his rights under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In Sutton\u2019s complaint he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c3. On or about April 14, 2008, at approximately 7:30 a.m., Plaintiff injured his back while disassembling a chop saw. Plaintiffs injury occurred during the course and within the scope of his employment with Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c4. Plaintiff reported his injury to Jim Tomasiak * * *, Defendant\u2019s President.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c5. Within approximately one hour of reporting the injury to Tomasiak, Plaintiffs employment was terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">{\u00b6 27} Although the complaint does not state the length of time between the injury and the report to Tomasiak, we think it is reasonable to infer that the second event came on the heels of the first. Sutton plainly had no reasonable opportunity to take the first step toward obtaining compensation benefits. Second, the allegation is that Torneo discharged Sutton to avoid paying higher premiums, which we do not believe qualifies as an overriding business justification. The complaint alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">{\u00b6 28} \u201c1. Plaintiff began his employment with Defendant on or about August 22, 2005.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c6. Tomasiak did not provide Plaintiff a reason for terminating his employment; however, he stated that it was not due to Plaintiffs work ethic or job performance. Additionally, Tomasiak stated that Plaintiff did not violate any work rule or company policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-12\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c7. Defendant used immediate termination as means to preclude Plaintiffs Workers Compensation injury claim and higher Workers Compensation premiums.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-13\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-14\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c13. Defendant lacked an overriding business justification for terminating Plaintiffs employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c14. Defendant\u2019s decision to terminate Plaintiffs employment was motivated by Plaintiffs workplace injury and in order to prevent him from filing of a workers compensation [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">{\u00b6 35} Accepting these allegations as true for purposes of evaluating Tomco\u2019s Civ.R. 12(C) motion, we find that the facts alleged in Sutton\u2019s complaint, if true, entitle him to his requested relief, meaning that the trial court erred in sustaining Tomco\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Torneo argues that the trial court correctly concluded that in <em>Bickers v. W. </em>&amp; <em>S. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201, the court barred all common-law tort claims of wrongful discharge under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We disagree. We find that Bickers\u2019s holding does not encompass Sutton\u2019s claim, because the policy at issue there differs from the one here.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">{\u00b6 37} Unlike Sutton, the plaintiff in <em>Bickers </em>was discharged for nonretaliatory reasons while she was receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits. She was injured in 1994 and filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation soon after. Because of the injury, she was unable to work for stretches of time. The employer did not discharge her until 2002, a decision based primarily on Bickers\u2019s inability to do her job effectively. The issue in <em>Bickers </em>was \u201cwhether the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy applies to a nonretaliatory discharge of an injured worker receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>Bickers </em>at 111. The court held that \u201c[a]n employee who is terminated from employment while receiving workers\u2019 compensation has no common-law cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of the public policy underlying R.C. 4123.90, which provides the exclusive remedy for employees claiming termination in violation of rights conferred by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id. at the syllabus. Sutton\u2019s claim falls outside this holding. Sutton was not discharged by Torneo \u201cwhile receiving\u201d compensation benefits. Nor had Sutton filed a claim before he was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Bickers, </em>the court barred only common-law tort claims of wrongful discharge when the discharge is for reasons that are not retaliatory. The discharge of an employee while the employee is receiving compensation benefits, like the plaintiff in <em>Bickers, </em>is not prohibited, because it is not retaliatory. The policy choice in <em>Bickers </em>is \u201cbetween permitting and prohibiting the discharge from employment of an employee who has been injured at work.\u201d <em>Bickers </em>at \u00b6 20. Deny employers the ability to discharge injured workers by requiring them to hold open such workers\u2019 jobs indefinitely and \u201cemployers will be burdened with employees unable to perform the work for which they were hired and an inability to obtain permanent replacements.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21. But permit employers to terminate workers who are injured and cannot work as a result and \u201cworker[s] suffer[ ] not only the burden of being injured but also the burden of unemployment at a time when seeking a new position is made more difficult by the injury.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. <em>The choice </em>of the General Assembly, reflected in R.C. 4123.90, was \u201cto proscribe retaliatory discharges only.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23. Deferring to the General Assembly\u2019s choice, the court said that \u201c[i]t is within the prerogative and authority of the General Assembly to make <em>this choice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. \u201cWe,\u201d the court continued, \u201cmay not override <em>this choice </em>and superimpose a common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>law, public policy tort remedy on this wholly statutory system.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. Also, \u201cit would be inappropriate for the judiciary to * * * supplant <em>the policy choice </em>of the legislature.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 24. Finally, said the court, \u201cthe imposition of common-law principles of wrongful discharge into the workers\u2019 compensation arena runs counter to the balance of mutual compromise between the interests of the employer and the employee as [the balance represented by <em>this choice </em>is] expressed by the General Assembly within the Act.\u201d Id. \u201cBickers\u2019s remedy,\u201d concluded the court, \u201cmust be found within the workers\u2019 compensation statutes.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">{\u00b6 39} The General Assembly\u2019s <em>policy choice </em>discussed by the court in <em>Bickers </em>is not the policy choice raised here. Torneo is entirely correct when it says that the public policy embodied by R.C. 4123.90 does not extend beyond the language of the statute. This is why the court barred common-law claims for wrongful discharge under this statute when the plaintiff was discharged \u201cwhile receiving workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Such a plaintiff undoubtedly filed a claim but was not \u201cdischarged for retaliatory reasons.\u201d A discharge in these circumstances does not jeopardize the public policy of the statute, which proscribes only retaliatory discharges. Conversely, a discharge under the circumstances of this case does directly threaten this public policy by allowing an employer to prevent an employee from obtaining protection against retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">{\u00b6 40} To be sure, we do not mean to suggest that Sutton will or should prevail on his claim. Rather, we conclude only that neither <em>Bickers </em>nor other law bars Sutton from bringing the claim. However, \u201c[i]n order to prevail on his claim, [Sutton] must carry his burden to prove the remaining elements of a wrongful-discharge claim.\u201d <em>Dohme v. Eurand Am., Inc., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 593, 2007-Ohio-865, 868 N.E.2d 701, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">{\u00b6 41} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe trial court erred in finding that appellant\u2019s actions were insufficient to constitute the institution or pursuance of a claim under R.C. \u00a7 4123.90.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">{\u00b6 43} Here Sutton alleges that the trial court erred by finding that he may not bring a statutory claim. Sutton argues that if we conclude that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bickers </em>does bar his tort claim, as the trial court concluded, we should construe the statutory words \u201cpursued\u201d and \u201cinstituted\u201d more broadly than they were construed before <em>Bickers. </em>Sutton contends that his act of reporting the injury constituted \u201cpursuit\u201d under the statute. Without a broader understanding of these words, Sutton asserts, the intent of R.C. 4123.90 will be undermined by employers immediately discharging employees after they report an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>{\u00b6 44} In the first assignment of error we concluded that <em>Bickers </em>does not bar Sutton\u2019s tort claim. And we there addressed Sutton\u2019s concern about undermining the statute\u2019s intent. Finally, Sutton cites no authority for the contention that reporting an injury satisfies the statute, nor does he provide an argument for why reporting his injury satisfies the statute in this case. Thus, the complaint does not allege that before being discharged, Sutton took any action that could be construed as filing a claim or instituting or pursuing proceedings under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">{\u00b6 45} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">{\u00b6 46} We overruled the second assignment of error regarding Sutton\u2019s claim based on Tomco\u2019s violation of R.C. 4123.90, so we do not disturb this part of the trial court\u2019s judgment. But we sustained the first assignment of error regarding Sutton\u2019s claim for wrongful discharge, so we reverse the court\u2019s judgment regarding this claim. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b800-9\">Froelich, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b800-10\">Donovan, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-12\">.

I do not believe that we are at liberty to overrule the syllabus of a Supreme Court opinion that is on point, i.e., <em>Bickers v. W. &amp; S. Life Ins. Co., </em>116 Ohio St.3d 351, 2007-Ohio-6751, 879 N.E.2d 201. As an appellate court, we are bound by S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 1. S.Ct.R.Rep.Op. 1(B)(1) and (2) indicate: \u201c(1) The law stated in a Supreme Court opinion is contained within its syllabus (if one is provided), and its text, including footnotes\u201d; \u201c(2) If there is disharmony between the syllabus of an opinion and its text or footnotes, the syllabus controls.\u201d Nothing in the <em>Bickers </em>syllabus indicates that the rule of law contained therein applies only to nonretaliatory discharges.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">{\u00b6 48} I would agree with the trial court the claim is barred based upon the <em>Bickers </em>holding, which we are not free to modify. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
