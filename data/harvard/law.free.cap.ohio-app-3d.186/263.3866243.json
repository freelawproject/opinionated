Appellant, the state of Ohio, appeals the trial court\u2019s decision that denied the state\u2019s application to reopen an estate in order to file its claim for Medicaid reimbursement. After a review of the record and applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 2} The following facts give rise to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 3} Josephine Centorbi (\u201cdecedent\u201d) died intestate on February 12, 2007. On December 21, 2007, decedent\u2019s sister, Diane Nancy Fiorille, filed an application to relieve the estate from administration. The trial court granted the application the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">{\u00b6 4} On December 11, 2008, the state filed an application to vacate the final accounting and reopen the estate. The trial court scheduled a hearing for January 20, 2009. The state failed to appear, and the petition was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">{\u00b6 5} On January 27, 2009, the state filed a second application to vacate the order releasing assets from administration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 30, 2009, a magistrate held a hearing on the application. On April 10, 2009, the magistrate issued a decision denying the application after concluding that pursuant to R.C. 2117.061 the time for the state to file its claim against the estate had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>{\u00b6 6} On April 17, 2009, the state filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. The state maintained that the statute of limitations outlined in R.C. 2117.061 did not apply. On June 3, 2009, the trial court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">{\u00b6 7} The state appealed, asserting one assignment of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av9\">Whether the probate court magistrate committed reversible error by denying appellant\u2019s objections to magistrate\u2019s decision which denied appellant\u2019s application to vacate final accounting and reopen estate based upon its interpretation of Ohio Revised Code 2117.061.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 8} The state argues that the one-year statute of limitations to file a claim against an estate pursuant to R.C. 2117.061 did not begin to run and, in the alternative, if the time has now expired, the one-year statute of limitations does not apply. However, after a review of the applicable law, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">{\u00b6 9} The state alleges that the decedent was a Medicaid recipient. The individual responsible for an estate must, pursuant to R.C. 2117.061(B)(3), complete a Medicaid estate-recovery form within 30 days of filing an application to relieve the estate from administration. On the application, to relieve the estate from administration, the applicant must check the box that indicates that the \u201c[djecedent was 55 years of age or older at the time of death and was a recipient of medical assistance under Chapter 5111 of the Revised Code.\u201d This language may have been confusing to the decedent\u2019s sister, who filed the application without an attorney. It is undisputed that the box was not checked and that the Medicaid estate-recovery form was never completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 10} The state argues that because the form was never completed, the statute of limitations has not been triggered. However, this interpretation contradicts the clear language of the statute. \u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\u201d this court does not need to interpret the statute. <em>Symmes Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Smyth </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 549, 553, 721 N.E.2d 1057, citing <em>Meeks v. Papadopulos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 187, 190, 16 O.O.3d 212, 404 N.E.2d 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 11} The pertinent portion of R.C. 2117.061(E) in effect at the time of the decedent\u2019s death, detailing the time limitations for filing a claim against an estate, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">The administrator of the Medicaid estate recovery program shall present a claim for estate recovery to the person responsible for the estate of the decedent or the person\u2019s legal representative not later than ninety days after the date on which the Medicaid estate recovery reporting form is received under division (B) of this section or one year after the decedent\u2019s death, whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The language of R.C. 2117.061(E) is clear in its intent to impose a maximum period of one year from the decedent\u2019s death to file a claim. If the legislature had intended the completion and submission of the Medicaid estate recovery reporting form to be a prerequisite to filing a claim, the legislature would not have specifically used the language \u201cor one year after the decedent\u2019s death, whichever is later.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 13} The decedent died on February 12, 2007. The state did not file its first application to reopen the estate until December 11, 2008, nearly ten months beyond the one-year statute of limitations. The application was dismissed by the trial court. The state filed its second application to reopen the estate on January 27, 2009, nearly two years after the decedent\u2019s death, and almost a year beyond the applicable statute of limitations. Clearly, the application was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 14} The state further argues that even if the one-year statute of limitations applied, despite the Medicaid estate-recovery form not being completed, statutes of limitation are inapplicable to the state unless the statute specifically provides that the time limitation applies to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">{\u00b6 15} The state urges this court to adopt the rationale in a factually similar Ninth District case, <em>Ohio Dept. of Human Serv. v. Eastman </em>(2001), 145 Ohio App.3d 369, 763 N.E.2d 193. In Eastman, the state did not bring its claim for Medicaid reimbursement against the estate for more than a year after the decedent\u2019s death. The Eastman court analyzed R.C. 2117.06(B), a broad statute governing virtually all creditor claims against an estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 16} As the basis for its decision, Eastman relied on the well-established principle outlined in <em>Ohio Dept. of Transp. v. Sullivan </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 137, 140, 527 N.E.2d 798, which held that the generally worded statutes of limitations do not apply as a bar against the state. Sullivan emphasized the protection of government assets as the reason for this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 17} We find the state\u2019s reliance on Eastman misplaced. In Eastman, R.C. 2117.06(B) was the statute at issue and stated that \u201c[a]ll claims shall be presented within one year after the death of the decedent.\u201d The statute clearly failed to specifically limit the state\u2019s time to file a claim; therefore, pursuant to Sullivan, as a generally worded statute, it was inapplicable to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">{\u00b6 18} However, the statute at issue in the instant case is the version of R.C. 2117.061(E) in effect at the time of the decedent\u2019s death in 2007, which unlike R.C. 2117.06(B) at issue in Eastman, does not provide a general one-year time limitation; rather, it provides a one-year time limitation specifically for the \u201cadministrator of the Medicaid estate recovery program.\u201d The goal of the statutory scheme governing claims against an estate is to efficiently and expedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tiously resolve these issues. <em>Reid v. Premier Health Care Serv. </em>(Mar. 19, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17437, 1999 WL 148191. The legislature addressed this issue when it specifically imposed a one-year statute of limitations for Medicaid claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, the state\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-7\">McMonagle, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b299-8\">Gallagher, A.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-13\">. Although this application was titled slightly different from the previously filed application, the two applications were nearly identical and cited the same case law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b299-9\">Sean C. Gallagher, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AJG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">{\u00b6 20} I respectfully dissent from the majority view that R.C. 2117.061(E) clearly imposes a maximum period of one year from the date of decedent\u2019s death for the state to file a claim against the estate. The majority view would allow a representative of a decedent\u2019s estate to intentionally not fill out a Medicaid estate-recovery form, and by failing to do so, to retain an undeserved windfall upon the expiration of one year from the date of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">{\u00b6 21} It is clear that R.C. 2117.061(E) is written in the alternative. A claim must be made within 90 days from the date a completed form is received <em>or </em>within one year following decedent\u2019s death, with the deciding option being \u201cwhichever is later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">{\u00b6 22} Because a completed Medicaid estate-recovery form was never received by the state, the provision requiring a claim within one year of decedent\u2019s death resolves only half the puzzle. In order for the 90-day clock to run on the first option, the form must actually be received. Since it was not, I cannot find that the lapse of one year from the date of decedent\u2019s death alone satisfies the requirement that this option is the one that occurred later.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
