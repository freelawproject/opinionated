Upon consideration of the assignments of error, we reverse the decision of the lower court. Schmidt asserts the following assignments of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>{\u00b6 2} \u201cAPPELLANT\u2019 [sic] ARGUMENT OF ERROR I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cWhether in the interest of justice, the trial court should have granted the Motion for Leave to File Notice of Objection, Instanter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cAPPELLANT\u2019 [sic] ARGUMENT OF ERROR II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIn the alternative, Defendant\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to notify her client of the right to object to the Magistrate\u2019s Decision in a timely fashion, thereby denying him that right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 6} The parties were divorced in 2005. Schmidt\u2019s monthly child-support obligation was determined to be $373.15. In a May 30, 2008 judgment, the trial court agreed that there had been a substantial change in circumstances and recalculated Jonathan Schmidt\u2019s child-support obligation to be $242.50, commencing retroactively from January 1, 2008. Furthermore, because of a question of whether he was voluntarily underemployed, the court further ordered Schmidt to provide proof to the Erie County Child Support Enforcement Agency that he was seeking employment each week from at least three employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">{\u00b6 7} On July 16, 2008, Norma Schmidt filed a motion to show cause on the ground that Jonathan Schmidt had failed to make the child-support payments ordered by the court in its May 30, 2008 order. On July 31, 2008, the court found that the motion was well founded and ordered Schmidt to appear for a contempt hearing. A hearing before a magistrate was held on October 16, 2008. Based upon the testimony presented, the magistrate found that Schmidt was $3,517.91 in arrears on his child-support obligation and that Schmidt\u2019s explanations of why he was unable to meet his obligation were not credible. Therefore, the magistrate proposed that Schmidt be found in contempt, sentenced to 30 days in the Erie County Jail, and fined $100. While the judgment was dated October 22, 2008, the judgment was not journalized until November 12, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">{\u00b6 8} On November 6, 2008, Schmidt moved for leave to file his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision. He attested that his attorney was on vacation from October 24 through November 3, 2008 and did not receive the court\u2019s order until her return. Therefore, he was unable to timely request a continuance. On November 12, 2008, the trial court denied the motion to file the objections. Schmidt then filed a motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s prior order, which the trial court denied on December 15, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court approved and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision on January 13, 2009, but that order was not journalized until March 4, 2009. Schmidt filed his notice of appeal from that order on March 9, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">{\u00b6 10} A court speaks through its journal entry, and a judgment is not rendered until it is reduced to a written journal entry and filed with the clerk for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>journalization. <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 337, 686 N.E.2d 267, and Civ.R. 58(A). Likewise, a magistrate\u2019s decision must be filed with the clerk for journalization. Civ.R. 53(B)(3)(a)(iii). Objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision must be filed within 14 days after the decision is journalized. Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 11} Since the magistrate\u2019s decision in this case was not journalized until November 12, 2008, Schmidt\u2019s motion for leave to file objections to the decision filed on November 6, 2008, was timely. The trial court erred as a m\u00e1tter of law by denying the motion. Therefore, we find Schmidt\u2019s first assignment of error well taken and his second assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 12} Having found that the trial court did commit error prejudicial to appellant and that substantial justice has not been done, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is reversed. This case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this judgment. Appellee is hereby ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-8\">Mark L.
