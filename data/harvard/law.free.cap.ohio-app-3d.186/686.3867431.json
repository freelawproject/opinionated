Boyle, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">{\u00b6 1} Defendants-appellants, Barbara J. and Alfred Luft (\u201cthe Lufts\u201d), appeal from a judgment of the trial court adopting a magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety and granting judgment accordingly. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>In March 2007, plaintiff-appellee, Zukerman, Daiker <em>&amp; </em>Lear Co., L.P.A. (\u201cZukerman\u201d), filed a complaint for foreclosure and other equitable relief against defendants Julie Luft Signer (\u201cSigner\u201d), the Lufts, Georgetown Condominium Association (\u201cGeorgetown\u201d), and the Cuyahoga County Treasurer (\u201cTreasurer\u201d). Zukerman alleged that it had obtained a judgment against Signer for the sum of $29,791.03 plus interest and costs, and that it was the holder of a judgment lien for such amount, which was attached to Signer\u2019s property located at 15 Brandy-wine Square, Euclid, Ohio. It demanded that the property be foreclosed and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>all liens be marshalled and their priority determined according to law. Zukerman later amended its complaint and added Rotatori, Bender, Gragel, Stoper &amp; Alexander Co., L.P.A. (\u201cRotatori\u201d), Citibank NA (South Dakota) (\u201cCitibank\u201d), and Standard <em>&amp; </em>Corsi Co., L.P.A. (\u201cCorsi\u201d) as new party defendants. Corsi, Rotatori, the Treasurer, Georgetown, and the Lufts filed answers and cross-claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">{\u00b6 3} The case was referred to a magistrate, who held a bench trial on March 3, 2008. The magistrate made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c1. * * * Prior to July of 1996, the property was owned by defendant Alfred Luft and his wife, defendant Barbara J. Luft. In July of 1996, Alfred Luft and Barbara Luft executed a deed transferring Alfred Luft\u2019s one-half interest in the subject property to their daughter, defendant Julie Luft Signer * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c2. On August 1, 2002, Julie Luft Signer executed a promissory note payable to Alfred Luft in the sum of $35,000.00 with interest at the rate of 8.00% per annum (hereinafter \u2018the Luft promissory note\u2019). The interest and principal were due and payable on or before July 31, 2007. This note recites that it was given \u2018for value received.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c3. To secure this promissory note, on September 19, 2002, Julie Luft Signer granted a mortgage in the sum of $35,000.00 in favor of Alfred Luft encumbering her one-half interest in the subject property (hereinafter \u2018the Luft mortgage\u2019). This mortgage was filed for record on September 20, 2002, and recorded at AFN 200209201284.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c4. Alfred Luft and Barbara Luft testified that the note and mortgage were given in consideration for payment of Julie Luft Signer\u2019s debts and living expenses incurred after her separation from her husband and as part of her divorce proceeding. With the exception of cancelled checks totaling $700.00, neither Alfred Luft nor Barbara Luft could produce any receipts or cancelled checks reflecting the payment of these expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c5. Alfred Luft and Barbara Luft further testified that they never received any payment related to the Luft mortgage or promissory note. Further, Alfred Luft has never made a demand for payment of the Luft promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c6. The subject property has been leased from time to time during the relevant time period. An undisclosed amount of rental payments have been made to Barbara Luft. The Lufts claim that these payments were not applied to the Luft promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c7. In early August 2005, a check in the sum of $54,053.13 made payable to Julie Luft Signer was endorsed to Barbara Luft and cashed by Barbara Luft on August 10, 2005. The Lufts claim that this sum was not applied to the Luft promissory note.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>{\u00b6 11} \u201c8. Defendant [Rotatori] holds a judgment lien on the one-half interest of Julie Luft Signer. This lien was filed for record on November 19, 2004, and recorded at JL-04-227691 of the County\u2019s Judgment Lien Docket. There is due on this lien the sum of $33,895.28 plus interest thereon at the rate of 10.00% per annum from May 21, 2007.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c9. Plaintiff [Zukerman] holds a judgment lien on the one-half interest of Julie Luft Signer. This lien was filed for record on February 14, 2006, and recorded at JL-06-256861 of the County\u2019s Judgment Lien Docket. There is due on this lien the sum of $29,791.03 plus interest thereon at the rate of 6.00% per annum from January 26, 2006, plus costs of $25.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c10. Defendant [Corsi] holds a judgment lien on the one-half interest of Julie Luft Signer. The lien was filed for record on October 23, 2006, and recorded at JL-06-276788 of the County\u2019s Judgment Lien Docket. There is due on this lien the sum of $7,717.86 plus interest thereon at the rate of 10.00% per annum from June 7, 2006, plus costs of $106.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">{\u00b6 14} The magistrate held that \u201ca party asserting a lien in response to a marshalling of liens claim has the burden of proving the balance due on his lien at trial\u201d and determined that \u201cAlfred Luft failed to meet that burden in this case.\u201d The magistrate determined that because Alfred Luft failed to prove a balance due on his note and mortgage, he was not entitled to payment upon the marshalling of liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">{\u00b6 15} The Lufts raised timely objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision based upon Civ.R. 53. The trial court overruled the Lufts\u2019 objections and adopted the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety. The trial court ordered that Signer\u2019s one-half interest in the property be foreclosed and that the funds first be distributed to the Treasurer and then to the lienholders who met their burden: Rotatori, Zukerman, and Corsi. It is from this judgment that the Lufts appeal, raising four assignments of error for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c[1.] The trial court abused its discretion by depriving Defendant/Appellant, Alfred Luft of a valuable interest in property without due process of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[2.] The trial court abused its discretion placing the burden of proof upon Defendant/Appellant, Alfred Luft, to prove that his note, which is secured by his mortgage, was not satisfied by payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[3.] The trial court abused its discretion in its determination that monies given to Defendant/Appellant, Barbara J. Luft, by Defendant Julie Luft Signer should have been credited as payment of the note held by Defendant/Appellant, Alfred Luft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>(\u00b6 19} \u201c[4.] The trial court abused its discretion in its finding that the testimony of Defendants/Appellants Barbara J. Luft and Alfred Luft was unsupported.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Civ.R. 53 and Transcript or Affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">{\u00b6 20} The record reveals that, while the Lufts timely objected to the magistrate\u2019s decision, they did not provide a transcript for the trial court\u2019s review. There is no indication that the Lufts requested a transcript be prepared for the trial court, nor is there any indication that the Lufts submitted an affidavit regarding the evidence upon which they based their objections or that they sought leave to supplement their objections with a transcript or affidavit at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">{\u00b6 21} Under Civ.R. 53, any \u201cobjection to a factual finding, whether or not specifically designated as a finding of fact under Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii), shall be supported by a transcript of all the evidence submitted to the magistrate relevant to that finding or an affidavit of that evidence if a transcript is not available.\u201d Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(b)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">{\u00b6 22} In <em>State ex rel. Duncan v. Chippewa Twp. Trustees </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 728, 654 N.E.2d 1254, the Ohio Supreme Court set forth our standard of review in this situation: \u201cWhen a party objecting to a referee\u2019s report has failed to provide the trial court with the evidence and documents by which the court could make a finding independent of the report, appellate review of the court\u2019s findings is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the referee\u2019s report, and the appellate court is precluded from considering the transcript of the hearing submitted with the appellate record. * * * In other words, an appeal under these circumstances can be reviewed by the appellate court to determine whether the trial court\u2019s application of the law to its factual findings constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id. at 730, 654 N.E.2d 1254. The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error in law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Berk v. Matthews </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 161, 169, 559 N.E.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">{\u00b6 23} A review of the record on appeal reveals that a transcript was filed with the trial court on August 12, 2008, after the trial court adopted and approved the magistrate\u2019s decision and after the Lufts filed their notice of appeal to this court. The transcript was filed in this court on August 25, 2008. Thus, to the extent that the Lufts rely on testimony from the hearing that was not before the trial court in ruling on the Lufts\u2019 objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, their arguments must fail. <em>Duncan, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 730, 654 N.E.2d 1254; see also <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Nonetheless, the Lufts\u2019 main contention is that the trial court abused its discretion in adopting the magistrate\u2019s <em>legal </em>conclusion; namely, that in a marshalling-of-liens case, the burden of proving the balance due on the lien is on the party asserting the lien. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">{\u00b6 25} In their first assignment of error, the Lufts argue that Alfred Luft had no notice or \u201creason to believe that he would be forced to bear the burden of proving the negative proposition that payments were not made.\u201d In their second assignment of error, they argue that the trial court erred by placing the burden of payment on Alfred Luft. Since these two assignments are interrelated, we will address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">{\u00b6 26} Regarding the burden-of-proof issue, the magistrate found that \u201c[t]here is a surprising lack of authority concerning the burden of proof in a marshallingof-liens claim.\u201d The magistrate explained that \u201c[o]rdinarily, one who asserts a claim has the burden of proving that claim.\u201d But he pointed out that \u201cMarshalling of liens, however, is a unique claim. A marshalling-of-liens claim is asserted by a lien claimant in a foreclosure case whereby all other lien claimants must assert their interests in the property or be barred from asserting them in the future. The Court then has the duty to ascertain the nature and extent of all liens and pay them out of the proceeds of sheriffs sale according to their priority. * * * Thus, marshalling of liens is a claim by the plaintiff against a creditor defendant upon which <em>the creditor defendant, </em>not the plaintiff, receives payment.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">{\u00b6 27} Describing the difficult concept, the magistrate explained: \u201cPlacing the burden of proof on the parties contesting the balance due on a lien could conceivably result in an absurd situation where two conflicting burdens of proof exist regarding payment of liens in foreclosure cases. A lien claimant who has asserted a cross-claim for foreclosure or money judgment on his mortgage and promissory note may be denied recovery on this cross-claim because of a failure to introduce sufficient evidence to prove an outstanding balance. Nevertheless, if the burden of proof regarding a marshalling-of-liens claim is on those contesting the balance due on a lien, this same lienholder may be paid on his lien pursuant to the marshalling-of-liens claim because adverse lien claimants are unable to provide evidence that the balance was paid. In other words, the cross-claiming lienholder loses because he cannot meet his burden of establishing the lien amount but, at the same time, wins because adverse lien claimants cannot meet their burden contesting this lien in regard to the marshalling-of-liens claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">{\u00b6 28} The magistrate concluded that \u201c[t]he present case further illustrates the sensibility of placing the burden of proof regarding the balance due on the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>seeking payment. If the burden of proof is on the other lien claimants, shoddy or incomplete bookkeeping could preclude other lien claimants from contesting the amount due on the lien simply because no evidence exists upon which to base a challenge. Accordingly, the magistrate finds that a party asserting a lien in response to a marshalling-of-liens claim has the burden of proving the balance due on his lien at trial. Alfred Luft has failed to meet that burden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">{\u00b6 29} The Lufts argue that the magistrate\u2019s reasoning was flawed and that the magistrate placed the burden on the wrong party. Relying on <em>Midland Title Security, Inc. v. Carlson, </em>171 Ohio App.3d 678, 2007-Ohio-1980, 872 N.E.2d 968, they contend that Alfred Luft\u2019s note and the mortgage securing the note were stipulated to, and that was sufficient to prove the existence of the debt. In <em>Midland, </em>this court distinguished between a note and a mortgage, stating that a \u201cpromissory note is the primary evidence of the debt, and the mortgage on the real estate is merely the security for the payment of the note.\u201d The similarities of the facts and law in <em>Midland </em>to the issues in this case, however, end there. Therefore, we find <em>Midland </em>to be completely inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">{\u00b6 30} The Lufts further maintain that the burden of proof of payment should be on the party asserting that payment was made and thus, \u201cthe parties arrayed against Alfred in this case would bear the burden of proving payment of the note.\u201d In support of this argument, the Lufts rely heavily on a 1934 case, <em>Buck v. Coblentz </em>(App.1934), 18 Ohio Law Abs. 1. After reviewing <em>Buck, </em>however, we find the Lufts\u2019 reliance on this case to be misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Buck, </em>the plaintiff brought an action upon a promissory note against the <em>maker of the note. </em>The defendant-maker denied the execution of the note, claimed that the signature on the note was forged, and averred that there was no consideration for the note. The trial court held that the plaintiff was entitled to the full amount of the note, plus interest. The appellate court affirmed, holding in part that \u201ca promissory note regular on its face when introduced into evidence for all purposes, establishes a prima facie case against the person whose name appears on it as maker unless under the pleadings there is an issue as to the genuineness of the signature.\u201d Thus, in <em>Buck, </em>it was an action <em>against </em>a maker of a note upon a <em>demand for payment </em>of the note. In such a case, the burden is not upon the holder of the note to prove lack of payment, but on the maker to plead and prove payment as an affirmative defense. See Civ.R. 8(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">{\u00b6 32} The reasoning in <em>Buck, </em>however, does not extend to the facts of the case sub judice \u2014 a marshalling-of-liens claim with competing liens. Here, the holder of the note and moi'tgage securing the note is not demanding payment from the maker of the note- \u2014 in this case his daughter \u2014 but rather, is attempting to show that his daughter never paid him in order to preclude a forced sale of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>property securing the note.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Lufts argue that they could never prove a negative payment. They maintain that the court should take into account that they are an elderly couple who do not keep accounting records such as a business would.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">{\u00b6 33} If this court were to adopt the Lufts\u2019 reasoning, however, then family members could loan money to each other to avoid paying other debts or to avoid foreclosure of property. It is our view that if family members loan money to each other with the expectation that the loan will be repaid, then it should be incumbent upon the holder of the note to keep such accounting records.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">{\u00b6 34} If a bank filed a foreclosure against a debtor claiming that the debtor had never made payments on his or her mortgage, but did not show proof of want of payments or balance due, courts would not foreclose on the debtor\u2019s property. In fact, the same burden that the trial court placed on the Lufts in this case also applied to the other creditor-defendants. If Rotatori or Corsi had not proven what balance was due upon their liens, they would not have been entitled to receive distribution of funds upon sale of the property (just as Citibank and Georgetown were not entitled to distribution of funds because they did not meet their burden). We see no reason why the same standard should not be applied to intrafamily loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">{\u00b6 35} Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate\u2019s well-reasoned decision. The Lufts\u2019 first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">{\u00b6 36} In their third assignment of error, the Lufts argue that the trial court erred when it applied the $54,053.13 that was received by Barbara Luft from Signer to Alfred Luft\u2019s $35,000 note. The Lufts maintain that \u201cthe defense of payment was never pleaded by any party,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Alfred, the payee on this note, received a penny of the money from Signer\u2019s check to Barbara, the rents or any other source.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">{\u00b6 37} According to the magistrate\u2019s findings, the Lufts could not explain what the $54,053.13 Barbara received from Signer was used for, except to say that it was used for other debts Signer owed them, not the $35,000 note. The magistrate found the Lufts\u2019 testimony was self-serving, not supported by any documentary evidence, and lacked credibility. Moreover, the magistrate never \u201capplied\u201d the $54,053.13 to Alfred\u2019s note, but stated that the $54,053.13, in addition to other unexplained sums received by Barbara Luft, may have \u201csatisfied the obligation of the Luft note and mortgage.\u201d This was just one factor, out of many, that led the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>magistrate to conclude that the Lufts did not meet their burden of showing that there was a balance remaining on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 38} Accordingly, the Lufts\u2019 third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">{\u00b6 39} In their fourth assignment of error, the Lufts challenge the trial court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate\u2019s credibility assessments and factual findings. As we stated previously, the Lufts failed to timely file a transcript of the proceedings with the trial court and, thus, the trial court was required to accept the magistrate\u2019s credibility assessments and factual findings. Therefore, the Lufts\u2019 fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 40} Having overruled the Lufts\u2019 four assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<judges id=\"b726-8\">Colleen Conway, A.J., and Sean C. Gallagher, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">. The Lufts filed a cross-claim against Rotatori, but not Signer. They attempted to do so on February 29, 2008, but the magistrate denied them leave to amend their complaint because trial was set for March 3, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
