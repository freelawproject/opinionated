This argument challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. See <em>State v. Crump, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22862, 2009-Ohio-4110, 2009 WL 2487987, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIn reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State v. Crowley, </em>Clark App. No. 2007 CA 99, 2008-Ohio-4636, 2008 WL 4183964, \u00b6 12. The statute under which Hicks was convicted, R.C. 2923.24(A), provides: \u201cNo person shall possess or have under the person\u2019s control any substance, device, instrument, or article, with purpose to use it criminally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">{\u00b6 4} The lone witness at trial was Dayton police officer Paul Harris. He testified that he observed Hicks walking down Edmund Street around 4:00 a.m. on July 21, 2008. Harris watched from inside a police cruiser while Hicks kept peering over his shoulder at the officer, who was half a block away. Hicks then approached a house on the corner of Edmund Street and Maryland Avenue. Harris watched as Hicks went to a side door and acted like he was knocking on it. No one responded. Hicks dropped a white bag when he saw Harris\u2019s cruiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>stop beside the house. The officer proceeded to speak to Hicks, who acted \u201chesitant\u201d and \u201cjumpy.\u201d During the conversation, Hicks admitted having a warrant for his arrest. Harris testified that he believed the warrant was for burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 5} After being handcuffed, Hicks claimed to have approached the house to visit \u201ca buddy\u201d whose name he did not know. Hicks also claimed that he was out \u201cjunking\u201d or going through dumpsters and trash to retrieve recyclables. Harris examined the white bag Hicks had dropped. Inside he found a flashlight with tape over the lens, which resulted in lower light emission. He also found a pair of pliers and a magnet. When describing the size of the bag, Harris indicated that it was large enough to hold a stereo. The bag did not contain any recyclable materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">{\u00b6 6} Following Harris\u2019s testimony, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the state had presented no evidence that Hicks intended to use the white bag and its contents criminally. The trial court overruled the motion and then found Hicks guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Hicks reiterates his argument that evidence of criminal intent is lacking. He attributes his nervousness and inability to remember his buddy\u2019s name to his knowledge of the outstanding warrant. Hicks also contends that the items he was carrying in the white bag were consistent with junking, which Officer Harris admitted is legal provided no trespassing occurs. While acknowledging that the circumstances might be suspicious, Hicks insists that the state did not prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had the purpose to use the items in the white bag criminally.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 8} For its part, the state points out that under R.C. 2923.24(B)(2) possession of an item \u201cspecially adapted for criminal use\u201d constitutes prima facie evidence of criminal purpose. The state suggests that Hicks\u2019s possession of a flashlight with a tape-covered lens is prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(2). The state additionally cites R.C. 2923.24(B)(3), which provides that possession of an item \u201ccommonly used for criminal purposes, under circumstances indicating the item is intended for criminal use,\u201d is prima facie evidence of criminal purpose. The state claims that Hicks\u2019s possession of the white bag containing the flashlight, pliers, and a magnet constituted prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(3). Finally, the state contends that Hicks did not rebut the inference of criminal purpose that arose under R.C. 2923.24(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 9} Upon review, we find legally sufficient evidence to support Hicks\u2019s conviction for possession of criminal tools. Reviewing the evidence in a light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>most favorable to the prosecution, the trial court could have found the essential elements of R.C. 2923.24(A) proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">{\u00b6 10} The record supports a finding that Hicks\u2019s flashlight had been \u201cspecially adapted for criminal use\u201d by covering the lens with tape to reduce the light emission. Cf. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(Oct. 24, 1985), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 49501, 49518, and 49577, 1985 WL 8499 (finding that a defendant\u2019s possession of a flashlight with a darkened lens and other evidence supported theft and burglary convictions); see also <em>People v. Waln </em>(1988), 169 Ill.App.3d 264, 120 Ill.Dec. 407, 523 N.E.2d 1318, 1322 (\u201cKelley stated that in burglaries, the flashlights used by burglars are often taped around the top to keep the light beam from spreading out and being seen\u201d); <em>State v. Kusgen </em>(Mo.App.2005), 178 S.W.3d 595, 598-599 (noting that evidence of criminal purpose included the defendant carrying \u201ca flashlight that had been wrapped in black electrical tape, which had apparently been done to dim the light so that it would be less detectable\u201d); <em>State v. Karlin </em>(1989), 151 Wis.2d 557, 445 N.W.2d 58 (Table, text in Westlaw No. 88-0767-CR, 88-1737-CR, 1989 WL 100089) (reasoning that the defendant\u2019s possession of various items, including \u201ca flashlight with the corners taped to cut down the amount of light,\u201d was relevant to his intent to steal); <em>People v. Nichols </em>(1971), 33 Mich.App. 63, 189 N.W.2d 865, 867 (finding that intent to steal a truck could be inferred from evidence that included \u201c[s]everal flashlights with their ends taped to provide narrow beams\u201d). Therefore, mere possession of the altered flashlight constituted prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(2). The trial court was not required to accept defense counsel\u2019s unlikely assertion that Hicks had covered the lens with tape as a courtesy to avoid bothering others while junking. The trial court reasonably could have concluded that Hicks did not rebut the state\u2019s prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(2). Moreover, a defendant who possesses multiple items may be convicted if one of the items qualifies as a criminal tool under the statute. <em>State v. Hegler </em>(Dec. 20,1979), Cuyahoga App. No. 39840, 1979 WL 210608. Therefore, we find legally sufficient evidence to sustain Hicks\u2019s conviction based on his possession of the altered flashlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 11} In the interest of completeness, we briefly will address the state\u2019s alternative argument that Hicks\u2019s possession of the items in the white bag constituted prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(3) because those items commonly are used for criminal purposes, and Hicks possessed them under circumstances indicating that they were intended for criminal use. We note that the state presented no testimony about the items in the bag commonly being used for criminal purposes. Absent such evidence, we decline to apply R.C. 2923.24(B)(3). See, e.g., <em>State v. Sanders, </em>Summit App. No. 23504, 2007-Ohio-2898, 2007 WL 1696963, \u00b6 13 (\u201cThe State presents prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>evidence of criminal purpose if it provides evidence that an item is \u2018commonly-used for criminal purposes, under circumstances indicating the item is intended for criminal use\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v. Hayley </em>(Dec. 2, 1999), Cuyahoga App. No. 74718, 1999 WL 1084274 (\u201cAt no time did the state\u2019s witnesses testify that a pager is commonly used for criminal purposes * * *\u201d); <em>State v. Mcgruder </em>(Aug. 11, 1982), Hamilton App. No. C-810734, 1982 WL 8675 (\u201cThe record discloses insufficient evidence to establish that the tea was a substance commonly used for criminal purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 12} But even if Hicks\u2019s possession of the white bag and its contents did not constitute prima facie evidence of criminal purpose under R.C. 2923.24(B)(3), the state nevertheless established criminal purpose beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State v. Anderson </em>(1981), 1 Ohio App.3d 62, 64, 1 OBR 342, 439 N.E.2d 450 (recognizing that the state still can prove criminal purpose even when the statutory inferences provided by R.C. 2923.24(B) do not apply); <em>State v. Keckler, </em>Hardin App. No. 6-07-07, 2007-Ohio-4489, 2007 WL 2472339, \u00b6 18 (\u201cUnless any of the subsections in R.C. 2923.24(B) apply, the state was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Keckler had criminal purpose\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 82904, 2004-Ohio-745, 2004 WL 308110, \u00b6 37 (\u201cSince a bicycle does not fall within one of the circumstances which constitute \u2018prima facie evidence of criminal purpose\u2019 under R.C. 2923.24(B), the state was required to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant possessed or had control over this bicycle with purpose to use it criminally, without the benefit of the inference provided by this statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 13} Even without relying on the statutory inferences, the record contains legally sufficient evidence to support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Hicks possessed the white bag and its contents with the purpose to use the items criminally. Hicks\u2019s possession of a darkened flashlight and other tools at 4:00 a.m. is somewhat indicative of criminal purpose. The inference of criminal purpose is strengthened by his suspicious behavior, which included nervously approaching what appeared to be a random house, pretending to knock on the door, and then discarding the white bag when Harris approached. Hicks\u2019s assertion that he was visiting \u201ca buddy,\u201d whose name he did not know, defies credibility and adds to the inference of criminal purpose. His alternative claim that he was out junking, while plausible, is only slightly more believable given the circumstances and time of day. Although the trial court could have accepted defense counsel\u2019s explanations, it was not required to do so. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, we find legally sufficient evidence to support Hicks\u2019s conviction for possession of criminal tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Dayton Municipal Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b565-6\">Donovan, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b565-7\">Grady, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A32\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 15} A person is not criminally liable unless he engaged in conduct prohibited by a section of the Revised Code, and \u201c[t]he person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the offense.\u201d R.C. 2901.21(A)(1) and (2). The burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt regarding both matters is on the prosecution. R.C. 2901.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 16} The culpable mental state required for a violation of R.C. 2923.24(A) is a purpose to use an article in the defendant\u2019s possession \u201ccriminally.\u201d \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 17} R.C. 2923.24(B)(l)-(3) identifies three matters which, when proved, constitute prima facie evidence of the criminal purpose required by R.C. 2923.24(A). Prima facie evidence means evidence which is sufficient to establish a fact, unless rebutted, and that standing alone and unexplained would support the conclusion for which it is introduced. 42 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Evidence and Witnesses, Sections 5, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 18} The 1973 Legislative Service Commission comment to R.C. 2923.24 regarding paragraph (B) of that section states: \u201cTo aid enforcement, the section spells out the evidence establishing prima-facie violations involving items having a high liability for criminal use. Each prima-facie case is, of course, rebuttable, and is based on evidence from which a criminal purpose in possessing certain items can reasonably be inferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-12\">{\u00b6 19} In order to rely on R.C. 2923.24(B)(l)-(3) to prove a violation of R.C. 2923.24(A), the state has the burden to offer some evidence that demonstrates the criminal nature or character of the article or articles possessed. Otherwise, there is nothing for the accused to rebut, and requiring the defendant then to do that is an improper transfer of the burden of proof. Furthermore, any finding the court then makes in accordance with R.C. 2923.24(B) is necessarily intuitive, instead of one based on evidence that satisfies the burdens of proof that section imposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The state offered no evidence demonstrating the criminal nature or character of the articles in the bag defendant carried. Therefore, I do not find that R.C. 2923.24(B) is satisfied. I would nevertheless affirm defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence for a violation of R.C. 2923.24(A) on a finding that the totality of the evidence presented was sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant possessed the articles in the white bag he carried with a purpose to use one or more of them criminally, for the reasons the majority opinion explains.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
