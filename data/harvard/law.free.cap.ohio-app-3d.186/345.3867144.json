Z-Coil Pain Relief Footwear. The facts giving rise to the litigation are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">{\u00b6 2} In February 2008, Hissong visited Ron and Tina Miller\u2019s Piqua, Ohio, Z-Coil Pain Relief Footwear store. While there, Hissong asked the sales clerk if she could use the restroom. The clerk replied, \u201c[0]f course,\u201d and directed Hissong \u201cthrough the curtains to the left of the trellis in the back.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the clerk pulled back the curtain, either Hissong or the clerk (it is not clear who) told Tim Miller, who was working in the back room, that she was going to use the restroom. Miller replied that that was \u201cfine.\u201d Id. Hissong, who had never been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>behind the curtain before, saw the trellis near the back on the left, and just before the trellis began, she saw the face of a closed door. Believing this was the restroom \u201cto the left of the trellis,\u201d Hissong walked over to it. The door had a hook-and-eye latch on its upper-right side, which Hissong said she did not see. (Neither the Millers nor the clerk could say why the door was not latched at the time.) Also, affixed to the center of the door, about eye-level, was a small piece of paper on which was handwritten, \u201cNotice, please keep this door locked.\u201d Hissong opened the door \u2014 which opened inwardly \u2014 about a foot and a half.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The other side was dark, but enough light from the backroom shone inside for Hissong to see a light switch on the right wall. As she reached for the switch, Hissong at the same time stepped through the doorway \u2014 never looking down. Had she looked down, she would have seen the steps that descended immediately on the other side of the door\u2019s threshold. As it was, expecting her foot to find the solid restroom floor and not finding it, Hissong bounced down the steps, severely injuring her shoulder on the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 3} In July 2008, Hissong filed a complaint against the Millers for negligence. She asserted that the abrupt and unexpected drop in floor elevation \u2014 in other words, the absence of a landing \u2014 was a hidden or latent danger that the Millers ought to have warned her about. The Millers filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they had no duty to warn Hissong of any damages that lurked in the darkness behind the basement door she entered. The trial court agreed and entered summary judgment for the Millers. Hissong has assigned three assignments of error in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 4} In each assignment of error, Hissong argues a different reason why the court\u2019s decision was erroneous. First, she argues that the court wrongly concluded that the stairs in the Millers\u2019 store were open and obvious. Second, Hissong argues in the alternative that even if the trial court were correct that the stairs were open and obvious, the court wrongly concluded that attendant circumstances did not excuse her failure to see them. And third, Hissong argues that the court wrongly concluded that the step-in-the-dark rule barred her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 5} We will review the trial court\u2019s summary-judgment decision de novo. See <em>Cox v. Kettering Med. Ctr., </em>Montgomery App. No. 20614, 2005-Ohio-5003, 2005 WL 2327124. To determine whether a trial court erred under de novo review, we apply the same legal standard it did (or should have) to the same facts, and we compare our conclusion to the court\u2019s. Here, the legal standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>comes from Civ.R. 56(C): Summary judgment on Hissong\u2019s negligence claim is appropriate if the Millers can show (1) that no genuine issue of material fact remains, (2) that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) that even when the evidence is construed most strongly in Hissong\u2019s favor, reasonable minds can conclude only adversely to her. We agree with the trial court that reasonable minds can conclude only that no attendant circumstances were present. But we agree with Hissong that reasonable minds can conclude differently on whether the stairs were open and obvious and whether she stepped into the darkness.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 6} Broadly speaking, before a plaintiff can recover from a defendant for negligence, she must prove that the defendants owed her a duty of care, that they breached the duty, and that the breach proximately caused her injury. See <em>Menifee v. Ohio Welding Prods., Inc. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 75, 77, 15 OBR 179, 472 N.E.2d 707. Here, duty and cause are in focus. The overarching issue in the first and second assignments of error is whether the Millers had a duty of care to protect Hissong from the stairs. The issue in the third assignment of error assumes that the Millers had such a duty and asks whether Hissong bears any responsibility for her injuries because she stepped into a dark space. Reviewing the assignments of error out of order, we begin with the first, then move to the third, and end with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">A shopkeeper owes his customers a duty of ordinary care</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 7} Proving that the Millers had a duty to protect her from the stairs is key to Hissong\u2019s claim because without such a duty, the Millers are not legally liable for her injuries. See <em>Olivier v. Leaf &amp; Vine, </em>Miami App. No. 2004 CA 35, 2005-Ohio-1910, 2005 WL 937928, at \u00b6 21 (\u201cThe existence of a duty is fundamental to establishing actionable negligence, without which there is no legal liability\u201d [citation omitted]). Because the parties appear to agree that Hissong was a business invitee, the Millers owed her a duty of reasonable or ordinary care. See <em>Perry v. Eastgreen Realty Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 51, 52, 7 O.O.3d 130, 372 N.E.2d 335, quoting Prosser on Torts (4th Ed. 1971) 392-393. This standard of care required the Millers to maintain their store \u201cin a reasonably safe condition so that its customers [were] not unnecessarily and unreasonably exposed to danger.\u201d <em>Paschal v. Rite Aid Pharmacy, Inc. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 203, 18 OBR 267, 480 N.E.2d 474. But the standard did not require the Millers to be guarantors of their customers\u2019 safety. Id. (\u201cA shopkeeper is not * * * an insurer of the customer\u2019s safety.\u201d) The Millers could meet this standard of care by inspecting their store for unknown dangers, by taking \u201creasonable precautions\u201d to protect customers from foreseeable dangers, and by warning customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>of known latent or hidden dangers. <em>Perry </em>at 52, 7 0.0.3d 130, 372 N.E.2d 335, quoting Prosser on Torts, 392-393.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Dangers that are open and obvious</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 8} The Millers could expect that customers would protect themselves from dangers in their store that were open and obvious. The question of open- and-obvious dangers does not concern an affirmative defense, but rather concerns the threshold issue of whether a duty of care exists. <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, at \u00b6 13. Unlike hidden or latent dangers, a shopkeeper has no duty to warn customers away from dangers that are open and obvious. See <em>Armstrong </em>at syllabus. The reason for this rule lies in the idea that \u201cthe open and obvious nature of the hazard itself serves as a warning.\u201d <em>Simmers v. Bentley Constr. Co. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 642, 644, 597 N.E.2d 504. So the shopkeeper may expect that a customer will discover such a danger and protect herself from it. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 9} Here, the trial court concluded that the stairway was open and obvious as a matter of law. But Hissong, in her first assignment of error,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contends that reasonable minds can differ on this question. The Millers (apparently conceding that the stairway is dangerous) respond that if Hissong had simply looked down, as she should have done, she would have seen the steps and been able to prevent her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\"> {\u00b6 10} The question of whether a particular danger is open and obvious is answered objectively, without regard to the injured plaintiff. Accordingly, the open-and-obvious test \u201cproperly considers the nature of the dangerous condition itself, as opposed to the nature of the plaintiffs conduct in encountering it.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, at \u00b6 13. Similarly, the plaintiffs subjective state of mind when she encountered the danger \u2014 for example, what she was aware of at the time \u2014 may not be considered. (Citation omitted.) <em>Weaver v. Booher Carpet &amp; Rug, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19982, 2004-Ohio-658, 2004 WL 257671, at \u00b6 9. So neither Hissong\u2019s actions when she encountered the stairs nor her mental state at the time of the encounter is material for this analysis. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 11} What is material to the open-and-obvious test is whether the danger is observable, which means it \u201cis discoverable or discernible by one who is acting with ordinary care under the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>Earnsberger v. Griffiths Park Swim Club, </em>Summit App. No. 20882, 2002-Ohio-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>3739, 2002 WL 1626126, \u00b6 24; see also <em>Springer v. Univ. of Dayton, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21358, 2006-Ohio-3198, 2006 WL 1717906, at \u00b6 5 (\u201c[T]he determinative issue is whether the condition is observable\u201d [citation omitted]). From this test, we, and other courts, have inferred that \u201cobservable\u201d does not mean that before being injured, the plaintiff must have actually seen the danger. <em>Springer </em>at \u00b6 5 (\u201c[T]he dangerous condition at issue does not actually have to be observed by the plaintiff in order for it to be an \u2018open and obvious\u2019 condition under the law\u201d); see also <em>Leonard v. Modene &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>Wood App. No. WD-05-085, 2006-Ohio-5471, 2006 WL 2988483, at \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 12} Rather, \u201cthe crucial inquiry is whether a customer exercising ordinary care under the circumstances would have seen and been able to guard him or herself against the condition.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Olivier </em>at \u00b6 31. It follows, then, that a plaintiffs failure to watch where she is walking is not necessarily dispositive of the open-and-obvious question. <em>Frano v. Red Robin Internatl., Inc., </em>181 Ohio App.3d 13, 2009-Ohio-685, 907 N.E.2d 796, at \u00b6 21 (whether a plaintiff looked down \u201cis not the determinative issue since \u2018the danger does not actually have to be observed by the plaintiff in order for it to be an open and obvious condition under the law.\u2019 \u201d [Citation omitted.]) See also <em>Gingrich v. D'Ambrozio, </em>Trumbull App. No. 2008-T-0103, 2009-Ohio-2956, 2009 WL 1743930, at \u00b6 27 (\u201cA plaintiffs failure to look down does not remove a danger from the realm of an open and obvious hazard\u201d). However, the question is answered, and the open-and-obvious nature of the danger is established, if the plaintiff admits that if she had looked down she would have seen the danger. <em>Gingrich </em>at \u00b6 27, citing <em>Armstrong, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, at \u00b6 16 (\u201c[W]hen a plaintiff acknowledges that he or she would have seen the danger had [he or she] looked down, the danger is open and obvious\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 13} Not surprisingly, whether a particular danger is open and obvious depends heavily on the particular facts of the case. While it is true that the question of whether a duty to warn exists is one of law for courts to answer, it is no less true that \u201c[w]hether a given hazard is open-and-obvious * * * may involve a genuine issue of material fact, which a trier of fact must resolve.\u201d <em>Henry v. Dollar Gen. Store, </em>Green App. No. 2002-CA-47, 2003-Ohio-206, 2003 WL 139773, at \u00b6 10. As one court aptly put it, \u201c \u2018[u]nder any given set of circumstances, how much attention a reasonably prudent person should direct to his or her surroundings is an extremely fact-specific analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sabitov v. Graines, </em>177 Ohio App.3d 451, 894 N.E.2d 1310, 2008-Ohio-3795, at \u00b6 20, quoting <em>Green v. China House </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 208, 211, 703 N.E.2d 872. For this reason, previously decided open-and-obvious cases tend to be of limited value. See <em>Kidder, </em>2004-Ohio-4261, 2004 WL 1802050, at \u00b6 11; see also <em>Leonard </em>at \u00b6 53 (\u201cThe existence and the obviousness of a danger which allegedly exists on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>premises is determined by a fact-specific inquiry and must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis\u201d [citation omitted]). Here, the question that must be answered for summary-judgment purposes is whether reasonable minds looking at the same evidence in the light most favorable to Hissong can conclude differently about whether the stairs were an open-and-obvious danger. See <em>Kidder, </em>2004-Ohio-4261, 2004 WL 1802050, at \u00b6 6. To answer this question, we must ask whether the stairs were objectively observable \u2014 that is, whether a person in Hissong\u2019s situation exercising reasonable care would have seen them.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 14} When Hissong reached the door to what she believed was the restroom, she opened it inward only about a foot and a half. She saw a light switch inside, and as she reached for the switch, she stepped through the doorway. Hissong admitted that she did not look down before stepping through the doorway. In her deposition, she explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. Okay. And did you turn on the light switch before you took a step in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. No, I was walking in as I reached for it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. And did you look down to see where you were walking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. No. I was going into the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. So you didn\u2019t look down to see what you could see when you put your foot down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. Absolutely not. I never do when I go to the bathroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 21} The deposing attorney could not get Hissong to admit that if she had looked down, she would have seen the stairs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cQ. * * * Was the room lighted in any way when you opened the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cA. Just from the light that was coming from the room I was walking from.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cQ. Was that sufficient light to show you where the stairs were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cA. If I had seen the stairs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-18\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA. Because I didn\u2019t see the stairs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-19\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cQ. Because you never looked down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-20\">{\u00b6 29} <em>\u201cA. </em>I never looked down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-21\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-22\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA. I didn\u2019t see anything but the light switch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-23\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cQ. So no matter what I ask you you only saw the light switch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>{\u00b6 33} \u201cA. That\u2019s what I was aiming for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 34} Do most people look down before stepping inside a restroom? This question, we think, cannot be answered as a matter of law. On the one hand, one can reasonably think that people should always watch where they step, so one could conclude that by not looking down Hissong failed to exercise ordinary care to protect herself from a visible danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 35} On the other hand, one could also reasonably think that most people, like Hissong, simply do not look down when stepping into a restroom. One could think that a door, particularly one that opens inward like the door here, hides the danger. See <em>Allgauer v. Le Bastille, Inc. </em>(1981), 101 Ill.App.3d 978, 981-982, 57 Ill.Dec. 466, 428 N.E.2d 1146 (a jury could find a concealed danger in \u201c[a] steep staircase without any landing or with one beginning before the end of the edge of the door when it is opened onto the stair\u201d because \u201cthe danger was hidden by the door until it was opened and the fact that the stair could be seen for the split second plaintiff was placing her foot on it does not necessarily remove it from the realm of hidden dangers\u201d). We think this question, especially, \u201cinvokes the jury\u2019s function: to find and apply the dictates of the community conscience in the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>McNally v. Liebowitz </em>(1982), 498 Pa. 163, 171, 445 A.2d 716, quoting 2 Harper <em>&amp; </em>James, The Law of Torts (1956) Section 22.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 36} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The step-in-the-dark rule</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 37} Unlike the open-and-obvious doctrine, the step-in-the-dark rule is an affirmative defense. Also unlike that doctrine, the rule does not relate to the duty element of a negligence claim, but instead relates to the cause of the plaintiffs injury. Here, the trial court concluded that the rule vitiated any liability that the Millers might have to Hissong because she was contributorily negligent in stepping into the darkness behind the door. But Hissong, in her third assignment of error,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> contends that she did not step into the darkness because she reasonably believed she was stepping into the restroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe step-in-the-dark rule * * * holds generally that one who, from a lighted area, intentionally steps into total darkness, without knowledge, information, or investigation as to what the darkness might conceal, is guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Posin v. A.B.C. Motor Court Hotel, Inc. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 271, 276, 74 O.O.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334. This rule does not prove contributory negligence but simply \u201craises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>an inference of the lack of prudence and ordinary care on the part of a plaintiff\u2019 \u2014 in other words, an inference that the plaintiffs own negligence, at least in part, caused her injury. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. However, the inference does not arise \u201c[i]f conflicting evidence exists as to the intentional nature of the step into the dark, the lighting conditions and degree of darkness, the nature and appearance of the premises, or other circumstances exist tending to disprove a voluntary, deliberate step into unknown darkness.\u201d Id. at 276, 74 0.0.2d 427, 344 N.E.2d 334. The rationale behind the rule is grounded in the idea that \u201c \u2018[djarkness is nature\u2019s own warning to arouse the natural instinct of self-preservation, the first law of nature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Parker v. Vaughn </em>(Aug. 7, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 16939, 1998 WL 639305, quoting <em>Cent. Publishing House v. Flury </em>(1927), 25 Ohio App. 214, 227, 157 N.E. 794. Because darkness is a warning, <em>\u201cfor one\u2019s own </em>protection it may not be disregarded.\u201d <em>Jeswald v. Hutt </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 224, 44 O.O.2d 196, 239 N.E.2d 37, at paragraph three of the syllabus. If one does unreasonably disregard the darkness, she may be precluded from recovering damages for resulting injuries. See id. at 227, 44 O.O.2d 196, 239 N.E.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 39} But as the rule recognizes, in some situations, a person\u2019s step into the darkness is perfectly reasonable. As one court has explained, \u201c[i]t cannot be said that a person is guilty of negligence as a matter of law under all circumstances when such person enters a dark place where his sense of sight alone does not enable him to see what is before him.\u201d <em>Chardon Lakes Inn Co. v. MacBride </em>(1937) 56 Ohio App. 40, 46, 9 O.O. 206, 10 N.E.2d 9. In some places, one expects to find darkness, so darkness is not always unusual and not always a warning of danger. A person does not act negligently by failing to look for danger where she has no reason to expect it or where she has reason <em>not </em>to expect it. For example, a person can be induced by another to enter darkness, having been instilled with a sense of safety in doing so. See 62A American Jurisprudence 2d (2009) Premises Liability, Section 761 (\u201cThe step in the dark rule, and similar rules which find the plaintiff to be negligent as a matter of law, are inapplicable * * * where the circumstances were such that an ordinary prudent person might be lulled into a false sense of safety\u201d). This is particularly true when one is following the directions <em>of </em>another. See id. at Section 759 (\u201cConduct which would otherwise constitute negligence as a matter of law does not bar a plaintiffs recovery where such conduct is done at the direction of, or in accordance with instructions from, the defendant or the defendant\u2019s agent\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[i]n holding that a person who walked in the dark has not been negligent, the courts often rely in part on the fact that such individual correctly followed instructions regarding how to proceed.\u201d Id. at Section 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>{\u00b6 40} Unlike the open-and-obvious test, the step-in-the-dark test does consider the plaintiff. Whether a particular plaintiff stepped into the dark depends on whether, when stepping into the darkness, the plaintiff was exercising ordinary-care. For example, the plaintiff in <em>Flury v. Cent. Publishing House of Reformed Church in the United States </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 154, 160 N.E. 679, did not exercise ordinary care. The plaintiff slid open elevator doors and stepped inside (and fell) without thought or hesitation, without investigation, information, or knowledge of what was lurking in the darkness. He did so even though several of the defendant\u2019s employees were lunching nearby, any one of whom could have helped him, but the plaintiff did not ask any of them. This failure to ask, said the court, raised an inference of the lack of ordinary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 41} Conversely, the plaintiff in <em>MacBride </em>did exercise ordinary care by asking and then following directions. The plaintiff had asked the hostess at the defendant\u2019s inn for a ladies\u2019 restroom. The hostess\u2019s directions led the plaintiff to the rear of a hallway where there was the door to the ladies\u2019 restroom and, immediately to the right of that door, another door, behind which, unbeknownst to the plaintiff, were stairs that descended to the cellar. The plaintiff apparently (the court\u2019s recitation of the facts is somewhat unclear) tried to open the restroom door and found it locked. Thinking she had made a mistake, she turned to the door on the right and opened it. After the plaintiff stepped inside and onto an unseen landing, because the light at the end of the hall was quite dim, she began searching for a light switch. She eventually stepped off the landing, lost her balance, and bounced down the unseen stairs. Reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant, the court distinguished <em>Flury </em>based on that plaintiffs failure to make any investigation. In contrast, said the court, the plaintiff here acted in accordance with the directions of one in charge of the premises. The plaintiff, said the court, \u201cmight reasonably rely upon the belief that she would not be directed into a place of danger by the person in charge of the inn.\u201d <em>MacBride, </em>56 Ohio App. at 44, 9 O.O. 206, 10 N.E.2d 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 42} Here, the analytical question is whether Hissong unreasonably stepped into the darkness behind the door. The analysis subjectively asks whether Hissong acted negligently in her encounter with the darkness. The question for summary-judgment purposes, then, is whether reasonable minds can answer this question differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 43} The facts show that a sales clerk allowed Hissong to use a restroom in the back room of the Millers\u2019 store, an area where customers are generally not permitted and where Hissong had never been. Directing her to the restroom, \u201c[the clerk] told [Hissong] to turn left at the trellis and the door was right there.\u201d Photographs in the record suggest what went wrong. A color photograph of the back room, which is what we assume Hissong saw when she walked through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>curtain, shows the face of a door a little ways back on the left, extending out perpendicular to the left wall. In this picture, only that one door is visible, which is the door Hissong saw and believed opened into the restroom. At roughly the width of the door, the wall turns sharply and runs perpendicular to the door toward the back of the room. Along this wall rests the trellis. A different photograph, taken closer to the trellis, reveals on the trellis\u2019s far end another door, in the same wall along which the trellis rests and partially obscured by it. This, presumably, is the door to the restroom. It seems, then, that the clerk intended for Hissong to turn left <em>after </em>the trellis, but Hissong, seeing only the one door, turned left <em>before </em>it.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">{\u00b6 44} In support of its decision to grant summary judgment, the trial court cited <em>Leonard v. Modene &amp; Assoc., Inc., </em>Wood App. No. WD-05-085, 2006-Ohio-5471, 2006 WL 2988483, wherein the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants where a realtor showing a house stepped into a darkened room that was an old, unlighted coal-bin room that had no stairway. The big distinction in <em>Leonard </em>and the facts before us was that Leonard had no idea what was behind the closed door. In this case, the appellant was led to believe the room she would be entering was a bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 45} Whether Hissong was negligent is also a question that cannot be answered as a matter of law. On the one hand, after Hissong opened the door and saw the darkness of the other side, one can reasonably think that Hissong should have been wary and looked down before she stepped inside. But on the other hand, one can also reasonably think that despite the notice on the door, in light of the directions given by the sales clerk, and considering the back room\u2019s configuration, Hissong did exercise ordinary care, even though she did not look down, because she was following directions. See <em>Tetrault v. Ghibellini </em>(1944), 316 Mass. 477, 480, 55 N.E.2d 956 (\u201cThe jury could find that [plaintiff] reasonably might have expected that the rest room would not be lighted, that, when injured, he was still proceeding reasonably as directed, and that it was not negligent to walk three steps in darkness\u201d when, following directions, plaintiff entered a dark room, took a few steps, and fell into an unseen grease pit). After construing the evidence and all reasonable inferences most strongly in Hissong\u2019s favor, we think that reasonable minds can reach different conclusions about whether Hissong stepped into the dark, and therefore, whether the step-in-the-dark rule bars her recovery. See <em>Atwater v. J.C. Castlebury </em>(1987), 84 N.C.App. 512, 353 S.E.2d 263 (whether plaintiff negligently \u201cstepped into the dark\u201d could not be determined as a matter of law when plaintiff stepped through a door into a dimly lighted building from a sunny outside and fell because the interior floor of the building was eight inches lower than the door\u2019s threshold, and plaintiff had never before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>entered the building, had no notice, and could not anticipate the lack of continuity between the threshold and the interior floor).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">{\u00b6 46} The third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">No attendant circumstances were present</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cAs a corollary to the open-and-obvious doctrine, we have recognized that there may be attendant circumstances [that] divert the individual\u2019s attention from [a] hazard and excuse her failure to observe it.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Olivier, </em>2005-Ohio-1910, 2005 WL 937928, at \u00b6 22. Hissong, in her second assignment of error,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> contends that attendant circumstances excuse her failure to see the steps. The trial court said that there were no attendant circumstances that distracted Hissong, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 48} Circumstances that are attendant \u201cwould come to the attention of the reasonable [person] * * * and reduce the degree of care that an ordinary person would exercise.\u201d <em>Huey v. Neal, </em>152 Ohio App.3d 146, 2003-Ohio-391, 787 N.E.2d 23, at \u00b6 13. The attendant circumstances here, Hissong suggests, relate to the fact that the cellar door, normally latched with the hook-and-eye latch for safety reasons, was not latched when she opened it. But Hissong said in her deposition that she did not see the latch: how was she distracted by it?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 49} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">{\u00b6 50} Overruling the second assignment of error but sustaining the first and third assignments of error, the trial court\u2019s order granting the Millers\u2019 summary judgment is reversed.
