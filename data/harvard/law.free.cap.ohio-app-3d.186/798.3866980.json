On this property, she built her home and a freestanding addition. Appellants Kristopher and Evelyn Sperry are Gayle\u2019s son and daughter-in-law. Together, the three appellants operate Myrddin Winery (\u201cthe winery\u201d), which they opened in May 2005 on Gayle\u2019s residentially zoned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">{\u00b6 3} Prior to commencing operations, appellants contacted the Milton Township Zoning Inspector at the time, Betsy Opre, to inform her of their planned home business and to inquire whether there were any local requirements for beginning such an operation. She informed them that there were no local permits necessary to start such a business and that they could begin their operations immediately. Appellants had already obtained the county, state, and federal permits and licenses required for operating the business. Appellants began operation of the winery based on the oral representation of Opre that they were permitted to do so. Zoning certificates in Milton Township are issued only orally by the zoning inspector and not in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">{\u00b6 4} As stated by the trial court, appellants\u2019 winery business is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cDefendants make and bottle wine on the premises and sell the wine and other shelf stable foods to customers who enter the premises for that purpose. The property contains 20 grape vines, of which only 12 are harvested. Defendants purchase other grapes and grape juices not grown on the property for use in the production of wine on the premises. The parties stipulate that ninety-five percent (95%) of the sales of bottled wine sold on the premises are from grapes and/or grape juices not planted, cultivated or harvested on the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">{\u00b6 6} To advertise its business, the winery has a three-by-nine inch \u201crack card\u201d with the winery\u2019s name and address on it that is displayed at the winery and some other local wineries. It has a website listed through the Ohio Department of Agriculture\u2019s website and in other publications. It also had a sign the size of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>political yard sign, an arrow on the winery\u2019s mailbox, and a sign located across the street from the winery, all informing visitors of the business\u2019s location. The winery also provides off-street parking to its patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">{\u00b6 7} Appellee filed a complaint pursuant to R.C. 519.24 on January 23, 2008, alleging that the winery was in violation of Milton Township Zoning Resolution, Section 5, B, \u201cR-l\u201d Residential District, and Section 4, Definitions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that appellants continued to operate the winery despite notice of their violation of the zoning resolution. Appellee asked that the court permanently enjoin appellants from using their property in violation of the Milton Township Zoning Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">{\u00b6 8} The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. They also stipulated to numerous facts and agreed that there were two issues for the trial court to determine: (1) Are the winery activities an agricultural use of the property as defined by R.C. 519.01; and (2) Is the winery exempt from zoning regulation by Milton Township pursuant to R.C. 519.21(A)?</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court answered both questions in the negative. The court found that the winery\u2019s activities of making wine and marketing wine and shelf stable-foods on the property were the primary uses and that agriculture was secondary. Therefore, the court found that the production of wine on the property was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>agriculture within the meaning of R.C. 519.01. The court further reasoned that because the activities conducted on the property were not an agricultural use of the property, R.C. 519.21(B) does not apply. Therefore, it found that the winery was not exempt from the local zoning regulations. Consequently, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied appellants\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">{\u00b6 10} Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal. On appellants\u2019 motion, this court issued a stay of the trial court\u2019s judgment pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">{\u00b6 11} Appellants raise three assignments of error. All of appellants\u2019 assignments of error allege that summary judgment in favor of appellee was incorrect. Thus, we will review appellants\u2019 assignments of error under the summary-judgment standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">{\u00b6 12} In reviewing an award of summary judgment, appellate courts must apply a de novo standard of review. <em>Cole v. Am. Industries &amp; Resources Corp. </em>(1998), 128 Ohio App.3d 546, 552, 715 N.E.2d 1179. Thus, an appellate court applies the same test as the trial court in determining whether summary judgment was proper. Civ.R. 56(C) provides that the trial court shall render summary judgment if no genuine issue of material fact exists and when construing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can only conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>State ex rel. Parsons v. Fleming </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">{\u00b6 13} Appellants\u2019 first and third assignments of error raise a similar issue. Therefore, we will address them together. They state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe trial court erred when it incorrectly interpreted R.C. \u00a7 519.01.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">(\u00b6 15} \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to consider whether appellants\u2019 activities in the operation of the winery were exempt from the Milton Township zoning regulation pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 519.21.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 519.01 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-12\">(\u00b6 17} \u201cAs used in section 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code, \u2018agriculture\u2019 includes farming; ranching; aquaculture; apiculture; horticulture; viticulture; animal husbandry, * * *; poultry husbandry * :]! *; dairy production; the production of field crops, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, nursery stock, ornamental shrubs, ornamental trees, flowers, sod, or mushrooms; timber; pasturage; any combination of the foregoing; <em>the processing, drying, storage, and marketing of agricultural products when those activities are conducted in conjunction with, but are secondary to, such husbandry or production.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">{\u00b6 18} The Ohio Supreme Court has consistently held that \u201c[statutes pertaining to the same subject matter are construed in pari materia.\u201d <em>Bartchy v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number><em>State Bd. of Edn., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 205, 2008-Ohio-4826, 897 N.E.2d 1096, at \u00b6 16; <em>State ex rel. Citizens for Open, Responsive &amp; Accountable Govt. v. Register, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 88, 2007-Ohio-5542, 876 N.E.2d 913, at \u00b6 28. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[a] code of statutes relating to one subject is presumed to be governed by one spirit and policy, and intended to be consistent and harmonious; and all of the several sections are to be considered, in order to arrive at the meaning of any part, unless a contrary intent is clearly manifest.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel Cromwell v. Myers </em>(1947), 80 Ohio App. 357, 364, 36 O.O. 62, 73 N.E.2d 218, quoting <em>Cincinnati v. Guckenberger </em>(1899), 60 Ohio St. 353, 54 N.E. 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">{\u00b6 19} Thus, a reading of R.C. 519.01 must also include consideration of R.C. 519.21, which is also at issue in this case. R.C. 519.21(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any township zoning commission, board of township trustees, or board of zoning appeals to prohibit the use of any land for agricultural purposes or the construction or use of buildings or structures incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which such buildings or structures are located, including buildings or structures that are used primarily for vinting and selling wine and that are located on land any part of which is used for viticulture, and no zoning certificate shall be required for any such building or structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">{\u00b6 21} Reading R.C. 519.01 together with R.C. 519.21(A) reveals that a township zoning commission may not prohibit the use of any land for \u201cagriculture.\u201d As stated above, agriculture is defined in R.C. 519.01 and includes viticulture.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">{\u00b6 22} Appellants argue here that the winery\u2019s activities qualify as \u201cagriculture\u201d as defined by R.C. 519.01, and therefore the zoning inspector has no power to limit the use of the land for purposes related to operating the winery.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants contend that the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cviticulture\u201d is incorrect. They assert that \u201cviticulture\u201d includes the growing of grapes for making wine.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court defined \u201cviticulture\u201d as \u201cthe production of wine.\u201d However, the application of this definition does not consider the growing of grapes in any way. Appellants were producing wine (fermenting, bottling, and labeling it) from the grapes and juice obtained off-site in addition to growing a small number of grapes on site.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">{\u00b6 25} However, as appellants assert, the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cviticulture\u201d is incorrect. Merriam-Webster\u2019s online dictionary defines \u201cviticulture\u201d as \u201cthe cultivation or culture of grapes especially for winemaking.\u201d http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/viticulture.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Given this definition of viticulture, we must go on to determine whether the \u201cbut are secondary to, such husbandry or production\u201d clause applies to viticulture.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants argue that the word \u201cproduction\u201d should be applied only to the words in the statute with which it is specifically used. They contend that because \u201cproduction\u201d is not used to describe \u201cviticulture,\u201d the phrase \u201cbut are secondary to, such husbandry or production\u201d does not apply to viticulture.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">{\u00b6 28} The word \u201cproduction\u201d appears in the phrases, \u201cthe production of poultry\u201d; \u201cdairy production\u201d; \u201cthe production of field crops, tobacco, fruits, vegetables, nursery stock, ornamental shrubs, flowers, sod, or mushrooms\u201d; and finally \u201cbut secondary to, such husbandry or production.\u201d The word \u201cproduction\u201d does not appear along with the words \u201cfarming; ranching; aquaculture; apiculture; horticulture; [or] viticulture.\u201d However, to dissect this statute in the way appellants suggest would mean that different activities that constitute agriculture are to be treated differently under the statute even though they are all part of the same definition. Such a result would be illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">{\u00b6 29} A simpler analysis of the statute yields the same result. The statute contains a list of items that constitute \u201cagriculture.\u201d One of the items on the list is \u201cviticulture,\u201d which we have already stated is the cultivation of grapes especially for wine making. Another item on the list is \u201cthe processing, drying, storage, and marketing of agricultural products when those activities are conducted in conjunction with, but are secondary to, such husbandry or production.\u201d Thus, this item of \u201cprocessing, drying, storing, and marketing\u201d is just another type of agriculture. And this type of agriculture requires that the \u201cprocessing, drying, storing, and marketing\u201d is secondary to the production of the agricultural products.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">{\u00b6 30} Appellants also contend that the use of semicolons in R.C. 519.01 should be construed to separate the clause \u201cbut are secondary to, such husbandry or production\u201d from the list of activities that appear at the beginning of the section, which includes \u201cviticulture.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">{\u00b6 31} This argument is not persuasive. In looking at the entire statute, we find the intent of the legislature clear: to define the activities that constitute \u201cagriculture.\u201d Appellants\u2019 acts of cultivating grapes for winemaking are clearly included as viticulture, and thus, agriculture. However, it is the remainder of appellants\u2019 activities (making wine from outside grapes and juices, advertising their products, selling shelf stable foods, etc.) that do not fit into any of the categories listed in R.C. 519.01. These activities are not encompassed in \u201cviticulture.\u201d Thus, the only possible category that they could fit into is \u201cthe processing, drying, storage, and marketing of agricultural products when those activities are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>conducted in conjunction with, but are secondary to, such husbandry or production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">{\u00b6 32} But there is no evidence in the record to suggest that viticulture is the primary activity at the winery and that the remaining activities are secondary. Instead, just the opposite is true. The property contains 20 grape vines, of which only 12 are harvested. Appellants purchase grapes and grape juices from vendors who ship the grapes and juices to appellants for processing, bottling, and selling. Wine and shelf-stable foods are sold on the premises. Ninety-five percent of the sales of bottled wine sold on the premises are from grapes/grape juices not planted, cultivated, and harvested on the property. Only five percent of the sales of bottled wine sold on the premises are from grapes planted, cultivated, and harvested on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">{\u00b6 33} These facts demonstrate that the primary activity on the property in question is not \u201cviticulture.\u201d Instead, the primary activities are the processing, bottling, and selling of wine. Thus, these activities are not \u201csecondary to\u201d the production of the agricultural products, i.e., the grapes cultivated for winemaking. Therefore, appellants\u2019 activities do not fit into the item of \u201cagriculture\u201d listed in R.C. 519.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">{\u00b6 34} Appellants contend that \u201csecondary\u201d has an alternate meaning. They assert that \u201csecondary\u201d can be defined as \u201cnot first in order of occurrence or development\u201d and that this meaning is appropriate to apply to the statute, citing, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secondary. But if the term \u201csecondary\u201d is interpreted to mean \u201cnot first in order of occurrence or development,\u201d it would be stripped of its meaning because of the nature of the temporal relationship that it describes. Appellants acknowledge as much in their brief when they state, \u201cTo market wine, one first has to have grapes grown for wine and then the wine itself, without which marketing would be a foolhardy endeavor.\u201d Therefore, this argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, appellants assert that reading R.C. 519.01 and 519.21(A) in pari materia manifests the legislature\u2019s intent to protect winemaking operations from zoning restrictions. They allege that by reading the statutes together, it becomes clear that \u201cagriculture\u201d includes viticulture <em>and </em>selling wine.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">{\u00b6 36} Appellants\u2019 argument here relies on R.C. 519.21(A)\u2019s language that allows for buildings used for vinting and selling wine that are located on land \u201cany part of which is used for viticulture.\u201d But a close reading of the statute reveals that while the buildings and structures used for vinting are permitted without prohibition from zoning ordinances, these buildings must be <em>incident to </em>the agricultural purpose. The statute explicitly states that a zoning commission may not prohibit the use of land for two purposes: (1) agricultural purposes or (2) the construction of buildings or structures <em>incident to </em>the use for agricultural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>purposes of the land on which the buildings are located. Included in the second purpose are buildings or structures used primarily for vinting and selling wine and that are located on land any part of which is used for viticulture. The statute goes on to state that no zoning certificate is required for any such building.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">{\u00b6 37} In examining the zoning exception set out in R.C. 519.21, the Third District held that \u201cstructure-use must be \u2018directly and immediately\u2019 related to agricultural use.\u201d <em>State v. Huffman </em>(1969), 20 Ohio App.2d 263, 269, 253 N.E.2d 812. Furthermore, \u201cthe plain language of the statute [R.C. 519.21(A) ] requires the building or structure to be incident to the agricultural purpose. In other words, <em>the agricultural purpose must be the primary use of the property.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Concord Twp. Trustees v. Hazelwood Builders Inc., </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-L-012, 2005-Ohio-1791, 2005 WL 880222, at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">{\u00b6 38} In this case, as discussed above, the agricultural purpose here was <em>not </em>the primary use of the property. Any building or structure used for vinting and selling wine here was not \u201cincident to\u201d the primary purpose of agriculture. Instead, the vinting and selling was the primary purpose. Consequently, appellants do not fall under the zoning exception set out in R.C. 519.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">{\u00b6 39} Based on the foregoing analysis, appellants\u2019 first and third assignments of error are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">(\u00b6 40} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court erred when it determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact that defendant-appellants\u2019 activities operating a winery were not \u2018agriculture\u2019 and that plaintiff appellee was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">{\u00b6 42} Appellants first argue that the record demonstrates that there are material facts that, when applying the trial court\u2019s definition of viticulture, precluded the court from granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">{\u00b6 43} Appellants\u2019 argument here must fail based on our earlier conclusion that the trial court\u2019s definition of \u201cviticulture\u201d was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">{\u00b6 44} Appellants next argue that there is no evidence in the record to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the marketing or selling of wine is of greater value or importance than the cost incurred for the cultivation of grapes and fruit for the production of wine. They argue that there are no facts in the record demonstrating the respective values of the grapes and plants planted on the property, the value of grapes and juice obtained off-site, or the value of the winery\u2019s marketing and selling efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">{\u00b6 45} Appellants are correct that there are no values in the record for the grapes and plants grown on the property, for the grapes and juice obtained from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>other sources, or for the winery\u2019s marketing and selling efforts. However, the actual values of the grapes and plants grown on the property and the other items are not material facts in this case. The fact remains that no matter what the value of the grapes, juices, marketing, etc., 95 percent of the sales of wine are from grapes and juices not grown or harvested on the property. Consequently, the lack of exact values for the items, which appellants take issue with, does not affect the court\u2019s summary-judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">{\u00b6 46} Appellants also make several other arguments concerning Milton Township\u2019s zoning resolution. First, they argue that their activities in operation of the winery comply with the \u201cagriculture\u201d use in Section 5(B)(1)(a). Second, they argue that Milton Township did not follow its own zoning resolution and that they relied on the representations made by Milton Township\u2019s zoning inspector that they were permitted to open the winery. Finally, they argue that there is no evidence that their activities were in violation of the \u201cHome Occupation\u201d restrictions in the zoning resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">{\u00b6 47} The arguments that appellants now raise were not before the trial court to decide, and therefore, we will not address them here. As noted previously, the parties entered into numerous stipulations in this case. In addition to stipulations of fact, the parties stipulated as to the issues for review. The stipulated issues were (1) whether the winery\u2019s activities are an agricultural use of the property as defined by R.C. 519.01 and (2) whether the winery is exempt from zoning regulation pursuant to R.C. 519.21(A). The arguments that appellants now raise do not fall under either of these limited stipulated issues for review. The trial court decided both of the issues before it. We too have reviewed both stipulated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">{\u00b6 48} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">{\u00b6 49} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b839-10\">Waite, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b839-11\">DeGenaro, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. {\u00b6 a}These sections provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">{Hb}\"Uses permitted.

Appellants\u2019 use of their property as a winery falls under the zoning exception set forth in R.C. 519.21(A) and thus is not subject to regulation by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>{\u00b6 51} As an initial matter, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that agriculture includes viticulture, the proper definition of which is \u201cthe cultivation or culture of grapes especially for winemaking.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 25, quoting Merriam-Webster\u2019s online dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/viticulture. Appellants\u2019 cultivation of 20 grapevines on the property clearly constitutes viticulture.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">{\u00b6 52} I also agree that appellants\u2019 additional activities, to wit, making wine from outside grapes and juices, advertising their products, and selling shelf-stable foods, do not constitute \u201cagriculture.\u201d As defined by R.C. 519.01, \u201cagriculture includes * * * the processing drying, storage, and marketing of agricultural products when those activities are conducted in conjunction with, but are secondary to, such husbandry or production.\u201d Here, the record reveals that appellants\u2019 wine-making activities are presently not secondary to their viticultural activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">{\u00b6 53} However, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that appellants\u2019 winery does not fall under the zoning exception set forth in R.C. 519.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">{\u00b6 54} R.C. 519.21(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, sections 519.02 to 519.25 of the Revised Code confer no power on any township zoning commission, board of township trustees, or board of zoning appeals to prohibit the use of any land for agricultural purposes or the construction or use of buildings or structures incident to the use for agricultural purposes of the land on which such buildings or structures are located, <em>including buildings or structures that are used primarily for vinting and selling wine and that are located on land any part of which is used for viticulture, </em>and no zoning certificate shall be required for any such building or structure.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">{\u00b6 56} In statutory interpretation, legislative intent is paramount. <em>Bailey v. Republic Engineered Steels, Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 38, 39, 741 N.E.2d 121. In order to determine legislative intent, it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that a court must first examine the language of the statute. <em>State v. Jordan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 488, 492, 733 N.E.2d 601. Further, it is well established that a specific statutory provision prevails over a conflicting general provision. <em>Springdale v. CSX Ry. Corp. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 371, 376, 627 N.E.2d 534, citing <em>State v. Volpe </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 191, 193, 527 N.E.2d 818; see also R.C. 1.51. Here, R.C. 519.21(A) provides a specific zoning exception with regard to buildings and structures used for vinting operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">{\u00b6 57} R.C. 519.21(A) precludes township zoning authorities from prohibiting the use of buildings or structures incident to the agricultural use of the land. R.C. 519.21(A) then provides a specific example of buildings or structures that are \u201cincident\u201d to agricultural use, namely, \u201cbuildings or structures that are used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>primarily for vinting and selling wine and that are located on land any part of which is used for viticulture.\u201d In other words, buildings or structures which are used primarily for vinting and selling wine and are located on land any part of which is used for viticulture <em>are </em>incident to the agricultural use of the land. A township has no power to regulate such buildings or structures pursuant to R.C. 519.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">{\u00b6 58} I agree with the position of amici curiae, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation and Mahoning County Farm Bureau, that the language of R.C. 519.21(A) unambiguously reveals a choice by the legislature to prohibit township zoning of the viticulture industry except in limited circumstances. Further, I find persuasive their argument that the legislature\u2019s use of vinting operations as a specific statutory example shows its recognition of the reality that all grapes used in vinting operations are rarely produced at the same location where the processing and winemaking occurs. Indeed, there was testimony by appellant Gayle Sperry that cultivation of a single grapevine can take several years. This reality necessitates the use of outside grapes to allow a viticulture and vinting operation to sustain itself in its infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">{\u00b6 59} Based on the plain language of the statute, the R.C. 519.21(A) exception applies to appellants\u2019 winery. It is undisputed that appellants use part of the land for viticulture. The property contains 20 grape vines, 12 of which are harvested. The remaining eight are still growing. In addition, the main building on the property is primarily used for vinting and selling wine. In her deposition, Gayle Sperry testified that the wine-making process, including the crushing, destemming, fermenting, aging, bottling and labeling of the wine, takes place inside the main building. Further, all equipment used in this process is stored in the building. Potential buyers are entertained, enjoy wine and shelf-stable foods, and purchase wine in the building as well. And zoning inspector Jenifer Terry concluded that the primary use for the building is vinting, as she testified in her deposition that appellants\u2019 operation had <em>\u201cgone </em>way above and beyond a home occupation.\u201d Therefore, based on my reading of R.C. 519.21(A), I conclude that appellants\u2019 winery falls squarely into the zoning exception. The winery is incident to the agricultural use of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">{\u00b6 60} The majority cites Concord Twp. <em>Trustees v. Hazelwood Builders, Inc., </em>11th Dist. No. 2004-L-012, 2005-Ohio-1791, 2005 WL 880222, in support of the proposition that in order for a structure to be \u201cincident to\u201d agricultural use, \u201cthe agricultural purpose must be the primary use of the property.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 41. However, <em>Hazelwood Builders </em>is factually distinguishable in that it did not involve the specific example provided by the statute, i.e., a structure or building primarily used for vinting and selling wine. Rather, <em>Hazelwood Builders </em>con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>cerned animal husbandry, more specifically, the proposed use of a residence for dog breeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">{\u00b6 61} In sum, because appellants\u2019 winery was incident to the agricultural use, as specified in R.C. 519.21(A), I would hold that appellee had no power to regulate it. Accordingly, I would hold that appellants\u2019 third assignment of error is meritorious and would reverse the judgment of the trial court on that basis.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
