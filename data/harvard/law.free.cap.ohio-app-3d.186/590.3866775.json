Jones, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant and cross-appellee, Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals (\u201cBZA\u201d), appeals the judgment of the trial court reversing the decision of the BZA to deny variances to defendants-appellees and cross-appellants, Ian Abrams and Cleveland Scrap (collectively \u201cAbrams\u201d). Finding some merit to the appeal, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">{\u00b6 2} On April 25, 2006, the city of Cleveland (\u201ccity\u201d) filed a complaint for injunctive relief. The city\u2019s complaint sought to enjoin Abrams from operating a scrap business on East 55th Street in Cleveland. The city\u2019s complaint alleged violations of numerous sections of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances, specifically ordinances 327.02(C), 676.02, 345.02, 347.06(d), 3105.01(a), and 3101.10(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">{\u00b6 3} After preliminary negotiations, the parties agreed that Abrams would apply to the city and appeal to the BZA for three variances at the property. The three variances were (1) to expand the use of the scrap yard into the residence-industry area, (2) to expand the use of the scrap yard to the hilltop and for auto wrecking at the property, and (3) to change the use of adjacent land from automobile storage to scrap yard and auto-wrecking use.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2006, an agreed judgment entry was submitted to the municipal housing court, in which the parties agreed that Abrams would continue operating at the property pending the BZA hearing, would keep the residence-industry area of the property clear of all containers, scrap, and debris, and would maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the street adjacent to the property clear of trash and debris while the case was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">{\u00b6 5} In July 2006, the BZA held a public hearing in which it heard the variance requests by Abrams. Following the hearing, the BZA denied the three variance requests. Abrams then filed an administrative appeal with the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. The trial court set a briefing schedule, ordering Abrams to file his brief by March 2, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 6} On February 28, 2007, Abrams filed a motion requesting a de novo trial, but did not file his assignments of error and brief. The BZA filed an objection to Abrams\u2019s request for a de novo trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 7} On May 2, 2007, the trial court issued the following journal entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c Final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cUpon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, the court affirms the order of the Cleveland Board of Zoning Appeals, finding that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. Appellant moves for trial de novo based on the admission of evidence into the record which had not been given under oath. Although appellant was represented by counsel at the administrative hearing, neither counsel nor the appellant objected to the admission of such evidence at the administrative proceeding therefore such error is waived * * *. Final.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 10} On May 15, 2007, Abrams filed a motion to reconsider with the trial court, claiming that the court had \u201cprematurely\u201d issued its decision and that the court was required to hold a hearing on the issues Abrams presented on appeal and a de novo trial on \u201cconstitutional issues.\u201d Abrams did not appeal the court\u2019s May 2, 2007 decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">{\u00b6 11} On June 5, 2007, the trial court issued an order granting, in part, Abrams\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The trial court affirmed the decision of the BZA as to the nonconstitutional issues but decided it would allow Abrams to go forward with his constitutional claims. The journal entry also stated that the May 2, 2007 journal entry was \u201cset aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">{\u00b6 12} Abrams filed two more motions for reconsideration, and the parties proceeded with the case throughout the rest of 2008 and 2009, but the case never proceeded to a hearing or trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>{\u00b6 13} During this time, the litigation on the original complaint filed by the city also moved through the municipal housing court, under case No. 06CVH11526, and this court. In 2008, we issued an opinion finding that the preliminary injunction issued by the housing court was vague, rendering it invalid, that the property was exempt from city ordinances, and that Abrams was maintaining a prior nonconforming use. <em>Cleveland v. Abrams, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 89904 and 89929, 2008-Ohio-4589, 2008 WL 4174974 <em>(\u2018Abrams I </em>\u201d). Our court remanded the case to the housing court. On remand, the housing court held a trial and issued a permanent injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">{\u00b6 14} Subsequent to our decision in <em>Abrams I, </em>the BZA and Abrams met with the trial court handling the administrative appeal. Abrams requested that the BZA\u2019s decision be vacated, rendered moot, and/or reversed based on <em>Abrams I. </em>On February 27, 2009, the trial court issued a decision ruling that the BZA\u2019s decision was vacated and rendered moot based on our decision in <em>Abrams I. </em>On March 24, 2009, the trial court issued an entry modifying the language of the February 27, 2009 decision to state that the BZA\u2019s order denying the variances was \u201chereby vacated and reversed as moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 15} The BZA is now appealing the trial court\u2019s March 24, 2009 ruling, and raises three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cI. The Common Pleas Court\u2019s decision to vacate and reverse as moot the Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019s decision on an interim ruling by the Court of Appeals was improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">\u201cII. The Common Pleas Court\u2019s affirmation of the Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019s decision on May 2, 2007 was a final, not interlocutory order that was never appealed by the opposing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">\u201cHI. The Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019s decision should not have been vacated and reversed as moot based on the evidence or case law that did not exist at the time the Board of Zoning Appeals\u2019s decision was rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 16} Abrams also filed a cross-appeal, raising 15 assignments of error. See appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">{\u00b6 17} Because we find the second assignment of error dispositive of this case, we will consider it first.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Motions for Reconsideration in Administrative Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"Aa8y\">{\u00b6 18} In the second assignment of error, the BZA argues that the trial court erred when it vacated and reversed as moot its May 2, 2007 order, because that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>order was a final, appealable order that Abrams never appealed. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 19} Again, Abrams filed a motion for reconsideration with the trial court after the court issued its ruling on May 2, 2007, affirming the BZA. As an initial step, we must determine whether a motion for reconsideration in an administrative appeal is allowable. Abrams argues that since his appeal to the trial court was an administrative appeal, the Appellate Rules as opposed to the Rules of Civil Procedure should apply to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2505.03(B) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cUnless, in the case of an administrative-related appeal, Chapter 119. or other sections of the Revised Code apply, such an appeal is governed by this chapter and, to the extent this chapter does not contain a relevant provision, the Rules of Appellate Procedure. When an administrative-related appeal is so governed, if it is necessary in applying the Rules of Appellate Procedure to such an appeal, the administrative officer, agency, board, department, tribunal, commission, or other instrumentality shall be treated as if it were a trial court whose final order, judgment, or decree is the subject of an appeal to a court of appeals or as if it were a clerk of such a trial court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">{\u00b6 22} There is no provision in R.C. Chapter 119, R.C. Chapter 2505, or other sections of the Revised Code that governs motions for reconsideration. Thus, at first glance, it appears that the Rules of Appellate Procedure, specifically App.R. 26, would govern in this instance. App.R. 26 states that an \u201c[ajpplication for reconsideration of any cause or motion submitted on appeal shall be made in writing before the judgment or order of the court has been approved by the court and filed by the court with the clerk for journalization or within ten days after the announcement of the court\u2019s decision, whichever is the later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 23} In 1981, however, the Ohio Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure do not prescribe motions for reconsideration after a final judgment in the trial court.\u201d <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105, paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, \u201call judgments or final orders from said motion are a nullity.\u201d Id. at 381, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 24} <em>Pitts </em>was an administrative appeal to a court of common pleas from a decision of the State Personnel Board of Review. And in <em>Pitts, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court unequivocally stated that motions for reconsideration of a final judgment are a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">(\u00b6 25} In 1997, the Ohio Supreme Court again held that motions for reconsideration in administrative appeals are not permissible when it remanded an administrative appeal to the Sixth Appellate District in <em>VFW Post 1238 v. Liquor Control </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number><em>Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 1482, 678 N.E.2d 946. In <em>VFW Post 1238, </em>the Liquor Control Commission filed a motion for reconsideration with the trial court after the court suspended the VFW\u2019s liquor license for 30 days. See <em>VFW Post 1238 v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(Sept. 22, 1997), Huron App. No. H-97-026, 1997 WL 614938. The trial court granted the motion for reconsideration, amended the suspension to 180 days, and the VFW appealed. On appeal, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court on the basis that the search the commission had conducted was not reasonable. The Ohio Supreme Court certified the case based on the search-and-seizure issue, but reversed the judgment of the appellate court finding that the VFW untimely filed its appeal as the appeal had been filed more than 30 days after the original judgment. Id. The court reinstated the trial court\u2019s original judgment suspending the liquor license for 30 days, and stated that its decision was based on the authority in <em>Pitts. </em>Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 26} On remand, in 1997 WL 614938, the appellate court noted the seeming inconsistency between the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in both <em>Pitts </em>and <em>VFW Post 1238 </em>with R.C. 2505.03(B). Id. at fn. 1. The court stated that because there is no mention of motions for reconsideration in R.C. Chapter 119, the Appellate Rules should apply to the motion for reconsideration. Id. The court went so far as to opine that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning was \u201cwrong,\u201d but conceded that it was bound by the law of the case and held that the commission could not appeal the original judgment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 27} In a later decision by the same district, the court noted that based on the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Pitts </em>and <em>VFW Post 1238, </em>it had no choice but to rule that the trial court\u2019s ruling in an administrative appeal on a motion for reconsideration was a nullity. <em>Luna v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Serv., </em>Lucas App. No. L-02-1146, 2002-Ohio-6359, 2002 WL 31630753; see also <em>Carroll v. Flexible Personnel, Inc. </em>(July 16, 1999), Williams App. No. WM-98-029, 1999 WL 502147.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 28} That being said, we note that other appellate districts have held that motions for reconsideration filed in accordance with App.R. 26 may be considered in an administrative appeal to a trial court. In <em>Miller v. Sts. Peter &amp; Paul School </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 762, 711 N.E.2d 311, the Eleventh District found that the trial court may rule on a motion for reconsideration since \u201cthe court of common pleas was not functioning as a trial court, but as an appellate court. As a result the Appellate Rules apply, and the court of common pleas could properly consider appellees\u2019 motion for reconsideration pursuant to App.R. 26(A).\u201d Id. at 764, 711 N.E.2d 311. See also <em>Leifheit v. Palmyra Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(June 22, 2001), Portage App. No. 99-P-0112, 2001 WL 703870; and <em>Morrison v. Dept. of Ins., </em>Gallia App. No. 01CA13, 2002-Ohio-5986, 2002 WL 31432102 (both citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Miller </em>and finding that motions for reconsideration may be considered by a trial court in an administrative appeal).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 29} While our district has not previously had the opportunity to rule on this issue, it is clear that we must follow the precedent established by the Ohio Supreme Court. <em>Pitts </em>made no exception for motions for reconsideration in administrative appeals. Therefore, based on <em>Pitts, </em>we find that the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider Abrams\u2019s motions for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 30} Even if we were to find that the Appellate Rules applied to motions for reconsideration filed with the trial court in an administrative appeal, we would still find that the trial court incorrectly considered Abrams\u2019s motions for reconsideration. App.R. 26(A) clearly states that an \u201c[ajpplication for reconsideration of any cause or motion submitted on appeal shall be made in writing before the judgment or order of the court has been approved by the court and filed by the court with the clerk for journalization or within ten days after the announcement of the court\u2019s decision, whichever is the later.\u201d The trial court issued its ruling on May 2, 2007. Abrams did not file his first motion for reconsideration until May 15, 2007. Therefore, his motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Final Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 31} Next, Abrams argues that the May 2, 2007 order was not final because it did not dispose of his constitutional claims. We disagree. R.C. 2505.02 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cAn order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, [or] an order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding * * * is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 33} The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[f]or an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for the party appealing, it must dispose of the whole merits of the cause or some separate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the court.\u201d <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Dev. Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 34} We find that the court\u2019s entry of judgment with respect to the administrative appeal satisfies the requirements of R.C. 2505.02. See <em>Hausman v. Dayton </em>(Dec. 22, 1993), Montgomery App. No. 13647, 1993 WL 541649, affirmed in part and reversed in part on other grounds (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 671, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>653 N.E.2d 1190. Because the trial court\u2019s May 2, 2007 judgment disposed of all claims as to all parties in the appeals, Civ.R. 54(B) is not implicated, and hence the judgment is final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 35} Moreover, even if the trial court erred in entering judgment without holding a de novo trial on the constitutional issues that Abrams allegedly raised in his pleadings, Abrams\u2019s proper recourse at that time was to file a direct appeal or to pursue a motion pursuant to Civ.R. 60(B). Abrams filed neither. See <em>Bencin v. Bd. of Bldg. &amp; Zoning Appeals, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 92991, 2009-Ohio-5570, 2009 WL 3387695 (appellant, in an administrative appeal, filed a direct appeal after trial court failed to hold a de novo hearing on constitutional issues, and we reversed and remanded the case for trial). We do not find that Abrams\u2019s argument that the court failed to dispose of his constitutional claims has merit, especially since Abrams declined to follow Loc.R. 28 or the trial court\u2019s briefing schedule when he chose not to submit his assignments of error and brief that could have set forth any constitutional claims he claimed to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, we hold that the motion to reconsider the May 2, 2007 ruling will not lie, and all judgments or final orders from the motion are a nullity. Thus, Abrams could have only appealed the May 2, 2007 decision, and he failed to do so in a timely manner. See App.R. 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 37} The second assignment of error is well taken. We find that the original order of May 2, 2007, was the only final, appealable order and Abrams did not appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 38} Therefore, we reverse the decision of the trial court. We further find that the BZA\u2019s remaining assignments of error are moot and the assignments of error brought forth by Abrams in his cross-appeal are also moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, the judgments of the trial court following the May 2, 2007 order are vacated, and the trial court\u2019s judgment entry filed on May 2, 2007, and journalized May 10, 2007, is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b629-11\">Sean C. Gallagher, A.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b629-12\">James J. Sweeney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-12\">.

Abrams appealed that decision to this court and we recently reversed and vacated the grant of the permanent injunction. <em>Cleveland v. Abrams, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 92843 and 92844, 2010-Ohio-662, 2010 WL 664144.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\">. While <em>Miller </em>cites <em>Pitts </em>for the general proposition that a motion for reconsideration is a nullity under the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, the court did not take notice that <em>Pitts </em>itself was an administrative appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b629-13\">Sean C. Gallagher, Administrative Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqhG\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">{\u00b6 40} I concur with the judgment of the majority. We are bound by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Pitts v. Ohio Dept. of Transp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 378, 21 O.O.3d 238, 423 N.E.2d 1105, and <em>VFW Post 1238 v. Liquor Control Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 1482, 678 N.E.2d 946. Both of those cases involved administrative appeals in the trial court, and in both cases, the court held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>motion for reconsideration was not permitted in the trial court following a final, appealable order. However, I recognize that these decisions did not address the rule that in administrative appeals, the common pleas court is governed by the Appellate Rules. See R.C. 2505.03(B); <em>Luna v. Ohio Dept. of Job &amp; Family Servs., </em>Lucas App. No. L-02-1146, 2002-Ohio-6359, 2002 WL 31630753; <em>Carroll v. Flexible Personnel, Inc. </em>(July 16, 1999), Williams App. No. WM-98-029, 1999 WL 502147. This is an issue that the Ohio Supreme Court may wish to revisit. In any event, the motion for reconsideration that was filed was untimely. It also appears that the issues raised in this appeal may be moot because of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cleveland v. Abrams, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 92843 and 92844, 2010-Ohio-662, 2010 WL 664144. Notwithstanding, I concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 41} <em>Cross-appellant\u2019s assignments of error</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cI.
