Burnside was convicted of felonious assault after a bench trial before a visiting judge in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas. The court sentenced him to five years of community control. Burnside appeals from his conviction, claiming that he did not validly waive his right to a jury trial and that his case was not properly assigned to a visiting judge. For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be reversed, and the matter will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b766-16\">{\u00b6 2} In September 2008, Burnside was indicted for felonious assault by means of a deadly weapon. The charge arose from an altercation with Lavon Robinson, during which Burnside allegedly hit Robinson with a steel martial-arts baton. After several continuances, trial was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on April 13, 2009. The transcript begins on April 14, 2009; it is not clear from the record what proceedings, if any, took place on April 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-17\">{\u00b6 3} On April 14, 2009, prior to that day\u2019s proceedings, Burnside expressed a desire to waive his right to a jury trial. At 8:53 a.m. on that date, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>discussed the matter with Burnside, defense counsel, and the prosecutor in chambers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay. We\u2019re on the record. And this State of Ohio versus Paul A. Burnside, excuse me, case number 2008-CR-3027. And Mr. Burnside is present here in chambers. The jury is awaiting his decision on whether or not he wants to proceed with them or proceed [to] trial by the Court. Mr. Ben Swift is his - [Mr. Swift\u2019s cell phone rings].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cMR. SWIFT: Can we pause for a second?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTHE COURT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cMR. SWIFT: This is one of the witnesses, his daughter. Can you hold one second? I need to speak with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. Let\u2019s put this on pause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(off record)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cTHE BAILIFF: We\u2019re back on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTHE COURT: All right. Mr. Burnside, you are here for a jury trial today. Your counsel has indicated that you want to forego the jury trial, and you want the case to be tried by the Court. Now I need to explain to you a few things, and then you can make your final decision. I see you signed this jury waiver, but I won\u2019t accept it until I hear you say that that\u2019s, in fact, what you want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-12\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cYou have a constitutional right to have your case - criminal case tried before a jury of 12 people. You understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-14\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTHE COURT: And that jury will hear the facts, and they will come up with a finding. Their finding will either be guilty or not guilty, and they must make that unanimously. All 12 jurors must agree to that finding. You understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-15\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-16\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTHE COURT: And of course, if they can\u2019t agree, that\u2019s the third option, and that\u2019s a hung jury, but we don\u2019t particularly care for those. We like to have the guilty or not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-17\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIn any event, you also, if you wish, have the right to waive that constitutional right and ask the Court to proceed without a jury. And if that\u2019s the case, then the case is tried before the Court. And what that means is it\u2019s tried before the Judge, and that would be me on this particular day in this case. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>{\u00b6 18} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cTHE COURT: Now you don\u2019t - the State has to prove the case against you beyond a reasonable doubt. They have to convince 12 people. And those 12 people, there could be a couple of people in there that don\u2019t accept that the State has done that, and they say no, I\u2019m not going to vote for a guilty finding. You do it before the Judge, he\u2019s only got to convince one person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cTHE COURT: So you have to balance that, whether that\u2019s an advantage or a disadvantage, in making your decision. Do you have any questions about waiving the jury or any questions about this subject that we\u2019re talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: You\u2019re fair, right? You\u2019re a fair judge, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cTHE COURT: Well, I\u2019d like to think so. Now I\u2019m not so sure that there\u2019s others out there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cTHE COURT: \u2014on behalf of the State or the defense that would say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-12\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yeah. I\u2019ll waive. I\u2019ll waive it then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-13\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cTHE COURT: You want to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-15\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cTHE COURT: You want to give up your right to the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-16\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-17\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cTHE COURT: And you have signed this jury waiver here? That\u2019s your signature?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-18\">(\u00b6 32} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-19\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTHE COURT: Very well. Then we\u2019ll proceed with the trial to the Court soon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-20\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-21\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cTHE COURT: Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-22\">{\u00b6 36} A written jury waiver was filed at 9:15 a.m. on April 14, 2009. The waiver stated: \u201cI, Paul Burnside, defendant in the above cause, hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury, and elect to be tried by a Judge of the Court in which the said cause may be pending. I fully understand that under the laws of this state, I have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u201d The waiver was signed by Burnside and his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>{\u00b6 37} At approximately 9:30 a.m., the court reconvened in the courtroom. At that time, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cAll right. Okay. We\u2019re here on the State of Ohio versus Paul Burnside. Jury has been waived. We are awaiting the State\u2019s representative, in present, in court. But that doesn\u2019t matter. The Defendant is present in court and the prosecut \u2014 or defense counsel, I think, are ready to go. Correct gentlemen?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">{\u00b6 39} Defense counsel responded, \u201cDefendant is ready, Judge.\u201d The court indicated: \u201cWe\u2019re going to move into an opening statement here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">{\u00b6 40} Burnside\u2019s case was then tried to the court. Upon consideration of all of the evidence submitted, the court found Burnside guilty of felonious assault. In May 2009, Burnside was sentenced to community-control sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">{\u00b6 41} Burnside appeals from his convictions, raising two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">{\u00b6 42} Burnside\u2019s first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe trial court prejudicially erred by conducting a bench trial when the jury waiver was not made in open court, which is a strict-compliance jurisdictional requirement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">{\u00b6 44} In his first assignment of error, Burnside claims that he did not validly waive his right to a jury trial, because he did not waive that right in open court, as required by R.C. 2945.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">{\u00b6 45} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the right to a jury trial. Likewise, under Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, a defendant\u2019s right to a trial by jury is inviolate. A defendant may, however, elect to waive this constitutional right. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(a); <em>Duncan v. Louisiana </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 145, 158, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (expressing \u201cno constitutional doubts about the practices * * * of accepting waivers of jury trial\u201d); <em>Patton v. United States </em>(1930), 281 U.S. 276, 293, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854, overruled on other grounds by <em>Williams v. Florida </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446; R.C. 2945.05; Crim.R. 23(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-14\">{\u00b6 46} It is also true that a state may, by statute or constitution, grant a defendant additional rights. For example, a petty offense does not involve the federal constitutional right to a jury trial, e.g., <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S. at 159, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, and <em>Lewis v. United States </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 322, 116 S.Ct. 2163, 135 L.Ed.2d 590, although Ohio and many other states afford that right to certain defendants charged with petty offenses. R.C. 2945.17; Crim.R. 23(A). See <em>State v. Tate </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 50, 13 O.O.3d 36, 391 N.E.2d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 47} In Ohio, Crim.R. 23 and R.C. 2945.05 govern a felony defendant\u2019s waiver of his jury-trial rights. Crim.R. 23(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cIn serious offense cases the defendant before commencement of the trial may knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waive in writing his right to trial by jury. Such waiver may also be made during trial with the approval of the court and the consent of the prosecuting attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">{\u00b6 49} R.C. 2945.05 sets forth the manner in which a defendant may waive this right. <em>State v. Lomax, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 350, 2007-Ohio-4277, 872 N.E.2d 279, \u00b6 6. That statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cIn all criminal cases pending in courts of record in this state, the defendant may waive a trial by jury and be tried by the court without a jury. Such waiver by a defendant, shall be in writing, signed by the defendant, and filed in said cause and made a part of the record thereof. It shall be entitled in the court and cause, and in substance as follows: T_, defendant in the above cause, hereby voluntarily waive and relinquish my right to a trial by jury, and elect to be tried by a Judge of the Court in which the said cause may be pending. I fully understand that under the laws of this state, I have a constitutional right to a trial by jury.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-10\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cSuch waiver of trial by jury must be made in open court after the defendant has been arraigned and has had opportunity to consult with counsel. Such waiver may be withdrawn by the defendant at any time before the commencement of the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-11\">{\u00b6 52} Similarly, the waiver of counsel, the return of the jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal case, and the statement of the underlying agreement for a negotiated plea in a felony case all must occur \u201cin open court.\u201d See Crim.R. 11(F), Crim.R. 31(A), 44(C). In contrast, Crim.R. 22 requires that all proceedings involving serious criminal offenses be recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">{\u00b6 53} Based on this authority, the Supreme Court of Ohio has identified five conditions that must be satisfied in order for a jury waiver to be valid. <em>Lomax, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 350, 2007-Ohio-4277, 872 N.E.2d 279, at \u00b6 9. The jury waiver must be \u201c(1) in writing, (2) signed by the defendant, (3) filed, (4) made part of the record, and (5) made in open court.\u201d Id. Trial courts must strictly comply with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05. <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 337, 339, 658 N.E.2d 766; <em>Jackson v. Dallman </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 261, 262, 638 N.E.2d 563. \u201cIn the absence of strict compliance with R.C. 2945.05, a trial court lacks jurisdiction to try the defendant without a jury.\u201d <em>Pless, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 337, 658 N.E.2d 766.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>{\u00b6 54} Burnside does not dispute that the first four requirements were satisfied. He signed a written waiver, which was filed and made part of the record; the form complied with the statutory language. He claims, however, that the trial court did not satisfy the open-court requirement, because his waiver was given during proceedings conducted in chambers, which, he claims, is not synonymous with proceedings in open court. Burnside asserts that the court\u2019s subsequent passing comment in the courtroom that the jury had been waived was inadequate to satisfy R.C. 2945.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">{\u00b6 55} R.C. 2945.05 does not define \u201cin open court.\u201d In the context of Crim.R. 44(C), which requires that a waiver of counsel be \u201cin open court\u201d and \u201crecorded,\u201d we have concluded that a waiver of counsel made only during an in-chambers conference did not satisfy the open-court requirement. <em>State v. Ware </em>(Dec. 30, 1999), Montgomery App. No. 17610, 1999 WL 1267028. See also <em>In re Guardianship of Melhom, </em>Montgomery App. No. 22764, 2009-Ohio-2424, 2009 WL 1448969 (noting that the probate court failed to make a record \u201cin open court\u201d or \u201cin chambers\u201d). In <em>Ware, </em>we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cThe term \u2018open court\u2019 means that court is in session, and that the judge is on the bench. <em>Linden v. Bates Truck Lines, Inc. </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 178, 4 OBR 280, 446 N.E.2d 1139. This court itself has stated that \u2018according to custom and usage, [in open court] means during a <em>public </em>proceeding conducted on the record after notice and an opportunity to be heard has been given to all parties whose rights are or may be affected thereby.\u2019 <em>State v. Grooms </em>(Apr. 25, 1997), Montgomery App. No. 16002, 1997 WL 205993, unreported, at 1. The First District Court of Appeals has recently pointed out that: \u2018An open courtroom is necessary to preserve and support the fair administration of justice because it encourages witnesses to come forward and be heard by the public, discourages perjury by the witnesses, and ensures that the judge and prosecutor will carry out their duties properly.\u2019 <em>State v. Sanders </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 92, 96-97, 719 N.E.2d 619, citing <em>State v. Lane </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 112, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338.\u201d (Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>Lomax, </em>the Supreme Court attempted \u201cto clarify the meaning of the \u2018open court\u2019 requirement in R.C. 2945.05\u201d and to determine the significance of written waivers with respect to the statute\u2019s open-court requirement. <em>Lomax, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 350, 2007-Ohio-4277, 872 N.E.2d 279, at \u00b6 1. In that case, the defendant had signed a written waiver, but the court did not question him or \u201cinform him of anything.\u201d Instead, the trial court merely noted that there would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>be a waiver of jury trial, stating, \u201cSince there\u2019s going to be a jury waiver, does the State care to make an opening statement at this time?\u201d Id. at \u00b6 10, 45. As stated by the Supreme Court: \u201cAside from this passing reference to a jury waiver, the trial court did not address Lomax and have him acknowledge in the courtroom and in the presence of counsel that he was waiving his right to a jury trial.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47. Lomax claimed that the trial court\u2019s passing reference to his jury waiver was insufficient to satisfy the open-court requirement of R.C. 2945.05. The First District agreed with Lomax and reversed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">{\u00b6 58} The Supreme Court affirmed the First District, finding that the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 had not been met by the trial court\u2019s passing reference to the jury waiver. The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c[A] trial court does not need to engage in an extended colloquy with the defendant in order to comply with the statutory requirement that a jury waiver be made in open court. There must be, however, some evidence in the record of the proceedings that the defendant acknowledged the waiver to the trial court while in the presence of counsel, if any. Absent such evidence, the waiver does not comply with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 and is therefore invalid.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">{\u00b6 60} The court further instructed that it does \u201cnot mandate magic words, or a prolonged colloquy, but simply what Ohio law intends \u2014 that a defendant while in the courtroom and in the presence of counsel, if any, acknowledge to the trial court that the defendant wishes to waive the right to a jury trial.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 48. The court thus held: \u201cTo satisfy the \u2018in open court\u2019 requirement in R.C. 2945.05, there must be some evidence in the record that the defendant <em>while in the courtroom </em>and in the presence of counsel, if any, <em>acknowledged </em>the jury waiver to the trial court.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">{\u00b6 61} In reaching its conclusion, the Supreme Court reviewed its holdings in <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464; <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 716 N.E.2d 1126; and <em>Pless, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766. <em>Jells </em>and <em>Bays </em>each concerned whether the trial court adequately made the defendant aware of his rights to a jury trial. <em>Pless </em>established that strict compliance with the requirements of R.C. 2945.05 was necessary, and the Supreme Court in that case held that a jury waiver was invalid when the waiver, although written, had not been filed or made part of the record. None of these cases is factually similar to the circumstances before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">{\u00b6 62} The Supreme Court\u2019s precedent concerning the open-court requirement is satisfied if the defendant \u201cwhile in the courtroom\u201d acknowledged the jury waiver to the court. Id. at \u00b6 49. Several appellate districts have addressed circumstances where at least part of the waiver process has occurred outside of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>{\u00b6 63} For example, the Eighth District has repeatedly held that Crim.R. 23(A) and R.C. 2945.05 are satisfied when the defendant signs a written waiver outside of the courtroom <em>\u201cand the court reaffirms this waiver in open court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Franklin, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81426, 2003-Ohio-2649, 2003 WL 21193014. See also, e.g., <em>State v. Ford </em>(Mar. 14, 2002), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 79441 and 79442, 2002 WL 407925.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">{\u00b6 64} The term \u201cacknowledge\u201d requires more than acquiescence on the part of the defendant. In contrast to acquiescence, which is implied consent \u201cby one\u2019s mere silence\u201d (qui tacet consentit), Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed.Rev.1990) 24, \u201cacknowledge\u201d means \u201c[t]o own, avow, or admit; to confess; to recognize one\u2019s acts, and assume the responsibility therefor.\u201d Id. at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">{\u00b6 65} The Supreme Court of Ohio has concluded that a defendant\u2019s silence is insufficient to waive the right to a jury trial. <em>State v. Tate </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 50, 13 O.O.3d 36, 391 N.E.2d 738. In <em>Tate, </em>the trial court concluded a bench trial, even though the defendant had filed a timely demand for a jury trial for his petty-offense charge. No written or oral jury waiver was obtained. The record reflected that the defendant was a man of above-normal intelligence, that he was represented by employed counsel, and that counsel, when asked by the trial judge if the defendant was ready to proceed to trial, stated that he was ready and did not mention to the judge that he desired a jury trial. Id. at 55, 13 0.0.3d 36, 391 N.E.2d 738 (Holmes, concurring). \u201cThe trial proceeded and the defendant testified. Upon being found guilty of the offense charged, the defendant and his counsel had no comment to make to the court and, again, no mention of, or complaint about, proceeding without a jury.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">{\u00b6 66} Upon review, the Supreme Court held that the trial court did not comply with R.C. 2945.05 and, consequently, the defendant was denied his constitutional right to a jury trial. Addressing the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cWhile the circumstances of this cause could lead one to surmise that appellant was aware of the situation and possibly took advantage of it, we cannot accept the proposition that there was a waiver of this right by silence. To do so would not only conflict with years of constitutional precedent, it could well require this court to review the circumstances of all such similar cases to determine whether the conduct and education of the accused and the adequacy of his counsel would support such an implicit waiver in each instance. As was stated in <em>Simmons v. State </em>(1906), 75 Ohio St. 346, 79 N.E. 555, at paragraph two of the syllabus, \u2018(s)uch waiver must clearly and affirmatively appear upon the record, and it can not be assumed or implied by a reviewing court from the silence of the accused * * *.\u2019 Furthermore, \u2018(e)very reasonable presumption should be made against the waiver, especially when it relates to a right or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>privilege deemed so valuable as to be secured by the Constitution.\u2019 Id., at page 352, 79 N.E. at page 557.\u201d <em>Tate, </em>59 Ohio St.2d at 53, 13 0.0.3d 36, 391 N.E.2d 738.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">{\u00b6 68} The present case is partially distinguishable from <em>Tate </em>in that the trial court discussed Burnside\u2019s expressed desire to waive his right to a jury trial in chambers, with counsel and the prosecutor present. The court thoroughly and patiently informed Burnside of his right to a jury trial and of the ramifications of his waiver of such right. The record reflects that Burnside understood the waiver and that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily elected to waive his right to a jury trial. Burnside had signed the waiver form prior to the in-chambers conversation, and Burnside acknowledged his signature during the in-chambers conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">{\u00b6 69} Despite the trial court\u2019s colloquy with Burnside, Burnside never waived his right to a trial by jury in open court. The court\u2019s in-chambers discussion with Burnside did not occur in open court. Similar to <em>Lomax, </em>the trial court\u2019s statement that the \u201cjury has been waived\u201d was the only reference to a jury waiver that was made in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">{\u00b6 70} And, Burnside never acknowledged his prior written and oral waivers in open court, despite the court\u2019s justifiable inference that he did. Upon the resumption of proceedings in the courtroom, the court indicated that a jury had been waived and that [the attorneys] \u201cI think, are ready to go. Correct gentlemen?\u201d As in <em>Tate, </em>Burnside\u2019s defense counsel responded, \u201cDefendant is ready, Judge.\u201d The court never asked Burnside, in the courtroom, whether he still wished to waive a jury trial, and Burnside made no affirmative statement that he wished to proceed without a jury. In the absence of a record of a conversation in the courtroom between Burnside and the court during which Burnside acknowledged or reaffirmed his waiver of his right to a jury trial, Burnside\u2019s purported waiver of his right to a jury trial did not comport with the open-court requirement of R.C. 2945.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">{\u00b6 71} The state asserts that reversing Burnside\u2019s conviction \u201cbecause he was standing in the wrong room when he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial\u201d is an absurd result, one which was not intended by the General Assembly. The state argues that the \u201cin open court\u201d requirement \u201chas less to do with the physical location where the jury waiver takes place than it is concerned with the circumstances that ensure a defendant is not coerced into waiving his constitutional right. That being the case, Burnside\u2019s waiver of the jury was, in effect, conducted in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">{\u00b6 72} While we do not agree with the state that in chambers is in effect in open court, we do agree that the difference, in these circumstances, is not one that is of constitutional import or that denied the defendant due process. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>record clearly reflects that Burnside signed a waiver form and that the trial court took care to ensure that Burnside understood his right to a jury trial, understood the risk of having one person rather than a group of 12 determine the verdict, and made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">{\u00b6 73} The right to a jury trial in a felony criminal case is a fundamental right. We are mindful that a defendant could \u201csandbag\u201d the court, but the legislature has concluded, and the Ohio Supreme Court has agreed, that a jury waiver (or at least its acknowledgment) must be in open court. In this particular case, we have no doubt that Burnside waived a jury and agreed to be tried by the court, but the \u201cin open court\u201d rule is prophylactic and designed to protect all defendants, not just this one. Considering that the written waiver need not be signed in open court and the trial court need not engage in an extensive discussion with a defendant, it is not difficult for a trial court to comply with the open-court requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">{\u00b6 74} The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">{\u00b6 75} Burnside\u2019s second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-9\">{\u00b6 76} \u201cThe trial court prejudicially erred by proceeding with a visiting judge without a valid transfer order being filed in the docket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">{\u00b6 77} In light of our disposition of Burnside\u2019s first assignment of error, the second assignment of error is overruled as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">{\u00b6 78} The judgment of the trial court will be reversed, and the matter will be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-13\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b775-14\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-13\">.
