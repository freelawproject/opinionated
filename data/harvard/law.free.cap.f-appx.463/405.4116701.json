Because we find that the district court properly evaluated Jackson\u2019s competency, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Jackson was an inmate at the United States Penitentiary, Pollock, Louisiana on November 1, 2006 when he punched Officer Bobby Ramos, a guard at the prison. On that day, Officer Ramos ordered Jackson to take off his boots because he did not clear the metal detector at the entrance to the east corridor of the prison. Jackson protested, and insisted on speaking with Lt. Mike Taylor. After the conversation, Jackson took off his boots and proceeded through the metal detector. When Officer Ramos inspected the boots for contraband, Jackson became agitated and told Officer Ramos, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get yours.\u201d Officer Ramos, along with several other corrections officers, then escorted Jackson up the east corridor. Along the way, Jackson asked to see the captain, but the officers denied his request. He subsequently attempted to veer away through the door into the cafeteria, which led <em>to </em>the captain\u2019s area. As the officers tried to direct Jackson away from the door, he punched Officer Ramos in the face, injuring his left eye and nose.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Jackson was charged with assaulting a government employee, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. In the time leading up to his trial, he wrote numerous letters to both the district and magistrate judges, as well as his attorney. The district court conducted a hearing as a result of these letters, after which it sua sponte ordered that Jackson undergo a competency evaluation by an - examiner designated by the Bureau of Prisons, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Jason Dana, the psychologist who examined Jackson, submitted a report indicating that Jackson has an anti-social personality disorder, and he \u201cpresents a significant challenge to any lawyer attempting to work with him in the development of a defense.\u201d However, Dr. Dana stated that Jackson does not appear to have a severe mental illness or cognitive defect, and that \u201chis ability to understand the legal proceedings and to properly assist his counsel do not appear to be noticeably impaired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">After receiving Dr. Dana\u2019s evaluation, the court ordered that the magistrate judge conduct a competency hearing as to Jackson. At the hearing, defense counsel requested that the court appoint a competency panel to evaluate Jackson, consisting of an independent psychologist and a criminal defense attorney. The magistrate judge then appointed Dr. John Simoneaux, a psychologist, to perform a sanity/competency evaluation of Jackson, but did not appoint a defense attorney to be part of the process. Dr. Simoneaux filed an initial report after meeting with Jackson for two hours at an office in the prison. This initial report indicated that, without further information, Dr. Simoneaux could not render a definitive evaluation, but he found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>that Jackson\u2019s ability to assist his defense counsel was \u201cmuch more impaired\u201d than his ability to understand his legal rights and the consequences of conviction. However, Dr. Simoneaux later filed a supplemental report after he had the opportunity to review additional materials, such as an evaluation of Jackson by Jim Womack, Ph.D., an extensive report by a probation officer, and Dr. Dana\u2019s psychological evaluation of Jackson. In his supplemental report, Dr. Simoneaux concluded that the history supported a finding that Jackson may be malingering a mental illness. Dr. Simoneaux stated that Jackson\u2019s history seemed to suggest that he \u201cdid not suffer from a mental disease or defect at the time of the alleged offense that would have affected his ability to appreciate or be aware of the wrongness of his acts.\u201d Dr. Simoneaux also found that Jackson \u201cis not suffering from a significant mental disease or defect that would materially affect .his ability to understand his legal situation or to assist counsel in preparing a defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The magistrate judge conducted a second competency hearing after receiving Dr. Simoneaux\u2019s reports. The magistrate judge recommended that Jackson be found competent to stand trial, to understand the nature and the consequences of the proceedings against him, and to assist in his defense. Defense counsel objected to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, both on the basis of its legal and factual findings, and because the court had not appointed a defense attorney to the evaluation panel. The district court, however, overruled the objections, and after a de novo review of the record, concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson was competent to stand trial and assist in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">A defendant is competent to stand trial if \u201che has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding,\u201d and if \u201che has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination of competency to stand trial may not be set aside on review unless it is clearly arbitrary or unwarranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 822 (5th Cir.1979). This is \u201ca species of clear error review,\u201d and it \u201crequires us to re-analyze the facts and take a hard look at the trial judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>333 F.3d 587, 589 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Doke, </em>171 F.3d 240, 247 (5th Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Here, Jackson contends that the district court is required to provide a defendant with a fair competency hearing, and that by not granting defense counsel\u2019s request to include a defense attorney on the panel evaluating Jackson\u2019s competency, the hearing held by the district court was inherently unfair. However, Jackson cites no authority in support of the premise that it is clear error for a district court not to include an attorney on the panel of experts conducting a competency assessment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">By statute, all that is required of a district court is that it grant a motion for a competency hearing \u201cif there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a). Whether to even order a psychiatric or psychological examination of the defendant prior to the hearing is left to the discretion of the district court. \u00a7 4241(b) (\u201cPrior to the date of the hearing, the court <em>may </em>order that a psychiatric or psychological examination of the defendant be conducted, and that a psychiatric or psychological report be filed with the court[.]\u201d (emphasis added)). The district court in Jackson\u2019s case held one competency hearing, and then at defense counsel\u2019s request ordered a second hearing, and also agreed to have a different, independent expert complete a second psychological evaluation of Jackson. Rather than deny Jackson a fair hearing, we find that the district court made a substantial effort to ensure that it rendered a fair and well-founded competency determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Jackson admits that, \u201c[g]iven the ultimate opinions of the two mental health professionals, the district court\u2019s finding of competency is obviously beyond serious review in this Court.\u201d We agree, and accordingly AFFIRM the district court\u2019s finding that Jackson was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 sets out the procedure for determining a defendant's mental competency to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">. Jackson quotes the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \"defense counsel will often have the best-informed view of the defendant\u2019s ability . to participate in his defense.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 450, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992). However, the Court in <em>Medina </em>was discussing a state\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof in competency hearings, and not a court\u2019s appointment of experts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
