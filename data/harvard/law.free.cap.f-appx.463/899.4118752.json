After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Az19\">A. Asylum Applications</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">On January 5, 1999, Chen entered the United States at the Canadian border. In 2000, Lin entered the United States. In October 2006, Chen married Lin, and their first son, Kevin, was born on September 1, 2006. Lin soon became pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-17\">In March 2007, Chen and Lin applied for asylum. In his application, Chen stated that he feared returning to China because the Chinese government would force Lin to abort their second child. If they returned to China after their second child was born, they would be fined and either Chen or Lin would be forcibly sterilized by the government. In her application, Lin likewise sought asylum based on political opinion because she feared being forced to abort her second child or being forcibly sterilized by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-18\">In support of their applications, Chen and Lin submitted many news articles and transcripts of congressional hearings regarding China\u2019s one-child policy; affidavits from other Chinese citizens who had been forcibly sterilized; fine schedules for violating the one-child policy in various regions; certificates from a number of villages in China indicating that their family planning policies required insertion of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>intrauterine device after one child and sterilization of one parent after a second child; letters and identification documents from family and friends regarding forced sterilizations in China; and personal documents such as birth certificates, travel documents, passports, and family photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">They also submitted several State Department reports on China and its human-rights practices, including one report titled, \u201cChina: Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions\u201d (\u201c2007 Profile\u201d). The 2007 Profile stated that China\u2019s birth planning policies retained \u201charshly coercive elements.\u201d Although the central government prohibited physical coercion to undergo sterilization, there were \u201ccontinuing reports of physical coercion to meet birth targets in some areas.\u201d Further, \u201cU.S. officials in China are not aware of the alleged official policy, at the national or provincial levels, mandating the sterilization of one partner of couples that have given birth to two children, at least one of whom was born abroad.\u201d According to the 2007 Profile, the Fujian Provincial Birth Planning Committee (\u201cFPBPC\u201d) claimed there were no forced sterilizations in the province within the last ten years, but it was \u201cimpossible to confirm this claim, and, in 2006, reportedly, there were forced sterilizations in Fujian.\u201d Finally, the 2007 Profile noted that documents from China, and particularly from Fujian Province, were \u201csubject to widespread fabrication and fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">At the merits hearing, Lin testified that she was born in Kefu Village, Tan Tou Town, Fujian Province, China. Lin filed for asylum in 2007 because she had violated China\u2019s one-child policy by having two children. She and her husband came from agricultural families. If they returned to China, they would live with her husband\u2019s family in Kuei Qi Village, Ma Wei District, in Fujian Province and would register their children in the household registry system. If they did not register the children, they would pay a fine and face criminal charges. Lin learned about China\u2019s one-child policy because some of her relatives and some of Chen\u2019s relatives were sterilized. Lin testified that, if she and her family returned to China, either Lin or Chen would be forcibly sterilized and they would be arrested if they did not pay the fine for having a second child. Lin did not want to be sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">B. IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s Decisions</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The IJ denied Chen\u2019s and Lin\u2019s asylum applications. After considering the background evidence and Lin\u2019s testimony, the IJ determined that Chen and Lin had not provided sufficient evidence to show that they had a well-founded fear of future persecution. The IJ considered the 2007 Profile, noting that it contradicted some of Chen\u2019s and Lin\u2019s assertions. For example, although local enforcement and regulations varied, the policies were more strictly adhered to in cities than in rural areas, and Chen and Lin were from a rural area. The IJ also cited to the 2007 Profile in concluding that forced sterilizations and forced abortions were prohibited, and according to the FPBPC, there had not been a forced sterilization in Fujian Province in the past ten years. The IJ found the State Department reports more persuasive than the evidence Chen and Lin provided. Accordingly, the IJ denied asylum and withholding of removal and ordered Chen and Lin removed to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Chen and Lin appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal. The BIA concluded that the IJ properly considered the evidence, as shown by the \u201clengthy discussion of the evidence in his decision.\u201d The BIA agreed with the IJ that Chen and Lin had not shown that they were eligible for asylum because they did not show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>one-child policy was being enforced in their home region \u201cor that such enforcement efforts would give rise to a well-founded fear of future persecution due to a violation.\u201d The BIA considered Chen\u2019s and Lin\u2019s evidence \u2014 including two of the villagers\u2019 committee certificates, as well as the evidence discussed in the BIA\u2019s published cases \u2014 determining that there was \u201cno uniform policy regarding the implementation of the population control law <em>with respect to children born outside of China.\u201d </em>The BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwhile some individuals may be subject to economic penalties or sanctions for such births, the [evidence in this case did] not establish penalties or sanctions rising to the level of persecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Chen and Lin petitioned for review. Denying the petition, this Court held that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that Chen and Lin did not have an objectively reasonable well-founded fear of forced sterilization or persecutory fines. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>426 Fed.Appx. 717 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">C. Motion to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">On December 23, 2010, while their petition was pending before this Court, Chen and Lin timely moved before the BIA to reopen the proceedings to submit new evidence on their one-child-policy claim and to present a new claim for relief based on Lin\u2019s practice of Falun Gong. They requested that the case be remanded to an IJ for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">In support of their motion, Chen and Lin submitted an affidavit in which Lin attested that, in March 2010, Lin began practicing Falun Gong due to her health. Lin always felt tired after long hours of working in a restaurant and had leg pain due to standing all day at work. Lin mostly practiced Falun Gong at home, but sometimes she practiced at the park \u201cto get a better result.\u201d After having practiced Falun Gong for a few months, Lin felt less tired, suffered less pain in her legs, and decided to continue practicing Falun Gong in the future. Lin attested that she would be detained, beaten, interrogated, and fined by the Chinese government, which prohibited the practice of Fa-lun Gong. Lin and Chen also feared that one of them would be sterilized if they returned to China, because they had two children (although both children were born in the United States). They feared being fined for their second child. Because they had no means to pay a fine, they feared their home would be destroyed or they would face other severe punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Chen and Lin also submitted, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the State Department\u2019s \u201cInternational Religious Freedom Report 2007,\u201d which stated that the Chinese government designated Falun Gong as a \u201ccult\u201d and repressed the practice of Falun Gong through arrest, detention, imprisonment, and sometimes torture and abuse, although leaders typically received harsher punishment than practitioners; (2) several news articles, a book chapter, and a 2006 congressional report on Falun Gong; (3) a review and evaluation of the 2007 Profile by Dr. Flora Sapio, a guest lecturer of Contemporary Chinese Studies at a German university, which review purported to assess the thoroughness, accuracy, and reliability of the 2007 Profile that Chen and Lin submitted with their original asylum application; (4) documents from a hearing before Congress\u2019s Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission (\u201cTom Lantos Commission Report\u201d) in November 2009, during which several organizations and witnesses provided testimony regarding 16 cases of coercive family planning, such as Chinese officials forcing women to have abortions and even forcibly inducing labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>and killing the baby upon delivery; (5) a portion of the 2009 Annual Report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (\u201c2009 Congressional-Executive Commission Report\u201d), which indicated that China \u201ccontinued\u201d to enforce a policy that interfered with women\u2019s reproductive rights, that forced abortion was an \u201cofficial policy instrument\u201d in Fujian Province, and that, in February 2009, officials within Fujian Province initiated a five-week campaign of heightened enforcement, using forced abortions; (6) a copy of <em>Zheng v. Holder, </em>361 Fed.Appx. 184 (2d Cir.2010), an unpublished Second Circuit decision involving an asylum claim for a Chinese petitioner that, like Chen and Lin, also gave birth to two children while in the United States; (7) an affidavit from Renzun Yuan, a resident of Qinchuan Village in Fujian, who stated that, upon his return to China in 2008, he was forcibly sterilized because he had two American-born children; and (8) five news articles published in 2009 and 2010 documenting sterilization campaigns in Guangdong Province, during which government officials detained elderly relatives to persuade their family members to be sterilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As to Chen\u2019s and Lin\u2019s renewed claim of persecution under China\u2019s one-child policy, the BIA determined that the majority of their evidence was new and previously unavailable. However, the BIA determined that the evidence was insufficient to establish Chen\u2019s and Lin\u2019s prima facie eligibility for asylum. The BIA considered Dr. Sa-pio\u2019s critique of the 2007 Profile, but gave more weight to the reliability of the Profile because Dr. Sapio\u2019s article was not based on personal knowledge, only conjectured regarding the motivations of the State Department, and speculatively challenged the validity of the State Department\u2019s sources. The BIA noted that (1) in their initial application Chen and Lin relied on the 2007 Profile and (2) they had waived an opportunity to object to the use of the 2007 Profile at the merits hearing before the IJ. The BIA also determined that Dr. Sapio\u2019s report exhibited an unfavorable bias against the State Department and other government agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">As to the Tom Lantos Commission Report, although it contained anecdotal evidence, this evidence did not convince the BIA that it had \u201cerred in finding that there [was] no country-wide campaign by Chinese authorities to forcibly sterilize parents returning to China with a second child born abroad.\u201d As to the 2009 Congressional-Executive Commission Report, the BIA noted that Chen and Lin submitted only 10 pages of the 300-page report and that the submitted portion of the report discussed occurrences in a province other than Fujian, where Chen and Lin would return.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">The BIA also found that the Second Circuit unpublished decision, cited in the motion to reopen, had no precedential value, and, further, was distinguishable on the facts. As to the affidavit from Yuan, the BIA noted that the affidavit was not notarized, such that the BIA could not be certain of Yuan\u2019s identity or the reliability of the affidavit. Further, the BIA noted that the affidavit may have been prepared for the purposes of litigation, and that Chen and Lin did not explain how they came into possession of Yuan\u2019s affidavit. The BIA also determined that the submitted news articles did not discuss conditions in Fujian Province, such that the articles did not support Chen and Lin\u2019s claim. Thus, the BIA determined that Chen\u2019s and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>Lin\u2019s new evidence did not establish grounds to reopen their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">As to Lin\u2019s claim based on her recent commitment to Falun Gong, the BIA concluded that Lin had not shown prima facie eligibility for relief. The BIA determined that Lin had not provided any evidence to suggest that the government was aware or could become aware of her Falun Gong practice, or that the government had the inclination to persecute her on account of this practice. The BIA noted that, although Lin submitted a few news articles regarding the mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China, the most recent was dated in 2008, such that Lin did not provide information about current conditions in China for Falun Gong practitioners. The BIA concluded that Lin had not met her heavy burden of establishing eligibility for asylum. Thus, the BIA denied Chen and Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as to the Falun Gong claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">A party may file <em>only one motion to </em>reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen based on any of the following grounds: \u201c1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (providing that the BIA may deny a motion to reopen even if the alien establishes a prima facie case for relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings. <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). The moving party bears a \u201cheavy burden,\u201d and judicial review \u201cis limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because of the \u201cheavy burden,\u201d the mov-ant must show that, if proceedings were reopened, \u201cthe new evidence would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">A. One-Child-Policy Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Chen and Lin argue that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion to reopen because they presented additional evidence to establish prima facie eligibility for asylum based on China\u2019s one-child policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">We acknowledge that evidence of a recent increased campaign of forced sterilization in the alien\u2019s home village may warrant reopening of immigration proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1254; <em>Li v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 1371, 1375 (11th Cir.2007). Here, however, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen and Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. Much of the evidence Chen and Lin submitted was unauthenticated and incomplete, and none of the evidence showed a recent campaign of forced sterilization in their home village.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by rejecting Dr. Sapio\u2019s critique of the 2007 Profile because the BIA was entitled to rely on the State Department reports. <em>See Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2004). We note that Dr. Sapio concedes in her report that \u201c[tjhere is no univocal consensus on whether forced abortions and sterilizations are still used to implement the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>family planning policy. Widely different opinions exist. All of them rest of the available evidence, which is neither conclusive nor comprehensive.\u201d Given the other evidence in the record, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion in concluding that the new evidence was unlikely to change the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">B. Falun Gong Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Lin argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her motion to reopen as to her Falun Gong asylum claim because she presented evidence that she practices Falun Gong and that Falun Gong practitioners are persecuted in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Lin\u2019s new Falun Gong evidence did not establish prima fa-cie eligibility for asylum. Lin presented no evidence that the Chinese government is aware that she practices Falun Gong. Thus, it is unclear from the record whether Lin would be singled out for mistreatment if she returns to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">Furthermore, even if Chinese authorities learned of Lin\u2019s practice of Falun Gong, it is not clear whether any response would rise to the level of persecution. This Court has concluded that \u201c[involvement with Falun Gong in China by itself does not entitle a person to asylum in the United States.\u201d <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006). And Lin states that she is a practitioner of Falun Gong, not a leader, and her own evidence shows that the government reserves the harshest punishment for the movement\u2019s leaders. Finally, although Lin submitted several news articles discussing mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners in China, the most recent of these articles was published in 2008. Thus, Lin failed to present any current evidence of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners, and she failed to present any evidence that she would be specifically targeted for persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-5\">. The BIA issued two separate orders on the motion to reopen, one for Chen and one for Lin, although the text of each order is materially the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b929-11\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge, specially</author>\n<p id=\"ABU\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">I concur in the majority opinion\u2019s result only because I believe that the Board of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
