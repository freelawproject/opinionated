Wood\u2019s action claimed a constitutional violation in the execution of his mother\u2019s will. Review is <em>de novo. E.g., Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">Wood challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against the individual state-court judges, contending the judges were not entitled to judicial immunity. He does not brief claims seeking to have reopened other trust cases adjudicated by the judges or his claims against Parker County; those claims are, therefore, deemed abandoned. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-24\">Judicial officers are entitled to absolute immunity from suit in \u00a7 1983 actions arising from the exercise of their judicial functions. <em>Boyd v. Biggers, </em>31 F.3d 279, 284 (5th Cir.1994). Immunity may be overcome by showing: the disputed acts were not judicial in nature; or, if judicial in nature, were performed in the complete absence of jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-25\">Wood\u2019s assertion that the judges\u2019 actions were nonjudicial in nature is without merit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>His complaint makes plain that he seeks recovery for decisions regarding the transfer and retention of his case during probate proceedings, acts which are usually performed by judges, and he fails to allege the judges acted in any role other than their judicial one.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Also unavailing is Wood\u2019s assertion that the judges acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. Where judicial immunity is concerned, \u201cthe scope of the judge\u2019s jurisdiction must be construed broadly.... A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done maliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when he has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction\u201d. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Upon Wood\u2019s motion to transfer, the constitutional county court judge was required by state law to transfer his case; the judge thus acted within the scope of the court\u2019s jurisdiction and is entitled to judicial immunity. Similarly, the judges of the county court at law are entitled to immunity because they did not act in clear absence of all jurisdiction, despite the state appellate court later determining the county court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the testamentary trust issues presented. <em>See Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 373 (5th Cir.1995) (inquiry \u201cis not whether the judge actually had jurisdiction, or even whether the court exceeded its jurisdictional authority, but whether the challenged actions were obviously taken outside the scope of the judge\u2019s power\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. Its dismissal of Wood\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>E.g., Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Wood is CAUTIONED that, if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
