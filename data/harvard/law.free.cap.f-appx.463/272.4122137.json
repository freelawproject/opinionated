He argues that his sentence, which is at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-24\">Estrada does not contend that the district court committed any procedural error regarding his sentence. Thus, this court\u2019s review is confined to whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Citing <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007), Estrada acknowledges that this court\u2019s review is for plain error when a defendant fails to object to the reasonableness of a sentence after the imposition of sentence. Nevertheless, he seeks to preserve for further review his contention that an objection is not required. This court need not determine whether plain error review is appropriate because Estrada\u2019s arguments fail even under the abuse-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of discretion standard of review. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">This court has consistently rejected Estrada\u2019s \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument and his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 results in an excessive sentence because it is not empirically based. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009). We also have rejected the \u201cinternational trespass\u201d argument that Estrada asserts. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">As to Estrada\u2019s argument that the Guidelines fail to account for the seriousness of his offense or for his personal history and characteristics, the district court expressly considered Estrada\u2019s arguments for a variance, including his cultural assimilation, the age of Estrada\u2019s prior drug-trafficking conviction, the lack of an empirical basis for \u00a7 2L1.2, the relative harshness of prison sentences on aliens, and Estrada\u2019s substance dependency issues. The district court also considered Estrada\u2019s criminal history, which the district court considered extensive and included violent acts upon others. The district court concluded that a sentence within the Guidelines \u201cwas consistent with all of the purposes of the sentencing statute.\u201d Estrada has not shown that the district court failed to give proper weight to his arguments or any particular 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). He has thus failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that is accorded his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED. Because no further briefing is required, the Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b296-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
