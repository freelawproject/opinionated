Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303 (5th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s decision will be upheld \u201cso long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">Liu has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying her second motion to reopen the removal proceeding. Her eligibility for rescission of the removal order is immaterial because her motion to reopen is numerically barred, and the exceptions to the numerical bar are not applicable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), (b)(4)(h); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C)(iv). Her arguments that reopening is warranted due to ineffective assistance of counsel and her eligibility for adjustment of status are in essence arguments that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen the removal proceeding sua sponte. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008). We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s wholly discretionary decision to refuse to reopen the removal proceeding sua sponte. <em>See id. </em>at 219-20. To the extent that Liu argues that the denial of the motion to reopen violated her right to due process, she has no constitutionally protected interest in discretionary relief. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">Liu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
