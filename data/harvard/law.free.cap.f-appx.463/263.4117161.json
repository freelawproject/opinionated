On July 15, 2008, Dou-cet had a heavy work day exchanging fire extinguishers on another platform and woke up the next day suffering severe back pain. Thereafter, Doucet was treated for back pain and a magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed degenerated and herniated discs in Doucet\u2019s spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Doucet filed a claim for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq., </em>as extended by the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cthe Act\u201d). An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded Doucet benefits, and the Benefits Review Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) affirmed the award. Island petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision, arguing that insufficient evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s award determination. Island argues that the evidence demonstrates that Doucet\u2019s back condition is the result of the natural progression of a pre-existing injury unrelated to, and not aggravated by, his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">This Court reviews decisions of the Board under the same standard the Board uses to review the ALJ: whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>SGS Control Servs. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>86 F.3d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1996). This court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ or reweigh evidence; its review is limited to determining \u201cwhether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">There is a presumption that a claim comes within the provisions of the Act in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a); <em>Port Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co. v. Hunter, </em>227 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Ijnherent in [\u00a7 920(a) ] is the presumption that an injury is causally related to a worker\u2019s employment.\u201d). To trigger this presumption, the claimant must make a prima facie showing of causation. <em>Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287. \u201cTo invoke the Section 920(a) presumption, a claimant must prove (1) that he or she suffered harm, and (2) that conditions existed at work, or an accident occurred at work, that could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Conoco, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>194 F.3d 684, 687 (5th Cir.1999)). If a plaintiff establishes this prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to rebut, the presumption by pointing to \u201csubstantial evidence establishing the absence of a connection between the injury and the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288; <em>see also Conoco, </em>194 F.3d at 687-88 (explaining that the \u201cemployer [must] rebut [the presumption] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>through facts \u2014 not mere speculation \u2014 that the harm was <em>not </em>work-related\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Here, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the presumption was triggered, thus shifting the burden to Island to rebut the presumption. The record also supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Island did not rebut the presumption that Doucet\u2019s back injury was causally related to his workplace accident. Doucet and his wife testified that Doucet never had back problems prior to the day in question, and Doucet testified that he had no trouble completing the rigorous functional assessment he was required to perform prior to commencing his employment with Island. The ALJ explicitly found this testimony \u201cvery credible,\u201d and we accord deference to that credibility determination. <em>See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>991 F.2d 163, 165 (5th Cir.1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record further indicated that Doucet never missed a day of work because of back pain prior to the day in question. Although the record contained some conflicting evidence regarding whether Doucet may have suffered from some type of back problems prior to the work day in question, it is not the role of this court to re-weigh that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Substantial evidence in the record supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Doucet\u2019s working conditions could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated his condition. The decision of the Benefits Review Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. Island\u2019s comparison of this case to <em>Mackey v. Marine Terminals Corp., </em>21 BRBS 129, 1988 WL 232723 (Ben.Rev.Bd.1988), is misguided. In <em>Mackey, </em>the Board deferred to the ALJ's \"assessment of claimant\u2019s credibility,\u201d specifically the fact that the ALJ \u201cgave no credence whatever to claimant\u2019s testimony\u201d regarding his claim. <em>Id. </em>at *2. Here, the ALJ specifically found Doucet\u2019s testimony regarding his condition to be highly credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
