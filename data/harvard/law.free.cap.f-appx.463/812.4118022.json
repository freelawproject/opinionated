No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">In 2001, Kerr pleaded guilty to bank robbery and was sentenced as a career offender based on his prior felony convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer and carrying a concealed firearm. He did not appeal his sentence. In his section 2255 motion, Kerr argued that he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of his career-offender sentencing enhancement because\u2014 based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008)\u2014 carrying a concealed firearm no longer qualified as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). The district court denied Kerr\u2019s motion but granted a certificate of appealability on \u201c[w]hether a freestanding challenge to a career offender sentence imposed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, brought pursuant to [Archer], states a cognizable claim on collateral review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">On appeal, Kerr reasserts that his enhanced sentence violates the sentencing guidelines in the light of <em>Begay </em>and <em>Archer. </em>Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), he also contends that his second predicate offense, battery on a law enforcement officer, is no longer considered a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Because Kerr raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we will not consider it. <em>See Walker v. Jones, </em>10 F.3d 1569, 1572 (11th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Moreover, this argument is not cognizable for the reason we will discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\">We review legal issues in section 2255 proceedings de novo. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Because Kerr raises a non-constitutional issue that he failed to raise on direct appeal, section 2255 relief is available only if the error \u201c(1) could not have been raised on direct appeal and (2) would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1232-33. \u201cA ground of error is usually \u2018available\u2019 on direct appeal when its merits can be reviewed without further factual development.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233 n. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">Kerr argues that he could not have challenged his career-offender status on direct appeal because there was no legal authority supporting his argument. But perceived futility in raising an issue on direct appeal does not constitute cause for not doing so. <em>See Smith v. Murray, </em>477 U.S. 527, 106 S.Ct. 2661, 2666, 91 L.Ed.2d 434 (1986). Indeed, even though the decisions in <em>Begay, Archer, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>were unavailable when Kerr was sentenced in 2001, he could have argued on appeal that his career-offender status was improper\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>just as Begay, Archer, and Johnson did. Because Kerr could have raised this claim on direct appeal but failed to do so, his claim is not cognizable now on collateral review under section 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b837-10\"> We will also not consider Kerr\u2019s alternate argument \u2014 raised for the first time on appeal\u2014 that he is entitled to relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Walker, </em>10 F.3d at 1572.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
