Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-26\">Adams was employed by the Orleans Parish Recovery School District (\u201cRSD\u201d), and served as the principal of the Booker T. Washington school during the 2009-2010 school year. She did not have a contract with RSD, and on January 25, 2010 was terminated from her position. Claiming this was wrongful, Adams filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983 and 1985, and under Louisiana state law. Specifically, she claimed that RSD violated her equal protection rights by failing to give her a contract, even though all other RSD principals were employed under contract, and violated her due process rights by failing to observe remedial steps required under state law. The lawsuit was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Although Adams originally sued RSD, she amended her complaint to name the Louisiana Department of Education as the defendant. The State of Louisiana, through the Depai'tment of Education, then moved for summary judgment. The district court granted that motion in part on the grounds that the Department of Education is an arm of the state of Louisiana and therefore not a \u201cperson\u201d who can be sued under \u00a7 1983. It dismissed Adams\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims because they were properly construed as \u00a7 1983 claims, and also dismissed her \u00a7 1985 claims because Adams failed to make any allegations in support of those claims. Because the only remaining claims were state law allegations, the district court remanded the lawsuit to state court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On appeal, Adams challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing her \u00a7 1983 claims with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de </em>novo.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of <em>law.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Section 1983 provides a cause of action against any \u201cperson\u201d who deprives another person of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United while acting \u201cunder color\u201d of state law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For purposes of \u00a7 1983, states and arms of a state are not \u201cpersons,\u201d and a \u00a7 1983 claim may therefore not be brought against those entities or them officials acting in an official capacity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">Adams originally filed suit against RSD. However, because RSD is not an entity that can sue or be sued,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> she requested leave to file an amended complaint \u201cin order to name the proper party as a defendant in this matter\u201d \u201cin place of the [RSD].\u201d The court granted leave, and Adams\u2019s amended complaint named the Louisiana Department of Education as the defendant, stating that \u201c[t]he DOE [Department of Education] is a juridicial [sic] entity capable of suing and being sued and is the proper defendant in cases against the Orleans Parish Recovery School District.\u201d At the time of summary judgment, the defendant was therefore the Department of Education. That Department is an arm of the state of Louisiana, and does not qualify as a \u201cperson\u201d who may be sued under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Recognizing this, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>trict court properly dismissed Adams\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, and remanded her state law claims to the state court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">In her brief, Adams argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because RSD is a person under \u00a7 1983, and because RSD should not receive immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. RSD, however, was no longer the actual defendant at the time of summary judgment. Adams\u2019s arguments are therefore unavailing, and provide no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b321-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. Adams does not present any argument challenging the district court\u2019s dismissal of her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 claims, or its decision to remand her state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). She therefore has waived any objection to those portions of the judgment. <em>See United States v.
