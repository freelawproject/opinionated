In August 2006, the first of several student complaints about Valdes\u2019s classroom performance, especially during exams, began to surface. Students said that she disturbed them during their exams by talking loudly with profanity over her cell phone. SOJ\u2019s internal investigator, Lieutenant Donald Diecidue, investigated the complaint, speaking to several students, and reported to SOJ\u2019s Director of Training, Thomas Hood, that the students\u2019 complaints were valid. Hood met with Valdes and informed her that such behavior would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">On March 28, 2007, Shawnee Fross, who had been overseeing the performance of 32 part-time instructors at MDC, including Valdes, informed Hood and Dr. Donna Jennings, SOJ\u2019s Director, of 10 incidents between September 13, 2006, and March 16, 2007, in which Valdes\u2019s performance was lacking. Some of the incidents involved missing a class, or canceling a class without notice, or being late to class. On one occasion she failed to appear and proctor an examination. One of the incidents involved complaints from instructors that she had left a testing area to talk on her cell phone. Fross counseled Valdes after receiving those complaints. On May 21, responding to Jennings\u2019s request for additional information on these 10 incidents, Fross wrote Jennings and Hood a memo identifying the specific class of students affected in each of the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On May 28, 2007, Valdes filed a written grievance with the MDC Human Resources Division, alleging that she was \u201cbeing treated differently than other instructors in [her] same position.\u201d Such treatment, she said, had been going on for nearly two years. Her grievance was investigated, and on July 5, 2007, SOJ issued Valdes a written reprimand. The reprimand consisted of a synopsis of the 10 incidents Fross had reported on March 28 and May 21. Following the issuance of the reprimand, Fross continued monitoring Valdes\u2019s performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">On October 8, 2007, Fross recorded that Valdes called to complain about the number of hours she was working. On October 9, she recorded that Valdes disrupted another instructor\u2019s class with her \u201cbitching.\u201d On October 10, Barbara Goodman, an instructor, informed Fross that a female African-American student had complained that a female Hispanic instructor had referred to the students as \u201cidiots.\u201d At the time of this incident, Valdes was the only female Hispanic instructor on the job. Fross noted that a month before the incident Goodman described, Fagan, another instructor, advised her to stop using Valdes as an instructor because her negative tone and unprofessional language was detrimental to student morale.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">On June 1, 2009, a student informed Lieutenant Diecidue that Valdes had acted unprofessionally during a final exam. Diecidue told Fross, who requested that he meet with the class. During the meeting, several students stated that Valdes disrupted the exam by talking on her cell phone. When the meeting ended, Dieci-due directed the students to submit a written statement. Fourteen students signed a statement written by their class leader, which stated, among other things, that Valdes had used SOJ\u2019s ammunition and a student\u2019s magazines while taking target <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>practice at the Miami Police Department\u2019s Medley Firearms Range. When the Dieci-due informed Hood of this allegation, Hood asked him to delve into the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">On June 11, 2009, Valdes complained to SOJ\u2019s Director, then Ronald Grimmings, that she had received no response from the May 28, 2007 grievance she had filed with MDC\u2019s Human Resources Division. That same day, June 11, Hood sent Valdes a letter suspending her without pay pending the outcome of Diecidue\u2019s investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">In August, Diecidue gave Hood a final report of his investigation. The report confirmed the validity of the complaints the students had made. On October 6, 2009, Valdes filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging that her June 11 suspension without pay constituted an act of gender discrimination. She claimed that \u201cmale instructors have been the subject of similar and more serious investigations; yet, the male employees were not suspended while they were being investigated.\u201d On October 21, 2009, Grimmings sent Valdes a letter terminating her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">On April 14, 2010, Valdes filed a second EEOC complaint, alleging that her termination was discriminatory and in retaliation for her having filed the EEOC complaint on October 6, 2009. In August 2010, EEOC issued a right to sue letter for the October 6 complaint. On October 29, 2010, Valdes brought this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">Valdes\u2019s complaint, as amended, contained eight counts: Counts 1 and 5 alleged that her suspension on June 11, 2009, and termination on October 21, 2009, constituted gender discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>Counts 3 and 7 alleged that the gender discrimination described in Counts 1 and 5 violated the Florida Civil Rights Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.01, <em>et seq. </em>Counts 2 and 6 alleged that the June 11 suspension and October 21 termination constituted retaliation under Title VII for engaging in protected activity, i.e., filing the grievance on May 28, 2007, and the EEOC complaint on October 6, 2009. Counts 4 and 8 alleged that the conduct described in Counts 2 and 6 violated FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">MDC answered Valdes\u2019s complaint and denied liability. And, following discovery, it moved the court for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">The district court addressed the merits of Valdes\u2019s Title VII and FCRA claims using the standards required to make out a claim under Title VII. <em>See Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201cdecisions construing Title VII guide the analysis of claims under [FCRA]\u201d). The court first addressed the gender discrimination claims, then the retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discharging an employee, or otherwise discriminating against her with respect to her employment, on the basis of gender. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of disparate treatment, a female plaintiff must show that her employer treated similarly situated male employees differently. <em>See Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>1999). This gender-based disparate treatment is what Valdes alleged in her EEOC complaints and in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">In determining whether the comparator employees Valdes named in her complaint were similarly situated, the district court properly considered whether they were involved in, or accused of, the same or similar conduct and disciplined differently. <em>Id. </em>The quality and quantity of the plaintiffs and the comparators\u2019 misconduct must be \u201cnearly identical\u201d in order to prevent courts from second-guessing reasonable employer decisions by comparing apples with oranges. <em>Id. </em>Misconduct merely similar to that for which the plaintiff was disciplined is not sufficient. <em>Rioux v. City of Atlanta, </em>520 F.3d 1269, 1280 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">As the district court noted, Valdes\u2019s complaint \u201cname[d] ten male employees who were investigated for misconduct; yet, unlike Valdes, never suspended without pay during their investigations.\u201d Order, October 5, 2011 (\u201cOrder\u201d) at 12. But, other than the bare allegations of her complaint, \u201cValdes provide[d] no additional information on seven of the alleged \u2018comparators.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cValdes made no showing at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. \u201cAs for the remaining three comparators (Mitchell, Delgado, and Bruzinski), Valdes present[d] evidence of allegations that no reasonable fact-finder could consider to be \u201cnearly identical\u201d in \u201cquality and quantity\u201d to satisfy the legal standard set in <em>Manicda, supra, </em>at 1368.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Valdes failed to present evidence of similarly situated comparators, the district court granted MDC summary judgment on her Title VII and FCRA gender discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Having disposed of these claims, the- district court turned to Valdes\u2019s retaliation claims. Title VII prohibits retaliation against an employee for opposing any practice made unlawful by Title VII (\u201cOpposition Clause\u201d) or for filing a charge with the EEOC pursuant to Title VII (\u201cParticipation Clause\u201d). To establish a prima facie case, a plaintiff must show: (1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is some casual relationship between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1375 (11th Cir.2008). A plaintiff can show that she engaged in a protected activity if she proves that she had a subjective good faith belief, as well as an objective, reasonable belief that her employer engaged in an unlawful employment practice when she opposed that practice. <em>See Dixon v. The Hallmark Cos., </em>627 F.3d 849, 857 (11th Cir.2010). An allegation of unfair treatment, absent discrimination based on gender, does not state an unlawful employment practice under Title VIL <em>Coutu v. Martin Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1995). Furthermore, to establish a causal connection, the plaintiff must show that the employer making the adverse employment action was aware of the protected conduct. <em>McCann, </em>526 F.3d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">Valdes claims that the grievance she filed with MDC\u2019s Human Resources Division on May 28, 2007 constituted a protected activity and that her suspension without pay on June 11, 2009, constituted an act in retaliation for her having filed the grievance. The district court rejected her Title VII and FCRA retaliation claims on two grounds. First, since the \u201cgrievance [was] essentially a list of workplace complaints unrelated to Title VII, there [was] no need to determine whether [MDC] unlawfully retaliated against Valdes.\u201d Order at 24. But even if viewed as protected activity, Valdes failed to show a causal link between the grievance and the suspension. \u201cConsidering the numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>ous allegations against Valdes in Dieci-due\u2019s investigation, no reasonable fact-finder could find that [MDC] [did] not satisfiy] its \u2018exceedingly light\u2019 burden of proffering a legitimate reason for suspending Valdes\u201d <em>id. </em>at 26, \u201cnamely the students\u2019 allegations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"AQXK\">Valdes claims that her termination on October 21, 2009 was in retaliation for her having filed a complaint with the EEOC on October 6, 15 days earlier. As the district court properly held, the filing constituted protected activity. Though Valdes swore to the complaint\u2019s allegations before a notary public on October 6, the EEOC did not receive it until October 20, and MDC was not aware of the filing on October 21. In addition, the court noted that Bettie Thompson, Vice Provost for Human Resources at MDC, made the decision to fire Valdes because, as far back as 2006, \u201cValdes had been counseled for being disrespectful to students.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. And, [s]ince Valdes ... offered no evidence to show that Thompson\u2019s reasons were pre-textual, even if [the court] assumed that Thompson was aware of the EEOC complaint, ... no question of material fact exist[ed] on the question of whether [MDC] unlawfully retaliated against Valdes by firing her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court therefore rejected Valdes\u2019s Title VII and FCRA retaliation claims as well.</p>\n<p id=\"AnW\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"Aop0\">Valdes appeals the district court s judgment on all counts. She argues that the district court erred in rejecting her gender discrimination claims for failure to present evidence of similarly situated comparators; that the court erred in concluding that she failed to make out a prima facie case on her claims of retaliation; and that the court relied on inadmissible hearsay when it considered Lieutenant Diecidue\u2019s report, which contained information related to him by students and instructors. We find no merit in Valdes\u2019s challenges to Diecidue\u2019s report, which was filed in August of 2009. The report had a bearing on Thompson\u2019s October 21, 2009 decision to fire Valdes; Hood\u2019s June 11, 2009 decision came before Diecidue filed the .report. The report, and the information it related, was not received for the truth of the contents; rather, it was received for the purpose of showing, in part, what prompted Thompson\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"AUf\">As for the district court\u2019s rejection of Valdes\u2019s claims of gender discrimination and retaliation, we find no merit in Valdes\u2019s arguments. The district court viewed the evidence before it in the light most favorable to Valdes, as it was required to do on summary judgment, and it correctly applied the relevant law to the facts that evidence yielded. The court therefore did not err in concluding that Valdes failed to establish a case on any of her counts. The judgment of the district court is, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"ABi\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">. Valdes asked the district court to postpone consideration of the motion so she could engage in further discovery, but the court denied her request. Valdes challenges the ruling in this appeal. The challenge is meritless, as the district court acted well within its discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
