Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 476, 181 L.Ed.2d 449 (2011). In <em>Judulang </em>the Court considered the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) \u201ccomparable-grounds\u201d rule for determining whether to summarily deny deportable aliens\u2019 applications for discretionary waivers under former \u00a7 212(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Court held that the comparable-grounds rule is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>Judulang, </em>132 S.Ct. at 479. In this case, the BIA relied on the comparable-grounds rule in denying Petitioner Khalid Umer individual consideration of his \u00a7 212(c) application. <em>Judu-lang </em>does not require the BIA to give individual consideration to every \u00a7 212(c) application filed by a deportable alien who is otherwise eligible to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief. The Supreme Court explained that \u201c[i]n rejecting th[e] rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to devise another, equally economical policy respecting eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief, so long as it comports with everything held in both this decision and <em>St. Cyr.\u201d Id. </em>at 490. Accordingly, it suffices to send this case back to the BIA to reconsider its decision regarding whether Umer\u2019s application should be considered on its individual merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">We GRANT Umer\u2019s petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s judgment, and REMAND the case to the BIA for reconsideration in light of <em>Judulang.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-24\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
