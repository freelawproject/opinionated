He contends that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time in which to file an appellate brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Cayetano-Gaspar has completed his sentence, has been released from custody, and has been removed to Mexico. The appeal of his sentence is therefore moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. The Government\u2019s motions for summary affirmance and for an extension of time are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
