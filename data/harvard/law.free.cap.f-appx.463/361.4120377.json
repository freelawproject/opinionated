The district court sentenced him to the low end of the guidelines range, 41 months. He appeals the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Ordinarily, we review sentences for procedural error and for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Unpreserved errors are reviewed for plain error only. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Flores renews his assertion that the sentence imposed in his case violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and further argues, for the first time on appeal, that his sentence violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection. Flores\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is not, however, grossly disproportionate to his offense that it violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, </em>987 F.2d 1129, 1134 (5th Cir.1993). Neither did the enhancement of Flores\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) violate his right to equal protection of the law. <em>See id. </em>Flores\u2019s contention, as part of his equal-protection claim, that fast-track districts create an unwarranted sentencing disparity is foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 562-63 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Flores next claims that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable, contending that the sentencing court should have exercised its discretion to vary downwardly to 24 months. His complaint that the district court applied the guidelines as mandatory, raised for the first time on appeal, is not supported by the record. Additionally, the record shows that the district court expressly considered Flores\u2019s arguments for a variance, including his policy challenges to \u00a7 2L1.2 and the relative harshness of prison sentences on aliens, but rejected them, citing, among other reasons, the heinous nature of Flores\u2019s prior crime and his multiple illegal reentries. Flores\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to establish error on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Flores\u2019s contention that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply in his case because \u00a7 2L1.2(b) lacks an empirical basis is also foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Flores has failed to show that his sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness attached to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). Neither has Flores demonstrated any error on the district court\u2019s part, plain or otherwise. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
