Jackson now appeals his 24-month sentence following the revocation of his supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). He argues his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Upon careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse only if left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">Upon determining a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, the district court may revoke the term of supervision and impose imprisonment after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). If the district court decides a sentence outside of the Guidelines range is warranted, it must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as a whole, justify the degree of the variance. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">Jackson has not met his burden of establishing the district court abused its discretion. The court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and disagreed with Jackson\u2019s characterization of his violations as \u201ctechnical.\u201d The court concluded Jackson had been unable to adjust to free society and that he posed a threat to others, based on both his recent behavior and his past criminal history. The court\u2019s conclusions were adequately supported by Jackson\u2019s own admissions to the court and to his probation officers, by his presen-tence investigation report, and by the testimony presented during his sentencing hearing. Accordingly, Jackson\u2019s 24-month sentence \u2014 the statutory maximum \u2014 was not outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
