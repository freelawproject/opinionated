McZeal removed that suit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana. MidSouth sought remand to state court and an award of sanctions for improper removal. The district court granted MidSouth\u2019s motion to remand after finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. The district court also granted MidSouth\u2019s request for removal sanctions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) after finding that McZeal lacked an objectively reasonable basis for removal. McZeal appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), \u201cCongress has severely circumscribed the power of federal appellate courts to review remand orders.\u201d <em>Schexnayder v. Entergy La., Inc., </em>394 F.3d 280, 283 (5th Cir.2004). Section 1447(d) provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). \u201cSpecifically, this Court lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 1447 if the district court based its remand order on either a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a defect in removal procedure.\u201d <em>Schexnayder, </em>394 F.3d at 283 (citing <em>Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.; </em>517 U.S. 706, 711-12, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c)). Here, the district court specifically stated it was remanding due to its lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain McZeal\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, McZeal\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
