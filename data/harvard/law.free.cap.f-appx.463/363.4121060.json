In February 2008, her supervisor, James Smith, was terminated. Shortly thereafter, she and several coworkers wrote a letter defending Smith to the Director of Field Services for OCS. In late February, OCS received an anonymous bomb threat, which it reported to the police, who questioned Becnel and other employees after learning they were upset about Smith\u2019s termination. The detectives were unable to identify any suspects and closed the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">Becnel sued OCS and her supervisors, alleging that they \u201csingled her out and humiliated her\u201d by implicating her to the police during the investigation. Becnel claimed that her supervisors\u2019 actions were retaliation for writing the letter, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge issued a report, which the district court adopted, recommending dismissal of all claims on summary judgment. On appeal, Becnel challenges only the dismissal of her retaliation claim, which she now styles as arising under the First Amendment rather than Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-23\">In her complaint, Becnel never mentions the First Amendment. The closest she comes to pleading a claim under the First Amendment is her vague allusion to the \u201cUnited States Constitution\u201d and her \u201ccivil rights.\u201d She does, however, refer specifically to several other parts of the Constitution and to several statutes, including the Civil Rights Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In her response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>answer to her amended complaint and in her opposition to summary judgment, she specifically alleges retaliation under Title VII of the of the Civil Rights Act but continues to fail to mention the First Amendment. Having failed to raise a First Amendment claim in the district court, Becnel may not do so on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
