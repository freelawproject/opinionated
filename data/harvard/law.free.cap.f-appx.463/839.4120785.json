The 42-month sentence was 15 months below the applicable guideline range of 57-71 months. On appeal, Rodriguez-Tapia argues: (1) the district court erred by not ruling on all of his PSI objections pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i), (2) his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain the reasoning behind his sentence, and (3) his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. After review, we affirm Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Rodriguez-Tapia first argues the district court procedurally erred under Rule 32(i) by not ruling on his objections to the PSI before imposing a sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because he did not raise any objection below to the way the district court resolved his factual objections to the PSI, we are limited to review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). A plain error is: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) affects substantial rights, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-17\">Under Rule 32(i)(3)(B), when a PSI statement is under dispute, the sentencing court must either make a ruling as to the controverted PSI statement or determine that a ruling is unnecessary because it will not affect sentencing. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(B). Rodriguez-Tapia objected to the PSI accounts of several of his past convictions, and pointed out a discrepancy in the number of his past deportations comparing the PSI with other documentation. With respect to the prior convictions, the district court ruled that Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s objections would not affect the sentencing guidelines calculation. In the context of the entire sentencing hearing, it seems the court meant they would not figure into sentencing at all. At most, the court\u2019s statement was ambiguous as to this point. Such ambiguity does not rise to the level of plain error. With respect to the number of prior deportations, Rodriguez-Tapia never clearly objected to their use. He merely asked the court to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>the discrepancy into account. The court did not plainly err in failing to rule on an objection which was not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Rodriguez-Tapia next argues the district court procedurally erred by not explaining why it rejected his request for an 18-month sentence. Because he did not object to his sentence on procedural grounds in the district court, we again review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1195 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1066, 181 L.Ed.2d 781 (2012). Rodriguez-Tapia has the burden of establishing the sentence was unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The appropriateness of brevity or length of a district court\u2019s reasons for accepting or rejecting an argument depends upon the circumstances and leaves much to the court\u2019s own professional judgment. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Where a party requests a non-guideline sentence, the district court will typically explain why those arguments were rejected. <em>United States v. Livesay, 525 </em>F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008). Where the district court imposes a non-guideline sentence, it should explain why. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The district court adequately explained the sentence given. In sentencing, the court responded to Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s arguments by specifically stating it had considered Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s age, the fact that Rodriguez-Tapia had \u201cbeen in this country for about 40 years,\u201d which spoke to cultural assimilation, and the fact that Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s criminal record showed a slowing down in criminal activity as he got older. Moreover, the court granted Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s request for a nonguide-line sentence, although it did not go so far as to impose the requested 18-month sentence. Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-13\">Finally, Rodriguez-Tapia argues his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He contends the district court failed to take into account all of the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that the guideline range was too severe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-14\">On substantive reasonableness review, we will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011) (quotation omitted). The weight to be given any particular factor in sentencing is left to the sound discretion of the distinct court. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). Also, the length of the actual sentence imposed as compared with the guidelines range and statutory maximum may be considered when reviewing reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s argument that the guidelines call for too high of a sentence for his offense is weakened by the fact that the district court imposed a non-guideline sentence. Moreover, Rodriguez-Tapia fails to demonstrate the district court made a clear error in judgment in imposing the sentence. In light of Rodriguez-Tapia\u2019s criminal history and multiple prior deportations, the sentence promotes specific and general deterrence, while adequately taking into account the particulars of his criminal history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 42-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-11\">. Rodriguez-Tapia does not argue that the district court failed to append a written record of its findings to the PSI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-10\">. He also claims the district court should have considered the fact that the Middle District of Florida does not provide downward departures for those who readily admit guilt on a \u201cfast track\u201d basis. We have previously held that district courts are prohibited for sentencing purposes from considering the disparity created by the lack of a \"fast track\u201d program. <em>See United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the failure to take such a disparity into account cannot be an error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
