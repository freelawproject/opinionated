The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition because Aguilar had failed to show that Bardo could not prosecute the action on his own behalf, and dismissed the petition without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Because Aguilar is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he need not obtain a COA to pursue his appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To bring the instant petition pursuant to \u00a7 2242 as Bardo\u2019s \u201cnext friend,\u201d Aguilar was required to provide the district court with \u201can adequate explanation \u2014 such as inaccessibility, mental incompetence, or other disability \u2014 why the real party in interest cannot appear on his own behalf to prosecute the action.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the \u201cnext friend\u201d it was Aguilar\u2019s burden to \u201cclearly to establish the propriety of his status and thereby justify the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court concluded Aguilar had failed to meet that burden. \u201cIn an appeal from the denial of habeas relief, this court reviews a district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and issues of law de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Aguilar alleged below that Bardo could not prosecute the action on his own behalf due to mental incapacitation caused by his marital difficulties. On appeal, he argues the district court erred by rejecting this claim as speculative merely because he did not submit a medical professional\u2019s opinion to support this claim. This argument ignores that Aguilar bore the burden of proving Bardo\u2019s incapacitation, however, and therefore does not justify reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Aguilar also argues that the district court erred because it presumed Bardo had access to a law library and therefore could have prosecuted the action himself. In support of that claim, he submits an affidavit from Bardo. This also does not aid the appeal. First, the affidavit does not claim Bardo was mentally incapacitated, as claimed by Aguilar before the district court. Second, this court does not consider evidence offered for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">In light of the lack of evidence to support Aguilar\u2019s \u201cnext friend\u201d status under \u00a7 2242, the district court did not err by dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\">. <em>Jeffers v.

The district court also found it lacked jurisdiction because Aguilar filed the petition in the wrong district court and because federal courts lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) to review immigration decisions left to the discretion of the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security. Because we conclude that Aguilar failed to present sufficient evidence of his \"next friend\u201d status under \u00a7 2242, we do not need to reach these additional grounds of dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>in order to affirm the district court's judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
