Johnson, prisoner # 07372-043, was sentenced to serve 188 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release. Johnson filed a motion requesting a nunc pro tunc judgment that is best construed as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 because it raised a claim seeking credit towards Johnson\u2019s federal sentence for time previously spent in state custody. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>753 F.2d 455, 456 (5th Cir.1985). The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion, and he now moves this court for authorization to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-22\">Our review of the record and pertinent authority shows that the district court, which sentenced Johnson, lacked jurisdiction over Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because this petition should have been filed in the district where he was incarcerated. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000). Consequently, the district court should have dismissed Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for want of jurisdiction. Johnson\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
