Romo maintains the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained when a police officer, after identifying Romo as a suspect in an attempted burglary, requested his name and date of birth. He claims this questioning violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because he had not been ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>vised of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On appeal from denial of a motion to suppress, issues of law are reviewed <em>de novo; </em>findings of fact, for clear error, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>E.g., United States v. Montes, </em>602 F.3d 381, 384-85 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Armijo v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 177, 178 L.Ed.2d 106 (2010). Assuming those findings are not clearly erroneous, whether the words or actions of law enforcement constituted \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., United States v. Chavira, </em>614 F.3d 127, 132 n. 7 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">There is no evidence the officer knew\u2014 or grounds for contending she should have known \u2014 that her requests for Romo\u2019s name and date of birth were \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Moreover, evidence of Romo\u2019s identity, such as his record as a deported felon, is not subject to suppression as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d. <em>E.g., United States v. Roque-Villanueva, </em>175 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1999). In sum, Romo has failed to identify any evidence obtained by the officer\u2019s questioning that is subject to suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
