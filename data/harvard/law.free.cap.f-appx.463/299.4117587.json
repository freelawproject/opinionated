We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-24\">Counsel\u2019s motions to file the motion to withdraw, the brief, and the record ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>cerpts under seal are GRANTED. Counsel\u2019s request to put the motion to seal itself under seal is also GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
