Rodriguez argues that his \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. 2255(e) because his prior state convictions for simple possession and delivery of controlled substances did not qualify for controlled substance offenses for sentencing enhancement purposes. He further argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001), created an improper precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cA section 2241 petition that seeks to challenge the validity of a federal sentence must either be dismissed or construed as a section 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). A \u00a7 2241 petition that attacks custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his detention. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">To demonstrate that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ineffective, Rodriguez must establish that his claim is \u201c(i) \u2022.. based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] ... may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] ... trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 <em>motion.\u201d Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. The first \u201cfactor requires that a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establish that the petitioner is actually innocent,\u201d meaning that he \u201cmay have been imprisoned for conduct that was not prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830-31 (5th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rodriguez cannot satisfy this factor by merely claiming that the district court improperly applied a sentence enhancement because the claim does not rely on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision showing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904; <em>Kinder, </em>222 F.3d at 213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Furthermore, to the extent that Rodriguez challenges the holding in <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>one panel of this court cannot overrule another panel absent an intervening en banc decision by this court or a decision by the Supreme Court, even if the panel disagrees with the prior panel\u2019s holding. <em>In re Entringer Bakeries, Inc., </em>548 F.3d 344, 348-49 (5th Cir.2008). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b481-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
