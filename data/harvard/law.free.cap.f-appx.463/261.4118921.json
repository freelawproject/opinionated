We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Kirkman\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. The only legal authorities, other than the statutes of conviction, cited in the brief filed on Kirkman\u2019s behalf are two cases holding that an appellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. The bulk of the brief consists of defense counsel\u2019s conclusional assertions and spin on the testimony. There is no discussion of matters ordinarily considered in sufficiency cases involving co-conspirator testimony, including the standard of review, the elements of the offenses, the evidentiary principles governing such testimony, and the law governing evidentiary sufficiency generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Given the uncontradicted evidence of her guilt, the standard of review may be pre-termitted, as Kirkman cannot prevail under any standard. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, the elements of the offenses may be pretermitted, as Kirkman does not contend that the government failed to prove any of them. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Kirkman notes that no independent witness saw her with the stolen property\u2014 coins valued at about $152,000 \u2014 and that the only evidence that the coins were stolen came from codefendants. She also states that the only proof of her guilt is the testimony of two co-conspirators who were indicted with her. To the extent that Kirkman may be understood to contend that her codefendants\u2019 testimony should not have been admitted and was not enough to convict her, she is mistaken. Unless it is factually insubstantial or incredible, which Kirkman does not claim to be the case, uncorroborated testimony from even one of her co-conspirator was sufficient evidence to convict her. <em>See United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1190 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Acosta, </em>763 F.2d 671, 680 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">The uncontradicted \u2014 and unobjected to \u2014 testimony of Kirkman\u2019s codefendants was that Kirkman removed the coins from the victim\u2019s residence and shared in the proceeds of their sale, knowing that the victim had consented to neither the remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>al nor the sale. Kirkman nevertheless maintains conclusionally that the totality of the evidence, both physical and testimonial, was just as likely to prove her innocence as it was to prove her guilt; she cites no law in support of this proposition. To the extent that Kirkman may be understood to imply that we should \u201csubstitute [our] decision for that of the jury\u201d and thus undermine \u201c[t]he sanctity of the jury function,\u201d she is wrong, our obligation being to review the \u201cevidence to determine if there exists any reasonable theory from which the jury might have concluded that [Kirkman] was guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. McGlamory, </em>441 F.2d 130, 136 (5th Cir.1971). Indeed, there is such a reasonable theory for concluding that Kirkman is guilty: She knew where the coins were kept, removed them, helped to sell them, and kept part of the proceeds without any accounting to their owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
