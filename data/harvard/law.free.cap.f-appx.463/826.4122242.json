The district court heard White\u2019s evidence in mitigation and allocution. The district court then, without further comment, sentenced White to 60 months as to case number 1:01-cr-33 and 24 months as to case number 1:08-cr-19, with the terms to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">White objected to the 60-month term as outside the guidelines range and to the imposition of consecutive terms. In response, the district court stated, \u201cIt is beyond the advisory guideline range but it is not beyond the statutory range.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court then implicitly overruled White\u2019s objections, noting that the \u201cobjections are on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">On appeal, White argues that the district court erred because it did not mention White\u2019s advisory guidelines range or the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or explain the sentences it imposed, one of which apparently included an upward variance to the statutory maximum. The government concedes error and agrees that remand is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">After reviewing the transcript of the revocation proceedings, we conclude that the record is insufficient to determine whether the district court calculated advisory guidelines ranges or considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing White\u2019s prison terms. The district court did not identify the criminal classification for White\u2019s violation or the applicable guidelines ranges under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1. The district court also did not state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or explain the chosen sentences in a way that would indicate it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Accordingly, we vacate White\u2019s sentences and remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.2007), and <em>United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1294-95 (11th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the record is insufficient for appellate review, we do not address the reasonableness of the sentences imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-14\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b851-10\">. According to the probation officer\u2019s memorandum, to which the district court did not refer during the revocation proceedings, the statutory maximum prison term the district court could impose in case number 1:01-cr-33 was 60 months and the applicable guidelines range was 46 to 57 months. For case number 1:08-cr-19, the statutory maximum and the applicable guidelines range was 24 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b851-11\">. <em>See United States v.
