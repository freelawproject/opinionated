He argues on appeal that the district court abused its discretion by revoking his supervised release, and that his 60-month sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Murphy first contends that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he committed aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, the state criminal offense that formed the factual basis of one of his supervised release violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). A district court\u2019s findings of fact made at a revocation hearing are reviewed for clear error, and we will reverse only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support those findings. <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993); <em>see United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007). A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release and impose a prison sentence when it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-16\">Here, substantial evidence and testimony presented at the revocation hearing, including Murphy\u2019s plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>to aggravated battery charges in Florida state court, supported the district court\u2019s determination that Murphy had committed a violation of the terms and conditions of his supervised release. Additionally, Murphy\u2019s admission to a different violation, misdemeanor battery, further supports the district court\u2019s determination. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Murphy violated the terms of his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-18\">Murphy further argues that his 60-month sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to determine the grade of his violations, for purposes of calculating an advisory sentencing range, nor did it indicate that had it thoroughly considered the Sentencing Guidelines and the sentencing factors found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also contends that because strong evidence suggested that he had not committed one of the violations, and the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his sentence is also substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-19\">We review the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d at 1252. A district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range, as determined by Chapter 7 of the Sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ing Guidelines, is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we ensure that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable, meaning the district court (1) properly calculated the guideline range, (2) treated the guidelines as advisory, (3) considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (4) did not rely on clearly erroneous facts, and (5) adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>In explaining the sentence, the district court need not specifically discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, if it is clear from the record that the district court properly considered them. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Once we determine that a sentence is proeedurally sound, we examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>We must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a sentencing variance. <em>Id. </em>We will remand for resentencing only if we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs violations of supervised release and provides recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4). We have consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. <em>Id. </em>at 799. However, the district court is required to consider the statements, and when exceeding them, \u201cmust normally indicate that it considered [them].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the Sentencing Guidelines, where there is more than one violation of the conditions of supervision, the grade of the violation is determined by the violation having the most serious grade. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(b). The guidelines provide that conduct constituting a crime of violence, punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, is a Grade A violation for which revocation of supervised release is mandatory. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a)(1). Under Florida law, aggravated battery is a second-degree felony, punishable by a term of imprisonment not exceeding 15 years, and occurs when a person, \u201cin committing battery ... uses a deadly weapon.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.045(1)(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Murphy has not carried his burden of showing that his sentence is either pro-eedurally or substantively unreasonable. Contrary to Murphy\u2019s contention, the district court revoked his supervised release on the basis of both the misdemeanor battery and aggravated battery violations. Any failure by the district court to expressly name Murphy\u2019s aggravated battery offense a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d in light of the circumstances of the violation that were established during the revocation hearing, does not amount to procedural error. Additionally, Murphy\u2019s other claims of procedural unreasonableness are similarly without merit, as the record reflects that the district court considered both the advisory sentencing guidelines range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Murphy\u2019s 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Murphy\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the facts and circumstances of his revocation offenses. The district court\u2019s above-guidelines sentence further reflects the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement, which provides that \u201can upward departure may be warranted\u201d in a case, such as this, where the defendant\u2019s \u201coriginal sentence was the result of a downward departure ... as [a] reward for substantial assistance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the revocation of Murphy\u2019s supervised release and his 60-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
