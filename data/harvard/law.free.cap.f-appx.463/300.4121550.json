Because Sotelo-Soto has raised a question of law for our review, we have jurisdiction in this case pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(D). <em>See Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 538 (5th Cir.2008) (stating that whether a prior convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion is an aggravated felony is a question of law). Sotelo-Soto argues that his conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony under Section 1101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act because the Texas statute applies to many non-forceful types of conduct, does not require intent for its violation, and does not involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Section 1101(a)(43) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as including \u201ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of Title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (2006). In <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ledezma, </em>630 F.3d 447, 451 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 3024, 180 L.Ed.2d 851 (2011), this court held that a Texas conviction for evading arrest or detention with a motor vehicle under \u00a7 38.04 qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Because the offense qualifies as a crime of violence and, as he does not dispute, Sotelo-Soto was sentenced to a term of two years of imprisonment for the offense, the BIA did not err in its conclusions that the offense qualifies as an aggravated felony and that Sotelo-Soto is removable as a result. <em>See Sanchez-Ledezma, </em>630 F.3d at 451; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (defining the term aggravated felony to include a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 16(b)); \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). The petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
