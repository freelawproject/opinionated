No reversible error has been shown; we affirm. The sentence was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">On appeal, Chavez-Romero argues that his sentence \u2014 imposed below the guidelines range of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the goals 'of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">In addition, \u201c[i]t is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, an alleged error cannot serve as grounds for reversal if the appealing party \u201cinduces or invites the district court into making [the alleged] error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Chavez-Romero concedes that the district court assigned him properly a criminal history category of IV. At his sentencing hearing, however, he argued that, because four of his seven criminal history points were for driving offenses, the district court should depart downward and sentence him based on a criminal history category of II. He requested specifically a sentence with the Category II guideline range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. He got a 57-month Category II sentence. Because the district court granted Chavez-Romero\u2019s request for a downward departure and sentenced him within the range he requested, Chavez-Romero is now precluded from challenging the very act that he asked the district court to undertake. Furthermore, the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
