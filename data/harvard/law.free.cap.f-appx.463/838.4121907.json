Allstate filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Swanson materially breached the contract by failing to notify it that the insured property had been vacant for over a year prior to its loss by fire. Allstate also argued that there was no coverage under the contract due to the contract\u2019s exclusion for vandalism or malicious mischief to a vacant house.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">The district court granted summary judgment to Allstate in a thorough opinion with which we find no error. Therefore, on the basis of the opinion of Chief United States District Judge Susan Blackburn, issued on the 3rd of August, 2011, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
