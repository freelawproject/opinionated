The district court departed upwardly from the applicable guidelines sentencing range and sentenced Guerra to 120 months of imprisonment and a four-year term of supervised release. Guerra timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-15\">Guerra argues that the district court inappropriately departed upwardly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. He asserts that the district court wrongly concluded that an upward departure was justified on the basis that he flagrantly abused the public trust in his capacity as the police chief in Sullivan City, Texas, by using his law enforcement position to facilitate and encourage drug trafficking. Guerra argues that he was assessed a two-level upward adjustment in his base offense level for abuse of trust under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3, and, therefore, his offense level accounted sufficiently for his abuse of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">Reasonableness review, in the context of an upward departure, requires an appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>late court to evaluate for abuse of discretion both the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly and the extent of that departure. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). An upward departure is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and are justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 250-51 <em>&amp; </em>n. 17 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on other </em>grounds, 479 F.3d 904 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Section 5K2.0 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides that a departure may be authorized if the court finds that there exists an aggravating circumstance \u201cof a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that, in order to advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(1)(A). An upward departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 may be warranted \u201cin an exceptional case, even though the circumstance that forms the basis for the departure is taken into consideration in determining the guideline range, if the court determines that such circumstance is present in the offense to a degree substantially in excess of ... that which ordinarily is involved in that kind of offense.\u201d \u00a7 6K2.0(a)(3), p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In the instant case, the district court found that, while Guerra received an adjustment for abuse of trust pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3, the case involved exceptional circumstances that justified the imposition of an upward departure. The district court concluded that Guerra\u2019s abdication of his law enforcement responsibilities and significant alignment with drug traffickers was an egregious and flagrant abuse of the public trust for which the Guidelines did not properly account. The court noted that Guerra\u2019s abuse of the public trust was unusually systematic and pervasive and would cause a community to suffer a significant loss in confidence in its government and law enforcement, particularly in light of Guerra\u2019s role as the \u201cchief law enforcement officer\u201d of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The district court\u2019s reasons for imposing an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0 are not discouraged by the Guidelines and are supported by the facts of the case. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5K2.0(a)(1), (a)(3); <em>see generally United States v. Wade, </em>931 F.2d 300, 307 (5th Cir.1991) (indicating that abuse of law enforcement position is valid reason to depart upwardly). The court\u2019s stated reasons for the departure also show that the court\u2019s sentencing decision was grounded in \u00a7 3553(a) and advanced the sentencing objectives of that statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to its decision to depart upwardly or its reasons for that decision. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Guerra also argues that his sentence is unreasonable. He asserts that a within-guidelines sentence would have been sufficient in light of his particular circumstances (e.g., he accepted responsibility for his offense, resigned from his career in law enforcement, had no prior criminal history, and qualified for safety valve relief pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2). Guerra contends that the imposition of an upward departure rendered his sentence excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">In considering the reasonableness of the sentence imposed, this court takes into account the totality of the circumstances, and may consider the extent of the departure. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cA sentence is unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives signif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>icant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this court might reasonably conclude<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that a lower sentence was appropriate, such a conclusion is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The record supports that the district court, which was in a superior position to assess sentencing factors, implicitly rejected Guerra\u2019s sentencing arguments and determined that an above-guidelines sentence was justified in spite of those arguments. Guerra\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s determination does not establish that the district court wrongly assessed the sentencing factors. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, as detailed above, the district court gave adequate reasons for its decision to impose an above-guidelines sentence; the district court concluded that a departure was justified given Guerra\u2019s egregious behavior in remorselessly using his position as police chief to facilitate and encourage drug trafficking, and the decision to depart advanced the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Accordingly, under the facts of this case, and given the district court\u2019s wide discretion in fashioning a sentence, the record supports that the district court\u2019s decision to depart upwardly was reasonable. <em>See Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d at 250. The extent of the departure, which was 12 months above the top of Guerra\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 87 to 108 months and was less than the statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, was a reasonable exercise of the court\u2019s sentencing discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
