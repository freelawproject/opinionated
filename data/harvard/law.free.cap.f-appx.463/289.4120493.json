His employer provides an Occupational Injury Benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The plan is administered by Caprock Claims Management and funded with an insurance policy issued by GHS Property &amp; Casualty. Caprock informed Jurasin his neck condition was not compensable. A review board also denied his claim. Ju-rasin brought suit, but the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">On January 21, 2008, while removing a tarp from his tractor-trailer, John Jurasin slipped on some mud. Although he avoided a fall by grasping a rail, he claimed to have heard a \u201cpop.\u201d Shortly thereafter, he sought treatment for pain to his \u201cright back and right abdominal wall.\u201d After some improvement, Jurasin returned to work with light-duty restrictions. By February 1, he resumed unrestricted assignments after having completed physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-17\">Jurasin complained of renewed lower thoracic back pain that March and was referred to a pain management specialist. He received a cortisone shot due to a knot in his back. Complications ensued. Jura-sin developed an abscess which required surgery. After a hospital stay, he received home health care. In July, an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Dar, suggested conditioning and rehabilitation, known as work hardening, and he sent Jurasin to another pain manager. Dr. Dar reviewed MRI films and made what he termed an \u201cincidental finding\u201d that Jurasin\u2019s C6-7 cervical disc in the neck was herniated; Dar further noted that Jurasin was not experiencing neck discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">An independent medical examination on August 21 found that Jurasin\u2019s C6-7 herniation was not compressing his spinal cord and that his cervical spine\u2019s range of motion was unrestricted. Several other doctors specializing in orthopedics and neurology expressed the opinion that his neck condition was chronic and preexisting, not traceable to Jurasin\u2019s injury at work. On November 18, 2008, Caprock informed Ju-rasin that it had determined, after consideration by a Medical Review Officer, that his cervical condition was not compensable. Coverage was limited to the injury to his thoracic and lumbar spine. For the com-pensable injuries, the plan ultimately paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>over $32,000 in medical expenses and $17,000 in disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On February 4, 2009, Jurasin was examined by Dr. Garza-Vale. This doctor found the neck injury was preexisting but that Jurasin\u2019s accident had aggravated the injury. His findings were submitted to Caprock. After reviewing the medical evidence, including the submission from Dr. Garza-Vale, Caprock again informed Jura-sin, on March 20, 2009, that the only com-pensable injury was to his back. Ten days later, Dr. Garza-Vale again examined Ju-rasin; a letter reiterating his view more emphatically was furnished to the GHS appeals board. The appeals board denied Jurasin\u2019s claim on April 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Pursuant to ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision, Jurasin filed suit challenging the denial of benefits for his cervical condition. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The court granted summary judgment for the plan defendants, Caprock and GHS. Jurasin timely appealed. In addition to contesting the coverage decision, Jurasin claims that the district court erred in striking parts of his own affidavit, as well as one from Dr. Garza-Vale.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and apply the same standard as the district court. <em>Schexnayder v. Hartford Life and Accident Ins. Co., </em>600 F.3d 465, 468 (5th Cir.2010). When, as here, the administrator of an ERISA plan has discretion to determine eligibility and interpret plan terms, the plan\u2019s denial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cA plan administrator abuses its discretion where the decision is not based on evidence, even if disputable, that clearly supports the basis for its denial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citation omitted). We are not \u201cto engage in full review of the motivations behind every plan administrator\u2019s discretionary decisions.\u201d <em>Crosby v. La. Health Serv. and Indem. Co., </em>647 F.3d 258, 264 (5th Cir.2011) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review is to \u201cassure that the administrator\u2019s decision fall[s] somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness \u2014 even if on the low end.\u201d <em>Corry v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>499 F.3d 389, 398 (5th Cir.2007) (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">We employ a two-step inquiry as to ERISA plan decisions. We first decide if the determination by the plan administrator was legally correct, and if it is, there is no abuse of discretion. <em>Holland v. Int\u2019l Paper Co. Ret. Plan, </em>576 F.3d 240, 246 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009). If the determination is not legally correct, we then determine whether the administrator\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Because Jurasin does not assert any improper plan interpretation, we exercise our discretion to bypass the first step here. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\n<em>I. Conflict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">Jurasin alleges two sources of conflict that \u201cshould have tilted the [district] court\u2019s review toward a less-than-deferential standard.\u201d Though Jurasin refers to some of our earlier caselaw about a sliding scale of review, this Court no longer employs that method. <em>Holland, </em>576 F.3d at 247-248 &amp; n. 3 (discussing <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008)). It is fair to say that \u201cconflicts are but one factor among many,\u201d and the \u201cspecific facts of the conflict will dictate its importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">Both his arguments relate to a conflict of interest rooted in Caprock\u2019s dual role as the evaluator and the payor. <em>See, e.g., Holland, </em>576 F.3d at 248 n. 3. We are required to take into account this dual role in reviewing a benefit determination. <em>Metro. Life, </em>554 U.S. at 115, 128 S.Ct. 2343. Jurasin claims bias stemming from the fact that the Medical Review Officer on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>whom Caprock relied for its November 2008 denial, Dr. Cunningham, was employed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma, a division of the funding insurance company GHS. Jurasin\u2019s suggestion that Cunningham provided a dishonest medical assessment merely due to an attenuated employment relationship with GHS is too theoretical and speculative for us to entertain. <em>See Davis v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>444 F.3d 569, 575-76 (7th Cir.2006). There needs to be, for example, evidence that Cunningham had \u201csome specific stake in the outcome of [Jurasin\u2019s] case, such as paying the doctors more\u201d when claims were denied. <em>Id. </em>at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Jurasin also claims an institutional-level conflict because the review board that processed his appeal was entirely composed of GHS employees. As noted, Caprock has been delegated the responsibility of independently deciding claims in the first instance. Conflict takes a \u201ccase-specific importance.\u201d <em>Metro. Life, </em>554 U.S. at 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343. Jurasin points to nothing suggesting a \u201clikelihood that it affected the benefits decision,\u201d such as an allegation that this \u201cinsurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration,\u201d misconduct by the board members, or the absence of firewalls and other internal operating procedures to insulate the decisionmakers. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We agree with the district court that the unsupported assertions here are not evidence of a conflict. <em>Schexnayder, </em>600 F.3d at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>II. Abuse of Discretion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Jurasin asserts the district court erred by striking portions of Dr. Garza-Vale\u2019s and Jurasin\u2019s affidavits. Evidence is irrelevant to the validity of the decision regarding coverage under the plan unless it \u201cis in the administrative record, relates to how the administrator has interpreted the plan in the past, or would assist the court in understanding medical terms and procedures.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>647 F.3d at 263. The district court hewed carefully to this limitation, striking offending portions and admitting only those that assisted \u201cthe district court in understanding the medical terminology or practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The evidence required in support of the plan\u2019s decision is \u201cmore than a scintilla, less than a preponderance, and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 273 (5th Cir.2004) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Jurasin\u2019s claim that the accident worsened his condition has some evidentia-ry support, but that is not enough for reversal. <em>See id. </em>The physician who administered Jurasin\u2019s independent medical exam concluded Jurasin\u2019s neck condition was unrelated to the incident at work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2I\">In my opinion, the injuries sustained <em>from </em>the work injury of 1/21/08 are the abdominal wall strain, thoracic strain/ sprain, and lumbar strain/sprain.... More likely than not, the herniated disc at C6-7 was a pre-existing herniation. There is no mention made in the medical records of any neck pain or arm pain that would date back to the 1/21/08 injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Jurasin relies on the opinion of Dr. Garza-Vale, who examined Jurasin only after he was denied coverage. That doctor agreed with the other doctors that the neck spur preexisted the injury at work. He believed, though, that the neck condition was traceable to work because it first became symptomatic after the accident. That evidence did not have to be accepted in light of contrary medical findings. Ju-rasin\u2019s argument that the review process ignored the contrary perspective of Dr. Garza-Vale is incorrect. When Caprock informed Jurasin on January 21, 2008 that it was upholding its earlier denial, it re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>ported that it had reviewed Dr. Garza-Vale\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In his brief, Jurasin also discusses the possibility of \u201creferred pain,\u201d a phenomenon by which an injury at one location in the body manifests as pain elsewhere. That possibility is relevant as it could explain why Jurasin did not report any neck pain soon after the injury at work. That opinion was presented and not found to control over the other medical evidence. We do not weigh the evidence on our review, but only determine whether there is some evidence to support the administrator\u2019s decision. There is.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u201cWe reach a finding of abuse of discretion only where the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>576 F.3d at 246 (quotation marks and citation omitted). That did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b314-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
