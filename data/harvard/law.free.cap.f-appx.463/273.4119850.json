He first argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence found during a search of a pickup truck he was driving because the Border Patrol agent who stopped the truck did not have a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The area\u2019s close proximity to the border, the characteristics of the area and the vehicle, the agent\u2019s extensive experience in detecting illegal activity, Fallin\u2019s behavior in nervously checking the mirrors to keep an eye on the agent, and the information about recent illegal narcotics in the area, viewed in totality and in the light most favorable to the Government, provided a constitutional basis for stopping Fallin\u2019s truck. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vasquez, </em>298 F.3d 354, 357-58 (5th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Jacquinot, </em>258 F.3d 423, 430 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Muniz-Ortega, </em>858 F.2d 258, 259-60 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Fallin also contends that the district court erred by failing to apply the safety valve provision set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) to his sentence. He argues that, despite the Government\u2019s assertion otherwise, he fulfilled his duty to truthfully debrief regarding his offense. Given the number of inconsistencies between Fallin\u2019s written proffer and the facts set forth in the pre-sentence report, the district court\u2019s determination that Fallin was not providing full disclosure was not clearly erroneous. See <em>United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
