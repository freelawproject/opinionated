But the defendants contended that the line marked \u201c center line \u201d was the west line of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and that the defendants\u2019 ground was not included.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-13\">It was shown at the trial by the testimony of J. W. Dodge and John S. Fox, two of plaintiffs\u2019 immediate vendors, as well as others, that said \u201c center line \u201d was the west line of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, as marked out in 1857 in their presence, and that none of the ground claimed by defendants was included. It was also found by the Court as a fact, that none of the ground claimed by defendants was ever included in the claim of plaintiffs while the same was the property of plaintiffs\u2019 vendors, and as marked out in 1857; nor had plaintiffs worked any ground west of the center line when defendants began working it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-15\">At the trial, the Court permitted evidence to show that when Fox and Dodge, who took up the claims with plaintiff, Eagan, in 1856, sold out their interest to Stewart, one of the plaintiffs, in July, 1858, they represented to Stewai't that their claims extended two hundred feet west of said \u201c center line,\u201d and that afterwards plaintiffs claimed the same as them ground, and that such claim was so made before defendants went upon the same; and the Court found that at this purchase, in 1858, there was no adverse claim to the ground two hundred feet west of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>\u201c </em>center line,\u201d and that defendants began working this two hundred feet in the fall of 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\">Upon these facts the Court found, as a conclusion of law, that plaintiffs were entitled to recover, not upon the title set up in the complaint, but upon the purchase in July, 1858, from men who at the time did not own the ground as was conceded\u2014the Court holding that plaintiffs were not limited to the boundaries claimed by their vendors, there being at the time no adverse possession or claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">When plaintiffs closed their case, defendants moved to strike out all evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 title which did not go to support the title set up in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">The Court overruled the motion, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">Plaintiffs had judgment; defendants appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-9\"><em>John Hume, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-10\"><em>Sanderson and, Newell, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b87-11\">Baldwin, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">This was a suit for the recovery of a mining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The plaintiffs stated in the complaint their title, its origin and deraignment; and upon the title, thus set out, claimed a recovery. The answer denied the title thus* set up. Upon the trial the plaintiffs proved, as they claim, a title accruing to them in a particular way, subsequent in origin and different in the mode of acquisition from that counted on in the complaint. Perhaps it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to set out the particular facts constituting then' title in this action; but having done this, it would seem they should be held to prove it as averred, at least in substance; and that they cannot, against the defendants\u2019 objection, recover on another and a different title.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">The defendants made an affidavit, on motion for a new trial, on the ground of surprise, arising from the frame of the pleadings, and averring that they could have introduced testimony rebutting the plaintiffs\u2019 case but for this surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-15\">We think, under the circumstances, a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-16\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
