This copy, on its face, showed that the deed purported to be acknowledged before Charles Halsey, a Notary Public, and his certificate concludes thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-9\">\u201c In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and affixed my official seal, the day and year first above written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-10\">[No Seal.] \u201c Charles Halsey,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-11\"><em>\u201c </em>Notary Public.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-12\">Then follows the certificate of the County Recorder that the foregoing is a true copy of an instrument on file in his office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-13\">On defendant\u2019s objection, this copy was ruled out, on the ground that it appeared on the face thereof, that there was no seal of the Notary who took the acknowledgment.

J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-17\">We think the Court erred in excluding the deed in this case. Take the transcript altogether, and we think it shows sufficiently that the seal of the Notary was affixed to the instrument. The certificate asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that the Notary affixed his seal to it, and the words \u201c No seal,\u201d in brackets in the margin, do not imply that there was no seal affixed, but axe a mere note of the Recorder of the place of the notarial seal, which he had probably no means of copying, nor was it necessary that he should transcribe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
