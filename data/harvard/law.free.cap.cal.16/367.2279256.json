The respondent is the Public Administrator of Amador county, where the intestate died. Both parties applied for letters of administration of the estate of the deceased. No other application was made by any one. The Probate Court held that the appellant, as surviving partner of the deceased, was disqualified from acting as administrator, and directed letters to issue to the respondent; and the question presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>for determination is, whether the proviso in the section cited extends to the several classes of persons to whom administration may be granted, or only to the persons embraced within the tenth class. We are of opinion that the proviso extends to all the classes designated, and that the surviving partner, where the partnership existed at the time of the death of the intestate, is precluded from acting as administrator of the estate of such intestate, and we therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
