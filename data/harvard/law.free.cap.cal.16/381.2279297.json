Plaintiff, having exhausted his remedies on this judgment, by execution and proceedings supplementary thereto, obtained from the Court a decree for the equitable relief sought in the complaint, to wit: for a lien upon, and a sale of the real estate. <em>Held, </em>that this decree was <em>coram nort judice, </em>and void\u2014assuming the judgment by the defendant to be valid. Such judgment, if valid, terminated the controversy, and whatever related to the merits of the case was merged in the judgment.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b381-5\">Doubtful, whether the Clerk could enter judgment, in action of this nature, without application to the Court.

It is also alleged, that defendant, at the time of making his note\u2014as part of the same transaction, and on the same sheet of paper\u2014made and delivered to plaintiff a writing as follows: \u201c This is to certify, that the above note is given for money to purchase a ranch or farm in Alamo, and is understood to be as purchase money on said ranch or farm; for which I consider the above ranch or farm holden for said moneys and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\"><em>(Signed) </em>\u201c Chas. 0.

Prayer for a decree that defendant hold the farm as trustee of plaintiff; that he have a lien thereon for the money advanced, with interest; that he have judgment against defendant for the amount of the note, with a decree to sell so much of the land as is necessary to pay such judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-11\">Further facts appear in the opinion of the Court.

J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">This is an action to recover a sum of money due upon a -promissory note, and to establish a lien for the amount upon certain real estate. The complaint was filed on the twenty-ninth of March, 1859, and a summons was duly issued and served upon the defendant. No answer being filed within the time limited by the statute, a judgment by default was entered for the amount claimed. Upon this judgment an execution was issued, and certain property of the defendant was levied upon and sold. The proceeds of this sale being insufficient to satisfy the judgment, the statutory proceedings, supplementary to execution, were resorted to without effect. The plaintiff, having exhausted his remedies upon this judgment, obtained from the Court a decree for the equitable relief prayed for in the complaint. The question is, whether, under these circumstances, the plaintiff was entitled to this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">No point is made as to the validity of the original judgment, and we allude to the matter for the purpose of reserving our opinion upon that subject. The judgment was entered by the Clerk, without an application to the Court, and we think it extremely doubtful whether, in an action of this nature, such a proceeding has any foundation in the statute. If the judgment was properly entered, it terminated the suit, and the subsequent decree was <em>coram non judice </em>and void. \u201cA judgment,\u201d says the statute, \u201c is the final determination of the rights of the parties in the action or proceeding; and the rendition of the judgment is the conclusion of the controversy.\u201d Whatever relates to the merits is merged in the judgment, and becomes <em>res judicata; </em>and if there are issues upon which the judgment is not conclusive, they must be determined in a different action. Even as a matter of practice, the course pursued in this case could not be tolerated. It would lead to endless confusion, and be attended with hardships and difficulties innumerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Conceding, for the purposes of this decision, the validity of the original judgment, our conclusion is, that the additional relief was improperly granted, and that the decree appealed from must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
