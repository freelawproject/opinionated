Defendant demurred on the grounds, among others, that the indictment does not substantially conform to sections two hundred and thirty-seven and two hundred and thirty-eight of the Criminal Practice Act in certain particulars, naming them; and that the facts stated do not constitute a public offense. Demurrer sustained, no exception being taken by the District Attorney. Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-10\"><em>Thomas H.

The People now appeal from this order sustaining the demurrer. We think, under the circumstances, the appeal should be dismissed. A contrary practice would lead to oppression and confusion. The failure to except and taking the order must be considered an acquiescence in the judgment and a waiver of a right of appeal. If the grand jury had found a new bill on the resubmission, no appeal would lie, of course, from any disposition of the demurrer to the first bill; and the resubmission of the matter is not less decisive of the intent to abandon the first indictment, and to hold as final the judgment on the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
