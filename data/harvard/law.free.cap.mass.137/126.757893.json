Smith conveyed this parcel, through a third person, to Ellen Smith, his wife, the demandant in this action, and, in 1873, Sarah P. Beville, formerly Kingman, conveyed her undivided half to said Ellen, thus vesting the whole title of the last described estate in Ellen Smith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">Hannah Smith died in 1876. W. W. Nichols, her administrator, obtained license of the Probate Court to sell all her real estate, and on September 16, 1879, by virtue of such license, sold, and. made a deed purporting to convey, to James R. Rutledge, real estate described as follows, namely: Bounded northwest on C Street 51 feet 7 inches, northeasterly on Silver Street 50 feet, southeasterly on parties unknown 51 feet 7 inches, and southwesterly on land of S. K. Williams 50 feet, containing 2579 square feet more or less.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">In 1880 the heirs of William Smith made quitclaim deeds to Rutledge of a parcel of land, the description of which was the same as the description in the above administrator\u2019s deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">Rutledge conveyed to Ellen Cooney the estate at the corner of C and Silver Streets, bounded northwest on C Street 21 feet, northeast on Silver Street 50 feet, southeast on parties unknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>21 feet, and southwest on the centre of the brick partition wall between this and the adjoining house 50 feet, to the point of beginning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\">Afterwards, in 1880, Rutledge conveyed to Esther Nichols the estate adjoining the last above described, bounded, commencing about 76 feet 5 inches northerly from the northeast corner of Fourth and C Streets, thence running northerly on 0 Street 30 feet 7 inches, then easterly by the partition wall between this and adjoining premises 50 feet, then southerly by parties unknown 30 feet 7 inches, then westerly by land of Ellen Smith 50 feet, more or less.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">Esther F. Nichols in 1881 conveyed the same premises by the same description to William W. Nichols, who, on June 29, 1882, conveyed the same by the same description to the tenant, who is and has been in possession under her said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">The present occupation of the tenant is north of a line 51 feet and 4 inches south of Silver Street. Between her occupation and that of the demandant is a fence, which was built in 1882, soon after she received her deed. At the same time that this fence was built there was removed an old fence, on the northerly side of the new fence, about parallel with the same. The demandant contended that the old fence was the true boundary of her land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">The demandant put in oral testimony tending to show that the old fence had existed in the same place over thirty years, and was about 49 feet from and parallel to Silver Street, and that the demandant and those under whom she claimed had in fact occupied all the land south of said old fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">It appeared that the new fence was built and the old fence removed at the joint expense of the tenant and her grantor, W. W. Nichols, and, if competent, against the objection of the demandant, it may be considered that the tenant, when she bargained for the property, did so with the understanding that the old fence was not the true boundary, and that her grantor was to contribute to the expense of removing the same and of building a new fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">The tenant then put in the following deed, executed and delivered by the demandant and her husband, and duly acknowledged and recorded:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201c Know all men by these presents that I, Charles T.

Charles T. and Ellen Smith on August 11, 1880, must be construed to be a deed of release and quitclaim by both, and to convey all the interest of Ellen, as well as of Charles, in the parcels described, and not a conveyance by Charles alone with a release by Ellen of all right to dower and homestead in the premises conveyed by Charles. If the measurements of the parcels are to govern, this deed conveyed the strip two feet and seven inches wide owned by Ellen, and the judgment should be for the tenant. The presiding justice could not therefore rule, as matter of law, that \u201c the tenant had not made out a defence.\u201d The deed purports to release and quitclaim \u201c a certain parcel of land, with the buildings thereon standing, situated in that part of Boston called South Boston, and numbered 87 and 89 C Street, and is bounded and described as follows,\u201d &amp;c.
