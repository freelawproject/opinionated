The declaration alleged that, in consideration of services to be rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant, in procuring persons to organize a corporation, the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff $200 in cash, and to transfer to him one hundred shares of the capital stock of the corporation so to be formed; that the plaintiff rendered the services agreed upon, and organized the corporation; that the defendant refused to pay said money or transfer said stock; and that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>claimed damages for the breach of the defendant\u2019s promise. The defendant filed a declaration in set-off, for money paid to the plaintiff\u2019s use; and the plaintiff filed an answer to the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">\u25a0 At the trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., before the defendant introduced any evidence in support of his declaration in set-off, the plaintiff asked the judge to rule that no evidence was admissible in support of the declaration in set-off, the claim of the plaintiff being a demand for unliquidated damages.- The defendant contended that the plaintiff had waived his objections to the declaration in set-off by answering thereto; and that the demand of the plaintiff was itself a subject of set-off. The judge ruled that the declaration in set-off should be considered as out of the case, and that no evidence could be introduced in support of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>C.

The plaintiff\u2019s demand was for an unliquidated sum. He sought to recover damages for the defendant\u2019s refusal to perform his promise. That promise, as alleged, was to pay a certain sum of money and to transfer a certain number of shares. This promise was alleged to have been broken; and, for the breach, the plaintiff claimed damages. These damages were unliquidated, and could not be ascertained by calculation, but would depend upon a consideration of how much the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the breach of the whole agreement of the defendant. No set-off, therefore, could be allowed. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>168, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">2. The plaintiff might properly take the objection at the trial, though no demurrer had been filed. <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Boston \u00a7 Fairhaven Iron Works, </em>97 Mass. 502. <em>Hubbard </em>v. <em>Mosely, </em>11 Gray, 170. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
