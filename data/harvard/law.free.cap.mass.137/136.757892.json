The declaration contained two counts, the first alleging that \u201c the defendant publicly, falsely, and maliciously accused the plaintiff of the crime of perjury, by words spoken of the plaintiff substantially as follows: \u2018I say before this officer, that Plumer Chesley committed perjury when before Blackmar. I say it openly, and intend to bring him before the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d The second count contained the same allegation as the first count, the words set out as spoken of the plaintiff being as follows: \u201cI say he committed perjury in swearing as he did before Blackmar. I say openly before these witnesses that he committed perjury.\u201d Answer: 1. A general denial. 2. That the words spoken were true. 3. That any words spoken by the defendant in relation to the matters set out in the declaration were spoken in court, in the course of the trial of a cause in the District Court of the United States for the district of Massachusetts ; that a petition was then pending to set aside a discharge in bankruptcy granted to said plaintiff; that in said petition it was charged that the plaintiff had committed the crime of perjury, and the same was assigned as one of the reasons for setting aside said discharge; and that any words spoken were parts of a conversation had with the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in relation to said charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">Trial in the Superior Court before Rockwell, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-8\">There was evidence tending to show that the alleged slanderous words were spoken in the presence of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and of five or six other persons, most of whom were members of the bar and officers of the court, in the United States District Court room, in Boston, before the opening of the court, and while they were waiting for the judge to come in to hear a motion in a case in which the plaintiff was a party. The plaintiff testified that he was aware that the defendant had uttered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the words complained of. He was then asked by his counsel, \u201c What has been the condition of your mind in regard to mental suffering since the publication of these alleged slanderous words ? \u201d The defendant objected to this question, as incompetent and inadmissible under the pleadings. The judge overruled the objection; and the witness answered, \u201cWell, it worried me a good deal. I used to walk the floor nights and worry about it.\u201d The defendant objected to the answer, but the judge allowed the witness to proceed, as follows: \u201cI laid awake nights considerable, and I used to hear from it every little while. I could not get it off my mind, and it worried me, because I had no property, and I had to depend upon my character, if I had any.\u201d The answer of the witness was objected to for the reasons before stated; but the judge admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-5\"><em>H.

His interest in the action only affects his credibility. Damages for mental suffering naturally resulting from the publication of the slander are not special damages, which must be specifically alleged in the declaration. The question objected to was therefore competent under the <em>pleadings; </em>and, if any part of the answer was not responsive, or related to matters other than mental suffering, the defendant did not specifically object to that. The answer was objected to \u201c for the reasons before stated,\u201d which were that the question was \u201c incompetent and in- \u25a0 admissible under the pleadings.\u201d <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
