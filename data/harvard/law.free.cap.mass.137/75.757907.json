The case was referred to an auditor, who found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-11\">On October 17, 1876, the defendant, who was in the employ of the plaintiffs as a salesman, signed an agreement as follows: \u201c In consideration of one dollar, I hereby agree to stand and pay to Knowles Freeman &amp; Co. one half the loss over and above ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dollars on all bills trusted by me since above date. Value received.\u201d The consideration of said agreement was the continuance of his employment at the then existing salary or wages, namely, $18 per week. Thereafter the defendant sold the goods of the plaintiffs, and, while in the employ of the plaintiffs, sold upon credit to certain persons or firms certain of said goods, the amounts of which remain unpaid. The total of said losses is $646.94, and one half the loss over and above $10 on all bills sold on credit by the defendant, since October 17, is $174.78. Reasonable efforts have been made by the plaintiffs to collect said bills, and the defendant had notice that sums were due from the persons so trusted, and that said sums were unpaid, and he had opportunity and means to collect said sums, if the same were collectible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">On said October 17, the plaintiffs, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, filed a petition in bankruptcy under the bankrupt law of the United States then in force; and the agreement hereinbefore set forth was signed on the morning of said day, but none of the goods were sold by the plaintiffs, and none of the losses occurred, until after that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The auditor also found that, at the date of the plaintiffs\u2019 writ, the defendant owed them the sum of $174.78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-6\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Staples, </em>J., without a jury, it was agreed that the plaintiffs were duly adjudicated bankrupts, under the petition mentioned in the auditor\u2019s report, and that they afterwards received their discharge from the District Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts, in which the proceedings in bankruptcy were instituted; that, previously to said bankruptcy, the plaintiffs were copartners, carrying on business under the firm name of Knowles Freeman and Company; and that they carried on business as copartners after their bankruptcy under the same name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-7\">The defendant requested the judge to rule as follows: \u201c 1. The bankruptcy of the plaintiffs dissolved the copartnership of Knowles Freeman and Company, and all their rights and interest then existing under .the contract declared on were transferred to their assignees in bankruptcy. 2. To render the defendant liable to the plaintiffs upon the contract declared on, the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>plaintiffs must prove the forming of a new copartnership after their bankruptcy, and that the contract declared on was made after their bankruptcy, and after the forming of a new copartnership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-4\">The judge refused to rule as requested; and found and ordered judgment for the plaintiffs. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-5\"><em>T. E. Grover &amp; J. J. </em>Feely, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-6\"><em>H. J. Boardman &amp; S.

The rulings requested by the defendant were immaterial, and misleading. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
