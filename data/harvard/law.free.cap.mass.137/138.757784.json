The record showed the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-10\">The writ in this case was entered at July term 1881 of the Superior Court. The case was continued from term to term until January term 1884, when it was tried by the court without a jury, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff. After-wards, upon motion of the plaintiff, and, after hearing the parties, for cause shown, the court ordered that the plaintiff be allowed, as part of his costs, a term fee for each and every one of the eleven terms that the case had been in court; the defendant contending that, under the St. of 1882, <em>c. </em>264, \u00a7 1, the Superior Court could allow only three term fees, the case never having been before the full bench of the Supreme Judicial Court on any question therein. After judgment, the clerk taxed the plaintiff\u2019s costs, and, against the defendant\u2019s objection, allowed the plaintiff eleven term fees, as ordered by the court. The court affirmed the clerk\u2019s taxation of costs, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff; and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-11\"><em>C.

If no question in a case is carried to the full bench of the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Judicial Court, the clerk, who is the officer required by law to tax the costs, is to allow only three term fees, unless the court in its discretion orders more to be taxed. If any question is carried to the full bench, the clerk is to allow two more term fees. In either event, it is left to the discretion of the court to allow and order to be taxed such number of term fees in addition as is deemed just. <em>Taxation affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
