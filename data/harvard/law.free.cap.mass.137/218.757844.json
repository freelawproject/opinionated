His will was duly proved and allowed on July 17, 1854. By the second clause of his will, he gave to his wife \u201c the sum of eight hundred dollars a year, to be paid her annually during her natural life by my executor out of the rents of such real property as I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>may leave.\u201d His wife survived him, and died in 1858. He left two children, both of age at the time of his death, John Bacon and Ann Elizabeth Bacon. He also left two sisters and one brother, all of whom died in the lifetime of his son John, and five nephews, children of said sisters and brother, all of whom are now living, and who, at the time of the death of the testator\u2019s son John, would have been the next of kin of the testator, if the testator had then died without leaving issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-4\">The annuity of eight hundred dollars given to the widow of the testator was duly paid to the time of her death. All debts and legacies were paid within two years from the probate of the will. The testator\u2019s son John died on November 28,1881, intestate, leaving no issue and no widow. John had sold and conveyed certain parcels of the real estate devised to him in the eighth clause of the will, but had not disposed of certain other valuable parcels thereof, and it is in respect to this real estate not so disposed of that the appellee asks to be appointed trustee. Ann Elizabeth died in 1864, leaving no issue. John Chorley never accepted the trust, having in January, 1882, declined it by reason of ill-health. After the death of the testator\u2019s son John, and upon the declination of John Chorley, the appellee, in 1882, asked to be appointed trustee, as above stated, for the benefit of the five nephews. The appellant, Henry H. Hartt, being the half-brother of the testator\u2019s wife, was the next of kin and heir at law of the testator\u2019s son John. He died on April 23, 1882, testate, leaving a widow but no issue, and his appeal from the appointment of the appellee is now prosecuted by the executors and trustees, devisees of said real estate under his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-5\">The appellant and his representatives, said executors and trustees, contend that, under said devise in the eighth clause of the will, the testator\u2019s son John became seised in fee simple of said real estate there devised to him; that the devise over to John Chorley was void; or, if not void, that it failed, and the testator\u2019s son John died seised in fee simple of said estate; that all of the real estate not disposed of by John descended to Hartt, his heir at law; and that no valid trust exists as to such real estate. The appellee, in behalf of the five nephews of the testator, contends that there is a valid trust existing as to said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>real estate; and that he is entitled to be appointed trustee to execute the same for the benefit of said nephews.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-4\">If, upon these facts, the devise over to John Chorley in the eighth clause of the will was valid, and if there existed a valid trust as to said real estate there devised to the testator\u2019s son John and not disposed of by him, the decree of the Probate Court was to be affirmed; otherwise, the decree to be reversed, and the petition dismissed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-5\"><em>J. B. Richardson S. Snow, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-6\"><em>W. A. Herrick &amp; J. F. Colby, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b240-7\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad1\">The testator\u2019s son John took a fee by the express terms of the eighth clause of the will, \u201cto him, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d The power to dispose of the land by sale or will, which he is assumed to possess by the limitation over, \u201c if he shall die not having disposed of the same by sale or by will, and leaving no issue living at the time of his death,\u201d is obviously assumed to be incident to the estate devised, and not a power superadded by those words to an estate for life insufficient of itself to carry such a power. We cannot cut down the intention clearly manifested in the limitation to the son, in order to sustain the limitation over. The intention is as definitely expressed in each and every part of the former as in any part of the latter. The subsequent and subordinate limitation must yield if it cannot stand with that which precedes it. The subsequent limitation in this case, being merely an attempt to take away one of the rights inseparable from the estate devised to the testator\u2019s son John, cannot stand with that devise. It is therefore invalid, and the heir at law of the first devisee, John, takes by descent. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Meins, </em>135 Mass. 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\n<em>Decree reversed, and petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
