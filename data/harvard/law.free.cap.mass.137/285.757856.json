And an. acceptance of this conveyance for our benefit, evidenced by our signatures hereto, shall constitute such discharge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-4\">\u201c It is expressly covenanted and agreed by all the parties hereto, that creditors holding securities do not prejudice the same by becoming parties hereto, but simply discharge said Cutler and Reed and said firm of E. P. Cutler &amp; Co. from all personal liability for such secured claims, the secured creditors relying upon their collateral and upon their right to a dividend for unsecured balances. And further, that any attaching creditor who becomes a party hereto does not thereby release or prejudice his lien by attachment until this instrument shall have been executed by the general creditors of the grantors, secured and unsecured, in such manner, and to such an amount in number and value of claims, as shall be satisfactory to the grantors; it being the purpose of the latter to have this instrument executed by all their creditors whose claims equal or exceed fifty dollars in amount, in such form and to such extent as shall save them harmless against proceedings in insolvency under the laws of said Commonwealth, and secure their release from all personal responsibility for their debts, except those which are\" trifling in amount; and when they express their satisfaction with the due execution of this instrument in writing and hereon, it shall be a perfected conveyance and agreement, and not before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">\u201c It is finally covenanted and agreed by all the parties hereto, that if said advisory committee, as now constituted or as hereafter constituted by a vote of said creditors duly called for the purpose of filling vacancies, shall decide upon any plan or scheme for the sale or disposition of any part of said pledged iron directly to individual creditors who may wish to avail themselves of such plan or scheme, then said trustees shall conform thereto, and shall thereupon sell and turn over to such creditor or creditors as said committee shall name such part of said iron in kind and quantity as said committee shall designate in writing; but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>advances, costs, and expenses then made, incurred, or due by or to said trustees on account of such iron so to be turned over or disposed of to such creditors, shall first be paid to said trustees. Said committee, however, shall not act upon or carry out any such plan or scheme until they have given all the unsecured creditors whose claims amount to fifty dollars or upwards notice of their intended action, at a creditors\u2019 meeting or by mail, that the latter may have an opportunity to express their approval or disapproval: not that the action of said committee may be controlled or restrained, but that said committee may have the fullest information as to the advisability of their action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\">\u201cIn witness whereof, the said several parties have interchangeably set their hands and seals this day of July,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-5\">1881, this instrument being made in triplicate for convenience and to save delay.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">It further appeared, from the trustees\u2019 answers, that this instrument was executed by the principal defendants and by a number of creditors before August 1,1881, and that by that day it had been delivered to the trustees by the defendants, with the following indorsement, signed by them, thereon: \u201cBoston, August 1, 1881. The within trust deed having been executed by the creditors to an extent satisfactory to us in number and amount, we hereby approve the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-7\">It further appeared that, at the time of the attachment in this action, July 21, 1882, creditors named in the schedule annexed to the assignment whose claims amounted to $85,581.88 had not signed or assented to the assignment, and of these, creditors whose claims amounted to $15,034.53 had since assented; that creditors not named in the schedule, whose claims amounted to $15,003.74, had signed before the attachment, and that other creditors not so named, and whose claims amounted to $43,580.88, had not signed; that the face value of the claims of the creditors who had signed before the attachment exceeded the value of the property assigned; and that the trustees had at the time of the attachment, and still had, in their possession, under said assignment, property of the defendants greater in amount than the plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">At the hearing before Holmes, J., on a motion to charge the trustees on their answers, the judge ruled that they were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>chargeable, and ordered that they be discharged. The plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-4\"><em>M. </em>Storey, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-5\"><em>J. O. Teele, </em>for the trustees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b311-6\">C. Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAD\">The whole question in this case turns upon the construction of the assignment. If, by its true construction, all the property assigned was to be distributed among such creditors only as should become parties to it, then the whole property will be exhausted by dividends to the creditors who became parties before the attachment in this action was made, and there would be nothing left for the attachment to reach. <em>Mechanics' National Bank </em>v. <em>Eagle Sugar Refinery, </em>109 Mass. 38. <em>May </em>v. <em>Wannemacher, </em>111 Mass. 202. <em>Pierce </em>v. O'Brien, 129 Mass. 314. But if, on the other hand, the property assigned was to be distributed among all the creditors of the assignors, without regard to whether they had signed the instrument or not, then the fact becomes important that creditors to a considerable amount had not signed it at the date of the attachment, and the dividends which otherwise would have become due to such creditors could be reached by trustee process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The former appears to us to be the true construction. It was expressed to be the purpose of Cutler and Company to have the instrument executed by all their creditors whose claims should equal or exceed fifty dollars in amount, and to secure their own release from all personal responsibility for their debts, except those which were trifling in amount. ' It was provided that, when they should express their satisfaction with the due execution of the instrument in writing and upon the instrument, it should be a perfected conveyance and agreement, and not before. The assignment was in consideration of the covenants and agreements therein expressed to be performed by their creditors and the trustees named in it, and of one dollar and other good and valuable considerations to them paid by said creditors and trustees. The assignors covenanted with said grantees and said creditors to execute further conveyances, if required. The trustees were to manage and dispose of the property for the benefit of said creditors. It was recited that said grantors\u2019 creditors had appointed an advisory committee, who were to advise the trustees; and there was a provision for filling vacancies by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>vote of said creditors. The trustees were constituted the attorneys of said grantors and of said creditors. The trustees, being the president and vice-president of the International Trust Company, covenanted with said grantors and their creditors, \u201c parties hereto,\u201d that it would execute the trust faithfully; and the said respective creditors of the grantors, each for himself, ratified the conveyance, and agreed to take and accept from the trustees their dividend or proportionate part of the estate in full payment, satisfaction, and discharge of their respective debts; \u201cand an acceptance of this conveyance for our benefit, evidenced by our signatures hereto, shall constitute such discharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In view of all these provisions, the further provisions, especially relied on by the plaintiffs, that \u201c the trustees shall pay <em>pro rata </em>dividends to all the unsecured creditors of said grantors,\u201d and that, \u201c in making such payments to creditors, there shall be no preference or priority, except to holders of valid liens, and other creditors whose claims would be preferred under the laws of said Commonwealth relating to insolvency,\u201d &amp;c., must be held to refer to such creditors only as (should become parties to the assignment. It was designed to make it an object for all the creditors to become parties, by giving to them the dividends. The scheme, stated in a general way, was, that the debtors should assign all their property to the trustees; that all the creditors should become parties, and thereby release the debtors; and that, if it should be found impossible to procure the signatures of all the creditors, the debtors might nevertheless elect to make the assignment valid and complete, for the benefit of such creditors as should sign, leaving the debtors personally responsible to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
