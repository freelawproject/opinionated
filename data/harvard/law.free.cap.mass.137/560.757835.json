Because said complaint charges no crime or offence. 2. Because the only count of said complaint charges two separate and distinct offences. 3. Because said complaint is uncertain and indefinite in the allegation of the offence. 4. Because, if said complaint is brought under the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>207, \u00a7 53, it does not allege that the defendant was either the owner, possessor, or person having the charge or custody of said horse. 5. Because there is no allegation in said complaint that the defendant overdrove said horse knowingly or intentionally.\u201d Knowlton, J., overruled the motion, and ruled that the complaint was sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b581-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b581-7\"><em>W.

It does not change the essential description of the offence charged, and is at most a formal defect, which could not be availed of for the first time in the Superior Court on appeal. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>214, \u00a7 25. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-10\"><em> </em>Section 52 provides that \u201cwhoever overdrives .... an animal\u201d shall be punished, &amp;c.
