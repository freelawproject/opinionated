It had three factories where its goods were made, one in B., one in N., and one in W. The goods made at the factory in W. were put into an adjacent storehouse, and there kept until sold.

One of the partners resided in Boston, and the other two in Newton. They owned a building in Boston, most of which was rented for stores, the firm reserving one room for its own business, and keeping a small supply of starch there, usually, and on said first day of May not exceeding $75 in value, as samples, and for the accommodation of retail customers. All the book-keeping, correspondence, and banking relating to the sale of goods were done at this place of business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-8\">The firm owned and operated three factories for the manufacture of starch, one in Boston, one in Watertown, and one in Newton. The goods made at Watertown were put in a storehouse adjacent to the factory, and there kept until sold. Nearly all the sales were made on orders received at the place of bhsiness in Boston, and it was the custom for one of the partners to go each day, with the orders received, to one or another of the factories, and ship the goods from those there stored direct to the customers. The bills and the collections for such sales were made in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The tax sought to be recovered was assessed upon starch made at the factory in Watertown, and on the first day of May there stored, as above stated, to await sale.
