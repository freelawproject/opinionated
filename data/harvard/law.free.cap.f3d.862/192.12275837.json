Section 6015 creates several exceptions to that rule. It relieves a spouse of joint and several liability in certain circumstances in which the other spouse fails to report income or reports it improperly, the couple is legally separated or no longer living together, or it would be inequitable to hold the spouse liable for the amount due. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(b)(1), (c), (f). If the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) denies a request for relief under \u00a7 6015, also known as \u201cinnocent spouse relief,\u201d the spouse has ninety days from the date of the IRS\u2019s final determination to petition the United States Tax Court for review. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">This appeal arises from the dismissal of a petition for innocent spouse relief based on petitioner-appellant Linda Jean Matus-zak\u2019s failure to comply with the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A). The issue is whether Matuszak\u2019s failure to file the petition within the statutorily prescribed period deprives the Tax Court of jurisdiction to review her claim. We conclude that it does and affirm the dismissal of Matus-zak\u2019s untimely petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">Matuszak and her husband filed joint income tax returns in 2007 and 2008. In 2012, Matuszak\u2019s husband pleaded guilty to charges of fraud and filing a materially false income tax return, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1342 and I.R.C. \u00a7 7206(1), for engaging in a scheme to defraud his employer of more than $1 million and failing to report the stolen money as income. As part of the plea agreement, Matuszak\u2019s husband agreed to \u201cfile legal and accurate amended income tax returns ... for calendar years 2007 and 2008,\u201d J.A. 72, which resulted in income tax deficiencies of approximately $333,964 for 2007 and $105,055 for 2008, <em>see id. </em>at 83. The Matuszaks stipulated to the deficiencies, and the IRS assessed them the amounts due.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">In March 2014, Matuszak requested innocent spouse relief for both taxable years. The IRS granted her request for the 2008 deficiency, but denied relief for the 2007 deficiency in a final notice of determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>dated October 7, 2014. Ninety-one days later, on January 6, 2015, Matuszak mailed a petition to the Tax Court seeking review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The IRS moved to dismiss Matuszak\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction based on her failure to comply with the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A). That section details how \u2014 and, crucially, when \u2014 a spouse may petition the Tax Court for review of the IRS\u2019s denial of innocent spouse relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the individual may petition the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction) to determine the appropriate relief available to the individual under this section if such petition is filed ... not later than the close of the 90th day after the date [the IRS issues its final notice of determination, or six months after the date the request was made].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The IRS asserted that ninety days after the October 7 notice of determination was January 5, not January 6. Therefore, even if the Tax Court treated Matuszak\u2019s petition as if it had been filed on the date it was mailed, <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 7502(a), the IRS argued the petition was one day late and beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction to review. In response, Matuszak conceded she did not file the petition by January 5 but urged the court to deem it timely for equitable reasons. Specifically, she alleged that two IRS agents informed her she had until \u201cthe end of business on January 7\u201d to petition the Tax Court for review. J.A. 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">The Tax Court (Marvel, <em>C.J.) </em>granted the IRS\u2019s motion and dismissed Matus-zak\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. The court held that its jurisdiction under \u00a7 6015(e) \u201cdepends, in part, on the timely filing of a petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. Matuszak did not timely file her petition, the court determined, because she did not mail it within ninety days of the IRS\u2019s determination. Relying on settled Tax Court precedent, the court declined to extend the statutory period for equitable reasons, noting that even \u201cerroneous legal advice cannot eliminate, by estoppel or otherwise, the jurisdictional requirement for a timely filed petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28 (citing <em>Elgart v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo. 1996-379, 72 T.C.M. (CCH) 398, at *4 (Aug. 15, 1996)). The Tax Court denied Matuszak\u2019s motion to vacate the order of dismissal, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">II.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">Is the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) a jurisdictional limit on the Tax Court\u2019s authority to review a petition for innocent spouse relief? The answer to that question is more than semantic. <em>See Henderson ex rel. Henderson v. Shinseki, </em>562 U.S. 428, 434, 131 S.Ct. 1197, 179 L.Ed.2d 159 (2011). \u201cBranding a rule as going to a court\u2019s subjectr-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201cdeprives a court of all authority to hear a case\u201d when a litigant fails to comply, <em>United States v. Kwai Fun Wong, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1625, 1631, 191 L.Ed.2d 533 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">Given the \u201cdrastic consequences\u201d of labeling a procedural rule as jurisdictional, the Supreme Court \u201chas endeavored in recent years to bring some discipline to the use of [that] term.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Thaler, </em>565 U.S. 134, 141, 132 S.Ct. 641, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court has \u201cpressed a stricter distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>truly jurisdictional rules, which govern \u2018a court\u2019s adjudicatory authority,\u2019 and non-jurisdictional \u2018claim processing rules,\u2019 which do not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kontrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 454-55, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004)); <em>see also Hoogerheide v. I.R.S., </em>637 F.3d 634, 638 (6th Cir. 2011) (describing a non-jurisdictional rule as one that \u201cgoes to a plaintiffs right to relief, not to his [or her] right to enter the federal courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Statutes of limitation and other filing deadlines typically fall into the latter category. Although they may use mandatory, even emphatic, terms, they often \u201cseek to promote the orderly progress of litigation, ... not deprive a court of authority to hear a case.\u201d <em>Wong, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1632 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Musacchio v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 709, 717, 193 L.Ed.2d 639 (2016) (the statute of limitations for federal crimes in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3282(a) \u201cdoes not expressly refer to subject-matter jurisdiction or speak in jurisdictional terms\u201d); <em>Sebelius v. Auburn Reg'l Med. Ctr., </em>568 U.S. 145, 154, 133 S.Ct. 817, 184 L.Ed.2d 627 (2013) (the time period to appeal to a review board under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(a)(3) contains no \u201cwords with jurisdictional import\u201d); <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S. at 438, 131 S.Ct. 1197 (the deadline to file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a) \u201cdoes not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the Veterans Court\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Nevertheless, \u201cCongress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>562 U.S. at 435, 131 S.Ct. 1197. When Congress \u201cclearly states\u201d that a statutory limit is jurisdictional, we must treat it that way, <em>Arbaugh v. Y&amp;H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006)\u2014\u201ceven if equitable considerations would support extending the prescribed time period,\u201d <em>Wong, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The ninety-day deadline at issue here is one of the \u201crare\u201d statutory periods that speak in clear jurisdictional terms. <em>See Wong, </em>135 S.Ct. at 1632. Section 6015(e)(1)(A) provides that \u201cthe Tax Court <em>shall have jurisdiction </em>... to determine the appropriate relief available to [an] individual under this section <em>if </em>[the] petition is filed ... not later than\u201d the earlier of ninety days after the date the IRS mails its final notice of determination, or six months after the request was made. I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) (emphases added). Not only did Congress place the grant of jurisdiction and the time limitation in the same sentence and subsection, it expressly conditioned the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction on the timely filing of a petition: \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction <em>... if </em>[the] petition is filed\u201d within the specified period. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Statutory context confirms that reading. The subsection immediately following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) states that the IRS may not undertake collection of the spouse\u2019s tax liability as it relates to the request for innocent spouse relief until the ninety-day period for petitioning the Tax Court expires, or, if the spouse files a petition, until the Tax Court\u2019s decision becomes final. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(l)(B)(i). It further states that \u201c[t]he Tax Court shall have no jurisdiction ... to enjoin any action or proceeding <em>unless a timely petition has been filed, </em>under subparagraph (A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6015(e)(l)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). Read alongside \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(B), the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) represents \u201c[t]he most obvious example\u201d of a jurisdictional rule, because Congress clearly and repeatedly expressed that it imposes a jurisdictional limit on the Tax Court\u2019s authority. <em>See Miller v. FDIC, </em>738 F.3d 836, 844 (7th Cir. 2013) (citing <em>Arbaugh, </em>546 U.S. at 515, 126 S.Ct. 1235).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Moreover, we have construed another statutory requirement in the same subsection of \u00a7 6015 as jurisdictional. The prefatory language to \u00a7 6015(e)(1) reads: \u201cIn the case of an individual ... who elects to have [innocent spouse provisions] apply, ... the individual may petition the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction) to determine the appropriate relief available to the individual under this section.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1). In <em>Maier, </em>we interpreted that language to mean that the spouse who petitions the Tax Court must be the spouse seeking innocent spouse status, and that the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review a petition by the non-electing spouse. <em>See Maier, </em>360 F.3d at 363-64. Because the Tax Court \u201cmay exercise jurisdiction only pursuant to specific legislative enactments\u201d and \u201cnowhere in \u00a7 6015 is the Tax Court conferred with jurisdiction ... to hear a non-electing spouse\u2019s petition,\u201d <em>id., </em>we held that the statute restricts the court\u2019s jurisdiction to a petition by the electing spouse. <em>See id. </em>at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The same is true with respect to the ninety-day filing period in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A), which contains a stronger jurisdictional link than the clause we considered in <em>Maier. </em>The plain meaning of \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) is that the Tax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d over a petition for innocent spouse relief <em>only </em>\u201cif [the] petition is filed\u201d within ninety days of the IRS\u2019s final determination or six months after the request was made. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A). Indeed, \u201cwe cannot read \u00a7 6015 any other way than to preclude jurisdiction\u201d over a petition filed after the ninety-day period. <em>See Maier, </em>360 F.3d at 364.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The timeliness requirement is explic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>itly linked to the statute\u2019s grant of jurisdiction; it therefore imposes a jurisdictional limit on the Tax Court\u2019s authority to hear the claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-21\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-22\">Because \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) expressly references the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction and conditions that jurisdiction on the timely filing of a petition, the ninety-day deadline is jurisdictional. We therefore agree with the Tax Court that it lacks jurisdiction to entertain Matuszak\u2019s untimely petition for innocent spouse relief. The orders of the Tax Court are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\">. We have jurisdiction to review the Tax Court\u2019s decision, <em>see </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1), and that review is <em>de novo, see Maier v. Comm'r, </em>360 F.3d 361, 363 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">. Our sister circuits and the Tax Court have construed a similarly-worded deadline to petition the Tax Court in a collection due process hearing as jurisdictional. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). Section 6330(d)(1) provides that a person who receives a determination from the IRS following a collection due process hearing \"may, within 30 days of [the] determination ... petition the Tax Court for review of such determination (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d Like the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A), the thirty-day deadline in \u00a7 6330(d)(1) is \"set forth in the same sentence of the statute\u201d and is \u201cexplicitly linked\u201d to the Tax Court's jurisdiction. <em>Guralnik v. </em>Comm\u2019r, 146 T.C. 230, 237 (2016); <em>accord Hauptman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>831 F.3d 950, 953 (8th Cir. 2016); <em>Gray v. Comm\u2019r, </em>723 F.3d 790, 793 (7th Cir. 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">. The Seventh Circuit recently concluded that a similar clause in I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a) renders the ninety-day deadline to petition the Tax Court in a deficiency case jurisdictional. <em>See Tilden v. Comm\u2019r, </em>846 F.3d <em>882, </em>886-87 (7th Cir. 2017). Like \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(B), \u00a7 6213(a) states that \"[t]he Tax Court shall have no ' jurisdiction to enjoin any action or proceeding or order any refund under this subsection unless a timely petition for a redetermination of the deficiency has been filed.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). According to the Seventh Circuit, that clause alone contains \"the magic word[s]\u201d that deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction over untimely petitions. <em>Tilden, </em>846 F.3d at 886. The ninety-day deadline at issue here speaks in equally clear jurisdictional terms, because it is linked to the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction in both \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) and \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">. We are not alone in concluding that the text and context of \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) signal Congress\u2019s intent to treat the deadline as jurisdictional. The Tax Court has long held that the ninety-day period is jurisdictional. <em>See, e.g., Pollock v. Comm\u2019r, </em>132 T.C. 21, 28-32 (2009); <em>Gormeley v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo. 2009-252, 98 T.C.M. (CCH) 420, at *2-3 (Nov. 9, 2009); <em>Sykes v. Comm\u2019r, </em>T.C. Memo. 2009-197, 98 T.C.M. (CCH) 150, at *4-5 (Sept. 3, 2009). And the Third Circuit has recently arrived at the same conclusion. <em>See Rubel v. Comm\u2019r, </em>856 F.3d 301, 304-06 (3d Cir. 2017).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\">. Although the Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review an untimely petition for innocent spouse relief,' taxpayers who miss the ninety-day deadline in \u00a7 6015(e)(1)(A) may have other means, outside the Tax Court, to seek review of the IRS\u2019s determination. <em>See </em>Appel-lee\u2019s Br. 47 (suggesting that a taxpayer may pay the assessed deficiency and then seek review of the IRS\u2019s denial of innocent spouse relief in a refund suit in federal district court or the Federal Court of Claims). We express no opinion on the availability of those alternative remedies in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
