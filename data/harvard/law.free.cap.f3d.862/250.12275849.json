Litig. </em>(the <em>\u201cCertification Order\u201d), </em>312 F.R.D. 354 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Petrobras is a multinational oil and gas company headquartered in Brazil and majority-owned by the Brazilian government. Though Petrobras was once among the largest companies in the world, its value declined precipitously after the exposure of a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar money-laundering and kickback scheme, prompting a class action by holders of Petrobras equity and debt securities (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) against multiple defendants (\u201cDefendants\u201d): Petrobras and certain wholly owned subsidiaries (the \u201cSubsidiaries\u201d; collectively with Petrobras, the \u201cPetrobras Defendants\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>); former officers and directors of the Petrobras Defendants; several underwriters of Petrobras debt securities (the \u201cUnderwriter Defendants\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>); and Petrobras\u2019s independent auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">The district court certified two classes (the \u201cClasses\u201d) for money damages under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3): the first asserts claims under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a <em>et seq.; </em>and the second asserts claims under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On appeal, the Pe-trobras Defendants and the Underwriter Defendants (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d) contest the <em>Certification Order </em>on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">First, Appellants challenge both class definitions insofar as they include all otherwise eligible persons who purchased Petrobras debt securities in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d Because Petrobras\u2019s debt securities do not trade on a domestic exchange, the district court must assess each class member\u2019s over-the-counter transactions for markers of domesticity under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 180 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 585 (2010). Appellants assert that the need for such assessments precludes class certification, particularly in light of concerns over the availability and content of the necessary transaction records. We first address Appellants\u2019 arguments regarding the \u201cimplied\u201d Rule 23 requirement of \u201caseertainability,\u201d taking this opportunity to clarify the scope of the contested aseertainability doctrine: a class is ascertainable if it is defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries. That threshold requirement is met here. However, we next hold that the district court committed legal error by finding that Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement was satisfied without considering the need for individual <em>Morrison </em>inquiries regarding domestic transactions. We therefore vacate this portion of <em>Certification Order.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Second, with regard to the Exchange Act Class, the Petrobras Defendants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> challenge the district court\u2019s finding that Plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption of reliance under the \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory established in <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s determination that Plaintiffs met their burden under <em>Basic </em>with a combination of direct and indirect evidence of market efficiency. We therefore affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM IN PART and VACATE IN PART the judgment of the district court and REMAND the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">We provide here a brief summary of the proceedings below as relevant for the issues on appeal. For additional background on Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and causes of action, see the district court\u2019s prior orders. <em>See In re Petrobras Sec. Litig. </em>(the <em>\u201cJuly 2015 Order\u201d), </em>116 F.Supp.3d 368, 373-77 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (summarizing the original consolidated complaint); <em>In re Petrobras Sec. Litig. </em>(the <em>\u201cDecember 2015 Orde\u2019\u2019), </em>150 F.Supp.3d 337 (S.D.N.Y 2015) (discussing new allegations in the amended pleadings).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations of Corruption at Petrobras</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise out of a conspiracy that began in the first decade of the new millennium, at which time Petrobras was expanding its production capacity. The company used a competitive bidding process for major capital expenditures, including the construction and purchase of oil refineries. Over a period of several years, a cartel of contractors and suppliers coordinated with corrupt Petrobras executives to rig Petrobras\u2019s bids at grossly inflated prices. The excess funds were used to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>billions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks to the corrupt executives and to government officials. In addition, the inflated bid prices artificially increased the carrying value of Petrobras\u2019s assets. Plaintiffs allege that Petrobras knew about the kickback cartel, and was complicit in concealing information from investors and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Brazil\u2019s Federal Police discovered the scheme during a money-laundering investigation, and ultimately arrested a number of the individuals involved. As details of the scandal emerged, Petrobras made corrective disclosures that, according to Plaintiffs, significantly understated the extent of incorrectly capitalized payments and inflated asset values. Even so, the value of Petrobras\u2019s securities declined precipitously. Plaintiffs allege that, \u201c[a]t its height in 2009, Petrobras was the world\u2019s fifth-largest company, with a market capitalization of $310 billion\u201d; by early 2015, its worth had allegedly declined to $39 billion. 4th Am. Compl. \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">B. Petrobras Securities</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Petrobras\u2019s common and preferred shares trade on a Brazilian stock exchange, the BM&amp;F BOVESPA. The company sponsors American Depository Shares (\u201cADS\u201d)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that represent its common and preferred shares. Those ADS are listed and trade on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In addition, Petrobras has issued multiple debt securities (the \u201cNotes\u201d; collectively with ADS, \u201cPetrobras Securities\u201d) underwritten by syndicates of domestic and foreign banks. The Notes do not trade on any U.S. exchange. Investors trade Notes in over-the-counter transactions, whether in connection with an initial debt offering or in the global secondary market.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">In December 2014 and January 2015, Petrobras investors filed five putative class actions asserting substantially similar claims against Petrobras and other defendants. The district court consolidated those actions in February 2015 and certified the Classes in February 2016. The district court also presided over several individual actions involving similar claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Causes of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">As relevant for this appeal, Plaintiffs assert a cause of action under the Exchange Act against the Petrobras Defendants, and three causes of action under the Securities Act against various Petrobras and Underwriter Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-13\">1. Claims Under the Exchange Act</p>\n<p id=\"b284-14\">. Plaintiffs\u2019 Exchange Act claims are brought against Petrobras and the Subsidiaries on behalf of holders of Petrobras ADS and Notes. Plaintiffs assert that, during the class period of January 22, 2010, to July 28, 2015, the Petrobras Defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>made two types of false and misleading statements in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. First, the Petrobras Defendants produced financial statements with inflated asset values. Second, they assured Petrobras investors that the company adhered to ethical management principles and maintained strict financial controls to prevent fraud and corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">2. Claims Under the Securities Act</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Plaintiffs rely on similar factual allegations in their claims under the Securities Act, brought on behalf of Petrobras Note-holders. Plaintiffs allege that the Petrobras Defendants and the Underwriter Defendants made materially false representations in registration statements and other documents connected with offerings of Petrobras Notes in May 2013 and March 2014 (the \u201cOfferings\u201d), thereby establishing liability under Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 77l(a)(2), 77o.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">B. The Certification Order</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">On February 2, 2016, the district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify two classes under Rule 23(b)(3), one asserting claims under the Exchange Act and the other asserting claims under the Securities Act. <em>Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Because Petrobras Notes do not trade on any U.S.-based exchange, Noteholders in both Classes are only entitled to assert claims under the Exchange Act and the Securities Act if they can show that they acquired their Notes in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 267, 130 S.Ct. 2869. To ensure compliance with <em>Morrison, </em>the district court limited both class definitions to \u201cmembers [who] purchased Notes in domestic transactions.\u201d <em>Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">The Exchange Act Class is defined, in relevant part,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-17\">[A]ll purchasers who, between January 22, 2010 and July 28, 2015, ... purchased or otherwise acquired [Petrobras Securities], including debt securities issued by [the Subsidiaries] on the [NYSE] or pursuant to other domestic transactions, and were damaged thereby-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-19\">The Securities Act Class is defined, in relevant part, as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-20\">[A]ll purchasers who purchased or otherwise acquired [Notes] in domestic transactions, directly in, pursuant and/or traceable to [U.S.-registered public offerings on May 15, 2013, and March 11, 2014] ..., and were damaged thereby[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al4\"><em>Id. </em>The Securities Act Class definition is temporally limited to purchases made \u201cbefore Petrobras made generally available to its security holders an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the offerings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language conforms to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>the limitations inherent m Section 11, given the absence of any allegation that Plaintiffs relied on any such earnings statement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\">III. The Instant Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">On June 15, 2016, a panel of this Court granted Appellants\u2019 timely filed petition for permission to appeal the <em>Certification Order </em>under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 5(a). On August 2, 2016, a separate panel granted Appellants\u2019 motion for a stay pending resolution of this expedited interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">A plaintiff seeking certification of a Rule 23(b)(3) class action bears the burden of satisfying the requirements of Rule 23(a) \u2014 numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation \u2014 as well as Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirements: (1) that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members\u201d (the \u201cpredominance\u201d requirement); and (2) that \u201ca class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy\u201d (the \u201csuperiority\u201d requirement). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a), (b)(3); <em>In re U.S. Foodservice Inc. Pricing Litig., </em>729 F.3d 108, 117 (2d Cir. 2013) (\u201cTo certify a class, a district court must ... find that each [Rule 23] requirement is \u2018established by at least a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Brown v. Kelly, </em>609 F.3d 467, 476 (2d Cir. 2010))). This Court has also \u201crecognized an implied requirement of ascertainability in Rule 23,\u201d which demands that a class be \u201csufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member.\u201d <em>Brecher v. Republic of Argentina, </em>806 F.3d 22, 24. (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">Appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s findings with regard to the class certification elements under Rule 23(a). Rather, they assert two arguments under Rule 23(b)(3). Appellants first argue that both Classes fail to satisfy ascertainability, predominance, and superiority because putative class members must establish, on an individual basis, that they acquired their securities in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d The Petrobras Defendants assert a second predominance challenge specific to the Exchange Act Class: they argue that the district court erred in finding that Plaintiffs successfully established a class-wide presumption of reliance under the \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions as to whether the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 were met, and in turn whether class certification was appropriate, for abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>In re Vivendi, </em>S.A <em>Sec. Litig., </em>838 F.3d 223, 263 (2d Cir. 2016) (citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cWhile we review the district court\u2019s construction of legal standards <em>de novo, </em>we review the district court\u2019s application of those standards for whether the district court\u2019s decision falls within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Roach v. T.L. Cannon Corp., </em>778 F.3d 401, 405 (2d Cir. 2015) (citing <em>Myers v. Hertz Corp., </em>624 F.3d 537, 547 (2d Cir. 2010)). \u201cTo the extent that the district court\u2019s decision as to class certification is premised on a finding of fact, we review that finding for clear error.\u201d <em>UFCW Local 1776 v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>620 F.3d 121, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing <em>In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig. (\u201cIn re IPO\u201d), </em>471 F.3d 24, 40-41 (2d Cir. 2006)); <em>see also In re Vivendi, </em>838 F.3d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">II. \u201cDomestic Transactions\u201d as a Condition for Class Membership</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The two certified Classes include all claims arising out of Petrobras Notes purchased in \u201cdomestic transactions\u201d during the class period, thereby capturing the broadest membership possible under <em>Morrison. </em>Appellants argue that the difficulties inherent in assessing putative class members\u2019 transaction records make the Classes uncertifiable for several reasons, the most important of which, for our purposes, are (1) the ascertainability doctrine, which has seen recent developments in this Circuit and others; and (2) predominance. We hold that both class definitions satisfy the as-certainability doctrine as it is defined in this Circuit. We further hold, however, that the district court erred in conducting its predominance analysis without considering the need for individualized <em>Morrison </em>inquiries. On that basis, we vacate the district court\u2019s certification decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>A. Extraterritoriality and Federal Securities Law</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">1. Defining \u201cDomestic Transactions\u201d: <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Absolute Activist</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u201cIt is a longstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 255, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Based on that presumption against extraterritoriality, the Supreme Court held in <em>Morrison </em>that the reach of U.S. securities law is presumptively limited to (1) \u201ctransactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges,\u201d and (2) \u201cdomestic transactions in other securities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (discussing Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act); <em>see also id. </em>at 268, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (noting that \u201c[t]he same focus on domestic transactions is evident in the Securities Act\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">As noted in the margin, we assume that a purchase of Petrobras ADS qualifies under <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>first prong as long as the transaction occurs on the NYSE, a \u201cdomestic exchange.\u201d <em>See City of Pontiac Policemen\u2019s &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys. v. UBS AG, </em>752 F.3d 173, 180-81 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that mere <em>listing </em>on a domestic exchange is not sufficient to establish domesticity if the relevant securities transaction did not <em>occur </em>on a domestic exchange). The Notes, however, do not trade on any domestic exchange.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, to assert claims under federal securities laws, Note-holders must show in some other manner that the Notes they hold were acquired in a \u201cdomestic transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Absolute Activist </em>elaborated on that standard: for \u201csecurities that are not traded on a domestic exchange,\u201d a transaction is considered \u201cdomestic if [1] irrevocable liability is incurred or [2] title passes within the United States.\u201d <em>Absolute Activist Value Master Fund Ltd. v. Ficeto, </em>677 F.3d 60, 67 (2d Cir. 2012). In other words, for a transaction to qualify as domestic, either (1) the purchaser must have \u201cincurred irrevocable liability within the United States to take and pay for a security, or ... the seller [must have] incurred irrevocable liability within the United States to deliver a security,\u201d or (2) legal title to the security must have transferred in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The location or residency of the buyer, seller, or broker will not necessarily establish the situs of the transaction. <em>Id. </em>at 68-69. Rather, plaintiffs demonstrate the location where irrevocable liability was incurred or legal title transferred by producing evidence \u201cincluding, but not limited to, facts concerning the formation of the contracts, the placement of purchase orders, ... or the exchange of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">2. The District Court\u2019s Pre-Certification <em>Morrison </em>Inquiries</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Before certifying the Classes, the district court twice adjudicated <em>Morrison-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>based challenges to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. When the class action was first consolidated, the court dismissed, without prejudice, all Securities Act claims based on Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \u201cto allege that they purchased the relevant securities in domestic transactions.\u201d <em>July 2015 Order, </em>116 F.Supp.3d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Plaintiffs responded with new allegations and documentary evidence regarding Notes transactions for each of the four putative named plaintiffs. Defendants once again moved to dismiss. The district court found that two of the named plaintiffs had adequately pleaded domestic transactions based on their acquisition of Notes directly <em>from </em>U.S. underwriters in the Offerings. <em>December 2015 Order, </em>150 F.Supp.3d at 340. For example, one plaintiff\u2019s \u201ctraders in Raleigh, North Carolina purchased Notes on May 13, 2013, and March 10, 2014, from underwriters in New York, New York.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court found that this plaintiff had alleged \u201cthe kinds of facts required by <em>Absolute Activist, </em>including New York area code phone numbers on the confirmations sent by representatives of the underwriters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The district court determined that the other two named plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the <em>Morrison </em>inquiry and dismissed their Securities Act claims. <em>Id. </em>at 340-43. One plaintiff, for example, presented a confirmation slip stating that Petrobras Notes had been purchased \u201cin U.S. dollars and that the Notes were held in \u2018[s]afe-keeping of securities abroad, depository country: U.S.A.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341 (quoting the 4th Am. Compl.). According to the district court, this \u201clanguage suggests that the purchase occurred <em>outside </em>the United States because it refers to the United States as \u2018abroad.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The district court similarly found insufficient an allegation that an investment manager \u201clocated in the United Kingdom[ ] instructed its U.S. affiliate, located in Chicago, Illinois, to transfer Petrobras Notes to [the plaintiff entity,] located in the United Kingdom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court noted that \u201ca \u2018transfer,\u2019 rather than a purchase, [was] all that [was] alleged. Moreover, the allegations suggest that irrevocable liability was incurred in the United Kingdom,\u201d where both the plaintiff and the investment manager were located, \u201crather than in the United States.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">In an attempt to preserve those claims, Plaintiffs offered two alternative methods for establishing domestic transactions as a matter of law. First, Plaintiffs argued that a securities transaction should qualify as \u201cdomestic\u201d if <em>beneficial </em>title is transferred when the transaction is settled through a domestic securities depository, such as the Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) located in New York City. <em>Id. </em>The district court disagreed, finding that \u201c[t]he mechanics of DTC settlement are actions needed to <em>carry out </em>transactions, but they involve neither the substantive indicia of a contractual commitment necessary to satisfy <em>Absolute Activist\u2019s </em>first prong nor the formal weight of a transfer of [legal] title necessary for its second.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c[T]he Second Circuit has [ ] indicated that domestic \u2018actions needed to carry out transactions, and not the transactions themselves,\u2019 are insufficient to satisfy <em>Morrison.\u201d </em>(quoting <em>Loginovskaya v. Batratchenko, </em>764 F.3d 266, 275 (2d Cir. 2014))). The district court also expressed concern that, \u201cassuming the parties are correct that most securities transactions settle through the DTC or similar depository institutions, the entire thrust of <em>Morrison </em>and its progeny would be rendered nugatory if all DTC-settled transactions necessarily fell under the reach of the federal securities laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Finally, Plaintiffs proposed a method for constructively establishing the domesticity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of Notes transactions: \u201callegations that a plaintiff purchased Notes \u2018on the offering date and at the offering price\u2019 [should be] sufficient to demonstrate irrevocable liability because all the underwriters who sold in the initial offerings only did so in the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342 (quoting the 4th Am. Compl.). The district court rejected this theory, noting that certain documents related to the Offerings \u201cimply that some underwriters <em>did </em>initially offer the Notes outside the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">B. Ascertainability</p>\n<p id=\"ane-dedup-0\">\u201cMost [] circuit courts of appeals have recognized that Rule 23 contains an implicit threshold requirement that the members of a proposed class be readily identifiable,\u201d often characterized as \u201can \u2018ascertainability\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Sandusky Wellness Ctr., LLC v. Medtox Sci, Inc., </em>821 F.3d 992, 995 (8th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (collecting cases). \u201c[Cjourts ascribe widely varied meanings to that term,\u201d however. <em>Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., </em>844 F.3d 1121, 1124 n.3 (9th Cir. 2017) (describing two versions of the ascertainability requirement); <em>see generally </em>Geoffrey C. Shaw, Note, <em>Class Ascertainability, </em>124 Yale L.J. 2354, 2366-88 (2015) (describing different conceptions of ascertainability and critiquing the proffered justifications).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In <em>Brecher v. Republic of Argentina, </em>we offered our first and, thus far, only affirmative definition<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the implied ascer-tainability requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">[T]he touchstone of ascertainability is whether the class is sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member. A class is ascertainable when defined by objective criteria that are administratively feasible and when identifying its members would not require a mini-hearing on the merits of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-9\"><em>Brecher, </em>806 F.3d at 24-25 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Based on this language, Appellants argue for a \u201cheightened\u201d ascertainability requirement under which any proposed class must be \u201cadministratively feasible,\u201d over and above the evident requirements that a class be \u201cdefinite\u201d and \u201cdefined by objective criteria,\u201d and separate from Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s requirements of predominance and superiority.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">We take this opportunity to clarify the ascertainability doctrine\u2019s substance and purpose. We conclude that a freestanding administrative feasibility requirement is neither compelled by precedent nor consistent with Rule 23, joining four of our sister circuits in declining to adopt such a requirement. The ascertainability doctrine that governs in this Circuit requires only that a class be defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries. Applying that doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>trine, we determine that ascertainability is not an impediment to certification of the Classes as currently defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">1. The Proceedings Below and Arguments on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">In its <em>Certification Order, </em>the district court rejected Defendants\u2019 argument that, \u201cbecause of the nuances of the \u2018domestic transaction\u2019 standard, determining [class membership] and damages will be an <em>administratively unfeasible </em>task for this Court, for putative class members who receive notice of the action, and for future courts facing claims from class members who have not properly opted out.\u201d 312 F.R.D. at 363-64 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Appellants renew that argument on appeal, packaged as a challenge to the district court\u2019s finding \u201cthat the <em>Morrison </em>determination is \u2018administratively feasible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364 (quoting <em>Brecher, </em>806 F.3d at 24). Appellants cite heavily to cases from the Third Circuit, which has formally adopted a \u201cheightened\u201d two-part ascertain-ability test under which plaintiffs must not only show that \u201cthe class is \u2018defined with reference to objective criteria,\u2019 \u201d but also that \u201cthere is \u2018a reliable and administratively feasible mechanism for determining whether putative class members fall within the class definition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byrd v. Aaron\u2019s Inc., </em>784 F.3d 154, 166 (3d Cir. 2015), <em>as amended </em>Apr. 28, 2015 (quoting <em>Hayes v.

Am., LLC, </em>687 F.3d 583, 592-95 (3d Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">With all due respect to our colleagues on the Third Circuit, we decline to adopt a heightened ascertainability theory that requires a showing of administrative feasibility at the class certification stage. The reasoning underlying our decision in <em>Brecher </em>does not suggest any such prerequisite, and creating one would upset the careful balance of competing interests codified in the explicit requirements of Rule 23. In declining to adopt an administrative feasibility requirement, we join a growing consensus that now includes the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits. <em>See Briseno, </em>844 F.3d at 1123; <em>Sandusky, </em>821 F.3d at 995-96; <em>Rikos v.

Our Decision in <em>Brecher v. Republic of Argentina</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\"><em>Brecher </em>was one of several opinions in which we assessed a class action initiated by holders of Argentinian bonds \u201c[a]fter Argentina defaulted on between $80 and $100 billion of sovereign debt in 2001.\u201d <em>Brecher, </em>806 F.3d at 23 (listing prior decisions). The district court originally \u201ccertified a class under a continuous holder requirement, <em>i.e., </em>the class contained only those individuals who [ ] possessed beneficial interests in a particular bond series issued by the Republic of Argentina from the date of the complaint [] through the date of final judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\">When the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, we vacated in part after finding that the district court\u2019s method of calculating aggregate damages had likely produced impermissi-bly inflated awards. <em>See Seijas v. Republic of Argentina, </em>606 F.3d 53, 58-59 (2d Cir. 2010); <em>Hickory Sec., Ltd. v. Republic of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Argentina, </em>493 Fed.Appx. 156, 160 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary order). On remand, the district court \u201cmodif[ied] the class definition by removing the continuous holder requirement and expanding the class to all holders of beneficial interests in the relevant bond seriesf,] without limitation as to time held.\u201d <em>Breeher, </em>806 F.3d at 24. The defendants appealed once again.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">We concluded that, without the continuous holder requirement, the modified class was unascertainable. <em>Id. </em>at 26. We first defined the elements of ascertain-ability, explaining that a proposed class: (1) must be \u201csufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member\u201d; and (2) must be \u201cdefined by objective criteria that are administratively feasible,\u201d such that \u201cidentifying its members would not require a mini-hearing on the merits of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24 (citations omitted). These requirements operate in harmony: \u201cthe use of objective criteria cannot alone determine ascertainability when those criteria, taken together, do not establish the definite boundaries of a readily identifiable class.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (footnote in original as n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Turning to the facts of the case, we expressed concern that the class was insufficiently bounded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">The secondary market for Argentine bonds is active and has continued trading after the commencement of this and other lawsuits.... Further, all bonds from the same series have the same trading number identifier (called a CU-SIP/ISIN), making it practically impossible to trace purchases and sales of a particular beneficial interest. Thus, when it becomes necessary to determine who holds bonds that fall inside (or outside) of the class, it will be nearly impossible to distinguish.between them once traded on the secondary market without a criterion as to time held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 25-26 (citations omitted). We concluded that \u201cft]his case presents [ ] a circumstance where an objective standard\u2014 owning a beneficial interest in a bond series without reference to time owned \u2014 is insufficiently definite to allow ready identification of the class or the persons who will be bound by the judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">As this summary clarifies, we reached our decision in <em>Breeher </em>by asking whether the class was defined by objective criteria that made the class\u2019s membership sufficiently definite, not whether the class was administratively feasible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 26 (\u201cThe lack of a defined class period ... makes the modified class <em>insufficiently definite </em>as a matter of law.\u201d (emphasis added)). The opinion\u2019s language about \u201cadministrative feasibility\u201d and \u201cmini-hearings\u201d was not strictly part of the holding, and was not intended to create an independent element of the ascertainability test; rather, that language conveyed the <em>purpose </em>underlying the operative requirements of definiteness and objectivity. That is, a class must be \u201csufficiently definite <em>so that </em>it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member\u201d; a class must be \u201cdefined by objective criteria\u201d so <em>that </em>it will not be necessary to hold \u201ca mini-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>hearing on the merits of each case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">This interpretation finds farther support' in the district court cases we cited in <em>Breaker's </em>articulation and application of the ascertainability standard. <em>Compare Bakalar v. Vavra, </em>237 F.R.D. 59, 65 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (declining to certify a class seeking recovery of artworks traceable to a particular estate \u2014 an objective criterion \u2014 because the movants were unable to <em>identify </em>the specific artworks, and were therefore also unable to identify \u201cthe owners, possessors or individuals who participated in transfers of such works\u201d), <em>with Ebin v. Kangadis Food Inc., </em>297 F.R.D. 561, 567 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (acknowledging the challenge of identifying individuals who purchased a particular brand of olive oil during the class period, but finding the class ascertainable because \u201cascertainability ... is designed only to prevent the certification of a class whose membership is <em>truly </em>indeterminable\u201d (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)), <em>and Charron v. Pinnacle Grp. N.Y. LLC, </em>269 F.R.D. 221, 229 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding that ascertainability was satisfied because the proposed class was \u201cdefined by objective criteria \u2014 namely, whether a given apartment is rent-regulated\u201d and \u201cowned by the [defendant corporation]; and whether the putative Class member is a tenant\u201d on a fixed date\u2014 \u201cthus allowing the Court to readily identify Class members -without needing to resolve the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">3. Ascertainability and Rule 23</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Having concluded that our decision in <em>Brecher </em>did not create an independent administrative feasibility requirement, we now consider whether such a requirement is compulsory under Rule 23, or at least complementary to the requirements enumerated therein. We find that it is neither. In pursuing this analysis, we are mindful that \u201c[c]ourts are not free to amend [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure] outside the process Congress ordered.\u201d <em>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 620, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997). \u201cThe text\u201d of Rule 23 thus \u201climits judicial inventiveness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The heightened ascertainability test, as articulated by the Third Circuit and endorsed by Appellants, treats administrative feasibility as an absolute standard: plaintiffs must provide adequate \u201cassurance that there can be \u2018a reliable and administratively feasible mechanism for determining whether putative class members fall within the class definition.\u2019\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Byrd, </em>784 F.3d at 164-65 (quoting <em>Hayes, </em>725 F.3d at 355); <em>cf. Mullins, </em>795 F.3d at 663 (\u201cWhen administrative inconvenience is addressed as a matter of ascertainability, courts tend to look at the problem in a vacuum, considering only the administrative costs and headaches of proceeding as a class action.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">On its face, this test appears to duplicate Rule 23\u2019s requirement that district courts consider \u201cthe likely difficulties in managing a class action.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3)(D). This apparent redundancy is misleading, however, because of a key difference in analytical orientation. Whereas ascertainability is an absolute standard, manageability is a component of the superiority analysis, which is explicitly comparative in nature: courts must ask whether \u201ca class action is <em>superior to other available methods </em>for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (emphasis added). We share the concern voiced by our sister circuits that heightened ascertainability and superiority could push in opposite directions. Though a court may not ignore concerns about the manageability of a putative class action, it may be that challenges of administrative feasibility are most prevalent in cases \u201cin which there may be no realistic alternative to class treatment,\u201d <em>Briseno, </em>844 F.3d at 1128 (agreeing with <em>Mullins, </em>795 F.3d at 663-64), underscoring the importance of a comparative inquiry. This concern-is particularly acute in light of our admonition that \u201cfailure to certify an action under Rule 23(b)(3) on the sole ground that it would be unmanageable is disfavored and should be the exception rather than the rule.\u201d <em>In re Visa Check/MasterMoney Antitrust Litig., </em>280 F.3d 124, 140 (2d Cir. 2001), <em>overruled on other grounds by In re IPO, </em>471 F.3d at 39-40 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The proposed administrative feasibility test also risks encroaching on territory belonging to the predominance requirement, such as classes that require highly individualized determinations of member eligibility. <em>See, e.g., Mazzei v. The Money Store, </em>829 F.3d 260, 272 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 137 S.Ct. 1332, 197 L.Ed.2d 518 (2017). Like superiority, predominance is a comparative standard: \u201cRule 23(b)(3) [ ] does <em>not </em>require a plaintiff seeking class certification to prove that each element of her claim is susceptible to classwide proof. What the rule does require is that common questions <em>\u2018predominate </em>over any questions affecting only individual [class] members.\u2019\u201d <em>Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans &amp; Tr. Funds, </em>568 U.S. 455, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1196, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3); other quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">We conclude that an implied administrative feasibility requirement would be inconsistent with the careful balance struck in Rule 23, which directs courts to weigh the competing interests inherent in any class certification decision. <em>Accord Briseno, </em>844 F.3d at 1128 (\u201c[A] freestanding administrative feasibility requirement\u201d would \u201chave practical consequences inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>with the policies embodied in Rule 28.\u201d); <em>Mullins, </em>795 F.3d at 658 (\u201cThe policy concerns motivating the heightened ascertain-ability requirement are better addressed by applying carefully the explicit requirements of Rule 23(a) and especially (b)(3).\u201d); <em>Byrd, </em>784 F.3d at 177 (Rendell, /., concurring) (concluding that the Third Circuit\u2019s \u201cheightened ascertainability requirement ... contravenes the purpose of Rule 23 and ... disserves the public\u201d); <em>see also </em>Shaw, 124 Yale L.J. at 2366 (\u201cRule 23 already safeguards the interests that the ascertainability requirement supposedly protects and adequately guards against the problems that the requirement supposedly forestalls.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Our decision in <em>Brecher </em>did not create an administrative feasibility requirement, and we decline to adopt one now. The ascertainability requirement, as defined in this Circuit, asks district courts to consider whether a proposed class is defined using objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries. This modest threshold requirement will only preclude certification if a proposed class definition is indeterminate in some fundamental way. If there is no focused target for litigation, the class itself cannot coalesce, rendering the class action an inappropriate mechanism for adjudicating any potential underlying claims. In other words, a class should not be maintained without a clear sense of who is suing about what. Ascertainability does not directly concern itself with the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to offer <em>proof of membership </em>under a given class definition, an issue that is already accounted for in Rule 23.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">4. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The district court\u2019s analysis in the <em>Certification Order </em>is not precisely consistent with the ascertainability standard articulated in this opinion. The district court focused primarily on the types of feasibility concerns that we hold are not controlling of the ascertainability analysis, and effectively addressed ascertainability as a component of superiority. 312 F.R.D. at 363-64. Nonetheless, the district court\u2019s findings reflect an understanding that objective criteria would permit the identification of class members. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">The Classes include persons who acquired specific securities during a specific time period, as long as those acquisitions occurred in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372. These criteria \u2014 securities purchases identified by subject matter, timing, and location \u2014 are clearly objective. The definition is also sufficiently definite: there exists a definite subset of Petrobras Securities holders who purchased those Securities in \u201cdomestic transactions\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>ing the bounded class period. Appellants vigorously challenge the <em>practicality of </em>making the domesticity determination for each putative class member, but as we explain above, the ascertainability analysis is limited to narrower question of whether those determinations are objectively <em>possible.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Unlike in <em>Brecher </em>or the cases cited therein, neither the parties nor the properties that are the subject of this litigation are fundamentally indeterminate. Finding no error in the district court\u2019s conclusion on this point, we reject Appellants\u2019 contention that the classes defined by the district court fail on ascertainability grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">C.

Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">A district court may only certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) if \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\u201d This \u201cpredominance\u201d requirement is satisfied if: (1) resolution of any material \u201clegal or factual questions ... can be achieved through generalized proof,\u201d and (2) \u201cthese [common] issues are more substantial than the issues subject only to individualized proof.\u201d <em>Mazzei, </em>829 F.3d at 272 (quoting <em>Myers, </em>624 F.3d at 547).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The distinction between \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201ccommon\u201d questions is thus central to the predominance analysis. As the Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">An individual question is one where \u201cmembers of a proposed class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member,\u201d while a common question is one where \u201cthe same evidence will suffice for each member to make a prima facie showing or the issue is susceptible to generalized class-wide proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\"><em>Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 4:50, at 196-97 (5th ed. 2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">The predominance inquiry is a core feature of the Rule 23(b)(3) class mechanism, and is not satisfied simply by showing that the class claims are framed by the common harm suffered by potential plaintiffs. <em>Amchem Prods., </em>521 U.S. at 623-24, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (noting that \u201cpredominance criterion is far more demanding\u201d than the \u201ccommonality\u201d requirement under Rule 23(a)); <em>see also Johnson v.

For this reason, the Supreme Court has emphasized district courts\u2019 \u201cduty to take a \u2018close look\u2019 at whether common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>questions predominate over individual ones.\u201d <em>Comcast Corp. v.

This analysis is \u201cmore [] qualitative than quantitative,\u201d Rubenstein, <em>supra, </em>at 197 (footnote omitted), and must account for the nature and significance of the material common and individual issues in the case, <em>see Roach, </em>778 F.3d at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">2. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">A proper assessment of predominance in this action involves two predicate questions about the role of <em>Morrison </em>inquiries. First, is the determination of domesticity material to Plaintiffs\u2019 class claims? <em>See Amchem Prods., </em>521 U.S. at 623, 117 S.Ct. 2231 (explaining that predominance \u201ctrains on the legal or factual questions that qualify each class member\u2019s case as a genuine controversy\u201d). If so, is that determination \u201csusceptible to generalized class-wide proof\u2019 such that it represents a \u201ccommon\u201d question rather than an \u201cindividual\u201d one? <em>Tyson Foods, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1045 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We find that the district court failed to meaningfully address the second question. That omission was an error of law, and we vacate the certification decision on that basis. Only by answering <em>both </em>predicate questions can the district court properly assess whether, in the case as a whole, common issues are \u201cmore prevalent or important\u201d than individual ones. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">With regard to the first question, <em>\u201cMorrison </em>makes clear that [determining] whether [federal securities law] applies to certain conduct is a \u2018merits\u2019 question.\u201d <em>Absolute Activist, </em>677 F.3d at 67 (quoting <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 254, 130 S.Ct. 2869). In other words, a putative class member only has a viable cause of action if the specific Petrobras Securities sued upon were purchased in a qualifying \u201cdomestic transaction.\u201d <em>City of Pontiac, </em>752 F.3d at 179; <em>see also Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 273, 130 S.Ct. 2869 (holding that securities fraud claims that lack a domestic connection must be dismissed for \u201cfail[ure] to state a claim on which relief can be granted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The district court clearly recognized <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>importance because the class definitions import <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>unelaborated legal standard, namely that Petrobras Securities must have been purchased in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d <em>See Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. at 372. Indeed, it appears that the district court consciously sought to certify encompassing classes that would extend as far as <em>Morrison </em>allows. <em>See id. </em>at 364 (rejecting a proposed limitation to the class definition because it \u201cwould cut off purchasers who have valid claims under <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>second prong\u201d). When it came to predominance, however, the district court did not mention <em>Morrison </em>at all. The court found that predominance was satisfied, explaining that, \u201cwith the exception of reliance[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>] and damages, plaintiffs\u2019 claims rest almost exclusively on class-wide questions of law and fact centered around\u201d Petrobras\u2019s alleged misconduct \u201cand the effects of these actions and events on the market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364. The court proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to discuss reliance and damages in great detail, <em>id. </em>at 364-72, but made no mention of <em>Morrison.</em><footnotemark><em>23</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The <em>Certification Order </em>is susceptible to two possible readings: either the district court implicitly held that <em>Morrison </em>inquiries constituted a common issue, or the court simply sidestepped the question. Either way, given the nature of the <em>Morrison </em>inquiries at issue, the district court cannot be said to have \u201cgive[n] careful scrutiny to the relation between [the] common and individual questions\u201d central to this case. <em>See Tyson Foods, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1045.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">On the available record, the investigation of domesticity appears to be an \u201cindividual question\u201d requiring putative class members to \u201cpresent evidence that varies from member to member.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As discussed above, a plaintiff may demonstrate the domesticity of a particular transaction by producing evidence \u201cincluding, but not limited to, facts concerning the formation of the contracts, the placement or purchase orders, the passing of title, or the exchange of money.\u201d <em>Absolute Activist, </em>677 F.3d at 70; <em>see also </em>Discussion Section II.A, <em>supra. </em>These transaction-specific facts are not obviously \u201csusceptible to [] class-wide proof,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> nor did Plaintiffs suggest a form of representative proof that would answer the question of domesticity for individual class members. <em>See Tyson Foods, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1045-46 (explaining that class plaintiffs may rely on representative samples to prove class-wide liability where they can show \u201cthat each class member could have relied on that sample to establish liability if he or she had brought an individual action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">In cases that have applied <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Absolute Activist </em>\u2014 including the district court\u2019s own experience adjudicating Petrobras-specific inquiries \u2014 factfinders have considered various types of evidence offered to prove the domesticity of various types of transactions. <em>See, e.g., Loginovskaya, </em>764 F.3d at 274-75 (finding that domestic wire transfers failed to satisfy <em>Absolute Activist </em>because they were \u201cactions needed to carry out the transactions, and not the transactions themselves\u201d); <em>In re Petrobras Sec. Litig., </em>152 F.Supp.3d 186, 193 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (explaining that the high-level documentation provided by various plaintiffs was insufficient to plead a domestic transaction); <em>December 2015 Order, </em>150 F.Supp.3d at 340-41 (finding that two proposed class representatives failed to plead domestic transactions in Petrobras Notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">The district court suggested that the pertinent locational details for each transaction are likely to be found in the \u201crecord[s] routinely produced by the modern financial system,\u201d and \u201care highly likely to be documented in a form susceptible to the bureaucratic processes of determining who belongs to a Class.\u201d <em>Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. at 364. Even if that fact is true, however, it does not obviate the need to consider the plaintiff-specific nature of the <em>Morrison </em>inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The two approved class representatives with Notes-based claims were both located in the United States, placed their Notes purchase orders in the United States, and procured their securities directly from United States underwriters as part of the initial Notes Offerings. <em>See December 2015 Order, </em>150 F.Supp.3d at 340. Appellants argue that those transactions are the easy case. As the Underwriter Defendants observe, the Classes as currently defined potentially \u201cinclude[] numerous foreign and domestic entities that purchased securities from other foreign and domestic entities, possibly through foreign and domestic intermediaries, using different methods, under different circumstances, and reflected in different types of records (assuming any records of the purchases exist at all).\u201d Underwriter Defs.\u2019 Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Significantly, the Classes include investors who purchased Notes in the initial Offerings, as well as investors who purchased their Notes on the secondary market. <em>See Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. at 372. Aftermarket purchasers asserting claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act must not only establish that they acquired their Notes in a domestic secondary transaction, but must also show that the particular Notes they acquired are \u201ctraceable to\u201d one of the U.S.-registered Offerings. <em>See id. </em>The <em>Certification Order </em>offers no indication that the district court considered the ways in which evidence of domesticity might vary in nature or availability across the many permutations of transactions in Petrobras Securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The need for <em>Morrison </em>inquiries nominally presents a common question because the need to show a \u201cdomestic transaction\u201d applies equally to each putative class member. However, Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that, more often than not, they can provide common <em>answers. Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1196. In this case, the potential for variation across putative class members\u2014 who sold them the relevant securities, how those transactions were effectuated, and what forms of documentation might be offered in support of domesticity \u2014 appears to generate a set of individualized inquiries that must be considered within the framework of Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s predominance requirement. <em>See Tyson Foods, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1045-46 (explaining that \u201c[a]n individual question is one where members of a proposed class will need to present evidence that varies from member to member....\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Consider, for instance, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Amgen </em>decision, which similarly involved class claims under Section 10(b) the Exchange Act. 568 U.S. 455, 133 S.Ct. 1184. Such claims require a showing that the defendants made a <em>\u201cmaterial </em>misrepresentation or omission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1195. Materiality \u2014 like domesticity \u2014 is thus an \u201cessential predicate\u201d of an Exchange Act claim. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Amgen </em>Court held, however, that <em>proof </em>of materiality was not required for the purpose of satisfying predominance at the class certification stage. <em>Id. </em>Because materiality is determined objectively from the perspective of the \u201c \u2018reasonable investor,\u2019 materiality can be proved through evidence <em>common to the class.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added) (quoting <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., </em>426 U.S. 438, 445, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976)). \u201cIn no event will the individual circumstances of particular class members bear on the [materiality] inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. \u201cConsequently, materiality is a common question for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1196 (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">In the present action, by contrast, it cannot be said that the class members\u2019 <em>Morrison </em>inquiries will \u201cprevail or fail in unison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>adjudicated several individualized <em>Morrison </em>inquiries, preserving some plaintiffs\u2019 claims and dismissing others. <em>See </em>Discussion Section II.A.2, <em>supra. </em>\u201c[Wjithout <em>class-wide </em>evidence\u201d of domesticity, \u201cthe fact-finder would have to look at every class member\u2019s [transaction] documents to determine who did and who did not have a valid claim.\u201d <em>Mazzei, </em>829 F.3d at 272 (citing <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

The predominance analysis must account for such individual questions, particularly when they go to the viability of each class member\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Finally, we emphasize that district courts are authorized to implement management strategies tailored to the particularities of each case. In addition to modifying class definitions and issuing class-wide rulings, district courts can, for example, bifurcate the proceedings to home in on threshold class-wide inquiries; sever claims not properly adjudicated on a class-wide basis to isolate key common issues; or certify subclasses that separate class members into smaller, more homogenous groups defined by common legal or factual questions.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(4), (c)(5); see <em>also In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, </em>461 F.3d 219, 227 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>In re Visa Check, </em>280 F.3d at 141 (summarizing various class action \u201cmanagement tools\u201d and collecting cases). While these options need not necessarily be exercised or even planned for prior to class certification, the possibility of post-certification procedural tailoring does not attenuate the obligation to take a \u201cclose look\u201d at predominance when assessing the motion for certification itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court\u2019s certification of the Classes insofar as they include all otherwise eligible class members who acquired their Securities in \u201cdomestic transactions.\u201d We take no position as to whether, on remand, the district court might properly certify one or more classes that capture some or all of the Securities holders who fall within the Classes as currently defined.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Our purpose is merely to outline the contours of the robust predominance inquiry that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Rule 28 demands. We leave the adjudication thereof to the district court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">III. \u201cFraud on the Market\u201d and the Presumption of Reliance</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The second issue on appeal concerns the district court\u2019s finding that the Exchange Act Class was entitled to a presumption of class-wide reliance on the market price of Petrobras\u2019s ADS and Notes. In reaching that conclusion, the district court found that Plaintiffs satisfied their burden of showing that the Petrobras Securities traded in efficient markets, as required under the \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory-established in <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). The Petrobras Defendants challenge that finding, arguing that the district court erred in the relative weight it assigned to the parties\u2019 competing evidence. We find no error of law in the district court\u2019s blended consideration of direct and indirect evidence of market efficiency, nor do we find any clear error in the district court\u2019s factual analysis. We therefore affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">A. The \u201cFraud on the Market\u201d Theory</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">1. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Plaintiffs alleging claims under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act must prove \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant; (2) scienter; (3) a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission; (5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.\u201d <em>Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc. (\u201cHalliburton </em>II\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark>),-U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 2407, 189 L.Ed.2d 339 (2014) (citation omitted). The key element for the purpose of this appeal is reliance, the element that establishes a sufficient \u201cconnection between a defendant\u2019s misrepresentation and a plaintiff\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">On its face, the reliance element would appear to preclude class certification on predominance grounds: \u201c[e]ach plaintiff would have to prove reliance individually,\u201d with the result that \u201ccommon issues would not \u2018predominate\u2019 over individual ones.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2416 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court resolved that tension almost three decades ago in <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>reasoning that \u201c[a]n investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price,\u201d and so \u201can investor\u2019s reliance on any public material misrepresentations [ ] may be <em>presumed </em>for purposes of a Rule 10b-5 action.\u201d 485 U.S. at 247, 108 S.Ct. 978 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">In 2014, the Court affirmed the continued vitality of the \u201cfraud on the market\u201d theory, and clarified that the so-called <em>\u201cBasic </em>presumption actually incorporates two constituent presumptions:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-16\">First, if a plaintiff shows that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation was public and material and that the stock traded in a generally efficient market, he is entitled to a presumption that the misrepresentation affected the stock price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-17\">Second, if the plaintiff also shows that he purchased the stock at the market price during the relevant period, he is entitled to a further presumption that he purchased the stock in reliance on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-18\"><em>Halliburton II, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2414. If a putative class successfully establishes the <em>Basic </em>presumption, \u201cdefendants must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>afforded an opportunity ... to defeat the presumption through evidence that [the] alleged misrepresentation [at issue in the plaintiffs\u2019 legal claim] did not actually affect the market price of the stock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2417.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">2. Market Efficiency and the <em>Cammer </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u201cThe fraud-on-the-market theory rests on the premise that certain well developed markets are efficient processors of public information,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe \u2018market price of shares\u2019 will \u2018reflect all publicly available information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1192 (quoting <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 246, 108 S.Ct. 978 (alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">This Court \u201chas not adopted a test for the market efficiency of stocks or bonds.\u201d <em>Teamsters Local 445 Freight Div. Pension Fund v. Bombardier Inc., </em>546 F.3d 196, 204 n.11 (2d Cir. 2008). A test based on the so-called <em>\u201cCammer </em>factors\u201d has been \u201croutinely applied by district courts considering the efficiency of equity markets,\u201d and has also been applied, in modified form, \u201cto bond markets with a recognition of the differences between the manner in which debt bonds and equity securities trade.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Cammer v. Bloom, </em>711 F.Supp. 1264, 1286-87 (D.N.J. 1989) (articulating five factors); <em>Krogman v. Sterritt, </em>202 F.R.D. 467, 478 (N.D. Tex. 2001) (describing three additional factors that are commonly included in <em>Cammer </em>analyses); <em>In re Enron Corp. Sec., </em>529 F.Supp.2d 644, 747-49 (S.D. Tex. 2006) (applying the <em>Cammer </em>factors in modified form to debt securities).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">All but one of the <em>Cammer </em>factors examine indirect indicia of market efficiency for a particular security, such as high trading volume, extensive analyst coverage, multiple market makers, large market capitalization, and an issuer\u2019s eligibility for simplified SEC filings. The fifth <em>Cammer </em>factor, however, invites plaintiffs to submit direct evidence, consisting of \u201cempirical facts showing a cause and effect relationship between unexpected corporate events or financial releases and an immediate response in the stock price.\u201d <em>Cammer, </em>711 F.Supp. at 1287; <em>see also Halliburton II, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2415 (\u201c[Plaintiffs [ ] can and do introduce evidence of the existence of price impact in connection with \u2018event studies\u2019 \u2014 regression analyses that seek to show that the market price of the defendant\u2019s stock tends to respond to pertinent publicly reported events.\u201d (citation and emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">B. Application</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">At the outset, the Petrobras Defendants assert an error of law: they challenge the district court\u2019s purported holding that Plaintiffs were entitled to the <em>Basic </em>presumption based solely on their <em>indirect </em>evidence of market efficiency. This argument mischaracterizes the district court\u2019s analysis. True, the court noted that \u201cPetro-bras was one of the largest and most-analyzed firms in the world throughout the Class Period,\u201d and explained that in instances where \u201cthe indirect <em>[Cammer] </em>factors overwhelmingly describe a large and well-functioning market for Petrobras securities, common sense suggests that the market would materially react to material disclosures.\u201d <em>Certification Order, </em>312 F.R.D. at 367. The opinion did not stop there, however. The court proceeded with an \u201cinvolved analysis\u201d of Plaintiffs\u2019 empirical evidence \u2014 which Defendants disputed as to \u201calmost every aspect\u201d \u2014 and \u201cultimately conclude[d] that plaintiffs [had] satisfied the fifth <em>Cammer </em>factor.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 367-71. Anything to the contrary was, at most, a holding in. the alternative. We therefore decline to reach the Petrobras Defendants\u2019 legal question\u2014 whether plaintiffs may satisfy the <em>Basic </em>presumption without <em>any </em>direct evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of price impact \u2014 because the issue is not squarely presented for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Having confirmed the <em>existence </em>of Plaintiffs\u2019 direct evidence of market efficiency, we turn to the Petrobras Defendants\u2019 attack on the <em>quality </em>of that evidence. They argue, first, that the district court gave undue weight to Plaintiffs\u2019 empirical test,, which measured the magnitude of responsive price changes in Petrobras Securities without considering the direction of those changes, and second, that the district court unduly discounted Defendants\u2019 rebuttal evidence. We find these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In the class certification proceedings, the parties\u2019 \u201cexperts [ ] sparred over whether any direct evidence of [Cammeds] fifth factor existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367.

Defendants responded with numerous challenges to \u201cthe execution and the sufficiency\u201d of that test. <em>Id. </em>at 368. They specifically criticized the test\u2019s failure to examine directionality, that is, \u201cwhether the price of a security moved up or down as expected based on the precipitating market event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369; <em>see also id. </em>at 370 (describing the defense expert\u2019s position that \u201cin an efficient market, the price of a security should <em>always </em>move in response to the release of new value-relevant information that is materially different from expectations\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 expert conducted supplementary analyses of directional price impact, but the district court accorded them \u201conly limited weight\u201d after Defendants highlighted certain methodological flaws. <em>Id. </em>at 369-70. As to the non-direetional analysis, the court declined to \u201clet the perfect become the enemy of the good\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">In this ease, where the indirect <em>Cammer </em>factors lay a strong foundation for a finding of efficiency, a statistically significant showing that statistically significant price returns are more likely to occur on event dates is sufficient as direct evidence of market efficiency and thereby to invoke <em>Basic\u2019s </em>presumption of reliance at the class certification stage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"as-dedup-0\">We find that the district court\u2019s conclusion \u201cfalls within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Roach, </em>778 F.3d at 405 (citation omitted). The district court properly declined to view direct and indirect evidence as distinct requirements, opting instead for a holistic analysis based on the totality of the evidence presented. <em>See, e.g., In re JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 12 CIV. 03852 (GBD), 2015 WL 10433433, at *7 (S.D.N.Y.

The gravamen of their claim is that plaintiffs would only be entitled to the <em>Basic </em>presumption after making a substantial showing of market efficiency based on directional empirical evidence alone, irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>spective of any other evidence they may have offered.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We reject this proposition. In short, the Petrobras Defendants are attempting to relabel a <em>sufficient </em>condition as a <em>necessary </em>one. We noted in <em>Bombardier </em>that \u201c[a]n event study that correlates the disclosures of unanticipated, material information about a security with corresponding fluctuations in price has been considered <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the existence of such a causal relationship.\u201d <em>Bombardier, </em>546 F.3d at 207-08 (citing <em>In re Xcelera.com Sec. Litig., </em>430 F.3d 503, 512-14, 516 (1st Cir. 2005)). We never suggested, however, that such evidence was the <em>only </em>way to prove market efficiency; indeed, we explicitly declined to adopt any particular \u201ctest for the market efficiency of stocks or bonds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The Supreme Court has similarly declined to define a precise evidentiary standard for market efficiency, but the Court\u2019s opinions consistently suggest that the burden is not an onerous one. <em>See Halliburton II, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2410 (\u201cEven the foremost critics of the efficient-capital-markets hypothesis acknowledge that public information generally affects stock prices,\u201d and so \u201c[djebates about the precise <em>degree </em>to which stock prices accurately reflect public information are [ ] largely beside the point.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 2417 (Ginsburg, <em>J., </em>concurring) (interpreting the holding in <em>Halliburton II </em>as \u201cimposing] no heavy toll on seeurities-fraud plaintiffs with tenable claims\u201d); <em>Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1192 (\u201c[I]t is reasonable to presume that most investors ... will rely on [a] security\u2019s market price as an unbiased assessment of the security\u2019s value in light of all public information.\u201d); <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 246 n.24, 108 S.Ct. 978 (\u201cFor purposes of accepting the presumption of reliance ..., we need only believe that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 246, 108 S.Ct. 978 (\u201cThe presumption is supported by common sense and probability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The Petrobras Defendants\u2019 proposed ev-identiary hierarchy unreasonably discounts the potential probative value of indirect evidence of market efficiency. As noted above, all but one of the widely used <em>Cammer </em>factors focus on elements that would logically appear in, or contribute to, an efficient securities market. Those factors would add little to the <em>Basic </em>analysis if courts only ever considered them after finding a strong showing based on direct evidence alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Indeed, indirect evidence is particularly valuable in situations where direct evidence does <em>not </em>entirely resolve the question. Event studies offer the seductive promise of hard numbers and dispassionate truth, but methodological constraints limit their utility in the context of single-firm analyses. <em>See generally </em>Alon Brav &amp; J.B. Heaton, <em>Event Studies in Securities Litigation: Low Power, Confounding Effects, and Bias, </em>93 Wash. U. L. Rev. 583 (2015); <em>see also id. </em>at 588 n.ll (collecting academic criticism of single-firm event studies). Notably, small sample sizes may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>limit statistical power, meaning that only very large-impact events will be detectable.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 589-605. In addition, it can be extremely difficult to isolate the price impact of any one piece of information in the presence of confounding factors, such as other simultaneously released news about the company, the industry, or the geographic region. <em>See id. </em>at 605-08. These methodological challenges counsel against imposing a blanket rule requiring district courts to, at the class certification stage, rely on directional event studies and directional event studies alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In sum, the district court properly considered a combination of direct and indirect evidence in reaching its conclusion that Petrobras ADS and Notes both trade in efficient markets. The court conducted a rigorous analysis of the parties\u2019 proffered evidence and objections. We find no abuse of discretion, and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption of reliance on the market price of the Petrobras Securities. We caution that this determination is limited to the district court\u2019s class certification order, and is not binding on the ultimate finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s <em>Certification Order </em>is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">.

T.L. Cannon Corp., </em>778 F.3d 401, 405 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>In re Nassau Cty. Strip Search Cases, </em>461 F.3d 219, 224-25 (2d Cir. 2006)), this language apparently arose from a misreading of-earlier Second Circuit cases. Moreover, it is out of step with recent Supreme Court authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">The first case to suggest that we apply a different standard to denials of class certification was <em>Lundquist v. Security Pacific Auto</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>motive Financial Services Corp., <em>993 F.2d 11, 14 (2d Cir. 1993) (per curiam). </em>Lundquist <em>cited </em>Robidoux v. Celani, <em>987 F.2d 931, 935 (2d Cir. 1993), and </em>Abrams v. Interco Inc., <em>719 F.2d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 1983), for the proposition that \"we are noticeably less deferential to the district court when that court has denied class status than when it has certified a class.\u201d </em>Id. <em>But </em>Abrams <em>and </em>Robidoux <em>do not support this proposition. </em>Abrams <em>states, in relevant part: \u201cAbuse of discretion can be found far more readily on appeals from the denial </em>or grant <em>of class action status than where the issue is, for example, the curtailment of cross-examination or the grant or denial of a continuance,\" because \"courts have built a body of case law with respect to class action status.\u201d 719 F.2d at 28 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). </em>Robidoux <em>repeated that \u201cabuse of discretion can be found more readily on appeals from the denial of class status </em>than in other areas, <em>for the courts have built a body of case law with respect to class action status.\u201d 987 F.2d at 935 (emphasis added) (citing </em>Abrams, <em>719 F.2d at 28).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Thus, neither <em>Abrams </em>nor <em>Robidoux </em>applied a different standard to denials versus grants of class certification. Rather, both cases stated that this Court is more likely to find abuse of discretion in appeals involving the <em>issue </em>of class certification \u2014 whether certification was granted or denied \u2014 when compared with <em>other types of legal issues. </em>It appears that <em>Lund-quist </em>misinterpreted that comparison. In sum, no Second Circuit case provides any reasoning or justification for the idea that we review denials of class certification with more scrutiny than grants.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">The Supreme Court has never drawn a distinction between the standard used to review district court denials or grants of class certification. <em>See, e.g., Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Boua</em>phakeo,-U.S.-, 136 S.Ct. 1036, 1045-46, 194 L.Ed.2d 124 (2016). Recent Supreme Court class certification cases emphasize that courts must \"conduct a rigorous analysis\u201d to determine whether putative class plaintiffs meet Rule 23\u2019s requirements. <em>Comcast Corp. </em>v. <em>Behrend, </em>569 U.S. 27, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1432, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013); <em>see also Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S. 338, 351, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011). That said, we need not decide the issue here. We take this opportunity, however, to point out the distinction as one that need not and ought not be drawn.

That language was pure dicta, however: the district court denied class certification on predominance grounds, <em>see id. </em>at *10-11, and discussed superiority and ascertainability only to show that, even if predominance had been satisfied, <em>\"potentially </em>serious impediments to class certification [would] remain,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *12 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">In any event, our opinion in <em>Brecher </em>did not cite to <em>Weiner\u2019s </em>fact-based analysis.

Certain arguments that appeared in Appellants\u2019 briefs under the heading of ascertaina-bility are properly construed as challenges to superiority. This includes, for example, due process concerns regarding notice to absent class members. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B); <em>Hecht </em>v. <em>United Collection Bureau, Inc., </em>691 F.3d 218, 222 (2d Cir. 2012) (\"Absent class members have a due process right to notice and an opportunity to opt out of [certain types of] class litigation,\u201d and \"Rule 23 protects that right by providing a parallel statutory requirement of notice and the opportunity to opt out for classes certified under subdivision (b)(3).\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. This clarified conception of ascertainability supports, rather than supplants, the plain text of Rule 23. As we noted above in our discussion of <em>Brecher, </em>a class must be \u201csufficiently definite\u201d and \"defined by objective criteria\u201d <em>so that </em>\"it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member\u201d (a superiority concern) and <em>so that </em>\u201cidentifying [the class's] members would not require a mini-hearing on the merits of each case\u201d (a predominance concern). <em>Brecher, </em>806 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added) (citation omitted). So understood, the ascer-tainability requirement merely gives name to a particularly vexing type of class defect that would cause a proposed class to founder on the shoals of predominance, superiority, or both. Ascertainability provides a guiding principle for the otherwise murky analysis of classes that, though ostensibly defined by objective criteria, nonetheless present fatal challenges of determinability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\">. As explained in the sections that follow, legal questions as to the \u201cdomesticity\u201d of any given transaction \u2014 and the resulting individualized determinations of class member eligibility \u2014 go to the core of the predominance analysis, and are not properly analyzed as issues of ascertainability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. As discussed in greater detail below, the Exchange Act claims include a reliance element that must be satisfied on an individual basis unless the plaintiffs establish a class-wide presumption of reliance under the \"fraud on the market\" theory. <em>See </em>Discussion Section III.A, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\">.

For instance, a district court might find that the transaction records for a particular security among particular parties display certain common indicia of domesticity. Class plaintiffs may propose a mechanism for assembling a representative sample of the manner in which a given security will trade, with an emphasis on the domesticity factors highlighted in <em>Absolute Activist. </em>A district court could also carefully weigh the relationship between common and individual questions in the case and determine that any variation across plaintiffs is, on balance, insufficient to defeat predominance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b301-12\">, The case commonly referred to as <em>\u201cHalliburton I\u201d </em>is <em>Erica P.

It would be a strange standard indeed that imposed a stricter burden for class certification than on the final merits adjudication. Presumably, then, the Petrobras Defendants would require that direct evidence take precedence over indirect evidence both at the certification stage and with the ultimate finder of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\">. Brav and Heaton caution courts against misinterpreting studies that fail to find statistically significant price changes: \"[W]hile a statistically significant reaction to a firm-specific news event is evidence that information was reflected in the price (absent confounding effects), the converse is <em>not true </em>\u2014 the failure of the price to react so extremely as to be [detectable] does <em>not </em>establish that the market is inefficient; it may mean only that the\u201d effect size was not large enough to be detected in the available sample. Brav &amp; Heaton, 93 Wash. U. L. Rev. at 602 (emphasis added). \"While some courts have been sensitive to this distinction ..., other courts have remained inattentive to this fact, which has generated inaccurate findings in some securities cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
