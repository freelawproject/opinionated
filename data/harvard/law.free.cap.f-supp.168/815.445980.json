It seeks to annul and set aside a report and order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated April 14, 1958, 295 I.C.C. 731, which authorizes the mergers of The Alabama and Vicksburg Railway Company and the Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway Company into the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and to enjoin enforcement of the order. For brevity the railroads will be referred to respectively as Alabama, Vicksburg and Illinois Central. The railroad corporations have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>been allowed to intervene as defendants. Plaintiff\u2019s application to the Commission for reconsideration of the report and order was denied by order dated September 29, 1958. Hence he had exhausted administrative remedies prior to filing the present suit in October, 1958. Joint answers to the complaint were filed by the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission praying that the complaint be dismissed. The intervening railroads have also answered and asked for dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The order under attack was issued pursuant to powers conferred upon the Commission by \u00a7 5(2) (b) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5(2) (b), which authorizes the Commission to approve a merger of railroads which it finds \u201cconsistent with the public interest\u201d on such terms as it finds \u201cto be just and reasonable.\u201d The proceedings before the Commission were initiated by the intervening railroads\u2019 applications for authority to merge. A public hearing was had at which the present plaintiff was heard in opposition to the railroads\u2019 application. A brief statement of the underlying facts will suffice. By lease dated March 31, 1925 Alabama, as lessor, leased its railroad to the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, as lessee, for a term expiring July 1, 2282. The lessee covenanted to pay rent, which included (among other things) a sum equal to six per cent of the par value of the capital stock of the lessor outstanding on the date of the lease. By agreement between Alabama and Illinois Central the latter guaranteed payment by the lessee of all sums required to be paid by it under the aforesaid lease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Illinois Central, as successor to the original lessee, is now operating the properties of Alabama and is subject to the obligations of the original lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Plaintiff is a minority stockholder in both the Alabama and the Vicksburg companies and also claims to be a creditor of the Illinois Central.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His brief asserts that \u201cBy virtue of the leases, the Alabama and the Vicksburg stockholders became the landlord and creditor of the Illinois Central, in addition to retaining their rights and status as stockholders of their own companies.\u201d From this premise he argues (1) that the leases are legal impediments to a merger because the obligation of the Illinois Central to make rental payments until July 1, 2282 cannot legally be terminated by merger; (2) that the compensation of $155. per share for his Alabama stock and $126.50 per share for his Vicksburg stock, which he is offered under the terms of the merger, is an illegal confiscation of his property; and (3) that the Commission erred in not considering evidence of the values of the leased railroads.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s claim that he is a creditor of Illinois Central and is entitled to receive payments of $6 per year on each share of his Alabama stock, until July 1, 2282, is based on two theories: (1) that the lease bound the lessee to make to stockholders of Alabama annual payments of $6 per share until July 1, 2282, and (2) that Illinois Central contracted with Alabama\u2019s stockholders to make such payments by reason of endorsements on their stock certificates. Plaintiff is mistaken in thinking that the lessee entered into any contractual relationship with the lessor\u2019s stockholders. The terms of the lease are very specific in stating that the lessee\u2019s promises run only to the lessor. These specific provisions are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Section 1 of Article Nine makes it perfectly clear that the stockholders of Alabama are neither third-party beneficiaries nor donee beneficiaries of the lessee\u2019s promises to the lessor. Section 2 of Article Nine makes equally clear that the lease does not preclude a transfer by merger or sale of the railway and properties of the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">Plaintiff also relies upon the legend endorsed upon his stock certificates as giving him a contractual right against Illinois Central. In this also he is mistaken. The final sentence of the endorsement shows plainly that the obligations of the lessee and guarantor are those expressed in the lease and guaranty, to copies of which the certificate holder is referred for ascertainment of his rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Illinois Central is under any contractual duty to him cannot be sustained. His reliance on such cases as King v. Richardson, 4 Cir., 136 F.2d 849, 861, certiorari denied 320 U.S. 777, 64 S.Ct. 91, 88 L.Ed. 466, to the effect that \u201cmerger will not be applied where its effect would be to prejudice the rights of innocent third persons,\u201d is misplaced. Much closer in point is Flagg v. Manhattan Ry. Co., C. C.S.D.N.Y., 10 F. 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s second contention which relates to the valuation of his shares of stock is also not sustainable. Because of the broad authority conferred upon the Commission by \u00a7 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act and the technical complexities of a merger case, the doctrine of administrative finality is particularly applicable. In McLean Trucking Co. v. United States, 321 U.S. 67, at page 87, 64 S.Ct. 370, at page 381, 88 L.Ed. 544, the court approved an order of the Commission under \u00a7 5, the opinion stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">\u201c* * * Resolving these considerations is a complex task which requires extensive facilities, expert judgment and considerable knowledge of the transportation industry. * * * \"The wisdom and experience of that commission,\u2019 not of the courts, must determine whether the proposed consolidation is \u2018consistent with the public interest.\u2019 * * * If the Commission did not exceed the statutory limits within which Congress confined its discretion and its findings are adequate and supported by evidence, it is not our function to upset its order.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">In approving a voluntary merger the Commission must find, first, that it \u201cwill be consistent with the public interest\u201d; second, -that it is \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d See Schwabacker v. United States, 334 U.S. 182, 194, 68 S.Ct. 958, 965, 92 L.Ed. 1305. With respect to the meaning of \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d the court said 334 U.S. at page 199, 68 S.Ct. at page 967:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-12\">\u201c* * * In appraising a stockholder\u2019s position in a merger as to justice and reasonableness, it is not the promise that a charter [of the state of incorporation] made to him but the current worth of that promise that governs, it is not what he once put into a constituent company but what value he is contributing to the merger that is to be made good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">In the case at bar the Commission made an appraisal of what plaintiff is contributing to the merger. Its report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-14\">\u201cUpon consideration of all the evidence we are of the opinion and find that the fair values of the considered stocks do not exceed amounts which would be produced by capitalizing the respective dividends at a rate between 4.25 and 4.50 per cent. Capitalizing the dividends at the lower of these rates would produce $141.18 per share for the Alabama stock and $117.65 per share for the Vicksburg stock. However, to avoid any possibility of injustice to the minority stockholders and to afford the present holders of these stocks the same prices which we have heretofore authorized Illinois Central to pay, and in view of the latter\u2019s willingness to pay the larger amounts or to exchange its stock upon the basis of the indicated prices, we are of the opinion that it will be consistent with the public interest to approve the merger upon the terms proposed, and that under these terms the holders of the leased lines\u2019 stocks will receive the fair economic equiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>alent of the rights surrendered by them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Plaintiff contends that the Commission has no authority in law to capitalize the contractual liability of Illinois Central to pay at the rate of $6 and $5 a year, per share, until July 1, 2282. But as we have previously demonstrated Illinois Central is under no such contractual liability to plaintiff. The Commission\u2019s capitalization of the present value of future rental payments is generous, and is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s third contention requires little discussion. Before the hearing examiner plaintiff moved to require the railroad applicants to furnish a statement segregating the traffic revenues derived from operation of the leased properties, in order to determine the value of his stocks from the standpoint of earnings contributed to Illinois Central. The examiner denied the motion and his ruling was sustained, the Commission citing its prior decision, Delaware L. &amp; W. Co. Merger, 257 I.C.C. 91, to the effect that where a lease in perpetuity is involved, which for practical purposes the present is, the rental represents the earnings of the property so far as the stockholders of the leased lines are concerned. Plaintiff now urges that the absence of evidence of the earning power and values of the leased lines makes it impossible to ascertain the value of the stock of Alabama and Vicksburg.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s argument lacks merit. We agree with the Commission\u2019s statement that \u201cFor all practical purposes, the stocks of the leased lines have a value to their owners measurable solely by the fixed rental payable under the leases and the dividends payable therefrom on the stocks.\u201d Plaintiff as a stockholder in Alabama and Vicksburg may have an interest in their separate earning power in 2282, if the leases are not renewed, but at present his only ascertainable interest is in the rental they produce. As said in Old Colony R. Co. v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 670, 672 \u201c * * * it is a fanciful notion that one may forecast the future value of a railroad half a century hence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">We find no basis for setting aside the report and order attacked by the complaint. Consequently the complaint should be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-5\">. On the same date Vicksburg, as lessor, executed a similar lease, and Illinois Central gave a similar guaranty that a sum equal to five per cent of the par value of the lessor\u2019s outstanding capital stock would be paid. As the issues are the same under both leases, we shall discuss only the Alabama lease and guaranty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b862-11\">. At the time of the order under attack plaintiff owned about one per cent of Alabama stock and one half per cent of Vicksburg stock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b862-12\">. Section 2 of Article Two reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-13\">\u201cSECTION 2. The lessee covenants to and with the lessor to pay yearly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>every year during the existence of this lease, and for any part of a year in proportion, the following amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-6\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">\u201c(g) To the lessor a sum semi-annually, on the first day of April and October of each year during the term of this lease, equal to six per cent (6%) of the par value of the present outstanding capital stock of the Lessor, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-8\">\u201cIt is agreed that said semi-annual payments, or any of them, must be made to the Lessor, if it so instructs the Lessee by timely notice in writing, but, in the absence of such instruction from the Lessor, the Lessee may make said semi-annual payments either to the Lessor or directly to the stockholders of record of the Lessor, as the Lessee may, from time to time, and at any time, elect. Any such payments made to the stockholders shall be in the proportion of their respective holdings of shares, and in case of such payment directly to the stockholders, evidence of the payment shall be preserved by the Lessee and furnished to the Lessor whenever the same shall be requested.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-9\">Section 1 of Article Nine, reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-10\">\u201cNothing in this Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other than the parties hereto, their successors and assigns, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture or under any covenant, condition or provision herein contained or the guaranty thereof; all the covenants, conditions and provisions herein and in the said guaranty being intended to be and being for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, their successors and assigns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-11\">Section 2 of Article Nine, reads as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-12\">\u201cSection 2.

The complete endorsement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-19\">\u201cBy an Indenture of lease bearing date the 31st day of March, 1925, and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission on the 3d day of May, 1926, The Alabama and Vicksburg Railway Company as Lessor, has leased its railroad and the appurtenances thereof and certain other property to The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad Company, as Lessee, from the day of the approval of the said lease by the Interstate Commerce Commission until the first day of July, 2282, and for such further term for which said lease may be extended as provided therein; and as rental therefor the Lessee has covenanted to pay (inter alia) on the 1st day of April and the 1st day of October in each year during said term, a sum equal to six per cent.
