A preliminary hearing was held thereon. Prior to the taking of any testimony, his attorney stated: \u201cI would like to make a motion to exclude all unauthorized persons from the courtroom during the interval of this hearing.\u201d Thereupon the court inquired of the district attorney and was advised that the only witness to testify on behalf of the People was the alleged victim. The court then asked the defendant\u2019s counsel : \u201cDo you want any of your witnesses excluded\u201d; whereupon the latter stated: \u201cAll unauthorized persons. The defendant is entitled to a private hearing here\u201d; and the court replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I have never heard of such a thing. There are a few certain types of cases where he would be entitled to a private hearing.\u201d Counsel for defendant made no attempt to enlighten the court with respect to the basis for his motion ; stated no grounds therefor; and offered no authority to support the same. It was denied. Following this, the defendant moved for production of all statements, tape recordings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>transcripts made by the police and witnesses, together with the names and addresses of all witnesses interviewed; the district attorney indicated his willingness to turn his entire file over to the defense counsel; whereupon, the court instructed the former to proceed, and to give defense counsel \u201ctime enough to peruse your file.\u201d Thereupon, the victim was called as a witness and testified to facts establishing that the defendant entered his store and committed the crime of robbery. At the conclusion of this testimony the defendant's attorney initiated a discussion of his previous request to exclude all \u201cunauthorized persons\u201d from the courtroom; noted that such persons were present; disclosed that he was relying on the rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>54 Cal.2d 498 [6 Cal. Rptr. 753, 354 P.2d 225] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Prizant, </em>186 Cal.App. 2d 542 [9 Cal.Rptr. 282]; and moved for a dismissal of the case. The remarks of the magistrate during the course of this discussion indicated that he had acted under the belief that defendant was entitled to request that all witnesses should leave the courtroom, but not all persons. A recess was taken for the obvious purpose of reading the decisions cited by counsel. When court reconvened the defendant renewed his motion to dismiss and the magistrate granted the same.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>quently, by new complaint, the defendant was charged with burglary, i.e., a violation of section 459 of the Penal Code, based on the same robbery incident. At the ensuing preliminary hearing the defendant moved \u201cto exclude all those persons <em>not authorized by the Penal Code 868 </em>from this hearing.\u201d (Italics ours.) The motion was granted. The defendant then moved to dismiss the proceedings upon the ground that his motion in the previous hearing to exclude \u201call unauthorized persons\u201d had been denied. After considerable discussion, the magistrate denied the motion to dismiss upon the ground that at the previous hearing the defendant had neither stated the grounds for his motion, disclosed the basis therefor, nor cited any authority in support thereof. All parties then submitted the pending issue of probable cause upon a transcript of the testimony taken at the first hearing. The defendant was held to answer to the superior court. In due course, an information was filed charging him with burglary and robbery, each offense based on the same incident. Prior to plea, the defendant moved for a dismissal under section 995 of the Penal Code, and prior to trial moved that the case be remanded to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>municipal court for dismissal; each motion ivas made upon the ground that the defendant had been deprived of his right to a private preliminary hearing as provided by section 868 of the Penal Code; and each motion was denied. Thereupon he pleaded not guilty; waived a jury trial; submitted his case to the trial judge on the preliminary transcript; was found guilty of both burglary and robbery; was sentenced to imprisonment in the state prison on both charges, the sentences to run concurrently; and appealed from the judgment entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">There are two issues on this appeal, i.e., (1) whether the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion at the first hearing to exclude \u201call unauthorized persons\u201d constituted a denial of due process of law which has infiltrated the whole proceeding, and (2) whether the court erred in imposing sentences upon him for both robbery and burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> The provisions of section 868 of the Penal Code confer upon the defendant the right to have excluded from his preliminary examination all persons except those designated by that section. If he is denied this right, the proceedings are subject to dismissal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Elliott, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 498.)  However, the right of exclusion exists only upon his request. Implicit in the exercise thereof is the requirement that such a request must be presented in an intelligent and legally sufficient manner.  Unless the defendant makes a request in the required manner the right of exclusion does not come into being, and the presence of persons at his examination who might have been excluded under the statute does not affect the validity of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">The magistrate at the second preliminary hearing determined that the defendant had not adequately claimed his right to a private hearing at the first preliminary hearing and, therefore, waived it. The record and the law support this position. The sum total of the defendant\u2019s initial motion was to exclude \u201call unauthorized persons\u201d from the courtroom. The basis or grounds for this motion were not stated. It is apparent that the deputy district attorney and the magistrate were unfamiliar with the requirements of Penal Code section 868 and the decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott, supra, </em>54 Cal. 2d 498 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Prizant, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 542. It also is apparent that counsel for the defendant wilfully withheld information respecting these requirements and these decisions. In the theatrical world such tactics might be classified as clever, but the courtroom is not a theatre, and the administration of justice is not a theatrical performance. The evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dence before us supports an implied finding in the order of the magistrate at the second hearing denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, in the order of the trial court denying his motion under Penal Code section 995, and in the further order of that court at the time of trial denying his motion to remand for lack of jurisdiction, that at the time the defendant made his original motion his action was not prompted by a desire to effect a private hearing, but with the hope that his request might be refused, and thus lay the foundation for a dismissal of all proceedings against him. Such conduct makes a mockery of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It cannot be said that the defendant in this case was denied his right to a private preliminary hearing; that he was not afforded due process of law; or that his trial was in any measure unfair. When the magistrate at the first hearing was advised of the basis for the defendant\u2019s request, his motion to dismiss was granted although, in our view of the record, the magistrate was not required to honor that motion. However, as hereinafter noted, this dismissal had no effect on the subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The principles evident in certain general rules of law applicable to various areas of trial practice, support the conclusion that a legally sufficient request to a court must fairly state the basis therefor, particularly where the judge or magistrate presiding indicates that he has a mistaken concept of the law in the premises. Ordinarily an objection to evidence without clearly stating the precise grounds therefor, unless they are obvious, may not be urged as a basis for error <em>(People </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>123 Cal. 482, 490 [56 P. 251]; <em>Kiler </em>v. <em>Kimbal, </em>10 Cal. 267; <em>People </em>v. <em>Modell, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 724, 730 [300 P.2d 204]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowzer, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 742, 746 [274 P.2d 471] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Renek, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 277, 283 [233 P.2d 43] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goff, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 166, 172 [223 P.2d 27] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Agajanian, </em>97 Cal.App.2d 399, 405 [218 P.2d 114]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calliham, </em>81 Cal.App.2d 928, 933 [185 P.2d 342] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>26 Cal.App.2d 197, 207 [79 P.2d 102]); nor is it error to deny a motion to strike evidence where no grounds for the motion are stated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>85 Cal. 421, 428 [24 P. 1006] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Eckman, </em>72 Cal. 582, 583 [14 P. 359] ; <em>Singer Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Management Corp., </em>116 Cal.App.2d 85 [253 P.2d 515] ; <em>Toomes </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>24 Cal.App.2d 395 [75 P.2d 94]; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hoge, </em>108 Cal.App. 180 [291 P. 444].) The requirement that a party fairly inform the court respecting the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>for his objection to evidence or his motion to strike the same is equally applicable to a situation such as the one at bar.  With respect to certain errors occurring in the course of a trial, it has been laid down as a general rule that: \u201cBefore a party may successfully take advantage of the behavior of the trial court, he must have objected, protested and assigned the conduct as prejudicial in order that the court may correct the asserted error.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kobey, </em>105 Cal.App.2d 548, 560 [234 P.2d 251].) The decisions are legion in support of the statement in 4 California Jurisprudence 2d 420 that: \u201cOne who by his conduct induces the commission of error by the trial court, or, in other words, invites error, is estopped to insist that the action of the court is erroneous.\u201d The tone of these general rules is a guide for the presentation of every request by any party to any action. It is noteworthy that, as shown by the record, in the course of the presentation of all subsequent motions counsel for the defendant referred either to the provisions of Penal Code section 868 or the decisions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Elliott, supra, </em>54 Cal.2d 498 and <em>People </em>v. <em>Prizant, supra, </em>186 Cal.App.2d 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Furthermore, not only did the motion in question fail to state the basis for the defendant\u2019s request, which is necessary in order that the court might be apprised of its duty in the premises, but it also was ambiguous in context. The request to \u201cexclude all unauthorized persons from the courtroom\u201d failed to designate with certainty the persons to be excluded. As framed, the request immediately prompts two inquiries, i.e., (1) persons unauthorized to do what? and (2) persons unauthorized by whom? The immediate reaction of the magistrate to this request indicated that he believed the defendant was directing his attention to the exclusion of witnesses. The latter\u2019s subsequent claim that he was entitled to a private hearing, without reference to the basis therefor, was not sufficient to remove the uncertainty existent in his motion. If it had been granted, and if the court had ordered \u201call unauthorized persons\u201d to leave the courtroom, the meaningless character of the order would have become apparent immediately in any attempt to direct the bailiff to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The dismissal of the original complaint did not bar the filing of a second complaint involving the same or a similar offense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prewitt, </em>52 Cal.2d 330, 340 [341 P.2d 1] ; <em>Ex parte Fenton, </em>77 Cal. 183 [19 P. 267] <em>; People </em>v. <em>White, </em>180 Cal.App.2d 99, 103 [4 Cal.Rptr. 261].) We do not eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>sider that the second complaint charging the offense of burglary, rather than the offense of robbery, had any significant effect either upon the validity of the proceedings taken at the first hearing, the right of the defendant to a private hearing after proper request therefor, or his further prosecution for any offense encompassed within the robbery incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The defendant\u2019s contention that he was denied due process of law and that the court erred in refusing to dismiss the present proceedings because the magistrate in the first hearing, in response to his insufficiently expressed request, did not exclude from the courtroom all persons except those enumerated in section 868 of the Penal Code, is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">However, the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in sentencing him to the state prison for the crime of robbery and the crime of burglary, each arising out of the same transaction, is meritorious. The defendant\u2019s action in entering the subject store with intent to rob the proprietor and thereupon completing the act of robbery, constitutes a continuous course of conduct for which only one punishment may be imposed. <em>(Neal </em>v. <em>State, </em>55 Cal.2d 11 [9 Cal.Rptr. 607, 357 P.2d 839]; <em>In re Dowding, </em>188 Cal. App.2d 418 [10 Cal.Rptr. 392].) Under these circumstances, that part of the judgment imposing sentence for the lesser offense should be stricken, while that part of the judgment imposing a sentence for the greater offense should be sustained. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chessman, </em>52 Cal.2d 467 [341 P.2d 679]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Logan, </em>41 Cal.2d 279, 290-291 [260 P.2d 20]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Knowles, </em>35 Cal.2d 175, 187 [217 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The judgment appealed from is modified by striking therefrom that part thereof directing that the defendant be imprisoned for the offense of burglary, and as modified is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Griffin, P. J., and Shepard, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The following is a transcript of the proceedings had at the time in question;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOhA\">\u201cMr. Mueller [defense counsel]; May the record show at this time before I begin to cross examine that after my motion there are still numerous people in the courtroom, and the motion was denied and there are still unauthorized persons in the courtroom and all witnesses are apparently present at the hearing and in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQa\">\u201cMr. Kurilieh [deputy district attorney]: I will object to the statement that the witnesses are present.

Maybe I am wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3r\">\u201cMr. Mueller: The witness has already testified, and if the record will show that I have made the motion, I will move that the charges against the defendant be dismissed at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8B\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\u201cMr. Kurilich: In relation to that motion, at no time was a request made to remove any witnesses by counsel.

All others, including the witnesses who are not testifying, would be unauthorized persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALr\">\u201cMr. Kurilich: I would only say that I would have to see the case that says that.
