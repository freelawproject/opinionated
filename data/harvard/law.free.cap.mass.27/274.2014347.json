Holst, a minor, a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was issued to Hammond, a member of the society of shakers at Harvard, commanding him to bring the minor into court. Hammond made a return upon the writ, that the minor was a legitimate child, of the age of eleven years and a half; that her father was deceased ; that before the letters of guardianship were granted to Tufts, the mother of the child (being then and still a widow) had committed her to the respondent, on a verbal contract for her support and education until she should arrive at twenty-one years of age, during which period she was to render to the respondent reasonable services ; and that she had not been at any time imprisoned or in any manner unreasonably restrained or deprived of her liberty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">It was conceded that the child had not been ill-treated, and that she was desirous of remaining with the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\"><em>W. T. Andrews </em>contended that the making of the contract was an abuse of the power of a guardian by nature ; that the judge of probate had authority to appoint a guardian to the child, and that such guardian was entitled to the custody of the person of his ward. 1 Bl.

That is not the case in the present instance ; and the order of the Court therefore is, that the child be at liberty to remain in the charge of the respondent, or to go at large, as she may elect.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
