But we think that he did not continue in the same relation to the note. He made a new engagement, and he had a right so to do. It is also said, that if the indorsement had been in blank, the holder might have filled it up with an obligation on the part of the defendant to be a surety ; but here the defendant himself filled ip the indorsement with an engagement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>guaranty merely. The sureties were in effect principals, so f\"ar as regards the guarantor. The law raises no implied promise on the part of a guarantor to contribute in the case of a surety\u2019s paying the note, as it does on the part of a co-surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
