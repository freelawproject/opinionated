Wherefore' the petitioner prayed that a new trial might be granted as to him, in order that he might have an opportunity of availing himself of the testimony of Bryant, for the purpose of proving the prior attachment made by the petitioner.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b24-8\">\n<em>Sept. 28th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7K\">Bryant, being now sworn, testified that before Merrill\u2019s attachment, he went with the petitioner into the barn where the hay was, and that the petitioner attached it and appointed the witness a keeper of it. On cross-examination he answered that he did not see the petitioner touch the hay, but that the petitioner said he attached it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ao7\"><em>Bigelow </em>and <em>Brooks, </em>for the petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1D\">considered this application as similar to a petition for a new trial on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of newly discovered evidence.

Ashmun, contr\u00e0.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN0\">There has been no discovery of evidence since the trial. The petitioner was prevented by the rules of law from using the testimony of Bryant at the trial, and he must now ask the Court to set aside those rules. It is a universal rule, that a party to the record, even though not interested, cannot be a witness unless by consent. <em>Nason </em>v. <em>Thacher, 7 </em>Mass. R. 398 ; <em>Fox </em>v. Whitney, 16 Mass. R. 118; <em>Adams </em>v. Leland, 7 Pick. 62 ; <em>Frear </em>v. <em>Evartson, </em>20 Johns.

If it prevails, then in cases of tort against numerous defendants, each may be acquitted in turn and be used as a witness in the succeeding trial, and there will be as many trials as there are defendants, in consequence of the operation of the rule of law that a party shall not be a witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b25-5\">A new trial cannot be granted in a civil case, where one defendant is acquitted and another convicted, unless it is granted as to both. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Spark, </em>12 Mod. 275; <em>Berrington\u2019s case, </em>3 Salk. 362 ; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Godin, </em>2 Str. 814 ; Bul.

The witness was originally a party to the record, but upon his acquittal he ceased to be so ; he would therefore now be a competent witness. Bul. N. P. 285 ; <em>Ward v. Haydon, </em>2 Esp.

The petitioner would put it on the ground of newly discovered evidence ; but that is incorrect. It is the case of an incompetent witness having become competent. To grant the petition would be to make every case of a witness\u2019s becoming competent, a ground for a new trial. After a trial, it is generally easy to find some additional or cumulative evidence ; but the rule is, that there shall not be a new trial, unless it is newly discovered evidence, and to some new point or ground of action or defence, to which the evidence given on the former trial did not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">It is not pretended in the case before us, that the petitioner was not aware, at the time of the trial, of the evidence of which he now seeks an opportunity to avail himself upon a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">A party to the record cannot be a witness for a co-defendant ;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but in an action of tort against several the court may direct the trial of one of them first, when it appears that there is no substantial evidence against him, and if acquitted he may be a witness for the other defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether such course shall be pursued, must necessarily be a question to the discretion of the judge at nisi prius.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">But a decisive reason against granting this application is, that upon a new trial, the petitioner could not avail himself of the testimony in question. If the verdict is set aside, the case must come to trial just as it did before, against both of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ants. This rule is clear in civil actions. Bac. Abr. Trial, <em>L </em>; 2 Dunlap\u2019s Pr. 681. The Court think it is the proper rule, and if this verdict should be set aside, Bryant would be put on his trial again, after having been acquitted. There is one case where of three defendants in an action of trespass, two were acquitted and the third convicted, and a new trial was granted ; but this was with the consent of those who were acquitted. <em>Leroux's </em>case, cited 6 T.
