Upon a case stated it appeared that Samuel Chandler, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, sailed from Boston about the 15th of September, 1826, for one of the West India islands or elsewhere and a market, and that he has not been heard from since that time. He left money in the hands of one Mycall, his attorney and agent,'who on April 7th, 1828, at Newburyport, lent the same to one Smith, taking therefor the note now in suit, signed by Smith and by the defendant as his surety, payable to Chandler or bis order on demand. Letters of administration upon Chandler\u2019s estate were granted to the plaintiff in August 1829.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b534-8\">JVb\u00bb. 18&lt;Zi.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqAu\"><em>Gerrish, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACO\">contended that Chandler must be presumed either to have died within one year from the time he left Boston, and in that case the note was taken after My-call\u2019s authority to lend the money and take the note had terminated ; or to be still living, seven years not having elapsed since he sailed, and then the action should have been brought in his own name. <em>Doe </em>v.

The burden was upon the defendant to prove that he was dead at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">It is said, however, that if the presumption of Chandler\u2019s death cannot arise until after the lapse of seven years, the plaintiff had no right to sue as his administrator. But in this point of view the fact of thoe death does not stand on a presumption, but on an adjudication of the probate court. \u2022 That court could not grant administration without being satisfied that Chandler was dead, and so long as the letters of administration stand unrecalled, they are evidence of the death. There might be a question as to the effect which would be produced upon the action by his returning alive, but that point it is not necessary to consider. The letters of administration are conclusive proof of his death, as the case stands.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the defendant intended to contest that fact, he should have filed a plea in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\n<em>Defendant defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-5\"> See <em>Spurr </em>v. <em>Trimble, </em>1 Marshall, (Ken.) 278; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>Hardin, 479; <em>Innis </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>1 Rawle, 373 ; <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>2 Bay, 476; <em>Wambough </em>v. <em>Schank, </em>Pennington, 229; <em>M'Comb </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>5 Johns.
