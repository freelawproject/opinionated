Plympton <em>versus </em>Lemuel Cutler.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b271-8\">The defendant, after having been summoned as trustee in an action brought by M,' against C., made a note for the sum due from him to C., and being desirous of having the note set off against a debt due to himself from M., C. and the defendant deposited it with a third person, to hold until they should have an opportunity of mak ing a settlement with M., when they would direct die depositary to deliver it to one of the three. No such settlement was made with M. ; who afterwards obtained judgment and took out an execution, which was satisfied in part only by C., but no demand upon it was ever made on the defendant as trustee. C. died, and his estate was represented insolvent; and some years after the issuing of M.\u2019s execution, the depositary, upon a demand made, delivered the note to C.\u2019s administrator. It was <em>held, </em>that the administrator had a right to the note, and an action upon it, brought by him against the defendant, was sustained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">Assumpsit by the administrator of G. Cooper, on a note made by the defendant to the intestate.

M.\u2018Intire. Upon this judgment an execution had been issued, but had not been returned. The officer who had the execution, testified that it had been satisfied only in a small part; that he made no return on it; and that he did not know whether he had ever called upon the trustee, the present defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-9\">The person who wrote the note, testified that it was given upon a settlement between the intestate and the defendant, for a balance due from the defendant; that it was given after the service of the trustee writ upon the defendant, and before the rendition of the judgment; that when it was given, it was stated by the parties to it, that M\u2018Intire was indebted to the defendant, and it was the defendant\u2019s desire that the debt which he owed to the intestate should be set off against the debt which M'lntire owed the defendant, and they both stated that M\u2018Intire had agreed to make the set-off. The intestate and the defendant then put the note into the witness\u2019s hands to hold till they could have an opportunity to settle with M\u2018In-tire, when they would direct him to give the note either to the intestate, or to the defendant, or to M\u2018Intire. The intestate died insolvent, and upon a representation to the judge of probate, commissioners of insolvency were appointed. The plaintiff demanded the note of the witness, who delivered it to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-10\">The defendant was defaulted ; and if upon these facts the plaintiff was entitled to recover, judgment was to be rendered upon the default; otherwise the plaintiff was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b272-7\"><em>Oct. 15th, </em>1829.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-11\"><em>T. </em>Fuller, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMg\">urged that the judgment in favor of M'Intire still subsists and may be enforced against the defendant as trustee. <em>Perkins </em>v.

But neither of these facts appears. Whether the defendant was charged as trustee in M\u2018Intire\u2019s suit, is not stated; nor does it appear that the judgment in favor of M\u2018Intire against the intestate has been satisfied or discharged. On the contrary, a part of the money was raised on the execution, out of the effects, we suppose, of the intestate. Nor is there any discharge of the defendant\u2019s demand against M\u2018Intire. The whole transaction was unfinished and incomplete ; and when the note in suit was given, it was left in the hands of a third person, to be delivered to one or other of the parties after a settlement with M\u2018Intire. No such settlement has taken place. The administrator of the intestate, therefore, has a right to the note and to this action upon it. The defendant\u2019s demand against M\u2018Intire remains in force ; and MTntire must look to the estate for his demand against the intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\n<em>Judgment for plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
