The land was formerly owned by one Eddy and fifteen other persons, who constituted a manufacturing corporation, and\" who conveyed to the defendant their shares in the stock of the corporation, embracing, as it was supposed, the land in question ; but in fact, the land belonged to them as tenants in common, and therefore did not pass by the transfer of their shares. Subsequently to the defendant\u2019s conveyance to the plaintiffs, Eddy entered upon the land for the purpose of regaining seisin and possession to the use of himself and others as tenants in common ; whereupon the plaintiffs yielded the possession, and afterwards paid divers sums to the original proprietors for the purpose of obtaining from them acquittances of their interests in the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">An auditor, appointed in the case, to ascertain the amount of damages, made a report, which came before the Court at this term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-7\">The plaintiffs presented before the auditor three classes of claims.
