It was admitted before the justice, that on the same first of April the petitioner took the oath prescribed by the act of Congress, 1825, c. 65, \u00a7 2, (by which proceeding he was constituted an assistant postmaster at South Oxford,) and that from that time until the day when he was summoned to appear before the justice, he occasionally, and in the absence of the postmaster, performed the duties of postmaster in South Oxford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">The alleged error was, that the justice did not consider the petitioner\u2019s being appointed and acting as assistant postmaster, a sufficient defence to the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAr\">The act of Congress, 1792, c. 33, \u00a7 2, exempts from militia duty, \u201c all post-officers, and stage^drivers who are employed in the care and conveyance of the mail.\u201d The act of Congress, 1825, c. 65, \u00a7 35, provides, \u201c that the postmasters, post-riders and drivers of the mail-stages shall be exempt from militia duty.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\n<em>Barton</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6Y\">contended that the petitioner was exempted by the first statute, and the subsequent statute was merely cumulative.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-4\">Prentiss, for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2x\">urged that an assistant \u201c postmaster is not exempted by the act of Congress of 1792; and further, that the provision in that statute is virtually repealed,' or at least has received a legislative construction from the act of 1825.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b163-19\">\n<em>Oct. 13th</em>\n</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b163-5\">The <em>Court</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ayl\">were of opinion that the clause, exempting \u201c postmasters, post-riders and stage-drivers who are employed in the care and transportation of the mail,\u201d does not include assistant postmasters ; and that taking this clause in connexion with the 42d section of the statute of 1825, in which assistant postmasters are named and precluded from being concerned in any contract for the conveyance of the mail, it was clear that they were not intended to be exempted from militia duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>Petitioner takes nothing.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-14\"> See Revised Stat. c. 12, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
