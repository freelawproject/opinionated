He then proceeds, \u2014 \u201c To my sons &amp;c. (enumerating all his children and the widows and heirs of his deceased children) I give and bequeath all my personal estate after deducting what I have given to my wife Lucy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Bardwell and paying my debts, to be divided equally among them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">The testator then devises the residue of his real estate, including the reversion of his widow\u2019s third, to his children and grandchildren.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-10\">On the 15th of December, 1829, the judge of probate for the county of Franklin passed a decree allowing an account, presented by the executor of the will ; from which decree two of the testator\u2019s children appealed, because the judge allowed the executor $292-18 for personal property delivered to the widow, that sum being one third of all the personal estate in the possession of the testator at the time of his decease, without regard to the debts due from the estate, incidental expenses and charges of administration ; whereas, by the will, the widow was only entitled to one third after the payment of those debts, expenses and charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-11\">In the account the executor is charged with $1064-93, and is credited with $829-71, which sum includes the debts paid and the personal property delivered to the widow. The debts still due are less than $ 200, and the executor has recovered possession of mortgaged land to the amount of $341-66 and costs.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b28-6\">\n<em>Sept 29th.</em>\n</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b28-12\"><em>Wells, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5n\">The legacy to the wife was only of one third of the personal property remaining after the payment of debts and charges of administration ; otherwise the real estate might be charged with the debts, to the exemption of the personal estate. Doubtful words are not to be so construed as to produce this effect; and courts lean against holding legacies to be specific. <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>8 Ves. 410 ; <em>Chaworth </em>v. <em>Beech, </em>4 Ves. 555 ; <em>Innes v. Johnson, </em>ibid. 568 ; <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>ibid. 748 ; <em>Beaver </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>14 Mass. R. 83 ; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>6 Mass. R. 151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b28-13\">The bequest to the wife has none of the characteristics of a specific legacy. No specific article is given, nor does the clause refer at all to the property belonging to the testator at the time of making the will. The fair construction is, that the testator intended to give his wife only what the law would have given her. <em>Sibley </em>v. Perry, 7 Ves. 522 ; <em>Purse </em>v. <em>Snaplin, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>1 Atk. 417 ; <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>7 Johns. Ch. R. 258 ; 4 Bac. Abr. 425, <em>Legacies. G; Inchiquin </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>l Wils. 82.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b29-4\">\n<em>H. G. Newcomb, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKQ\">The legacy at least partakes of the character of a specific legacy. 2 Mad. Ch. Pr. 7, 8 ; <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Camelford, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 160 ; <em>Selwood </em>v. <em>Mildmay, </em>3 Ves. 310 ; <em>Chaworth </em>v. <em>Beech, </em>4 Ves. 555 ; <em>Murray v. Nisbett, </em>5 Ves. 149 ; <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Walton, 7 </em>Johns. Ch. R. 262 ; <em>Sayer v. Sayer, 2 </em>Vern. 688 ; <em>Andrews v. Hunneman, </em>6 Pick. 126.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-5\">But whether it was a specific legacy or not is immaterial, if the intention was to give the wife one third of the personal estate before the payment of the debts, and if such third was not wanted for that purpose. Here two thirds of the personal assets are more than sufficient to pay the debts, and taking the whole instrument together, it is clearly the intention that the wife should have one third free from any deduction. <em>Annable </em>v. <em>Patch, </em>3 Pick. 363.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b29-11\">\n<em>Oct. ish</em>\n</otherdate>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-6\">Putnam J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0b\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Whether the decree of the judge of probate should be affirmed or not, depends upon the true construction of the will, in regard to the appropriation or disposition of the personal estate ; and we are to look into the various provisions of the will to ascertain the intent of the testator. The question is, whether the one third of the personal estate given to the wife is to be taken before the debts shall have been paid, from the whole personal estate, or whether the debts are to be first deducted. If there were no other disposition by the testator, the whole personal estate would be subject to the payment of the debts. But we think that the testator has made a different appropriation. He gave to his wife one third absolutely, and to his children and others all his personal estate, with certain exceptions and deductions ; viz. from that part was to be deducted what he had given to his wife, and also the amount of his debts. The rest was to be equally divided between them. The words <em>and paying my debts, </em>are indicative of an intention on the part of the testator, that the legatees should take the bequest upon condition that they would apply the amount of the property given to them, in payment of his just debts, so far as it would extend, before they should take any part of it for their own use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Now in point of fact, two thirds of the personal estate are suffic*ent t0 pay ah the debts, without resorting to the one third given to the wife ; so that there will be something to be divided among the children and others, to whom the personal property was given after the payment of the debts. But if that were otherwise, and there would be no residuum after payment of the debts, we think it would make no difference in the decision. The testator intended to give one third of his personal property, without limitation or restriction, to his wife for her own use ; but the bequest of the residue was subjected to deductions and charges, as well of his debts as of the third part before given to his wife.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-11\"> See <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Hosford, </em>22 Pick. 288</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
