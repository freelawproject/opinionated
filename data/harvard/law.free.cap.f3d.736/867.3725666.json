The Appellant\u2019s unopposed motion for filing costs in the amount of $805.00 is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) instructs that this court \u201cshall\u201d grant attorneys fees to a prevailing plaintiff \u201cunless\u201d the government meets its burden to demonstrate that both its litigation position and the agency decision on review were \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(a); <em>Thangaraja v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 870 (9th Cir.2005). Further, this court has stated that, it \u201cwill be only a decidedly unusual case in which there is substantial justification under the EAJA even though the agency\u2019s decision was reversed as lacking in reasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">The dissent asserts that the case <em>Meier v. Colvin </em>requires us to award attorneys\u2019 fees in this case. In <em>Meier v. Colvin, </em>an ALJ denied Meier social security benefits and the district court affirmed the ALJ. 727 F.3d 867, 869 (9th Cir.2013). This court reversed and remanded for an award of benefits in an unpublished memorandum disposition, holding that the ALJ failed to offer specific reasons supported by substantial evidence for rejecting a treating physician\u2019s opinion that Meier could not work. <em>Id. </em>Meier then moved for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and the district court denied the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">This court clarified that in the social security context, \u201cthe position of the United States includes both the government\u2019s litigation position and the underlying agency action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 870 (internal citations omitted). The court then looked at the decision of the ALJ to determine whether the government\u2019s position in the underlying action was substantially justified. <em>Id. </em>at 871. The court noted that its previous memorandum disposition held that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence including any specific and legitimate reasons for rejecting the physician\u2019s opinion and Meier\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 872. The court then reiterated that holding an \u201cagency\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence is a strong indication that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Because the ALJ\u2019s decision was not substantially justified, the court held it need not address whether the government\u2019s litigation position was substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">While <em>Meier </em>and the instant case are similar, in <em>Meier, </em>the claimant relied on his own testimony, and a physician\u2019s testimony, that he was <em>presently </em>disabled. Here, the ALJ had to determine whether Campbell was disabled in the <em>past. </em>In this case, the ALJ had to determine whether Campbell\u2019s multiple sclerosis rendered her disabled by June 30, 1996. The ALJ did not have any records from 1996 to examine. Instead, the ALJ had medical records from 1989 and 2000. The ALJ also had to consider circumstantial evidence that Campbell cared for her children and worked during that time, which justified doubts that Campbell was fully disabled. While the ALJ erred in her determination, the fact that she was trying to extrapolate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>what Campbell\u2019s injury may have been in 1996 from other evidence regarding a disease which may worsen at varying rates leads this court to conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The dissent acknowledges that \u201cin <em>Meier, </em>the question was whether the applicant was <em>presently </em>disabled, whereas here, the question was whether Campbell was disabled on the last date insured.\u201d Dissent at 870. While this circuit has been clear that when an agency\u2019s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence it is a strong indication that the position of the United States is not substantially justified, this circuit has never stated that <em>every </em>time this court reverses and remands the ALJ\u2019s decision for lack of substantial evidence the claimant should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The difference between examining current medical records to make a decision about a present condition and extrapolating from medical records to make a decision about a past condition distinguishes this case from <em>Meier. </em>The instant case is one of the \u201cunusual\u201d cases where attorneys\u2019 fees should not be awarded under the EAJA. In this case there was not enough evidence to uphold a decision, but enough to find the government\u2019s position was substantially justified.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b895-7\">WARD LAW, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A5M\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party in this social security disability benefits case. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) instructs that we \u201cshall\u201d grant attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing plaintiff \u201cunless\u201d the government meets its burden to demonstrate that both its litigation position and the agency decision on review were \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(a); <em>Thangaraja v. Gonzales, </em>428 F.3d 870 (9th Cir.2005). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cCongress enacted EAJA in 1980\u2018to eliminate the barriers that prohibit ... individuals from securing vindication of their rights in civil actions and administrative proceedings brought by or against the- Federal Government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 406, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96-1005, p. 9) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Congressional Findings and Purposes, 94 Stat. 2325, note following 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 (\u201cIt is the purpose of this title ... to diminish the deterrent effect of seeking review of, or defending against, governmental action ....\u201d) (discussing earlier iteration of the EAJA).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Here, we held that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) conclusion that Campbell had failed to demonstrate that she was disabled as of June 30, 1996, the last date she was insured, failed to survive the extremely deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard of review. That the agency\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence is a \u201cstrong indication\u201d that the government\u2019s position was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d for purposes of the EAJA. <em>Thangaraja, </em>428 F.3d at 874. As we explained in <em>Thangaraja, </em>it \u201cwill be only a decidedly unusual case in which there is substantial justification under the EAJA even though the agency\u2019s decision was reversed as lacking in reasonable, substantial and probative evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citation omitted); <em>cf. Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>284 F.3d 1080, 1085 (9th Cir.2002) (denying attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA in agency action because we <em>upheld </em>\u201cthe government\u2019s central positions,\u201d even though we reversed the agency decision on review).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">This is not such an unusual case. In the circumstances here, where Campbell un-disputedly had multiple sclerosis, which was undisputedly capable of producing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>symptoms she reported, the law required the ALJ to credit Campbell\u2019s testimony about those symptoms unless there was some evidence of \u201cmalingering\u201d or clear and convincing evidence contradicting her statements. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th. Cir.1996). This law was clearly established well before Campbell\u2019s proceedings began, and it is straightforwardly applicable here. As even the state\u2019s doctor agreed, there is no evidence that Campbell was a malingerer, and the ALJ did not so find. Accordingly, the ALJ should have credited Campbell\u2019s testimony unless there was clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. As we unanimously concluded, there was none.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">When the ALJ asked Campbell to describe her symptoms \u201cbetween 1995 and 1996,\u201d Campbell testified that in addition to her generally progressive symptoms, she experienced eight to ten \u201cexacer-bations\u201d per year, each lasting up to two weeks, during which her fatigue and weakness worsened. She testified that it was difficult to get out of bed; that at times, she had to crawl to reach the bathroom; that she was unable to walk without support and \u201cscooted on her butt\u201d to go down stairs; that she was unable to perform tasks like making her bed, vacuuming, sweeping, mopping, or even holding a pen; and that she stopped curling her hair because it required \u201ctoo much energy.\u201d The ALJ rejected not only this testimony, but also that of Campbell\u2019s treating and examining physicians whose medical opinions supported Campbell\u2019s testimony because a third non-treating doctor, the state\u2019s witness, said that he was unsure when Campbell became fully disabled, despite his stated opinion that Campbell was likely fully disabled as of \u201csometime between '95 and '98,\u201d a range which obviously <em>includes, </em>and does not exclude, the date of June 30,1996. In other words, <em>not a single physician </em>contradicted Campbell\u2019s description of her disability as of her last date insured. When the ALJ presented a vocational specialist with a hypothetical incorporating just six periods of exacerbation, not the actual eight to ten periods Campbell experienced in 1995 and 1996, the specialist unequivocally stated that a person experiencing such symptoms would be unable to perform work in the national economy. The Commissioner was not \u201csubstantially justified\u201d in failing to apply the clearly established law that compelled the result we reached in this case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). Nor was the government justified in defending the agency\u2019s erroneous decision through multiple stages of litigation at taxpayer expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">That the ALJ\u2019s decision was not substantially justified is further underscored by our recent opinion in <em>Meier v. Colvin, </em>727 F.3d 867 (9th Cir.2013), where we held that a district court abused its discretion by denying attorney\u2019s fees under the EAJA in remarkably analogous circumstances. There,- as here, the panel had previously issued an unpublished disposition reversing the district court\u2019s decision affirming an ALJ\u2019s denial of social security benefits. There, an ALJ improperly rejected a Social Security applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his subjective pain symptoms without clear and convincing reasons. The main difference between the two appeals is that in <em>Meier, </em>the question was whether the applicant was <em>presently </em>disabled, whereas here, the question was whether Campbell was disabled on the last date insured. I disagree with my colleagues that this difference bears on whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was substantially justified, where all the testimonial evidence, including that of the state\u2019s doctor, whose testimony was credited by the ALJ, supported Campbell\u2019s claim of disability as of the date last insured. Moreover, the government and Campbell en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tered into a Joint Stipulation in which the government <em>agreed </em>that Campbell was \u201caffirmatively diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (\u2018MS\u2019) in 1989\u201d after experiencing symptoms for years prior, and that the lack of medical records between the years 1989 and 2000 was \u201cdue to her lack of medical insurance.\u201d That Campbell did not have records for 1996, presumably because she could not afford to pay medical bills, does not substantially justify the government\u2019s litigation position; indeed, it turns the safety net intended to be created by the provision of disability benefits on its head. When we ruled in Campbell\u2019s favor, we concluded that there were <em>no </em>clear and convincing reasons not to credit Campbell\u2019s testimony, so the ALJ should have credited it. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281. We concluded that the ALJ acted improperly by rejecting Campbell\u2019s testimony about the frequency and duration of her exacerbations. We found that had the ALJ properly credited Campbell\u2019s testimony, he would have had to find that her MS rendered her disabled as of June 30, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Our precedent requires us to grant Campbell\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees under these circumstances. Moreover, neither Campbell nor her attorney should be made to bear the burden of the ALJ\u2019s egregious error, and the government\u2019s zealous defense of it. Congress enacted the EAJA to prevent precisely such outcomes.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
