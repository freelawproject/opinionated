Castro entered a written agreement with the United States to plead guilty to several counts of his indictment, but Castro renounced his agreement on the morning of his change of plea hearing. After the district court advised Castro that, \u201cif you don\u2019t plead today!,] [the government] may charge you with other things that will make your sentence even more severe,\u201d Castro entered pleas of guilty in accordance with his plea agreement. We initially granted Castro relief under our precedents that established a rule of automatic vacatur for judicial participation in plea discussions, but we <em>sua sponte </em>vacated our earlier opinion and granted rehearing of this appeal after the Supreme Court abrogated that rule in <em>United States v. Davila, </em>569 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013). Under <em>Davila, </em>we must consider \u201cthe full record\u201d and determine \u201cwhether it was reasonably probable that, but for the ... [single comment of the district court], [Castro] would have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2150. We ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing how to resolve this appeal in the light of <em>Davila, </em>and they did so. Because the record does not establish that, but for the comment of the district court, Castro would have exercised his right to trial, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1335-22\">A grand jury returned a 14-count indictment that charged Castro for five counts of possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), one count of possessing with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), (b)(1)(D), two counts of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), four counts of possessing a firearm in violation of a court order, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(8), 924(a)(2), one count of possessing a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>with an obliterated serial number, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(k), and one count of dealing in firearms without a license, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), 924(a)(1)(D). A magistrate judge appointed the federal public defender to represent Castro at his initial appearance, but Castro later retained a private attorney, Richard Castillo. At his arraignment hearing, Castro entered a plea of not guilty to each charge in his indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-3\">Castro later negotiated a written plea agreement with the United States and signed the agreement a few minutes before his change of plea hearing on January 25, 2012. During the plea colloquy, Castro told the district court that he was under the influence of \u201cmedication\u201d and it affected his ability to reason or think. Attorney Castillo said that Castro\u2019s response was the \u201cfirst time that [he had] heard from Mr. Castro today that he was having an issue with the medication as to his ability to understand what was going on with the proceedings,\u201d and Castillo requested additional time to confer with Castro. After Castillo spoke with Castro and \u201cstill [had] some reservations as to his ability to comprehend everything,\u201d Castillo requested a delay to determine \u201cwhat [Castro had been] taking because when ... sp[eaking] with him [two nights earlier] until about 11:00, [counsel] didn\u2019t detect any issues with him comprehending\u201d the plea agreement. The district court continued Castro\u2019s change of plea hearing for two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-4\">On February 7, 2012, three days before his change of plea hearing resumed, Castro again signed a plea agreement with the United States. Castro agreed to plead guilty to seven charges: two counts of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), one count of possessing with intent to distribute marijuana and cocaine, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), (b)(1)(D), one count of carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1), two counts of possessing a firearm in violation of a court order, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(8), 924(a)(2), and one count of dealing in firearms without a license, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(1)(A), 924(a)(1)(D). In exchange, the United States agreed to dismiss the seven remaining charges and to recommend that Castro receive reductions to his sentence that corresponded with his acceptance of responsibility and his level of cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1336-7\">On the morning of his change of plea hearing, Castro notified Attorney Castillo that he did not want to plead guilty. At the hearing, Castillo announced that Castro did not want to change his plea to guilty; Castro was dissatisfied with Castillo\u2019s representation; and Castro wanted the district court to appoint him a new attorney from the public defender\u2019s office. The district court questioned Castro, who confirmed that he did not want to plead guilty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\">THE COURT: Is this your wish, you did not want to go forward with the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-8\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-9\">THE COURT: Is it still your wish that you don\u2019t want Mr. Castillo to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I can\u2019t pay him anymore, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-11\">THE COURT: This means that you don\u2019t want him to represent you? THE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah0\">DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-12\">THE COURT: I guess I could appoint the public defender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1336-13\">At Castillo\u2019s request, the district court advised Castro of the consequences of reneging on his plea agreement. Castro decided to plead guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1336-14\">MR. CASTILLO: I just need Mr. Castro [to] understand that if he doesn\u2019t resolve the matter today that the gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>ernment [intends] to withdraw whatever plea offer has been conveyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-5\">THE COURT: Do you understand that the government has made you a plea offer in which they have made certain concessions, that if you don\u2019t plead today they may charge you with other things that will make your sentence even more severe? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-7\">THE COURT: And you still want to go ahead with a public defender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-8\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-9\">THE COURT: Who do you want to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-10\">THE DEFENDANT: I\u2019ll just finish with Mr. Castillo then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-11\">THE COURT: Do you want to plead today then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-13\">At the direction of the district court, Castro signed another copy of the plea agreement. Castro identified the written agreement, which stated that he agreed to \u201center[] into the Plea Agreement freely and voluntarily, and no threats or promises, other than the promises contained in this ... Agreement, were made to induce [him] to enter his plea of guilty.\u201d Castro verified that he understood the seven charges to which he was pleading guilty; the potential sentence for each offense; the rights attendant to trial that he was waiving by pleading guilty; and that he had the \u201cright to plea[d] not guilty ... and to persist in the plea.\u201d Castro also acknowledged that he had not been coerced to plead guilty and that he could not withdraw his pleas of guilty if he was dissatisfied with the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-14\">THE COURT: Has anyone attempted in any way to force you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhR\">THE DEFENDANT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-15\">THE COURT: Do you understand that any sentence the Court renders will be influenced by the advisory sentencing guidelines and no one knows exactly what those guidelines will provide at this time. But that you may not withdraw your plea if the Court should sentence you to a term larger than you are now expecting, you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1337-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1337-18\">Castro acknowledged that the government could prove the facts proffered in his plea agreement. The proffer stated that undercover officers visited Castro\u2019s rental property in Loxahatchee, Florida, to investigate reports that he was operating a brothel with women who had been smuggled into the United States. During the visit, Castro bragged to the undercover officers that he controlled a grow house that would produce 60 to 70 pounds of marijuana. The undercover officers returned to Castro\u2019s rental property on several occasions and recorded eight transactions in which they purchased more than 1,000 grams of marijuana, several grams of cocaine, 12 firearms, and large quantities of ammunition. All of the firearms had been stolen from a single location in Miami-Dade County. Although Castro was prohibited in a restraining order from possessing firearms and ammunition, Castro displayed on his waistband a black semiautomatic pistol and showed the undercover officers an AK-47 style assault rifle and a .22 caliber rifle during his first two drug transactions. After agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Castro on the rental property, the agents searched the property and seized three firearms, various types of ammunition, marijuana and cocaine, and approximately $1,000 in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1337-19\">Castro told the district court that he had reviewed his written plea agreement \u201ctoday\u201d in Spanish with the assistance of a translator. When asked how he wanted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>plead to the charges, Castro responded, \u201cGuilty.\u201d The district court found that Castro\u2019s \u201cplea of guilty [was] a knowing and voluntary plea supported by an independent basis in fact containing each of the essential elements of the offense,\u201d and the district court accepted Castro\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-4\">Castro\u2019s presentence investigation report provided an advisory guideline range between 87 and 108 months of imprisonment. In the meantime, Castro hired a new attorney to represent him at sentencing, Richard Della Fera. Della Fera filed an objection to Castro\u2019s presentence report that requested that the district court vary downward from the advisory range and sentence Castro to a term of home confinement followed by supervised release. The government responded that Castro had benefitted considerably from his plea arrangement and requested that the district court sentence Castro to 158 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-5\">The district court sentenced Castro to 156 months of imprisonment. The district court based its decision on evidence that Castro was \u201crunning brothels with immigrant prostitutes\u201d; had \u201c[e]ight instances of domestic violence\u201d; and had not \u201cfiled any tax returns\u201d despite making \u201cmoney in various businesses.\u201d The district court also mentioned that \u201cthe government [had been] very generous in [dismissing a second charge for carrying a firearm], which would have added 25 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-6\">Eight days after he was sentenced, Castro moved <em>pro se </em>to withdraw his pleas of guilty and to dismiss Della Fera as counsel. In the motion, Castro \u201cexpressed his displeasure with ... Della Fera, and his sentence and [he] desire[d] to withdraw[ ] his plea [for] which [he] was sentence[d] to 156 months.\u201d The district court denied Castro\u2019s motion after \u201chaving reviewed the pertinent portions of the record and being duly advised in the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-7\">Castro then retained a third attorney, Allen Stewart Kaufman, who filed a motion for reconsideration arguing that Castro was entitled to withdraw his plea of guilty. Castro argued that he was \u201cdenied his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment\u201d because \u201cof the misrepresentations of [Paul] Lazarus ... regarding his ability to represent [Castro] in federal court.\u201d According to Castro, attorney Lazarus accepted a retainer; \u201cconvinced [Castro] that [his case] could [be] resolve[d] ... by way of a plea agreement\u201d; negotiated a plea agreement with the government; and persuaded Castro to plead guilty despite his misapprehensions about the \u201cjail time [being] excessive.\u201d Castro also argued that his plea was unknowing and involuntary because he suffered from \u201cmany maladies,\u201d ranging from gout and alcohol dependence to kidney and heart disease and, because of those illnesses \u201cand medications, his frame of mind was such that he was unable to think clearly and rationally with regard to pleading guilty.\u201d The district court denied Castro\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-8\">Castro appealed and, for the first time, argued that the district court participated in plea discussions, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1). The United States responded that the district court could not have interfered with plea negotiations because Castro had already executed a written plea agreement. We concluded that Castro\u2019s appeal was controlled by our holding in <em>United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1177-79 (11th Cir.1995), that the district court violated the prohibition against judicial participation by advising the defendant of the consequences of renouncing his plea agreement, and we vacated Castro\u2019s pleas of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1338-9\">After the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Davila, </em>we <em>sua sponte </em>vacated our earlier opinion and granted rehearing of the appeal. In a separate order, we in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>structed the parties to file supplemental briefs. Castro argues that he is entitled to a vacatur of his pleas of guilty because \u201c[i]t is obvious\u201d that the comment of the district court swayed him to plead guilty, as evidenced by his decision to plead guilty on the heels of the judicial participation. The United States responds that Davila cannot satisfy his burden, under review for plain error, to prove \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the one intemperate remark ..., he would have gone to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-5\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-6\">When a defendant fails to object to an alleged violation of Rule 11(c)(1), we review the alleged violation for plain error. <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2147; <em>United States v. Brown, </em>526 F.3d 691, 704 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. granted and judgment vacated on a different ground, </em>556 U.S. 1150, 129 S.Ct. 1668, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2009). Plain error occurs when the district court commits an error that is plain, affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Under this standard, \u201cthe defendant who [remains] silent ... has the burden to show that his \u2018substantial rights\u2019 were affected.\u201d <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 63, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1048, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-9\">Our earlier precedents established that judicial participation in plea discussions of the kind that occurred in this case is plain error, but the Supreme Court abrogated our rule of automatic vacatur and held that \u201cRule 11(h) ... calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objections, the plain-error review).\u201d <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2149. In so doing, <em>Davila </em>rejected our long-standing precedents providing that a defendant need not show actual prejudice to obtain relief from a plea of guilty obtained in violation of Rule 11(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1303-07 (11th Cir.2012); <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>138 F.3d 1359, 1362 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Casallas, </em>59 F.3d at 1176-79; <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1134-35 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cWe are bound to follow a prior panel or en banc holding, except where that holding has been overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by a subsequent en banc or Supreme Court decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Whatley, </em>719 F.3d 1206, 1216 (11th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Chambers v. Thompson, </em>150 F.3d 1324, 1326 (11th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1339-11\">Davila instructs that, when a defendant does not complain to the district court about its participation in plea discussions, a reviewing court \u201cshould ... consider! ] whether it was reasonably probable that, but for the ... exhortations [of the district court], [the defendant] would have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2150. To make that determination, we must evaluate the comments of the district court, \u201cnot in isolation, but in light of the full record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the immediate response of the defendant to the judicial participation informs our decision, \u201cother portions ... of the limited record\u201d are equally illuminating in determining what effect the participation had on the defendant\u2019s decision. <em>See Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 74, 122 S.Ct. at 1054-55. In other words, we can consider events that precede and postdate the error. <em>See Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2149-50 (discussing the defendant\u2019s conduct after the judicial participation and explanation for his decision to plead guilty); <em>Vonn, </em>535 U.S. at 74-75, 122 S.Ct. at 1055 (instructing the appellate court on remand to consider a defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>the record of the defendant\u2019s initial appearance and arraignment); <em>see also United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004) (\u201c[T]he reviewing court[] [examining for plain error is] informed by the entire record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-4\">Because he failed to raise this issue in the district court, Castro faces a \u201cdaunting obstacle\u201d in obtaining a vacatur of his guilty plea. See <em>United States v. Pielago, </em>135 F.3d 703, 708 (11th Cir.1998). Castro must prove that, \u201cbut for the error [of the district court], he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>526 F.3d at 704 (quoting <em>Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at 83, 124 S.Ct. at 2340). And that burden \u201cis anything but easy\u201d to satisfy. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005). Castro must prove that the error made a difference in his decision. If the record establishes that it is as likely that the error had no effect on Castro\u2019s decision, he cannot prevail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1340-5\">[T]he burden truly is on the defendant to show that the error actually did make a difference: if it is equally plausible that the error worked in favor of the defense, the defendant loses; if the effect of the error is uncertain so that we do not know which, if either, side it helped the defendant loses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1340-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-7\">The timing of Castro\u2019s decision to plead guilty is not dispositive. The comment by the district court arguably had an effect on Castro\u2019s decision, but prejudice is not measured \u201cbased on the speculative standard of what is \u2018arguable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304. \u201c \u2018Arguable\u2019 is not enough to satisfy the third-prong test of prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Castro asserts that he was prejudiced by the comment, but he fails to explain how the comment affected his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-8\">After Castro decided to change his plea to guilty, he signed another copy of his plea agreement that stated he had not been pressured to plead guilty, and he then verified during an oral colloquy that he had not been forced by \u201canyone\u201d to plead guilty. The district court advised Castro that he was entitled to \u201cpersist in the plea\u201d of not guilty, but Castro admitted that he was guilty of several drug and firearm offenses. Castro has never repudiated those admissions. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 168 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201c[W]hen a defendant makes statements under oath at a plea colloquy, he bears a heavy burden to show his statements were false.\u201d); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Mercado, </em>808 F.2d 796, 800 n. 8 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption that the statements made during the colloquy are true.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-10\">Castro later moved to withdraw his plea, but sought that relief on grounds that he was dissatisfied with his sentence; he was denied .his right to counsel; and he had pleaded guilty under duress from his attorney. Castro did not mention the comment by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1340-11\">\u201c[Particular facts and circumstances matter\u201d in evaluating whether a defendant has been prejudiced by judicial participation in plea discussions, <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2149, and we are not convinced that Castro would have rejected the plea agreement had the district court not advised him of the consequences of reneging on his plea agreement. By pleading guilty, Castro avoided prosecution and punishment for seven offenses, including a second charge of carrying a firearm during a trafficking offense for which he faced a mandatory sentence of 25 years of imprisonment that had to run consecutively to his other sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i), (D)(ii). And Castro\u2019s conduct in the district court smacks of gamesmanship and suggests that he decided to plead guilty because he did not want to forego a favorable\u2019agreement. Castro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>changed attorneys repeatedly; retained attorneys, despite telling the court that he was penniless; and postponed entering a change of plea ostensibly because he was under the influence of an unspecified \u201cmedication.\u201d <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>643 F.3d 885, 894 (11th Cir.2011) (\u201cA defendant cannot use the right to counsel as a means to manipulate the court and cause delay\u201d). Castro later moved <em>pro se </em>to withdraw his plea because he was displeased with the sentence he received, see <em>Gonzalez-Mercado, </em>808 F.2d at 801 (explaining that defendants should not be permitted \u201cto use the guilty plea as a means of testing the weight of the potential sentence\u201d), and when that proved unsuccessful, he sought reconsideration on the grounds that he had been denied his right to counsel and had \u201csuccumbed\u201d to the pressure exerted by defense counsel to plead guilty, <em>see United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 472 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cA defendant cannot complain of coercion where his attorney, employing his best professional judgment, recommends that the defendant plead guilty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-5\">\u201cAll pleas of guilty are the result of some pressures or influences on the mind of the defendant,\u201d <em>Schnautz v. Beto, </em>416 F.2d 214, 215 (5th Cir.1969), but in this appeal it is unclear what compelled Castro to plead guilty. Although it is plausible that Castro decided to plead guilty because of the comment of the district court, it is, at least, equally plausible that Castro pleaded guilty to shorten the duration of his inevitable sentence for crimes that he admittedly committed. Because \u201cthe effect of [the] error on the result in the district court is uncertain or indeterminate ... [Castro] has [failed to prove] ... that the result would have been different but for the error; he ... [was] prejudice^]; ... [or] his substantial rights have been affected.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-7\">We AFFIRM Castro\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1341-8\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ABP\">concurring in result only:</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-9\">I agree with the Majority\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Castro has not shown the District Court\u2019s Rule 11(c)(1) violation was plain error. I write separately to raise three points that bear emphasis. First, although <em>United States v. Davila </em>changed the standard for evaluating a Rule 11(c)(1) error on appeal, <em>see </em>569 U.S. <em>-, </em>-, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2143, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013), it did not change our law for determining whether there was a Rule 11(c)(1) error or whether that error was plain. It is still true that the District Court\u2019s comments described in the Majority opinion violated the Rule ll(c)(l)\u2019s prohibition on judicial participation in plea discussions. Thus, Mr. Castro has shown error that is plain. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (\u201c[Bjefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d (quotation marks and alterations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1341-12\">Second, Rule ll(c)(l)\u2019s ban on judicial involvement in plea discussions remains an important prophylactic rule even after <em>Davila. </em>While <em>Davila </em>overruled our precedent that judicial participation in plea discussions required automatic vaca-tur without regard to case specific circumstances, see 133 S.Ct. at 2143, 2148, the Supreme Court did not immunize violations of Rule 11(c)(1) from appellate scrutiny. Rather, <em>Davila </em>held that a reviewing court must \u201cconsider all that transpired in the trial court in order to assess the , impact of the error on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2148. In doing so, the Supreme Court concluded that Rule 11(c)(1) errors are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>not \u201cstructural,\u201d meaning they do not belong to a \u201cvery limited class of errors that trigger automatic reversal because they undermine the fairness of a criminal proceedings as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2149 (quotation marks omitted). In other words, Rule 11(c)(1) errors, like most errors appellate courts review, are subject to harmless error analysis. But that does not diminish the important prophylactic purposes that Rule 11(c)(1) serves and promotes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-4\">It is just as true today, as it was before <em>Davila, </em>that Rule 11(c)(1) was \u201cdesigned to totally eliminate judicial pressure from the plea bargaining process.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1135 (11th Cir.1993). <em>Davila </em>did nothing to vitiate the important reasons that warrant separating the sentencing court from the plea discussions, such as: (1) judicial participation in the plea process may coerce th\u00e9 defendant into accepting a proposed agreement or entering a plea of guilty involuntarily; (2) judicial participation may affect the court\u2019s impartiality; and (3) judicial participation affects the appearance of impartiality. See <em>United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1178 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-5\">Finally, turning to the merits of Mr. Castro\u2019s claim, this case presents for me a closer question as to whether Mr. Castro\u2019s substantial rights were affected than the Majority\u2019s opinion suggests. As I\u2019ve said, I think the Majority correctly concluded that Mr. Castro has not shown, based on the full record, that \u201cit was reasonably probable that, but for the ... [single comment of the district court], [Castro] would have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d Majority Op. at 1309 (quoting <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2150 (alterations in Majority Op.)). But the Majority\u2019s opinion goes further than I would in minimizing the timing of Mr. Castro\u2019s guilty plea in relation to the Rule 11(c)(1) violation by saying: \u201c[t]he timing of Castro\u2019s decision to plead guilty is not dispositive. The comment by the district court arguably had an effect on Castro\u2019s decision, but prejudice is not measured based on the speculative standard of what is arguable.\u201d Majority Op. at 1314 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-7\">While timing may not always be \u201cdispos-itive,\u201d I say it remains an important factor. Indeed, in light of the closeness in time of the District Court\u2019s comment to Mr. Castro and his decision to plead guilty, it seems to me that the effect is more than what the Majority characterizes as \u201carguable.\u201d There are circumstances in which timing may still be dispositive. <em>Davila </em>is instructive on this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1342-8\">Had Davila\u2019s guilty plea followed soon after the Magistrate Judge told Davila that pleading guilty might be \u201cthe best advice\u201d a lawyer could give him, see App. 152, this case may not have warranted our attention. The automatic-vacatur rule would have remained erroneous, but the Court of Appeals\u2019 mistake might have been inconsequential. <em>See </em>Tr. of Oral Arg. 47 (Counsel for the Government acknowledged that if there is a \u201cserious [Rule 11(c)(1) ] error,\u201d and the defendant pleads guilty \u201cright after that,\u201d the error would likely qualify as prejudicial).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1342-9\">133 S.Ct. at 2149.</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-10\">In <em>Davila </em>there was a three month gap between the Rule 11(c)(1) violation and the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThree months distanced the <em>in camera meeting </em>with the Magistrate Judge from Davila\u2019s appearance before the District Judge who examined and accepted his guilty plea and later sentenced him.\u201d). In contrast, there was no gap in Mr. Castro\u2019s case. At Mr. Castro\u2019s change of plea hearing, he told the District Court that he did not want to plead guilty. In that same proceeding, the District Court advised Mr. Castro that if he did not plead guilty that day, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>might be consequences that would result in a more severe sentence for him. Then Mr. Castro immediately went forward with his plea of guilty. Because there was no gap in time, Mr. Castro is not similarly situated to the defendant in <em>Davila. </em>Further, because the District Court itself committed the Rule 11(c)(1) violation at the time of the plea hearing \u2014 unlike in <em>Davila </em>where a magistrate judge had committed the violation three months earlier \u2014 it cannot be said \u201cthere was no blending of judicial and prosecutorial functions\u201d at the time Castro pleaded guilty. <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, I believe Mr. Castro\u2019s case is factually distinguishable from <em>Davila </em>and presents a closer question on prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-5\">Even so, taking into consideration all of the circumstances identified by the Majority and the fact that Mr. Castro had the burden to prove his substantial rights were affected because he failed to object in the District Court, I am persuaded that there is not a reasonable probability that, but for the District Court\u2019s single statement (which was error and plain), Mr. Castro \u201cwould have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2150.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
