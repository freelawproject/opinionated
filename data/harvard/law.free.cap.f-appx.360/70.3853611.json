INA \u00a7 208; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158. The Board vacated the order of the immigration judge that had granted Lombana-Cano asylum as a victim of past persecution who also had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion. We deny Lombana-Cano\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Substantial evidence supports the finding of the Board that Lombana-Cano did not suffer past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion. Lombana-Cano\u2019s encounters with members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in which he was kidnapped, struck repeatedly, led through the jungle to meet with a guerilla leader, and received death threats did not amount to persecution because he was not seriously harmed. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005). Even if these encounters were persecution, the record does not compel a finding the abuse was inflicted due to Lombana-Cano\u2019s political opinion. Lombana-Cano testified that, while he was completing a mandatory social service internship, the Revolutionary Forces tried to recruit him to provide medical treatment for its members and to support their cause. \u201c \u2018Persecution on account of ... political opinion ... is persecution on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutor\u2019s.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Lombana-Cano\u2019s argument that the Revolutionary Forces pursued him because he worked for the government could support an inference of persecution because of an imputed political opinion, but \u201cthe evidence equally supports an inference that he was threatened simply because of his refusal to provide [medical] services, and the record does not \u2018compel\u2019 this Court to hold otherwise.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Lombana-Cano\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
