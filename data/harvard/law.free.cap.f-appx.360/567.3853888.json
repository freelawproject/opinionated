Yzaguirre, Yzaguirre &amp; Cha-pa, McAllen, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b594-10\">Before KING, STEWART, and HAYNES, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-11\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Jesus Pecina-Ramirez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, and he was sentenced to 324 months and 240 months of imprisonment, to run concurrently, and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">Pecina-Ramirez argues that the district erred by imposing a four-level increase in his offense level for being an organizer/leader under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). He argues that DEA Agent De La Cruz\u2019s testimony did not show that he directed the activity of any other participants, but showed only that he was in the truck with Rivera conducting counter-surveillance under the direction of the owner of the drugs. He contends that no evidence was presented to support the agent\u2019s opinion that he was a leader or organizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-18\">In reviewing a sentencing decision, this court must consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, or selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The determination that a defendant is a leader or organizer under \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) is a factual finding reviewed by this court for clear error. <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">DEA Agent De La Cruz\u2019s testimony established that Pecina-Ramirez\u2019s primary role was to oversee the smuggling of the drugs from Mexico using the storm drain pipe. There was evidence in the form of intercepted conversations which showed Pecina-Ramirez discussing dividing payments with his co-leaders, discussing with the owner of the drugs whether a load should be crossed all at once or divided for security, discussing payment for seized drugs with the owner, and receiving reports from those conducting counter-surveillance. This evidence supports agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>De La Cruz\u2019s conclusion that Pecina-Ramirez supervised the counter-surveillance aspect of the smuggling operation. Pecina-Ramirez does not dispute the evidence from the debriefings that he recruited two other participants. The agent\u2019s testimony established that Pecina-Ramirez was one of the people in charge of the smuggling operation and exercised control or authority over his co-conspirators, even if he was just carrying out orders from the owners above him. He was not required to be \u201cthe leader\u201d but \u201ca leader\u201d to receive the adjustment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4); <em>Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d at 175 n. 13 (noting that more than one person can be a leader). The district court\u2019s finding that Pecina-Ramirez was a leader or organizer is not clearly erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
