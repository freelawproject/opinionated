Resen-diz challenges the district court\u2019s upwardly departing from criminal history category VI pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a), p.s., arguing that the decision to depart was not justified by the facts in his case and that the court failed to follow the incremental approach in determining the extent of departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">We need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute over the standard of review governing Resendiz\u2019s first issue because under either standard, Resendiz\u2019s argument fails. The district court found that the criminal history substantially underrepresented Resendiz\u2019s serious criminal history <em>and </em>the likelihood that he will commit other crimes. Here and below, Resendiz challenged only the first part of that finding. Under \u00a7 4A1.3, a district court may upwardly depart on either basis. Moreover, the district court\u2019s reasons for departure advanced the objectives of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and are justified by the facts of this case. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">Resendiz\u2019s arguments below did not preserve his argument that the district court erred by failing to following the incremental approach required by \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B). This is the type of error that, if proper objection had been made, the district court could have corrected. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir.2000). The error here is the district court\u2019s failure to \u201cshow its work\u201d in arriving at the 48 month sentence. Resendiz does not argue, and there is nothing in the record to show, that the district court would have, or could not have, imposed a lesser sentence if it had employed the incremental approach. Thus, Resendiz\u2019s substantial rights were not affected. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1431; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 682 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
