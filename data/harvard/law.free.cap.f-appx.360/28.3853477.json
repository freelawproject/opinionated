On appeal, Brewer argues that the district court violated Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure when it resentenced him in absentia. Brewer argues that he should have been afforded a resentencing hearing, at which he would have had an opportunity to allo-cute. As a result of not being afforded a resentencing hearing, Brewer generally argues that his rights to Due Process and Equal Protection Under the Law were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">We have held that the established right to be present at sentencing does not translate into a right to be present whenever a court modifies a sentence. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>923 F.2d 1494, 1496 (11th Cir.1991). We explained that a \u201cdefendant\u2019s right to be present extends to the imposition of a new sentencing package after an original sentencing package is vacated in its entirety on appeal and the case is remanded for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, \u201cwhere the entire sentencing package has not been set aside, a correction of an illegal sentence does not constitute a resentencing requiring the presence of the defendant, so long as the modification does not make the sentence more onerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1497. We emphasized that the defendant already had the opportunity to allo-cute during his original sentencing hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1496-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Here, the district court entered an amended judgment, vacating Brewer\u2019s conviction and sentence imposed on Count Six. The district court did not alter the sentences for the remaining counts of conviction. Nothing in the record suggests that Brewer did not have the opportunity to challenge his sentencing information and present mitigating evidence at his original sentencing hearing. <em>See Id. </em>at 1497.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Moreover, Brewer has presented nothing to show any reasonable possibility that, if he had been afforded the opportunity to allocute at a resentencing hearing, the district court would have imposed a different sentence. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Brewer\u2019s motion for a resentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
