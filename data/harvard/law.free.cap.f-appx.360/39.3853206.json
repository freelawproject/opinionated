Ambers contends that the district court failed to apply the proper legal standard under \u00a7 4243(g) and violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process when it revoked his conditional release and committed him indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">A federal grand jury indicted Ambers for possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1), and placing a loaded firearm on an aircraft, in violation of 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46505(b)(2). After determining that Ambers was competent to stand trial and accepting his waiver of his right to a jury trial, the district court conducted a bench trial based on facts stipulated to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">Ambers stipulated and agreed to the admission into evidence of a report written by Dr. David Shapiro, a psychologist, following his examination and evaluation of Ambers. In that report, Dr. Shapiro stated that Ambers was \u201csuffering from a severe Affective Disorder.\u201d Dr. Shapiro further stated that Ambers, \u201csimilar to many patients who have severe Affective Disorders, began to feel better once he was taking his medication and decided, therefore, to go off of his medication\u201d and that \u201c[w]hen his symptoms started returning, rather than going back on the medication, he attempted to \u2018self-medieate\u2019 [with psychoactive substances] which, in turn, made him more paranoid and resulted in his [perceived] need for a weapon to protect himself.\u201d Ambers also stipulated and agreed to the admission into evidence of a report by Dr. Rodolfo Buigas, another psychologist who evaluated Ambers. Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Buigas stated that Ambers\u2019 mental disorder is \u201csignificantly exacerbated by substance abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Based on the parties\u2019 stipulations, the district court found Ambers not guilty only by reason of insanity and ordered him committed pursuant to \u00a7 4243(a). In its December 2007 order committing Ambers, the district court also ordered that a psychological or psychiatric examination of Ambers be conducted to determine whether his \u201crelease would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage of property of another\u201d and that a report based on that examination be filed with the court pursuant to \u00a7 4243(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">In April 2008, the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina, prepared and filed with the district court a Forensic Evaluation Report pursuant to the district court\u2019s December 2007 order. The Forensic Report concluded that Ambers\u2019 release \u201cwould not create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or [ ] serious damage to the property of another person.\u201d However, as the district court noted, the Forensic Report also acknowledged that Ambers suffers from Bipolar Disorder, that he \u201chas a history of engaging in violent behavior when he is off his psychotropic medication and self-medicating himself with illegal substances,\u201d and \u201cthat [Ambers] has a \u2018pattern of medication non-compliance\u2019 and of behaving impulsively when untreated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The district court then conducted a hearing on Ambers\u2019 possible release pursuant to \u00a7 4243(f). At that hearing, the district court reviewed the Forensic Report. Ambers did not object to the Report. Following that hearing, the district court issued an order finding that Ambers\u2019 \u201crelease would not pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another person, provided that [he] continues to take the psychotropic medications that have been prescribed for him.\u201d Due to Ambers\u2019 history of medication non-compliance, the district court also ordered that Ambers\u2019 \u201crelease must be conditioned upon a prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric or psychological care or treatment.\u201d The district court then ordered the Federal Medical Center to prepare an appropriate treatment regimen for Ambers before his conditional release.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The Federal Medical Center created a regimen of conditions to govern Ambers\u2019-release. Ambers\u2019 regimen included requirements that he \u201cmaintain active participation in a regimen of outpatient mental care as ... administered by Compass Health Systems,\u201d that he \u201cabstain from the use of alcohol, illegal narcotic substance[s] or drugs,\u201d and a provision stating that Ambers \u201cmay be required to submit for testing for use of drugs and alcohol at the direction of the United States Probation Officer.\u201d On June 6, 2008, the district court found \u201cthat [Ambers\u2019] release would not pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another person under the conditions described in the FMC\u2019s regimen\u201d and ordered Ambers released subject to those conditions pursuant to \u00a7 4243(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">In February 2009, the United States Probation Office petitioned the district court for the issuance of a warrant for Ambers\u2019 arrest. The petition alleged that Ambers violated the conditions of his release by \u201cfailing to participate in an approved mental health/substance abuse treatment program\u201d and \u201cby failing to submit to drug testing.\u201d The district court issued the warrant, which was executed on February 25, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">On April 21, 2009, the district court held a hearing to determine whether Ambers\u2019 conditional release should be revoked un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>der \u00a7 4243(g). At that hearing, Ambers stipulated that he violated the conditions of his release by failing to attend two scheduled appointments at Compass Health Services and by failing to submit to drug testing on two occasions. Ambers\u2019 counsel also admitted that Ambers had tested positive for cocaine use during his conditional release. No witnesses testified at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Following the hearing, the district court issued an order stating that it \u201cfound [that Ambers] failed to comply with his prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, and psychological care or treatment and that his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another.\u201d Consistent with those findings, the district court revoked Ambers\u2019 conditional release and ordered him committed to a suitable facility pursuant to \u00a7 4243(g) \u201cuntil such time as he is eligible for release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243(e).\u201d Ambers then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Ambers argues that the district court\u2019s revocation of his conditional release was an erroneous application of the legal standard required by \u00a7 4243(g) and a violation of his rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although Ambers frames his arguments as based on the application of legal standards, both of his arguments hinge on his contention that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that his continued release would pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to another\u2019s property. He asserts that at his revocation hearing there was no evidence that he had failed to take his medication or that his continued release would pose a substantial danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Whether the district court properly applied the legal standard of \u00a7 4243(g) and the requirements of due process under the Fifth Amendment are legal questions that we review <em>de novo. See Agan v. Vaughn, </em>119 F.3d 1538, 1541 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe review ... purely legal questions <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>We review a district court\u2019s finding of dangerousness under \u00a7 4243 for clear error. <em>United States v. Wattleton, </em>296 F.3d 1184, 1201 n. 34 (11th Cir.2002). Under either standard, the result of this appeal would be the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243(g) provides in pertinent part that when deciding whether to revoke an insanity acquittee\u2019s conditional release, a district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa\">shall, after a hearing, determine whether the person should be remanded to a suitable facility on the ground that, in light of his failure to comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The plain language of \u00a7 4243(g) requires that a district court make two findings before revoking an insanity acquittee\u2019s conditional release: (1) the acquittee failed to comply with his prescribed regimen of care or treatment and (2) his continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to another\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Ambers stipulated that he did not comply with the conditions of his prescribed regimen of treatment because he failed to attend two scheduled meetings with his mental health counselors and failed to submit to drug testing on two occasions. Also, at the revocation hearing, Ambers, through his attorney, admitted testing positive for cocaine in violation of the conditions of his regimen. <em>See Laird v. Air </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Carrier Serv. Inc., </em>263 F.2d 948, 953 (5th Cir.1959) (\u201cWhen [an attorney] speaks in Court, whether it be [i]n a formal trial or in an informal pretrial, he speaks for and as the client.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Ambers admits that he failed to comply with the conditions of his treatment regimen, the only remaining issue is whether the district court erred in finding that his continued release would create a substantial risk under \u00a7 4243(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Unlike subsections (d) and (f) of \u00a7 4243, which explicitly place the burden on the insanity acquittee to prove that his release would not create a substantial risk, \u00a7 4243(g) does not specify whether the government or the acquittee bears the burden of proof in a hearing on the revocation of an acquittee\u2019s conditional discharge. We need not decide that issue today because our decision would be the same whether the burden falls on Ambers or on the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Ambers did not present any evidence of his lack of dangerousness at the revocation hearing. Therefore, if \u00a7 4243(g) places the burden on Ambers to demonstrate that \u201chis continued release would [not] create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another,\u201d his arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Even if the government bears the burden under \u00a7 4243(g) of demonstrating that Ambers\u2019 continued release would pose a substantial risk, Ambers\u2019 argument that the district court erred in revoking his conditional release still fails. Before revoking his conditional release, the district court specifically found that Ambers\u2019 continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It did not make that finding in an evidentiary vacuum.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Ambers stipulated to and does not now challenge the fact that he suffers from a mental disorder. Ambers stipulated and agreed to the admission into evidence of Dr. Shapiro\u2019s report, which detailed the way in which Ambers\u2019 failure to take his medication and his attempts to self-medicate led to his paranoia and caused him to believe that he needed a firearm to protect himself. Ambers\u2019 also stipulated to Dr. Buigas\u2019 report, which noted that substance abuse worsens Ambers\u2019 condition. Also, Ambers did not object to the Forensic Report, which noted Ambers\u2019 history of medication non-compliance and his propensity for violence when he is unmedieated and using illegal drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">The record shows that Ambers\u2019 mental condition renders him substantially dangerous when he fails to comply with his mental health treatment regimen and uses illegal drugs. The district court was aware of that record; the same judge presided over Ambers\u2019 bench trial, his conditional release hearing, and the hearing revoking his conditional release. At his revocation hearing, Ambers admitted that he failed to attend scheduled meet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ings with his mental health counselors, failed to submit to drug testing, and tested positive for cocaine during his conditional release. The conduct comprising those violations makes Ambers\u2019 condition worse and renders him substantially dangerous. The record therefore contains enough evidence to support a finding that Ambers\u2019 continued release created a substantial risk of bodily injury to another or serious damage to another\u2019s property. Because both Ambers\u2019 \u00a7 4243(g) argument and his due process argument rely on his contention that the record lacked sufficient evidence to support that finding, those arguments must fail. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\">. Ambers' reliance on <em>Friend v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 579 (D.C.Cir.1967), is misplaced. In that case, the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s revocation of the acquittee's conditional release because the district court \u201cmade no findings as to the appellant\u2019s mental condition and dangerousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. Ambers admits that he has a mental disorder, and the district court explicitly found in its revocation order that his continued release would pose a substantial risk. Furthermore, <em>Friend </em>does not bind us in our interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4243, as it was decided by the D.C. Circuit and involved that court\u2019s interpretation of 24 D.C.Code \u00a7 301(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
