He maintains: at a pretrial conference, the district court agreed with Jacobs\u2019 counsel\u2019s assessment that a suppression motion was not viable because Jacobs lacked standing to challenge the disputed evidence. The record reflects, however, that the district court never ruled on the validity of a motion to suppress because no such motion was ever filed. Instead, the court merely explained to Jacobs the legal concept of standing and clarified for him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the reasons his counsel decided not to file such a motion. Moreover, to the extent that Jacobs seeks to have our court decide whether the disputed evidence should be suppressed, he has waived his right to raise that issue here. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>467 F.3d 912, 918 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that a defendant who fails to make a timely suppression motion cannot raise that claim for the first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Jacobs also asserts his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not file a motion to suppress. The record, however, is <em>not </em>sufficiently developed to permit direct review of Jacobs\u2019 ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. <em>See United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, we decline to consider this claim, without prejudice to Jacobs\u2019 right to raise it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 502-07, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (noting that habeas proceedings are the preferred method for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Finally, for the first time on appeal, Jacobs contends the district court erroneously relied upon the presentence investigation report\u2019s (PSR) characterization of his prior state-court convictions, for illegal use of weapons and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, to increase his sentence by 10 offense levels under Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1 (increasing base offense level where defendant has \u201cat least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\u201d). As Jacobs concedes, review of this issue is only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Reversible plain error exists where a clear or obvious error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>E.g., United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 962, 173 L.Ed.2d 153 (2009); see <em>also Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even then, we have discretion whether to correct such an error and generally will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Baker, </em>538 F.3d at 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The district court was not permitted to rely on the PSR\u2019s characterization of Jacobs\u2019 past offenses for sentence-enhancement purposes. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.2005). Jacobs has failed, however, to demonstrate that any such error affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Ochoa-Cruz, </em>442 F.3d 865, 867 (5th Cir.2006) (holding substantial rights are not affected where appellant fails to establish that the application of the enhancement was ultimately wrong).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
