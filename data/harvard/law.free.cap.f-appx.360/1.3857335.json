For two reasons we reject Charles\u2019 appeal. First, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), on its face and as applied to Charles, does not violate the Commerce Clause. Second, the Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions do not need to be alleged in an indictment or proved to a jury in order to be used to enhance a sentence, and we have applied that ruling to sentences enhanced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b27-23\">A federal grand jury returned an indictment alleging that Charles was a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). <em>See </em>Rl-8. At trial, Miami Dade Police Department Detective Dario Socar-ras testified as follows. R2 at 63. On 3 December 2008, Socarras stopped a car after it failed to stop at a stop sign. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65. While talking to the car\u2019s driver, Socarras smelled marijuana and noticed that the passenger was reaching towards his feet. <em>Id. </em>at 68. Socarras identified Charles as the car\u2019s passenger. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-24\">After another officer, Speck, arrived at the scene, Socarras approached the passenger side of the car, and asked Charles to step out. <em>Id. </em>at 69. After Charles stepped out of the car, he ran away from the officers. <em>Id. </em>at 70. Both Speck and Socarras pursued him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b27-25\">During the chase, Socarras noticed that Charles\u2019s hands were near his waist. <em>Id. </em>Socarras then saw Charles drop or throw a gun magazine to the ground. <em>Id. </em>at 72. Socarras later learned that the magazine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>was loaded. <em>Id. </em>at 74. Charles continued fleeing, and just before Charles dove to the ground, Socarras saw him throw a gun into the air. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78. Shortly thereafter, Socarras arrested Charles. <em>Id. </em>at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Socarras searched Charles, and recovered a bag of marijuana and $962. <em>Id. </em>at 80-81. Socarras then recovered the gun Charles threw away. <em>Id. </em>at 81. Socarras also recovered a bag of marijuana under the passenger seat of the car from which Charles had fled. <em>Id. </em>at 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Jason Gambill, an officer with the Miami Dade Police Department\u2019s Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives task force, testified as follows. <em>Id. </em>at 126. Gambill did not find Charles\u2019s fingerprints on the gun. <em>Id. </em>at 128,140. During a post-arrest interview, Charles told Gambill that a girl had given him the gun, and when he was pulled over, he was on the way to give the gun to a friend. <em>Id. </em>at 132. Charles also told Gambill that there was no way the officers could have seen him throw the gun to the ground, and that his fingerprints and DNA would have been on the gun. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The parties stipulated that, prior to 3 December 2008, Charles was previously convicted of a felony offense. <em>Id. </em>at 142. Next, Charles stipulated that the gun and magazine introduced in the instant case were manufactured outside the State of Florida and had moved in interstate or foreign commerce prior to the day in question. <em>Id. </em>Lastly, Charles stipulated that, in April 1998, he was convicted of a felony offense involving a firearm. <em>Id. </em>at 142^3. At the close of evidence, Charles moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the court denied. <em>Id. </em>at 147. The jury found Charles guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86; Rl-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">In preparing the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer calculated a base offense level of 24 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). Noting that Charles was subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), the probation officer characterized Charles as an armed career criminal pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B), and reset his base offense level to 33. The probation officer further noted that Charles\u2019s statutory minimum term of imprisonment was fifteen years and the maximum term of imprisonment was life. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Based on a total offense level of 33, and a criminal history category of VI, Charles\u2019s guideline imprisonment range was 235 to 293 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">At sentencing, Charles did not object to the PSI or his armed career criminal designation. <em>See </em>R3. The court adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations, stating that Charles\u2019s guidelines range was 235-293 months of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Charles\u2019s sister spoke on behalf of his family. See <em>id. </em>at 2-4. She asked the court to be lenient, stating that Charles had two children and that his community loved him. <em>Id. </em>at 3. She emphasized that Charles was his mother\u2019s only son, and that she did not believe their mother would live through his entire sentence. <em>Id. </em>Next, Charles personally apologized for his actions. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Charles stated that he only wanted to pursue his musical career and care for his children. <em>Id. </em>Charles requested a 180 month sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 6. The government opposed Charles\u2019s request, arguing that his extensive criminal history warranted a sentence at the high end of the advisory range. <em>See id. </em>at 6-8. After considering the guidelines and the statutory sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the court sentenced Charles to 240 months of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Charles did not object to the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 10. This appeal followed. Rl-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">On appeal, Charles argues that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), on its face and as applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to him violates the Commerce Clause. Charles concedes that his arguments are precluded by our precedent, but raises the arguments to preserve further review. Charles contends that \u00a7 922(g) is a general criminal statute that bears no relation to commercial activity. Charles argues that \u00a7 922(g) is not limited to interstate or foreign commerce, which is beyond Congress\u2019s scope. According to Charles, \u00a7 922(g) also violates the Commerce Clause because it does not require a showing that the firearm possession substantially affected interstate commerce. Next, Charles argues that his possession of a firearm did not affect interstate commerce. Charles maintains that any link between his possession and interstate commerce is, at best, attenuated. Charles further contends that, because the government never showed that his possession substantially affected interstate commerce, his conviction cannot be sustained. Charles concludes that his conviction constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Because Charles raises this constitutional challenge for the first time on appeal, it is within our discretion to either address his arguments <em>de novo </em>or consider them waived. <em>See United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259 (11th Cir.2001). However, when an objection is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005). Under plain error review, the appellate court may only correct forfeited errors if the defendant establishes: (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">In <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387 (11th Cir.1996), we found that because \u00a7 922(g) expressly requires that the felon possess a firearm or ammunition \u201cin or affecting interstate commerce,\u201d the statute is constitutional on its face, and that it also was constitutional as applied to McAllister because the government demonstrated that the gun he possessed had traveled in interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 390. Because <em>McAllister </em>remains controlling on this issue, Charles\u2019s argument must be rejected. <em>See United States v. Dunn, </em>345 F.3d 1285, 1297 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is the firmly established rule of this Circuit that each succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en banc, or by the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Charles also argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by using prior convictions, which were neither found by a jury nor admitted by him, to enhance his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). Charles concedes that this issue is arguably foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1228-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but nonetheless argues that we should re-evaluate the constitutionality of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>Charles next argues, in the alternative, that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is inapplicable here because the jury never specifically found that he had previously been convicted of qualifying offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Because Charles raises this objection for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298. Charles was sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4(a), which states, \u201cA defendant who is subject to an enhanced sentence under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) is an armed career criminal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(a). Section 924(e) states in relevant part that \u201ca person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>serious drug offense ... shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court held that factors, such as prior convictions, that are \u201crelevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime,\u201d need not be charged in an indictment or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 228, 118 S.Ct. at 1223. The Supreme Court stated explicitly in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding in which it held that it is a Sixth Amendment violation for a sentencing court to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on facts that were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or expressly admitted by the defendant), that its decision in that case did not question the validity of its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">We reiterated in <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir.2005), that the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not affected by <em>Apprendi </em>or the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (holding that mandatory enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines must be based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant), and that a district court does not err when it uses prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329. Finally, in <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006), we specifically held that prior convictions did not have to be found by a jury in order to be used to enhance a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 924(e). Accordingly, because the district court followed precedent from both the Supreme Court and this court when it used Charles\u2019s prior convictions to enhance his sentence, it did not plainly err.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">For the reasons stated above we find no merit in Charles\u2019 appeal. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
