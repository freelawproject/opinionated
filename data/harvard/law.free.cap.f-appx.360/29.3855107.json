Cesaire argues that this sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to make a proper assessment in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We find no merit in Cesaire\u2019s argument and affirm the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">We review the sentence of the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Once we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we then consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence,\u201d under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-17\">Cesaire\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Cesaire argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district judge failed to give proper weight and consideration to: (1) the fact that his purpose for returning to the United States was to see his son; (2) that he was under the impression that a French judge could give him permission to return to the United States; and, (3) that he did not have specific intent to violate any federal statutes. However, the district judge, in pronouncing sentence, specifically referred to \u201cyour guideline range and the <em>statutory factors.\u201d </em>Doc. 44 at 7 (emphasis added). This statement is adequate to establish the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>As such, we find that the sentence of the district court was procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-12\">. Cesaire did not raise the issue of procedural reasonableness, so we will not consider that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
