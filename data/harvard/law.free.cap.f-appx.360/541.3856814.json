The plaintiffs alleged that they requested documents from the defendants and that their request was ignored, denied, and/or tampered with. In addition to seeking injunctive relief under FOIA, the plaintiffs also asserted that their Fourteenth Amendment rights of due process and equal protection were violated when the defendants allegedly failed to respond to the FOIA request. The plaintiffs asked the district court to impose punitive damages against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In a report and recommendation, the Magistrate Judge recommended dismissal of the action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). The Magistrate Judge found the plaintiffs did not reasonably describe the records sought in their FOIA request as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(3). Additionally, the Magistrate Judge concluded that FOIA only allows the plaintiffs the potential for injunctive relief; it does not provide for the monetary damages sought by the plaintiffs. Finally, the Magistrate Judge found that the plaintiffs failed to allege that they exhausted their administrative remedies prior to filing suit as is required for FOIA complaints. <em>See Hedley v. U.S., </em>594 F.2d 1043, 1044 (5th Cir.1979). The district court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and dismissed the suit without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On appeal, the plaintiffs-appellants do not address the basis on which the district judge dismissed this suit. Plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 brief argues that they need the information they sought from the defendants to assert claims of discrimination. Their brief does not identify the particular records sought or allege that they have exhausted their administrative remedies. The plaintiffs-appellants also do not provide any authority allowing a claim for monetary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Because the plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 brief does not address the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal or state how the district court erred, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
