He was sentenced to 286 months of imprisonment, eight years of supervised release, and a $2,000 f\u00edne.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Hewitt argues that \u00a7 860, as applied to him in this case, was not a valid constitutional exercise of federal authority by the United States Congress because it does not require a nexus with interstate commerce or regulate a commercial activity. His argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>132 F.3d 192, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Next, Hewitt asserts that the evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Because Hewitt failed to preserve this challenge for appeal, our \u201creview is limited to determining whether there was a manifest miscarriage of justice, that is, whether the record is devoid of evidence pointing to guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir.2001) (citations and internal quotations marks omitted). However, our review of the evidence shows that it was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict even if Hewitt\u2019s challenge had been preserved. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
