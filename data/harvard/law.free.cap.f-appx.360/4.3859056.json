The government argues that the district court lacked discretion to depart below the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). For the reasons set forth below, we vacate Thomas\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Thomas pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) initially set Thomas\u2019s base offense level at 38, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), because Thomas\u2019s offense involved 4 kilograms of crack cocaine. After applying a 2-point enhancement under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), (possession of a weapon during the offense), and a 3-level reduction under \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), (acceptance of responsibility), Thomas\u2019s total offense level was set at 37. Thomas\u2019s four criminal history points placed him in criminal history category III. His offense level of 37 combined with criminal history category III to yield a guideline imprisonment range of 262 to 327 months. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Thomas was subject to a mandatory minimum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">At sentencing, the court granted the government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a 4-level departure and then departed an additional 2 levels, reducing Thomas\u2019s offense level to 31 and his guideline imprisonment range to 135 to 168 months. The court sentenced Thomas to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-14\">On January 29, 2009, the district court, <em>sua sponte, </em>appointed a public defender to represent Thomas, ordered the probation office to complete a supplemental report addressing whether Thomas was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 706, and ordered Thomas and the government to file responses to the probation officer\u2019s supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">The government responded that Amendment 706 reduced Thomas\u2019s original of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>fense level of 37 to 35 and his original guideline imprisonment of 262 to 327 months to 210 to 262 months. It asserted that, pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3), the court should recalculate Thomas\u2019s total offense level, then apply a departure comparable to the one Thomas originally received as a result of the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. The government noted that such a departure would result in an amended guideline range of 108 to 135 months, but it noted that Thomas was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum of 10 years\u2019 (120 months) imprisonment. The government stated that it would not oppose a reduction to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The district court issued an order reducing Thomas\u2019s sentence to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. It noted that Thomas\u2019s amended total offense level was 35, his criminal history category remained III, and his amended guideline imprisonment range was 210-262 months. The court explained that \u201c[t]he previous term of imprisonment was less than the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing as a result of a departure or Rule 35 reduction and the reduced sentence is comparably less than the amended guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>issues of legal interpretation in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1338-39 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment in the case of a defendant who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The district court correctly determined that Amendment 706 lowered Thomas\u2019s applicable guideline range. Because Thomas\u2019s guideline range was based on \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 reduced Thomas\u2019s original base offense level from 38 to 36, his total offense level from 37 to 35, and his original guideline imprisonment range from 262 to 327 months to 210 to 262 months. <em>See U.S.S.G., </em>App. C, Amend. 706 (amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l)). We now address whether the district court was authorized to reduce Thomas\u2019s sentence as far as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">Any sentence reduction granted pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) must be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1341 (stating that we \u201cmust treat such commentary [in the policy statements] as binding\u201d). The applicable policy statement provides that \u201c[i]f the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing, a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range ... may be appropriate.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(B). The commentary also provides the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-11\">In a case in which: (A) the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing was 70 to 87 months; (B) the defendant\u2019s original term of imprisonment imposed was 56 months (representing a downward departure of 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing); and (C) the amended guideline range ... is 57 to 71 months, a reduction to a term of imprisonment of 46 months (representing a reduction of approximately 20 percent below the minimum term of imprisonment provided by the amended guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>range ...) would amount to a comparable reduction and may be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJ\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Applying Application Note 3 to Thomas\u2019s case, the lowest sentence Thomas could have received at resentencing would have been 108 months. Thomas\u2019s original 135-month sentence represented a 48 percent departure from the 262-month low-end guideline sentence. Similarly, a 108-month sentence would represent a 48 percent departure from the 210-month low-end amended guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">More important than \u00a7 1B1.10, the statutory provision in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (b) (1) (A) (iii) requires that Thomas is subject to a 10-year, or 120-month, mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(iii). Section 5K1.1 of the Guidelines states: \u201c[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Although a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion permits a court to depart from the guidelines, we have held that a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion does not effectively waive the statutory minimum to allow a district court to grant a \u00a7 3582 reduction below that statutory minimum. <em>See Williams, </em>549 F.3d at 1339 (holding that the district court was not permitted to grant the defendant a \u00a7 3582 sentence reduction where the defendant had originally been sentenced below the statutory minimum, because the statutory minimum, which effectively became the defendant\u2019s \u201cguideline range,\u201d was not reduced by Amendment 706). Under <em>Williams, </em>the district court was not authorized to reduce Thomas\u2019s sentence below the applicable statutory minimum, even though the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at the original sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">We also note that binding precedent also forecloses any argument that <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough </em>permit district courts to ignore statutory minimum sentences in \u00a7 3582 proceedings. <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192-93 (11th Cir.) (holding that <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Kimbrough</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>apply to original sentencing proceedings and do \u201cnot address motions to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2382, 173 L.Ed.2d 1300 (2009); <em>see also United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1362 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that \u201cthe district court remains bound by statutes designating mandatory minimum sentences even after the remedial holding of <em>[Booker T). </em>Finally, although the government did not raise the issue on appeal, the district court abused its discretion in failing to state that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors in determining the extent of Thomas\u2019s sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 760 (11th Cir.1998) (stating that a district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine whether, and to what extent, to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence). Accordingly, we vacate Thomas\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">. <em>United States v.
