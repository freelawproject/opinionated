The BIA dismissed Puac\u2019s appeal of an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of her application for cancellation of removal, asylum, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Puac now petitions for a review of the denial of her application for cancellation of removal, arguing that the BIA board member should have remanded or referred the case to a three-member panel and that her due process rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-25\">This court reviews only the decision of the BIA and not that of the IJ, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s decision influenced the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Gonzalez-Maldonado v. Gonzales, </em>487 F.3d 975, 976 (5th Cir.2007). Factual findings of the BIA and IJ are reviewed for substantial evidence and questions of law and constitutional claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>are reviewed <em>de novo. Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\">Puac claims that the BIA erred by issuing a \u201csummary affirmance,\u201d or affirmance without opinion, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(4). On the contrary, the BIA issued a four-page decision dismissing Puac\u2019s administrative appeal. The decision clearly stated why the BIA did not find error in the findings of the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Puac also claims that the decision by a single BIA board member violated agency regulations and that her case should have been referred to a three-member panel or remanded for additional fact finding. These claims are unwarranted. As stated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e): \u201cUnless a case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under paragraph (e)(6) of this section, all cases shall be assigned to a single Board member for disposition.\u201d Puac has not shown that her case meets the standards for assignment to a three-member panel under \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(6) (defining the limited circumstances in which review by a three-member panel is permissible).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the BIA\u2019s decision by a single board member was permissible. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(5) (permitting a single BIA member to consider the merits of a case and to issue a brief order affirming the decision under review).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Remand was also not warranted since the BIA was exercising <em>de novo </em>review of a discretionary issue. The BIA declined to reverse the IJ\u2019s determination that Puac\u2019s departure from the United States would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her United States citizen child. This is a discretionary determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(b)(1) (The Attorney General may cancel removal). The BIA retains <em>de novo </em>jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (\u201cThe Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment and all other issues in appeals from decisions of immigration judges de novo.\u201d) Thus, the BIA did not need to remand Puac\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Puac alleges that the BIA violated \u201cequal protection\u201d by failing to remand her case and that the IJ violated \u201cdue process\u201d by failing to consider all the relevant factors in the hardship determination. These constitutional claims are without merit. The IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of relief does not amount to a constitutional violation. <em>Assaad v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cfailure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d). The Fifth Amendment affords an alien the right to \u201c(1) notice of the charges against him, (2) a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal, and (3) a fair opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Manzano-Garda v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 470 (5th Cir.2005). Puac has not alleged that these requirements were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The Petitioner\u2019s assertions do not involve any constitutional claims, but rather \u201can abuse of discretion argument cloaked in constitutional garb.\u201d <em>Hadwani v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 798, 800-801 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001)). What the petitioner asks is that this court reverse the IJ\u2019s finding that her removal does not satisfy the \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d requirement needed for cancellation of removal. This we cannot do. As noted, this is a discretionary determination by the Attorney General. This court does not have jurisdiction to review judgements of cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229(b). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review must be DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
