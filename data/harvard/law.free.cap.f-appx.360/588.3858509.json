A COA is not required for Patron to appeal. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any basis supported by the record. <em>See Scott v. Johnson, </em>227 F.3d 260, 262 (5th Cir.2000) (denial of \u00a7 2255 motion). The district court correctly dismissed Patron\u2019s petition for writ of audita querela because redress was available to Patron under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Felker v. Turpin, </em>518 U.S. 651, 662, 116 S.Ct. 2333, 135 L.Ed.2d 827 (1996). It is irrelevant that Patron can no longer meet the standard for bringing a timely \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>Cf. Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 878 (holding that fact that federal prisoner filed unsuccessful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion or that federal prisoner cannot meet requirements for filing successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Accordingly, Patron\u2019s motion for a COA is DENIED as unnecessary and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
