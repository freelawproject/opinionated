The district court determined that no con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>dition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure Simpson\u2019s presence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">A judicial officer may order a defendant detained pending trial if the officer finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person,\u201d or, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cno condition of combination of conditions will reasonably assure ... the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d \u00a7 3142(e), (f); <em>see United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243, 250 (5th Cir.1985). Absent an error of law, we will uphold a district court\u2019s pretrial detention order if it is supported by the proceedings in that court. <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 586 (5th Cir.1992). The district court\u2019s determination that the Government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or combination of conditions could reasonably assure Simpson\u2019s presence at trial is supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Westbrook, </em>780 F.2d 1185, 1189-90 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Fortna, </em>769 F.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Moreover, Simpson has not shown that any error in denying production of government documents pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2 prejudiced his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Doucette, </em>979 F.2d 1042, 1044-45 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, Simpson is not entitled to a new detention hearing on this basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
