He argues that the district court erred in dismissing his amended Rule 60(b) motion as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion because his motion did not attack the merits of a decision. Instead, it focused on a defect in the integrity of the habeas proceeding. He argues that his Rule 60(b) motion alleged that the integrity of the prior habeas proceedings was compromised because prison officials confiscated and lost his legal file, so the district court should reopen his first and second \u00a7 2255 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">We granted Williams a COA on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">Whether the district court erred by dismissing Williams\u2019s amended Rule 60(b) motion as impermissibly successive, in part, where Williams[] argued that his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was not time-barred based on \u00a7 2255(f)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions regarding the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, including whether a Rule 60(b) motion is a second or successive habeas petition. <em>See Zakrzew-ski v. McDonough, </em>490 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2007) (addressing \u00a7 2254 petition). The principles developed in \u00a7 2254 cases also apply to \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Gay v. United States, </em>816 F.2d 614, 616 n. 1 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-15\">On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ... (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). A movant seeking relief under Rule 60(b)(6) must show extraordinary circumstances, justifying the reopening of a final judgment. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2649, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(2), the statutory provision upon which Williams argues that his \u00a7 2255 motion was timely, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-17\">(f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-18\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>mental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">A movant must show that the alleged impediment \u201ccaused an actual harm, or in other words, unconstitutionally prevented him from exercising that fundamental right of access to the courts in order to attack his sentence or to challenge the conditions of his confinement.\u201d <em>Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1090 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The Supreme Court has held that, if a Rule 60(b) motion seeks to add a new ground for relief or attacks a federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits, it constitutes a habeas corpus claim. <em>Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. at 2648. However, the Court in <em>Gonzalez </em>held that a Rule 60(b) motion that attacks \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings\u201d should not be construed as a \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, if the movant \u201cmerely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error\u2014 for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar,\u201d then he is not asserting a habeas corpus claim. <em>Id. </em>at 532 n. 4, 125 S.Ct at 2648 n. 4. The Rule 60(b) motion at issue in <em>Gonzalez </em>challenged only the district court\u2019s ruling that Gonzalez\u2019s initial 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition had not been timely filed. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 125 S.Ct. at 2650. The Supreme Court concluded that Gonzalez\u2019s motion should not have been construed as a second or successive \u00a7 2254 petition, but nevertheless affirmed after determining that Gonzalez could not demonstrate \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d that were necessary to obtain Rule 60(b) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 125 S.Ct. at 2651.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u201c[E]quitable tolling is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.\u201d <em>Akins, </em>204 F.3d at 1089. Prison \u201clockdowns and periods in which a prisoner is separated from his legal papers are not \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 in which equitable tolling is appropriate.\u201d <em>Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1283 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u201cUnder the law of the case doctrine, both the district court and the court of appeals are bound by findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the court of appeals in a prior appeal of the same case unless (1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to that issue, or (3) the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>97 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. The district court should not have construed Williams\u2019s amended Rule 60(b) motion as an impermissibly successive \u00a7 2255 motion, to the extent that he was arguing that his initial \u00a7 2255 motion was timely because he was entitled to statutory tolling under \u00a7 2255(f)(2). <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532 n. 4, 125 S.Ct. at 2648 n. 4. However, the court\u2019s error was harmless because Williams failed to show that the prison officials\u2019 failure to provide him with his legal files was an unconstitutional impediment that prevented him from accessing the court system by timely filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Akins, </em>204 F.3d at 1090. He also does not address why he was unable to file a \u00a7 2255 motion prior to the prison transfer, which occurred approximately six months after the final judgment. <em>See id. </em>(holding that prisoner\u2019s failure to explain his inability to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion during the seven months prior to a prison lockdown, which was the alleged unconstitutional impediment, did not \u201csupport a finding of actual injury\u201d and was \u201cfatal to his claim of an unconstitutional impediment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Furthermore, we previously resolved against Williams these very same issues that he raises in support of equitable tolling, when he appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his initial \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, we are bound by our prior decision regarding the issues that Williams again raises, pursuant to the law of the case doctrine. <em>See Stinson, </em>97 F.3d at 469. None of the exceptions to this doctrine apply to William\u2019s case because: \u201c (1) a subsequent trial has not produced substantially different evidence; (2) controlling authority has not since made a contrary decision of law applicable to these issues; and (3) our prior decision was not clearly erroneous and would not work manifest injustice.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
