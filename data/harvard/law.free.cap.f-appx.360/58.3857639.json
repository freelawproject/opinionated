Aupont contends that the IJ and BIA erred by concluding that he was not credible. He argues that his testimony, when considered along with the evidence in the record, establishes that he is entitled to withholding of removal and CAT relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s opinion, so we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1283. We apply the \u201csubstantial evidence test\u201d to the BIA\u2019s findings of fact, including its credibility determinations. <em>Kueviakoe v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304 (11th Cir.2009). We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284 (quotation marks omitted). That standard is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA\u2019s findings of fact \u201cmay be reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The government contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s credibility determination because Aupont failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination in his notice of appeal or brief to the BIA. That is wrong. In his notice of appeal to the BIA, Aupont asserted: \u201cI provided testimony which was believable, consistent and sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible and coherent account of the basis or [sic] my fears.\u201d The BIA reviewed the IJ\u2019s credibility findings. It expressly refused to adopt or affirm the IJ\u2019s finding that Aupont\u2019s testimony was not credible on two particular points: the number of siblings that Aupont has in Haiti and whether a sworn statement made to corroborate his persecution claim was prepared by his mother or his father. In all other respects, however, the BIA found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Aupont stated in his asylum application and testified before the IJ that he was a member of a political group in Haiti called Organisation du Peuple en Lutte (OPL). He testified that he was a regional coordinator, and he \u201cmotivate[d] people to join the party.\u201d His application for asylum stated that he worked as a security guard for the City Hall of Port-au-Prince and was \u201ca gun carrying member of the largest opposition party in Haiti.\u201d He testified that as a result of his OPL activities he was threatened by the chimere of Lavalas. According to Aupont\u2019s testimony, four chimere of Lavalas attacked him on December 15, 2005, when he was on his way to work. Aupont\u2019s asylum application, however, did not mention the December 15 incident, and Aupont offered no police report to corroborate his testimony. He testified on cross-examination that he did not refer to the December 15 attack in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>application because he had no documentation to corroborate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Aupont did state in his application that on December 19, 2005, \u201ca group of armed individuals who clearly intended to do [him] harm\u201d invaded his family\u2019s home. Aupont escaped, but the intruders ransacked the house and raped his sister. The record contains evidence that: Aupont was a member of OPL; unidentified, armed people raided his house; and his sister was raped. Nothing in the record, however, compels the conclusion that the assailants were Aupont\u2019s political opponents or that the attack was related to a protected ground. His asylum application does not identify the \u201cgroup of armed individuals who clearly intended to do [him] harm\u201d and does not assert that they were persecuting him on account of his political opinion. The record contains his mother\u2019s sworn statement \u201cthat her house had been the object of an act of vandalism caused by a group of unidentified individuals\u201d on the night of December 19, 2005. The affidavit states that \u201ca group of armed individuals\u201d broke into the family\u2019s home and asked for Aupont, who escaped by way of the back door. The affidavit does not identify the intruders and does not indicate that their actions were on account of Aupont\u2019s political opinion. Aupont \u201cfail[ed] to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution\u201d on account of a protected ground. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007). Therefore, he failed to establish that he is entitled to withholding of removal. <em>See id., see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination also undermines the uncorroborated testimony on which Aupont\u2019s CAT claim relies: that the police refused to assist him after the alleged December 15 assault, which he did not mention in his asylum application. Other than his own allegations, he has not provided any evidence to establish that the police were aware that he was being tortured and that they breached their duty to intervene. <em>See Rodriguez Morales, </em>488 F.3d at 891 (explaining that \u201cto qualify for CAT relief, an alien must demonstrate a likelihood that he will be tortured at the \u2018acquiescence\u2019 of the government, meaning that the government was aware of the torture, yet breached its responsibility to intervene\u201d). The record does not compel the conclusion that Aupont qualifies for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. The BIA and the IJ denied Aupont's claim for asylum because his application was untimely and he failed to satisfy the requirements for any exception to the one-year filing deadline. We lack jurisdiction to review those findings. <em>Mendoza v. United States Att'y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201c[S]ection 1158(a)(3) divests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
