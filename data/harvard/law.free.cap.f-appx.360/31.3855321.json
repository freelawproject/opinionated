Mann, a <em>pro se </em>prisoner, appeals the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint alleging an Eighth Amendment violation for cruel and unusual punishment, pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). On appeal, Mann contends that: (1) the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim after it determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>that Mann was not entitled to damages for mental anguish and suffering because he failed to allege sufficient physical injury; and (2) he is entitled to declaratory relief in the form of a prison transfer. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>an appeal from a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, taking all factual allegations as true. <em>Douglas v. Yates, </em>535 F.3d 1316, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2008). The same standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) also govern \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissals. <em>Id. </em>at 1320. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Boxer X v. Harris, </em>437 F.3d 1107, 1110 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201cNo Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). \u201cIn order to avoid dismissal under \u00a7 1997e(e), a prisoner\u2019s claims for emotional or mental injury must be accompanied by allegations of physical injuries that are greater than de minimis.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir.2002). We have previously held that a forced \u201cdry shave\u201d only amounted to a <em>de minimis </em>injury. <em>Harris v. Garner, </em>190 F.3d 1279, 1286-87 (11th Cir.1999), <em>vacated, </em>197 F.3d 1059, <em>reinstated in relevant part, </em>216 F.3d 970, 972 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc); see also Nolin v. Isbell, </em>207 F.3d 1253, 1258 n. 4 (11th Cir.2000) (bruises received during an arrest were non-actionable <em>de minimis </em>injury). Even though \u00a7 1997e(e) bars damages for mental or emotional injury, it does not affect the availability of declaratory or injunctive relief. <em>See Harris, </em>190 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Here, under our case law, the injuries that Mann complains of \u2014 including the vague injuries to his back, the scrapes and marks on his knees and legs, the lack of personal items, the lapse of time in reordering medication, the window-cleaning assignment, and the discontinuance of his pass for showers twice a day \u2014 amount to <em>de minimis </em>physical injuries. <em>See Nolin, </em>207 F.3d at 1258 n. 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 1997e(e), therefore, bars Mann\u2019s claim for damages as a result of mental anguish and suffering. <em>See Mitchell, </em>294 F.3d at 1312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Moreover, Mann contends that all of the alleged abuse by prison officials stemmed from one initial complaint at his former prison, for which he already received a prison transfer. Thus, Mann\u2019s current request for declaratory relief in the form of a prison transfer is moot. <em>See Smith v. Allen, </em>502 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe general rule in our circuit is that a transfer or a release of a prisoner from prison will moot that prisoner\u2019s claims for injunctive and declaratory relief.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mann\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">. Mann's alleged eye infection and his injuries stemming from his tooth extraction were not alleged in his complaint and therefore have been abandoned. <em>See Skinner v. City of Miami, </em>62 F.3d 344, 348 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201c[A]s a general rale, an appellate court will not consider a legal issue or theory raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ak\">. In addition, Mann's motion to submit supplemental records is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
