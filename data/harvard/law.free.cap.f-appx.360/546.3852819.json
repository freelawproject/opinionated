Moore alleges that she was terminated from her position as the chief juvenile probation officer in the Reeves/Loving County Juvenile Probation Department on account of her race and gender. On appeal, Moore only presses her race discrimination claims and argues that the trial court erred in holding that: (1) Reeves County was not Moore\u2019s employer; (2) Moore was not an employee under Title VII; and (3) Moore did not raise any fact issue regarding whether the Reeves County Juvenile Board\u2019s reason for terminating her was pretextual. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b572-25\">Louise Moore was the chief juvenile probation officer in the Reeves/Loving County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Juvenile Probation Department (the \u201cDepartment\u201d). She was appointed to her position by the Reeves/Loving County Juvenile Probation Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d). In her role, Moore directed and supervised the juvenile services program. The Board holds the ultimate responsibility of supervising and managing the Department, including decisions about whether to terminate employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">In late 2005, a dispute arose between Moore and a subordinate juvenile probation officer, Mary Ann Acosta. In December 2005, Moore prepared a critical evaluation of Acosta that prevented Acosta from receiving her maximum compensation under the Department\u2019s new incentive pay program. In response, Acosta filed a formal grievance with the Board. In January 2006, the Board heard Acosta\u2019s grievance. However, instead of taking formal action on the grievance, a member of the Board agreed to meet personally with Moore and Acosta on a regular basis in an effort to resolve the conflicts between Moore and Acosta and improve the performance of the Department. Moore and Acosta both agreed with this plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">However, in July 2006, Acosta notified Moore that she intended to submit another grievance to the Board. In response, Moore discharged Acosta for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d Acosta appealed Moore\u2019s decision to the Board, and the Board reversed the discharge and reinstated Acosta at a meeting on August 8, 2006. At an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d on August 18, 2006, the Board hired a consultant, Nancy Baird, to evaluate the Department\u2019s problems and make findings and recommendations to the Board. The Board informed employees, including Moore, about the steps it was taking to resolve the problems within the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">After reviewing the Department in August 2006, Baird presented findings and recommendations which the Board adopted at its meeting on September 1, 2006. These recommendations included specific actions that Moore and Acosta should take to improve communications and resolve conflict. Specifically, Baird recommended that Moore attend management training; prepare a plan of action to improve communication in the Department; and meet individually with the Department staff to review their professional development plans. Baird also recommended that Acosta develop a plan of action to improve communication with Moore. To follow-up on these recommendations, Baird was to complete a subsequent evaluation and report for the board forty-five days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">After conducting her follow-up evaluation, Baird presented her findings and recommendations to the Board on October 20, 2006. In her November 5, 2006, written report detailing these findings, Baird noted that Moore had not followed several of her recommendations. Specifically, Baird determined that Moore had attended some training sessions, but she had not attended appropriate training; Moore had developed an insufficient plan of action to improve Department communications because the plan did not include specifics, measurable goals, or timelines; Moore had neither delivered professional development plans to all Department staff as recommended nor reviewed professional development plans individually with all Department staff; and Moore had not met with Acosta to discuss Acosta\u2019s professional development plan. Further, Baird found that Acosta had complied with her recommendations because she had developed a detailed plan of action, which she provided to Baird. Based on these findings, the Board voted to terminate Moore at its October 20, 2006, meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Moore properly exhausted administrative remedies, received her right to sue letter, and filed suit in federal court on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>July 17, 2008, alleging race and sex discrimination under Title VII and \u00a7 1981. The Board and Reeves County filed their motion for summary judgment in March 2009. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Board and Reeves County on April 30, 2009, and entered final judgment in favor of the defendants the same day. Moore now appeals the grant of summary judgment on her race discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review and Title VII, \u00a7 1981 Framework</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court.\u201d <em>Pegram v. Honeywell, Inc., </em>361 F.3d 272, 278 (5th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.CivP. 56(c); <em>Pegram, </em>361 F.3d at 278. \u201cA dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine\u2019 if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Davis v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>383 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). The summary judgment test for discrimination claims under \u00a7 1981 is the same as the test for discrimination claims under Title VII. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Since Moore does not allege any direct evidence of discrimination, we apply the familiar <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). \u201cTo survive summary judgment under <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the plaintiff must first present evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317. If the plaintiff presents a prima facie case of discrimination, then an inference of discrimination arises, and the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, nondis-eriminatory reason for the underlying employment action. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the employer is able to state a legitimate rationale for its employment action, the inference of discrimination disappears and the plaintiff must present evidence that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was mere pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">\u201cOn summary judgment, [at the pretext stage], the plaintiff must substantiate his claim of pretext through evidence demonstrating that discrimination lay at the heart of the employer\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Price v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>283 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cTo carry this burden, the plaintiff must produce substantial evidence indicating that the proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Laxton v. Gap, Inc., </em>333 F.3d 572, 578 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cEvidence is substantial if it is of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Pretext may be established \u201ceither through evidence of disparate treatment or by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is false or \u2018unworthy of credence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578 (quoting <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000)). \u201cTo raise an inference of discrimination, the plaintiff may compare his treatment to that of nearly identical, similarly situated individuals.\u201d <em>Bryant v. Compass Group USA Inc., </em>413 F.3d 471, 478 (5th Cir.2005). However, to establish disparate treatment, a plaintiff must show that the employer gave preferential treatment to another employee under \u201cnearly identical\u201d circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Alternatively, \u201c[a]n explanation is false or unworthy of credence if it is not the real reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Laxton, </em>333 F.3d at 578. \u201cWhether summary judgment is appropriate depends on numerous factors, including \u2018the strength of the plaintiffs prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the employer\u2019s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer\u2019s case and that properly may be considered.\u2019 \u201d Price, 283 F.3d at 720 (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148-49, 120 S.Ct. 2097).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\n<em>B. Moore\u2019s Race Discrimination Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Both parties agree that Moore has made a prima facie case of discrimination and that the Board has met its burden of offering a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason as to why Moore was discharged. Accordingly, the question before us is whether Moore has raised a fact issue regarding whether the Board\u2019s proffered reason for Moore\u2019s termination \u2014 that Moore did not follow Baird\u2019s recommendations \u2014 was pre-textual.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Moore argues that the Board\u2019s reasons for firing her were pretextual for two reasons. First, Moore contends that she received \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d because a subordinate juvenile probation officer, Acosta, also did not comply with Baird\u2019s recommendations and was not fired. Second, Moore contends that the Board\u2019s reasons for firing her are \u201cunworthy of credence\u201d both because the consultant\u2019s recommendations were not finalized until after Moore was terminated and because the final written report was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We are not persuaded by Moore\u2019s contention that Moore was subject to disparate treatment because Acosta was not fired. At the time, Moore was the chief juvenile probation officer and Acosta was a subordinate juvenile probation officer. As such, Moore, by her own admission, is vested with different responsibilities than Acosta. Further, Baird\u2019s report, which formed the basis for the Board\u2019s decision, indicated that Acosta complied with Baird\u2019s recommendations and that Moore did not. Though Moore contends that she actually did comply with Baird\u2019s recommendations, Baird concluded otherwise and the record supports Baird\u2019s conclusion. Specifically, the record shows that the Board warned Moore that the training she proposed to attend was not appropriate; that Moore\u2019s plan of action does not list measurable goals and timelines; and that Moore did not meet individually with all employees. Additionally, Moore\u2019s statements that Acosta did not comply with Baird\u2019s recommendations are conclu-sory and unsupported by any evidence. Accordingly, we conclude that Moore has not presented the kind of substantial evidence required to show disparate treatment of similarly situated employees in nearly identical situations such that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the Board\u2019s reason for terminating Moore was pretextual. <em>Bryant, </em>413 F.3d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">We are also not persuaded by Moore\u2019s contention that the Board\u2019s proffered reason for terminating her was \u201cunworthy of credence\u201d because Baird did not finalize her report until after Moore was fired and because Baird\u2019s report contained inaccuracies. While Baird did not finalize her report until after Moore\u2019s termination, the record reflects that Baird was present at the October 20, 2006, meeting of the Board and that Baird made a presentation regarding her follow-up review of the Department. Further, Moore\u2019s contention that the report is inaccurate is not supported by the record. In her appellant brief, Moore only reiterates actions that she took after Baird\u2019s recommendations and makes conclusory statements that she complied with Baird\u2019s recommendations. However, as discussed above, the record supports Baird\u2019s determination that Moore had not complied with her recommendations. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Moore has failed to present the kind of substantial evidence necessary to support a reasonable factfinder\u2019s determination that the Board\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason for Moore\u2019s termination was unworthy of credence and thus pretextual. <em>Price, </em>283 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Because Moore fails to meet her burden showing that the Board\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reason for terminating her was pretextual, summary judgment in favor of the Board and Reeves County on Moore\u2019s discrimination claims is appropriate. Thus, even if we assume that Moore is correct (in arguing to sustain her Title VII claim) that Reeves County is her employer or that she is an employee of the Board and Reeves County under Title VII, Moore still has not shown that the Board\u2019s proffered reason for firing her is pretextual, and as such, Moore\u2019s discrimination claims under both Title VII and \u00a7 1981 against the Board and Reeves County fail. Accordingly, we need not resolve Moore\u2019s two other issues on appeal \u2014 whether Reeves County was Moore\u2019s employer and whether Moore was an \u201cemployee\u201d for Title VII purposes \u2014 to conclude that summary judgment in favor of the Board and Reeves County is appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
