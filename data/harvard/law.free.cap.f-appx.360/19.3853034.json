Because the BIA failed to consider additional documentary evidence submitted by Bwalu in support of her application, we GRANT the petition and REMAND to the BIA with instructions to evaluate her claim for relief in light of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Bwalu, a native and citizen of Tanzania, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief based on political opinion and membership in a particular social group on 18 June 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Administrative Record (\u201cAR\u201d) at 218-28. Bwalu alleged in her application that in 1999 she joined the Civic United Front (\u201cCUF\u201d), a political party whose goal was to \u201cfight the corruption of the government [in] a peaceful way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. She stated that on 26-27 January 2000, Tanzanian police fired into an organized CUF street demonstration, killing fifty-six people, including three of her friends. <em>Id. </em>Two days later, the police entered her house, beat her children, and beat her nearly to death. <em>Id. </em>Bwalu subsequently testified during her removal proceedings that she prepared her own asylum application in Swahili and later had it translated into English. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78. During a 28 January 2005 interview with an asylum official, Bwalu made fifteen miscellaneous changes to her asylum application, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the addition of an allegation that \u201cTanzania police beat her once [at] her house regarding her activities [with] CAF [sic].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218-23; <em>see also id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-16\">The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cCIS\u201d) served Bwalu with a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) in February 2005, charging her with entering into the United States without inspection by an Immigration Officer. <em>Id. </em>at 250-51. At an initial hearing before an IJ, Bwalu admitted the allegations in the NTA and conceded removability. <em>Id. </em>at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-17\">On 26 June 2006, Bwalu filed an amended statement in support of her asylum application in which she alleged that after she fled the January 2000 street demonstration, five members of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (\u201cCCM\u201d) political party captured, raped, and beat her nearly to death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 209-11. Bwalu attached to her amendment a 26 January 2000 police report, which stated that Bwalu was raped by unknown individuals \u201cbelieved to have political motivation[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214. Bwalu also included a 2 May 2006 statement from the CUF confirming that she had been an \u201cactive member of [the] party ... since 2-7-1999.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Bwalu amended her statement once more prior to her 17 April 2007 removal hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 174-75. In this statement, Bwalu again recounted her 26 January 2000 rape and alleged additionally that: (1) CCM threatened to beat and kill her on five separate occasions; (2) members of CCM attacked her twice; and (3) she went into hiding for several years. <em>Id. </em>at 176. Bwalu further stated that she feared she would be killed by CCM if she returned to Tanzania. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">At her removal hearing, Bwalu testified that in January 2000, she attended a campaign rally in support of the CUF presidential candidate who was running in the upcoming October 2000 election. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14. Six hundred people, including members of both CUF and the ruling party, CCM, were present. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 115. As the CUF candidate was addressing the crowd, members of CCM disrupted the meeting and called the police. <em>Id. </em>at 115-16, 122. In the chaos that ensued, CCM \u201cpolice,\u201d armed with guns, opened fire and killed fifty-six people. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 122. Bwalu testified that between three and five of these policemen captured her, raped her, and left her unconscious. <em>Id. </em>at 116, 121. After being discovered by some passers-by, she was taken to the hospital, where doctors checked her \u201cprivate parts\u201d and treated her with antibiotics. <em>Id. </em>at 116-18, 125. Later that evening, Bwalu went to the police and reported the rape. <em>Id. </em>at 125. When asked why she reported the incident to the police if it was the police who had raped her, Bwalu responded that there were two different groups of police \u2014 the \u201cFFU, that kill people, and ... the other police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Bwalu testified that she remained in Tanzania for two years after her rape because she lacked funds to leave. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 124. During this time, CCM members continued to look for her. <em>Id. </em>at 119\u201421. Bwalu stated that she could not return to Tanzania because the CCM would beat her and \u201cprobably ... kill [her].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. She further stated that she believed she would be tortured if she returned because CCM had tortured, beaten, and raped her before, and because she had been told that other people who had returned in 2005 had been tortured and even killed by CCM. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">In response to the IJ\u2019s concern that Bwalu failed to include the rape incident in her original asylum application, Bwalu, through counsel, stated that her application had been completed \u201cby a non-lawyer\u201d and \u201cwas not properly prepared.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137. Bwalu further explained that she did not disclose the rape to the asylum officer during the interview because she \u201cwent to [the] interview by [her]self without a lawyer,\u201d \u201cwasn\u2019t very fluent in English,\u201d and \u201cwas very ashamed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137, 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">In support of her claim for relief, Bwalu submitted into evidence the 2005 and 2006 Tanzanian Country Reports. The 2005 report explained that because 2005 was a presidential election year, government harassment of political opposition parties had increased. <em>Id. </em>at 183. The report documented instances of security forces firing tear gas and live ammunition at CUF supporters in order to disperse political demonstrations. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 191-92. The 2006 Country Report stated that although harassment of political parties significantly decreased in 2006, \u201crape contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ued to be a serious problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">In an oral decision, the IJ denied relief after making an explicit adverse credibility determination based on Bwalu\u2019s failure to mention in her initial asylum application or during the subsequent asylum interview that she had been raped by CCM police. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55. On appeal, the BIA rendered its own decision upholding the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and finding that Bwalu\u2019s explanations for failing to disclose her rape were implausible. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. Specifically, the BIA noted that Bwa-lu\u2019s claim that she was embarrassed and ashamed was belied by her testimony that she reported the rape to Tanzanian police immediately after it happened. <em>Id. </em>The BIA further noted that Bwalu blamed the omission on the person who prepared her asylum application, yet had testified that she prepared her own asylum application. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The BIA concluded that \u201c[b]e-cause the central evidence of a threat to [Bwalu] depended on her credibility,\u201d the adverse credibility determination precluded her from satisfying the burden of proof necessary for establishing eligibility for asylum or the more stringent burden of proof associated with withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>With respect to Bwalu\u2019s CAT claim, the BIA found that it likewise failed to the extent that it was predicated on the same central facts as her asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>Id. </em>The BIA held alternatively that CAT relief was due to be denied because there was no evidence that Bwalu faced a clear probability of torture if returned to Tanzania. <em>Id. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">On appeal, Bwalu argues that the BIA erred in relying solely on its adverse credibility determination, without considering the additional documentary evidence she submitted, in denying her application for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Where, as here, the BIA issues its own decision and does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision or reasoning, we review the BIA\u2019s decision only. <em>See Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). We review legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and factual findings, including credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Under this highly deferential standard, we view the record in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision and are bound by that decision unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">To establish eligibility for asylum, the applicant must, with credible evidence, demonstrate that he was (1) persecuted in the past on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a statutorily-protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>see also Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1231 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain this burden. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). On the other hand, an adverse credibility determination alone is sufficient to support the denial of relief, especially where the applicant produces no evidence other than her own testimony. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Where the applicant does produce other evidence of persecution, however, the BIA <em>must </em>consider that evidence and may not rely solely on an adverse credibility determination to deny relief. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that \u201can adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the [BIA]\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by an asylum applicant\u201d); <em>see also Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1347 (11th Cir.2008) (noting IJ\u2019s obligation to consider petitioner\u2019s documentary evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">In this case, Bwalu produced evidence other than her testimony in support of her asylum application, including country reports detailing political turmoil and incidents of violence between the CUF and CCM, a letter confirming Bwalu\u2019s CUF membership, and, most significantly, a police report stating that Bwalu was raped on 26 January 2000 by individuals with political motivations. The BIA failed to refer to, let alone evaluate, this documentary evidence and instead relied solely on its adverse credibility determination to deny relief. This was error. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. Because the police report, if authenticated, would corroborate Bwalu\u2019s testimony that she was raped on the day of the January 2000 demonstration, and because the BIA based its adverse credibility determination exclusively on Bwalu\u2019s failure to include the rape in her initial asylum application, we remand to the BIA for reconsideration of its credibility determination in light of this corroborating evidence. <em>See, e.g., Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1320 (vacating BIA\u2019s order denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen where \u201cBIA\u2019s decision overlooked ... other record evidence that corroborate^] [petitioner's claim\u201d); <em>Gui Cun Liu v. Ashcroft, </em>372 F.3d 529, 531-35 (3d Cir.2004) (remanding to BIA for reconsideration of credibility issue where IJ did not make any reference to abortion certificates that, if genuine, would have corroborated petitioner\u2019s testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Bwalu petitions us for review of the BIA\u2019s decision denying her claims for relief under the INA and the CAT. For the foregoing reasons, we GRANT Bwalu\u2019s petition for review, VACATE the decision of the BIA, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\">.
