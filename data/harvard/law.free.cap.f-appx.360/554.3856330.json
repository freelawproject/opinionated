Cruz asserts that the district court plainly erred when it increased his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2008) based on his previous Utah conviction for second degree burglary. He argues that second degree burglary in Utah does not constitute the enumerated offense of burglary as defined in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) and thus is not a crime of violence for purposes of the sentencing enhancement provided in \u00a7 2L1.2(b) (1) (A) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-25\">Cruz concedes that our review is for plain error only. We \u201cfind plain error only if: (1) there was error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhen these elements are present, this Court may exercise its discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Section \u00a7 2L1.2 authorizes a 16-level increase if the defendant was deported following a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d The commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as either an enumerated felony, including \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d or a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. (l)(B)(iii)). The Government concedes that Utah\u2019s second degree burglary offense does not have as an element the use of physical force against another person and that the issue on appeal is whether Cruz\u2019s prior conviction was the enumerated felony of \u201cburglary of a dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Because \u00a7 2L1.2 does not define the enumerated offense \u201cburglary of a dwelling,\u201d federal courts must do so. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Ochoa, </em>386 F.3d 639, 642-43 (5th Cir.2004). To arrive at a definition, this court uses the categorical approach set forth in <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 592-98, 110 S.Ct. 2143. <em>See Dominguez-Ochoa, </em>386 F.3d at 642-46. Under that approach, federal courts are to determine the generic, contemporary meaning of an enumerated offense irrespective of the label placed on the offense by state criminal codes. <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 592, 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143. In <em>Taylor, </em>the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the term \u201cburglary\u201d under the firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>See id. </em>at 577, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The Court determined that \u201cthe generic, contemporary meaning of burglary contains at least the following elements: an unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with the intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143. <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>definition of burglary controls when defining the burglary part of burglary of a dwelling under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Ortega-Gonzaga, </em>490 F.3d 393, 395 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Cruz argues that Utah\u2019s burglary statute permits the formation of the requisite criminal intent after the trespass has occurred and been completed. He argues that it is therefore outside of the \u201cgeneric, contemporary definition\u201d of burglary as set forth in <em>Taylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">At the time that Cruz was sentenced, the law on this issue was not settled. Thus, any error in the district court\u2019s assessment of the 16-level enhancement based on Cruz\u2019s prior Utah conviction for burglary of a dwelling was not clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>415 F.3d 452, 455 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
