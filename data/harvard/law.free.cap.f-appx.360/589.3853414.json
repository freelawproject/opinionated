This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The judgment Ramirez-Alvarez seeks to appeal was issued by a federal magistrate judge, and a federal magistrate judge\u2019s judgment of conviction and sentence may be appealed only to a federal district court. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402; Fed. R.Crim. P. 58(g)(2); <em>see also United States v. Baxter, </em>19 F.3d 155, 156 (4th Cir.1994). Thus, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-20\">Ramirez-Alvarez\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
