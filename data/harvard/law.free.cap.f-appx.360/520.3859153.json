Mitchell argues that the district court erroneously calculated his base offense level. He argues that the district court\u2019s use of the definition of \u201coffense\u201d provided by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. (n.l(H)) was erroneous and resulted in an artificially high guidelines range. He posits that \u201coffense\u201d refers to the \u201coffense of conviction,\u201d and argues that, as such, it restricts a sentencing court\u2019s calculation of the base offense level to consideration of only the specific conduct, or admitted facts, underlying the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">To the extent that Mitchell is arguing that the district court\u2019s sentencing discretion was curtailed by the factual stipulation he entered, he is incorrect. The Guidelines specifically provide that a district court is not bound by the factual stipulations made by the parties, \u201cbut may with the aid of the presentence report, determine the facts relevant to sentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This remains true even though the Guidelines are now advisory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">To the extent that Mitchell is arguing that the district is prohibited from using other offense conduct to determine his base offense level, his argument is likewise unavailing. \u201cThe guidelines provide that, in determining the amount of drugs to be attributed for a base offense level, the district court may consider other offenses than those underlying the offense of conviction as long as the offenses constitute relevant conduct as defined in the guidelines.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">Mitchell does not challenge the validity of the drug amounts set forth in the PSR or the district court\u2019s calculation of the amount of drugs for which he should be held responsible. Rather, he challenges the district court\u2019s authority to consider the information relied upon. For the reasons set forth above, Mitchell\u2019s arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The district court committed no procedural error, and Mitchell has failed to demonstrate that his within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-9\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6B 1.4(d), p.s.; <em>see also Graham v.
