Defendant appeals the district court\u2019s decision to hold him without bail pursuant to 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7553. Defendant argues that the court erred by: (1) holding defendant without bail despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>insufficient evidence of guilt; and (2) refusing to consider evidence of alternatives to holding defendant without bail. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\u00b6 2. Defendant is charged with burglary and kidnapping. \u201cKidnapping is punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment or a fine of not more than $50,000.00, or both.\u201d 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 2405(b). The Vermont Constitution and 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7553 provide that a person may be held without bail when charged with an offense that is punishable by life imprisonment if \u201cthe evidence of guilt is great.\u201d Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 40(1); 13 V.S.A. \u00a7 7553. Section 7553 requires the district court to consider only \u201cwhether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, can fairly and reasonably show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Duff, </em>151 Vt. 433, 439, 563 A.2d 258, 263 (1989). The district court, after an evidentiary hearing, found that the evidence against defendant on the charge of kidnapping was great and held defendant without bail. We review this determination \u201cto decide if the State has substantial, admissible evidence legally sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>State v. Turnbaugh, </em>174 Vt. 532, 534, 811 A.2d 662, 665 (2002) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\u00b6 3. Defendant first argues that the evidence presented to the district court was insufficient to support holding him without bail. The State alleges that on March 19, 2006, defendant, along with two co-defendants who are not parties to this appeal, entered the home of Richard Lavalette, in Colchester, Vermont, where they tied up Mr. Lavalette and threatened him with a knife while they burglarized his home. At the bail hearing, the court received several affidavits and heard eyewitness testimony from Kayla Couture, who allegedly drove the three co-defendants to Mr. Lavalette\u2019s home on the night in question. Ms. Couture\u2019s identification of defendant was the only evidence directly linking defendant to the kidnapping. Defendant argues that because Ms. Couture was an accomplice to the crime, her testimony alone is insufficient to meet the statutory and constitutional standard that the evidence of guilt must be great. We disagree and hold that Ms. Couture\u2019s identification of defendant was \u201csubstantial, admissible evidence legally sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u00b6 4. Defendant bases his argument on the evidentiary standard for probable cause to support a warrant. He argues that the standard the State must meet to support holding a defendant without bail under \u00a7 7553 must be higher than the probable cause standard. Our probable cause standard relies on a two-pronged test established in two United States Supreme Court decisions, <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). See <em>State v. Goldberg, </em>2005 VT 41, \u00b6 9, 178 Vt. 96, 872 A.2d 378 (stating that although it has since been abandoned by the federal courts, we continue to use this test because it \u201cstrikes an appropriate balance\u201d between individual rights and the State\u2019s interest in crime prevention). \u201cThe first prong requires an analysis of the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge, while the second examines his or her veracity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant argues that according to the second prong of the test, Ms. Couture\u2019s testimony was inherently unreliable because of her own involvement in the crime, and because she initially denied having driven the three co-defendants to Mr. Lavalette\u2019s house before admitting her involvement. We hold that Ms. Couture\u2019s testimony was nonetheless reliable because her statement to the police was against her penal interest. See <em>id. </em>\u00b6 11 (\u201c[PJarticular information is generally deemed inherently reliable if the informant'acted against penal interest.\u201d). Despite the fact that Ms. Couture has not been charged, it was against her interest to admit driving the co-defendants to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>house. The court was entitled to consider Ms. Couture\u2019s testimony as evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, and this evidence was sufficient to meet the evidentiary standard of \u00a7 7553.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\u00b6 5. Defendant next contends that despite the determination that evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was great, the court was required to consider whether there were \u201calternative measures to holding without bail that would reasonably ensure the appearance by defendant.\u201d <em>Turnbaugh, </em>174 Vt. at 534-35, 811 A.2d at 666. While defendant is correct that the court did not consider alternative measures, defendant did not request such consideration. Such a request must be made to the district court in the first instance. This question is thus not properly before us, and we will not consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
