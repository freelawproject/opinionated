Hewitt, Respondent, <em>v. </em>Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-6\">Trust \u2014 provision of deed of trust providing for selection of trustees of Cooper Union \u2014 meaning and eSect of provision that \u201c oldest lineal male descendant \u201d of grantor should be trustee of corporation \u2014 such provision means that oldest lineal male descendant of the oldest line shall be entitled to be a trustee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-7\">1. While in various statutes and by various authors the word \u201c lineal \u201d is sometimes unnecessarily used to qualify the word \u201c descendant \u201d for the purpose of emphasizing the fact that a descendant of the body is meant rather than a collateral, yet in d cisions relating to primogeniture the word \u201c lineal \u201d had a real significance distinct and separate from the word \u201c descendant,\u201d and was not used merely for the purpose of indicating that the word \u201c descendant \u201d meant issue and not a collateral.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b421-8\">2. Statutes (L. 1857, ch. 31; L. 1857, eh. 149, and L. 1859, eh. 279) passed to enable the philanthropist Peter Cooper to found and establish a scientific institution in the city of New York provided that the powers of the corporation established by authority of said s'tatutes should be exercised by a board of trustees, who were named and consisted of six people, and that \u201c the manner of filling vacancies in the board of trustees \u201d should be as provided in the deed of property to the institution to be executed by Mr. Cooper. This provision in the deed provided for a board of six trustees, consisting in the first instance of those named in the statute and \u201c that the five survivors of the said six trustees above named shall constitute the first board of trustees consisting of five members; that every succeeding vacancy in said board of trustees shall be filled by the surviving or remaining trustees by ballot * * * and that the oldest lineal male descendant of Peter Cooper shall be a trustee <em>ex gratia, </em>unless he be a trustee by virtue of original appointment herein made, or by election as herein provided. * * * If such oldest lineal male descendant of Peter Cooper be not a trustee by virtue of such original appointment or subsequent election, then and in such ease, and until another vacancy shall occur in the said board of trustees by the death or removal of a trustee other than such oldest lineal male descendant of Peter Cooper, the number of such trustees shall be six.\u201d When the Cooper act was drawn it must be assumed that the Legislature and Mr. Cooper and his attorney were acquainted with the law relating to primogeniture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and to the rules governing it, to which the rules adopted by Mr. Cooper for selecting a trustee were more or less akin; under these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that the word \u201c lineal \u201d had a significance such as was given to it in the rules of primogeniture and that it was not used merely to indicate that \u201c descendant \u201d did not mean a collateral.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b422-6\">3. If in construing this clause it is assumed that in the statute and the clause the words composing it were used with accuracy and each word is given its full and exact meaning, the word \u201c descendant \u201d would indicate a descendant from the body of Mr. Cooper and not a collateral, and the word \u201c lineal \u201d would refer to the line of descent leading from Mr. Cooper to such descendant. And when these two words \u201c lineal \u201d and \u201c descendant \u201d were qualified by the word \u201c oldest <em>\u201d </em>the conclusion is that the clause meant the oldest male descendant in the oldest line of descent. <em>(Thellusson Case, </em>7 H. L. Cas. 429, followed.)</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b422-7\">4. There is evidence that, in making the provision for the selection of trustees, Mr. Cooper gave to the word \u201c lineal \u201d important and accurate significance for, whereas the earliest act provided for a trustee who should be the \u201c oldest male descendant of legal age,\u201d there was incorporated in the final deed and act the word \u201c lineal,\u201d thereby naturally suggesting and adding the feature of line of descent, thus giving to the word \u201c lineal \u201d the same meaning and force as would have been given to it in a similar clause under the common law in a case of primogeniture. Under this construction, and the facts stated, Peter Cooper Bryce, being the grandson of the older son of Peter Cooper, is \u201c the oldest lineal male descendant \u201d of Peter Cooper and, as he is already a trustee by election, the plaintiff Edward R. Hewitt, the grandson of the younger son of Peter Cooper, cannot be, under the provisions of the deed, a trustee <em>ex gratia.</em></headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b422-8\"><em>Hewitt </em>v. <em>Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, </em>207 App. Div. 256, reversed.</history>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b422-9\">(Argued April 16, 1924;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3G\">decided June 3, 1924.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-10\">Appeal, by permission, from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the- Supreme Court .in the first judicial department, entered December 14, 1923, in favor of plaintiff upon the submission of a controversy under sections 546-548 of the Civil Practice Act.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-11\"><em>Henry B.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_q\">This appeal involves the question of respondent\u2019s right to be selected as one of the trustees of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">In 1857 an act (L. 1857, ch. 31) was passed <em>\u201c </em>to enable Peter Cooper to found a scientific institution in the City of New York.\u201d After somewhat brief amendments made by another act (L. 1857, ch. 149) passed at a later date in 1857, an act was passed in 1859 (L. 1859, ch. 279) entitled <em>\u201c </em>An amendatory act \u201d of the original statute but really covering the entire subject and which is the act now before us. Only one of its provisions is directly involved and, therefore, we shall summarize it very briefly. It authorizes Peter Cooper to convey to the defendant thereby being created a block of land for the purpose of \u201c founding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>and establishing a public institution in said city (of New York) for the advancement of science, art, philosophy and letters * * * and upon the' trusts, and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the deed \u201d which was to conform in form with that set forth in the act and, also, \u201c for and upon the uses, intents and purposes, and upon the trusts, and subject to the restrictions and conditions \u201d as were thereafter mentioned in the\u2019act. The provision especially involved provided that the powers of the corporation should be exercised by a board of trustees who were named and consisted of six people and that <em>\u201c </em>the manner of filling vacancies in the board of trustees \u201d should be as provided in the deed to be executed by Mr. Cooper and referred to in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The provision in the deed thus referred to and thereafter duly executed and whose terms in reference to the selection of trustees were adopted by the statute provided for a board of six trustees in the first instance and \u201c that the five survivors of the said six trustees above named shall constitute the first board of trustees consisting of five members; that every succeeding vacancy in said board of trustees shall be filled by the surviving or remaining trustees by ballot * * * and that the <em>oldest lineal male descendant </em>of Peter Cooper shall be a trustee <em>ex gratia, </em>unless he be a trustee by virtue of original appointment herein made, or by election as herein provided. * * * If such oldest lineal male descendant of Peter Cooper be not a trustee by virtue of such original appointment or subsequent election, then and in such case, and until another vacancy shall occur in the said, board of trustees by the death or removal of a trustee other than such oldest lineal male descendant of Peter Cooper, the number of such trustees shall be six.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The important words in these provisions and which we are to interpret are those providing for membership in the board of the \u201c oldest lineal male descendant \u201d and in this connection it is to be observed as a matter of some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>importance that in the original act provision was made in certain contingencies for the selection as trustee <em>\u201c </em>of the <em>oldest male descendant </em>of lawful age * * * of the said Peter Cooper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The respondent claims that the contingency has now arisen which entitles him to be selected by defendant as one of its trustees as being the <em>\u201c </em>oldest lineal male descendant \u201d of Mr. Cooper and he thereby comes in conflict with the views of the defendant which has refused to thus select him. The circumstances which precipitate this controversy are as follows: Peter Cooper left two children. One of these was Edward Cooper, who was the older and who left a daughter, Edith Cooper Bryce, who had an only son, Peter Cooper Bryce, who is now one of the board of trustees of defendant by regular election. Mr. Cooper\u2019s younger child was a daughter who became Sarah A. Hewitt and of- her the plaintiff, Edward R. Hewitt, is now the oldest child. He is older than Peter Cooper Bryce who now sits in the board and he claims that mider the provisions of the statute and deed hereinbefore referred to he is, therefore, the oldest lineal male descendant and should be added to the board <em>ex gratia </em>as its sixth member. Thus the fin al contest becomes the one whether Peter Cooper Bryce or Edward R. Hewitt is designated by the words which have been quoted because, of course, if Peter Cooper Bryce is the oldest lineal male descendant and is already sitting in the board there is no place for Edward R. Hewitt. The question is an unusual one and has been argued by counsel on briefs which are both interesting and helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In construing this clause, if we should assume that the counsel, <em>\u201c </em>learned in the law,\u201d who drew Mr. Cooper\u2019s deed (as is stated in the submission) and the Legislature which passed the statute adopting and thus interpreting his language, used with accuracy the words composing this short and important clause and gave to each word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>its full and exact meaning there could be no real doubt that the clause describes as the trustee <em>ex gratia </em>Mr. Bryce and not Mr. Hewitt. On such assumption of the accurate use of words, the word <em>\u201c </em>descendant \u201d would indicate a descendant from the body of Mr. Cooper and not a collateral, and the word \u201c lineal \u201d would refer to the line of descent leading from Mr. Cooper to such \u25a0descendant. And when these two words \u201c lineal \u201d and \u201c descendant \u201d were qualified by the word \u201c oldest \u201d we should easily reach the conclusion that the clause meant the oldest male descendant in the oldest line of descent and that, at the present time, would be Mr. Bryce. Evidence is not wanting that Mr. Cooper and the Legislature did give to the word <em>\u201c </em>lineal \u201d important and accurate significance for, whereas the earliest act provided for a trustee who should <em>\u2022 </em>be the \u201c oldest male descendant of legal age,\u201d we find in the final deed and act the word \u201c lineal \u201d incorporated, thereby naturally suggesting and adding the feature of line of descent.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">La answer to this view, however, it is urged that authors and American writers and statutes have at times made sure of excluding collaterals by adding the word \u201c lineal \u201d in the classification of descendants. There is some force in this suggestion and yet one might hesitate to adopt it in this case. Concededly the use of the word \u201c lineal \u201d in mentioning a descendant of a man is superfluous. <em>(Van Beuren </em>v. <em>Dash, 30 </em>N. Y. 393.) * And while we can understand, as has been the case, that a Legislature or even an author using words somewhat carelessly and certainly redundantly might seek to emphasize the meaning of descendant by prefixing <em>\u201c </em>lineal,\u201d it seems rather improbable that a learned counsel in framing this clause and having before him the objects of such a project as this was would indulge in such pleonasm and use an utterly unnecessary and superfluous word to indicate what had already been sufficiently and accurately designated. It seems more reasonable to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>the word had some real meaning and significance than that it was an idle one carelessly thrown into an important clause which was to regulate the government of what was to become an historical institution reaching far into the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">But if we should assume that under some circumstances redundancy and not accuracy would prevail and that this might have been done, we think that it would be going too far to believe that it was done in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Comment was made at the Appellate Division and is now made by counsel upon the fact that the policy of primogeniture has been rejected as un-American and has never prevailed in this country. Nevertheless Mr. Cooper\u2019s plan in respect of this trustee <em>ex gratia </em>was fundamentally akin to the doctrine of primogeniture. He was providing for the title to an office which necessarily could only go to one person and could not be distributed amongst several and he desired to limit this title to one who was a male and who was the oldest either amongst all descendants or in a particular fine. Thus there were present in his scheme the basic features of the theory of primogeniture with which English law was familiar and American law not so familiar. Without going to the extent of the argument made by appellant that in this case Mr. Cooper\u2019s counsel was Mr. Parsons, of English descent and, therefore, acquainted with English law, we are justified in assuming that both Mr. Cooper and his counsel and the Legislature were acquainted with and understood the common law bearing upon what they were trying to accomplish and were acquainted with the English decisions stating this common law. Apparently, from the briefs, the outstanding decision construing, in connection with the subject of primogeniture, language very similar to that before us was the <em>Thellusson </em>case reported on its last appeal in 7 House of Lords Cases, 429. There, with an abundant wealth of opinions, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was held that in a clause reading \u201c the eldest male lineal descendant \u201d\u2014 a phrase somewhat less favorable to appellant than the one now before us \u2014 the word \u201c lineal \u201d did have a significance distinct and separate from the word \u201c descendant \u201d with which it was connected and that, qualified by the word \u201c eldest \u201d it indicated not only a male descendant but a male descendant in the oldest line of descent. While this case on the appeal which we have mentioned was decided subsequent to the passage of the Cooper statute there had been prior appeals decided before the statute was passed upholding the same view and in addition it was stated in the opinions of the judges on the last appeal that the application and meaning of the word \u201c lineal \u201d in connection with the word \u201c descendant,\u201d which was adopted, was so common and well understood that no well-informed layman would be ignorant of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">So we think that counsel in drafting and the Legislature in adopting the clause before us must be assumed to have known and understood what would be the meaning and significance of the word \u201c lineal \u201d used as it is in this phrase when applied to the theory of primogeniture and that in view of the analogy between the theory of primogeniture and the theory of qualification for the office of trustee which Mr. Cooper was creating, it is fair to believe that the same meaning and force was intended to be given to the word \u201clineal\u201d in the present clause as would have been given to it in a similar clause under the common law in a case of primogeniture. That being so Mr. Bryce and not Mr. Hewitt is described.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Various arguments of convenience are brought into play by counsel on each side for the purpose of influencing the interpretation of the clause, but we do not think .there is any preponderance in weight of those advanced by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On one side it is argued that after a male descendant of what was at the time the oldest line of descent had taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>his place as trustee there might be bom a male child of an older line of descent and in this manner the sitting trustee be displaced. I am not certain whether when one who was at the time the oldest lineal male descendant had taken his place as trustee, he would be displaced by a male descendant of an older line subsequently born. It is not necessary to consider that question. But even if we should assume that that was the law and that in addition the male descendant designated by our interpretation might be an infant and so be incapable for the time being of acting as trustee, we do not think that these inconveniences would equal those which would result from adopting the respondent\u2019s theory. That theory, that the trusteeship was to be filled by the oldest male descendant of Peter Cooper anywhere to be found, might not be troublesome for two or three generations. But certainly at the end of several generations it would be a task of endless difficulty to inventory in all parts of the world all the male descendants of Mr. Cooper and then by a process of careful investigation and comparison determine who was the oldest one of the entire collection with the result, perhaps, of inducting into this trusteeship one who, by reason of excessive old age, would be quite as incapacitated to discharge its duties as one at the other extreme of infancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">For these reasons we think that the judgment should be reversed and judgment granted for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Crane, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
