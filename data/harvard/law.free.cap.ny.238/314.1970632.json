Crane\u2019s Sons Company was a corporation engaged in the business of building and repairing ships and maintaining drydocks for this purpose at Erie Basin, borough of Brooklyn, city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Bernt E. Jaabeck was a carpenter employed as such by Theodore A. Crane\u2019s Sons Company, and living at 270 Sixty-first street, in said borough of Brooklyn. Some time in the spring of T921 Jaabeck had been directed by the foreman of the company to go to the home of Wilbur H. Crane, 1711 Newkirk avenue in Brooklyn, to do carpenter work on the porch of the house. Wilbur Crane was the manager of Theodore A. Crane\u2019s Sons Company, but not an officer or director thereof. He was on the payroll and received a salary as manager. On June 7, 1921, while doing this carpenter work at Wilbur Crane\u2019s home, Jaabeck tripped over a cord on the lawn and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>sustained such injuries that he died therefrom on the 5th day of December, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On other occasions; carpenters employed by the Theodore A. Crane\u2019s So/ns Company had been sent to do carpenter work at the homes of the officials of the company. The arrangement between the company and these officials was that the owner of the house should pay the employee while he was at work upon the place. The employee was not a <em>party </em>to such arrangements. In this case Jaabeck had besen off the payroll of the company for a portion of the time that he was working on Wilbur Crane\u2019s house. At the time of his injury, however, he was back on the pay; 'oil, and had been for about a week. Jaabeck had been in the employ of the company as a carpenter for about six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Pursuant to the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 67) the Theodore A. Crane\u2019s Sons Company had taken out a compensation policy with the Royal Indemnity Company, respondent in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">After the death of JTaabeck,his widow, Kristense Jaabeck, on behalf of herself; and minor child, presented a claim to the Industrial Board for compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, After full and complete hearing an award was made to the claimant against both the company and the insurance carrier. On appeal to the Appellate Division, that court sustained the award as to the employer, but reversed and dismissed the claim as to the insurance carrier, on the ground that the policy did not cover the risk.- The employer is the appellant in this court, and the insurance carrier the respondent, the sole question presented beiig whether the terms' of the policy make the insurance carrier liable for this award. The dispute is between the employer and the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">That the State Industrial Board had jurisdiction over the insurance- carrier as well as the employer and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>power to make this award againri the insurance carrier is distinctly stated in subdivision 1 of section 54 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. Pursuant to this provision condition \u201c D \u201d of the policy provides that the obligations of the insurance company \u201c are hereby declared to be the direct obligations and promises of the company to any injured employee covered hereby, or, in the event of his death, to his dependents. \u201d Subdivision 2 of section 54 provides that jurisdiction of the employer shall be jurisdiction of the insurance carrier and that the carrier shall in all things be bound tby the awards rendered against the employer for the payment of compensation. Section23 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law provides for appeal to the Appellate Division and to this court by any party in interest. The State Industrial Board, therefore, had jurisdiction to determine the liability of the insurance carrier under its policy, and either the carrier or the employer being parties in interest - could appeal to the higher courts. <em>(Matter of Phillips </em>v. <em>Holmes Express Co., </em>229 N. Y. 527; <em>Matter of Cheesman </em>v. <em>Cheesman, </em>236 N. Y. 47.)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The question, therefore, between the carrier and the employer being rightfully before this court, we are called upon to i- :ar. \u25a0 ne the terms and conditions of the policy in order to determine the merits of this appeal. Turning to the policy we find that it covers the compensation payable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of the State of New York to persons injured. The terms material to our consideration are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201c Royal Indemnity Company</p>\n<p id=\"A8M\">\u201c(Head Office, New York)</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201c Does Hereby Agree with this Employer........as respects personal injuries sustained by employees, including death at any time resulting therefrom, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u201c One (a) To Pay Promptly to any person entitled thereto under the Workman\u2019s Compensation Law...... any sum due......</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201c (1) To such person, because of the obligation for compensation for any such injury imposed upon or accepted by this Employer under......the Workman\u2019s Compensation Law, and \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\"(2)..............\u2022\u2022 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201c It is agreed that all the provisions of each Workman\u2019s Compensation Law covered hereby shall be and remain a part of this contract ns fully and completely as if written herein................\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">\u201cOne (b).................</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">\u201cTwo.............:...</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">\u201c Three. To Defend, in the name and on behalf of this Employer, any suite or other proceedings which may at any time be instituted against him on account of such injuries, including suite or other proceedings alleging such injuries and demanding damages or compensation therefor, although such suits, other proceedings, allegations or demands wholly groundless, false or fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">\u201c Four. To Pay all costs taxed against this Employer in any legal proceeding defended by the Company......\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AKY\">\u201c Five. This Agreement Shall Apply to such injuries sustained by any person \u00b0 or persons employed by this Employer 1\u2019yhose entire remuneration shall be included in the total actual remuneration for which provision is hereinafter made, upon which remuneration the premium for this Policy is to be computed and adjusted........\u201d ,</p>\n<p id=\"b359-15\">\u201c Six. This.Agreement Shall Apply to such injuries so sustained by reason' of the business operations descrilbed in said Declarations.' which, for tie purpose of this insurance, shall include all operations described in said Declarations which, few the purpose of this insurance, shall include all operations necessary, incident or appurtenant thereto, or connected therewith, whether such operations are conducted at the work places defined and described in said Declarations or elsewhere in connection with, or in relation to, such work places.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Turning to the declaration w\u00e9 find the name of the employer given as \u201c Theodore A. Crane Sons Co., a corporation, at Erie Basin, Brooklyn, N. Y.\u201d Annexed to the declaration is an extension schedule classifying the operations which the policy is to cover. These operations are separately lettered, and begin with class <em>\u201c </em>A \u201d which is shipwright work covering among other things ship carpentry or ship ceiling work. Class. \u201c G \u201d covers carpentry work, installation of interior trim such as builders\u2019 finish and cabinet work. Schedule \u201c H,\u201d covering plumbing, includes house] connections. The location where these various operations may be conducted includes the Erie Basin, Brooklyn, New York, and elsewhere in New York State. '</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">It would thus appear from the policy and the extended schedule that the class of risk which was covered by this policy was carpentry work done \u2022 by the company either at its drydocks and yards or anywhere in the State of New York. If it were carpentry work being done by an employee of the Crane Company for which he was paid by the company the policy would appear to cover such a case. But we\u00b0may consider.\u2019 another rider annexed to the policy which extended it still further. It reads, <em>\u201c </em>It is hereby understood and agreed that the undermentioned policy is extended <em>to </em>cover the insured\u2019s liability as therein defined in connection with all other classifications of work in addition to those described in the said policy.\u201d The policy was do cover the empoyer\u2019s liability under the Workman\u2019s Compensation Law. The employer in this case was liable for Jaabeck\u2019s death as he was on the payroll o\u00ed the company at the time, was its general employee, and was, Ating work by the direction of the company\u2019s foreman in the State of New York. The employer was, therefore, hable under the Workmen s Compensation Law. The policy of the carrier insure <em>the </em>employer against such liability in cases specified an classified in the policy, the declaration, and riders annexe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>These specifications included carpentry work in the State of New York and <em>\u201c </em>the insured\u2019s liability as therein defined in connection with all other classifications of work in addition to those described in the said policy.\u201d If for any reason the work of Jaabeck at the house of Wilbur Crane was not covered by classification \u201c G \u201d in the declaration it surely was covered by this general omnibus rider which extended the policy to all other classes of work. This certainly was a class of some kind. It was carpenter work, done by the direction of his employer, paid for by his employer, and done within the State of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Much emphasis has been placed upon another rider which referred to work being done at the residence of Mrs. E. C. Brown. This reads as follows: <em>\u201c </em>It is hereby understood and agreed that the undermentioned policy is extended to cover the interest of Mrs. E. C. Brown, in connection with work, as defined in said policy conducted at the residence of Mrs. E. C. Brown, located at 264 Berkeley Place, Borough of Brooklyn, New York.\u201d It is insisted on behalf of the respondent that as work upon Mrs. Brown\u2019s house was specifically mentioned and covered by this policy, the implication must be that the work upon Wilbur Crane\u2019s house was excluded; the reasoning is that mention of Mrs. Brown\u2019s house was not required to bring it within the policy if otherwise the general terms of the policy would have covered it. We do not give this meaning to the rider. In the first place, the insurance company knew by the rider that employees of the company were doing work for the company\u2019s officials at their private dwellings. This rider further recognizes that this class of work, that is, the nature of the work is covered by the policy, for it says that the policy is extended to cover Mrs. Brown <em>\u201c </em>in connection with work, <em>as defined in said policy </em>conducted,\u201d etc. Therefore, work as defined in the policy was being done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>at Mrs. Brown\u2019s residence. There is one thing, however, that this rider does not state. It does not state that the policy is extended to cover work being done at Mrs. Brown\u2019s house; it is not the <em>work </em>which is classified or included within the policy. It is the <em>interest </em>of Mrs. Brown which the policy is extended to cover. It so states; it necessarily must be taken to mean what it states. Therefore, this rider recognizes that the policy covers the work being done upon Mrs. Brown\u2019s house. It is being done for the company by one of its employees, paid by the company. If for any reason Mrs. Brown should be held liable because as between her and the workman there exists the relationship of special, as distinguished from general employer and employee, the policy is to cover her interest. We cannot, therefore, take this rider as in any way limiting the general meaning of the other terms of the policy, declaration and extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">If there be any doubt as to the meaning of its terms, the language should be given the meaning most favorable to the insured. <em>(Cary Brick Company </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; C. Company of N. Y., </em>162 App. Div. 873; affd., 220 N. Y. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We, therefore, conclude that the policy covered this liability upon the part of the insured and that the insurance carrier as well as the employer were rightly held liable to pay this award by the State Industrial Board. This leads to a reversal of the Appellate Division order, and an affirmance of the order of the State Industrial Board, with costs to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">His cock, Ch. J., Cardozo, Pound, McLaughlin, Andrews and Lehman, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Order reversed, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
