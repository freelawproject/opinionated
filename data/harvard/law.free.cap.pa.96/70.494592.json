A true copy of said bond is hereto attached and made part hereof; and affiant further avers that, at No. 48, December Term 1876, said Robert Gracey, guardian, filed his account, showing a balance in his hands, October 17th 1876, of one thousand one hundred and ninety-eight and eight hundredths ($1198.08) dollars, on account of personal property, which said sum he has never paid, and the whole amount thereof, with interest from said date, is yet due. Affiant further says, that the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county made an order and decree directing said Robert Gracey to pay to affiant said sum of money ; that more than twenty days have elapsed since said decree was entered, and that no appeal has been taken therefrom, and the money has not been paid. Wherefore, affiant avers that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is entitled, to judgment for his use in the sum of $8000, with leave to have execution for $1198.08, with interest, from October 1st 1876, and further saith not.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">The following was the bond:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">\u201cKnow all men by these presents, that we, Robert Gracey, James Rees and C. H. Love, are held and firmly bound unto the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the sum of eight thousand dollars ($8000), lawful money of the United States, to be paid to the said Commonwealth, to which payment well and truly to be made, we do bind ourselves, our heirs, executors and administrators, and every of them, jointly and severally, by these presents.

James Rees. C. II. Love. 'l. s.] Ji. s.] L.

That although he signed said bond, yet the said guardian, as appears of record, made report that the personal estate of his said wards was exhausted, and obtained an order to sell real estate for their maintenance, and made said sale, and gave a new bond with James M. Riter et al., as sureties for the application of the proceeds. That all of said children, except William Gracey, the youngest, are now of full age, and said Samuel McGaugh has power to act and sue for the interests of but one of said children. That said Robert Gracey, principal, is bound in law .to file his separate account as to his management of the estate of said minor, for each of his said wards, of his receipts and expenditures for each child, and have fixed by the Orphans\u2019 Court, by its decree, the amount the said guardian is. liable for to each, on account of their personal estate. That this has not been done, and but one joint account has been filed, and defendants submit that until said plaintiff has such accounts and decrees filed, and the liability of said guardian to each of his said wards held by such decree, no action can be maintained on the bail bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">The plaintiff took a rule to show cause why judgment should not be taken for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, which the court discharged. This writ was then taken, and this action of the court assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><em>J. McF. </em>Carpenter, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AId\">Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of claim, and copy of bond thereto attached, were a good statement of his cause of action, and he could have gone to trial without more: Graff <em>v. </em>Graybill, 1 Watts 428 ; Bowman <em>v. </em>Sharp, 6 Id. 324; Moyer <em>v. </em>Kirby, 14 S. &amp; R. 161; Geary <em>v. </em>Cunningham, 17 Id. 424 ; Epler <em>v. </em>Funk, 8 Barr 468. Rule 9 of the Courts of Common Pleas of Allegheny county, only requires that plaintiff shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>have filed his declaration, if one be necessary. The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is conclusive upon both principal and surety. It fixes the amount of debt due by Robert Gracey to his successor, and cannot now be questioned : Moorhead <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Grant 214; Garber <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 7 Barr 265. All the plaintiff would have to do at the trial of this cause before a jury, would be to offer in evidence the bond and the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court and rest. Defendants can only escape liability by showing payment or release, neither of which have been set up in the affidavit of defence, and could not, therefore, be proven. This case is analogous to that of Kase <em>v. </em>Greenough, 7 Norris 403.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-6\"><em>Barton &amp; Sons, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHV\">The bond- sued on being the official bond of a guardian, is expressly covered by the Act of June 14th 1836, sect. 6, Purd. Dig. 162. As suggested by the affidavit of defence, before an action could be maintained the plaintiff must first have an account filed by the guardian for each ward, setting forth the amount due to him, and on what account, and the amount of each: Weyand\u2019s Appeal, 12 P. F. Smith 198. Then the court, in the action upon the official bond, could fix the amount due to each, and thus conform to the act, and enter judgment for the Commonwealth for the penalty of the bond, and for the amount due to each child under the decree. But the plaintiff not only failed to observe the act relating to actions on official bonds, but he failed even to file a declaration. Rule 9 of the court requires that before judgment can be taken for want of an affidavit of defence, the plaintiff must file a declaration, if one be ne.cessary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b73-7\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AUh\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 15th 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court directing Robert Gracey, guardian, to pay over to the plaintiff, who is his successor in the trust, the money in his hands as such guardian, not having been appealed from, is conclusive both upon Gracey and the sureties upon his official bond. It is manifest, therefore, that in an action of debt upon such bond the defendants can have no defence but payment. The affidavit of defencesets up nothing of the kind. It makes some suggestions as to what ought to be done in the Orphans\u2019 Court.in the way of distribution of the funds, but this is a question with which a defaulting guardian can have no concern. Having been removed from the trust his duty is to pay the money which the Orphans\u2019 Court has adjudged to be in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">No sufficient defence appearing in the affidavit, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment provided he has placed himself in a position to demand it. The, Act of 14th June 1836, Pamph. L. 639, prescribes the manner of proceeding upon official bonds. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>plaintiff appears to have proceeded in substantial conformity to the act. It is true he did not file a declaration, but he did file a copy of the bond with an affidavit distinctly setting forth the breach. Rule 9 of the court below provides for the filing of a declaration before judgment by default only when necessary. It was not necessary here. The only benefit of a declaration would be to assign the breach and that was sufficiently done by the affidavit. The bond in question was clearly within the rule of court which prescribes in what cases judgment may be taken for want of an affidavit of defence, and as the affidavit of defendant disclosed no defence the plaintiff was entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The order of the court below refusing to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence is reversed, \u2022 and it is now ordered that the record be remitted to the court below with directions to enter judgment against the defendants for such sum as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown why such judgment should not be so entered.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
