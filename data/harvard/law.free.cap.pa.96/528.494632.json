C. McCoy, overseers of the poor of the poor district of Cherry township, Butler county, for an appeal <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>and for an order upon two justices who issued an order of removal of a pauper to return a certified transcript of the proceedings had before 'them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-12\">On the 29th of October 1879, John K. Gilghrist and William Murrin, overseers of the poor of Marion township, Butler county, obtained an order of removal removing one Kate McClinchy, a pauper chargeable upon them, to the poor district of the township of Cherry, said county. Gilghrist, on the 21st November 1879, presented the said Kate McClinchy, and the order of removal, to H. C. McCoy, Esq., one of the overseers of Cherry township, at his place of business in said township. ^EcCoy protested against receiving the said pauper; and insisted that the order of removal was irregular, and that the said pauper was not rightfully chargeable upon Cherry township, she never having obtained a residence therein, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-13\">Gilghrist then agreed with McCoy, each for his township respectively,' that in order to avoid expenses of litigation they would.amicably submit all matters at variance between them to two justices of the peace \u2014 one to be chosen by an overseer of each township, and whose decision should be final. Accordingly, Gilghrist selected William Black, Esq., and McCoy selected Robert McElhaney, Esq., and the 10th of December then next, at 10 o\u2019clock A. M., was fixed as the time, and the office of William Black, Esq., as the place of meeting for the hearing before the said justices. , Gilghrist until after the hearing retained the pauper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>and the order of removal; and the said William Black, Esq., at the request of the parties, entered a record of their agreement and submission on his docket.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-6\">On the 10th of December 1879, the parties, with their witnesses, met at the time and place stipulated, the overseers of Cherry township ready to proceed with the submission as per agreement, but the overseers of Marion township, having discovered (as they believed) that the time for an appeal from said order of removal had expired, and that the overseers of Cherry township, in consequence, had no other alternative than to accept the pauper, refused to go on with the hearing, and demanded that the overseers of Cherry township submit without further contention. This the overseers of Cherry township refused to do, whereupon the' overseers of Marion, a few days thereafter, petitioned the Court of Common Pleas for a mandamus to compel the overseers of Cherry to accept the said pauper, and were awarded a rule to show cause. Before answering this rule the overseers of Cherry township, apprehending that they were not entitled to an appeal, as of right, on the 29th of December 1879, presented a petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions (containing in detail the facts as above stated) praying the court to grant an appeal <em>\u201cnunc pro tame\u201d </em>as of the last day of last term, and to make an order on the justices who granted the order of removal to return \u00e1 certified transcript of the proceedings had before them, and to give such other and further relief as the cause might require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-7\">The court granted a rule to show cause returnable to 2d Monday of January, and on the-same day respondents accepted service of said rule, and in lieu of and answer thereto, filed an agreement between the attorneys for the respective townships as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">\u201cWhereas,in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler county, Pa., on petition of the overseers of Marion township, Butler county, Pa., a rule was granted on the overseers of the poor of Cherry township, said county, to sh$w cause why a mandamus should not issue to said overseers of Cherry township to receive and maintain one Kate McOlinchy on an order of removal issued by James McGill and 0. M. Brown, two justices of the peace of said county; and also, whereas, on the 29th day of December 1879, on petition of the overseers of the poor of Cherry township, a rule was granted by the Court of Quarter Sessions of said county to show cause why an appeal should not be granted from said order of removal, &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-9\">\u201c Therefore, it is hereby agreed, that depositions may be taken on this last-mentioned rule, on the questions that would come up on an appeal, to wit, the place of last settlement of the pauper and the amount expended by Marion township after order of maintenance in support of and caring for said pauper. And if the court be of opinion from said proofs that the last place of legal settlement of said pauper is in Cherry township, then the overseers of Cherry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>township to take and maintain said Kate McClinchy, and pay costs of this proceeding and of the proceedings in the Common*Pleas for mandamus, and to pay to the overseers of Marion township the moneys expended by them, as proven, for support, &amp;c., of said pauper, after order of maintenance and to date of decision ; and in case the court be of opinion that said pauper\u2019s last place of legal residence is not in Cherry township, then the overseers of Marion township to discontinue the proceedings for mandamus on their part; and the court to make this rule absolute, and decree according to the proofs as though appeal were in time. The court- to order and decree in accordance with this agreement after hearing the proofs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">(Signed) ' Walker, Reed and Bredin,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\">Attorneys for Cherry Township.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">George A. Black, Attorney for respondents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-8\">Under this agreement all subsequent proceedings in the case were based, and depositions were taken sustaining the petition that the pauper\u2019s last place of settlement was not in Cherry township. On the 8th of September 1880, the cause having come on to be heard and argued, the court made the following order: \u201c Case called and argued, and same day on due consideration rule discharged at costs of party obtaining it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\">To this the petitioners filed the following exceptions-, which the court overruled, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-10\">1. In 'ruling that the petition for the appeal was not presented to the next Court of Quarter Sessions. after the order of removal. 2. In ruling that the petition was not filed in time to entitle petitioners to their appeal as of right. 3. In ruling that the agreement between the overseers of the respective townships on file in this case was not binding on the said overseers but void. 4. In discharging the rule to show cause why the appeal should not be allowed <em>mine pro </em>tuno, the rule having been made absolute by the said agreement of the overseers of the respective townships. 5.. In discharging the rule to show cause aforesaid because respondents had never filed an answer thereto. 6. In discharging said rule at costs of petitioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-11\">The Act of 13th. June 1836, Pamph. L. 546, pi. 19, requires an appeal from an order of removal to be taken to the next Court of Quarter Sessions, and not elsewhere. The order of removal in this case was obtained 29th October 1879, during the December term of court, and the petition for an appeal and the agreement aforesaid were filed on 29th December as alleged, at the next Court of Quarter Sessions, to wit, March term 1880. The December term began on the 1st of September 1879, and ended on the 30th day of November 1879. The next Court of Quarter Sessions was March term 1880, which commenced on the 1st day of De&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>cember 1879, and ended, as petitioners alleged, 28th February 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">The overseers of Cherry township took this writ, alleging that the court erred in refusing to make an order on the justices, who granted the order of removal, to return a certified transcript of the proceedings had before them, and in ignoring the above recited written agreement and refusing to hear the cause on its merits.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-7\"><em>Charles McCandless </em>and <em>James W. Reed, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9RX\">\u2014The only question in this case in regard to the time of appeal is, whether or not, under the Act of Assembly, the next Court of Quarter Sessions and the next term of the Court of Quarter Sessions is identical in meaning. If the next Court of Quarter Sessions means the next term of the Court of Quarter Sessions, then, undoubtedly, the petition for an appeal and the order upon the justices, as aforesaid, was within' this Act of Assembly. The clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions for Butler county, Pa., has certified that the March Term of the Court of Quarter Sessions, in and for the county of Butler, began on the 1st day of December 1879, and continued until the 28th day of February 1880, and that the said court was in session at the time this petition was presented and the rule granted thereon, to wit: the 29th of December 1879. If it were otherwise, and any specific day or time was fixed for an appeal to be entered to the next Court of Quarter Sessions, for instance, the first week or two weeks that the court would be in session, for the trial of causes, great injustice might be done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-8\">In the case of Sugar Creek Overseers <em>v. </em>Washington Overseers, 12 P. F. Smith 479, the next Court of Quarter Sessions and the next term of Quarter Sessions are used synonymously, the court evidently regarding the terms to be interchangeable. Also, in the Directors of the Poor of Westmoreland County <em>v. </em>Overseers of Conemaugh Township, 10 Casey 232, the court referring to the session said: \u201c When the next term of the sessions had gone by.\u201d A session or term is always considered as one day: 2 P. A. Browne\u2019s Reports 258.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-10\"><em>George &amp; A. T. Black </em>and <em>L. Z. Mitchell, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANi\">The \u201c next court\" in the Act of Assembly is plainly intended to mean an actual sitting or session of the court, as the only mode of appealing to that court seems to be. by a petition to it, and, of course, it must be in'session. See Directors of the Poor, &amp;e., of Northampton <em>v. </em>Limestone, 18 P. F. Smith 386. Even if the word \u201c term \u201d had been used, it would still, we contend, mean the same thing, an actual session of the court, as by analogy to road cases where viewers are required to report to the next term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b531-11\">The next regular term, or next Court of Quarter Sessions in and for the county of Butler, after the order of removal in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>commenced on the first Monday of December 1879, \u201cto continue two weeks, or so long as necessary to dispose of the business.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-6\">The records and minutes of the Quarter Sessions Court show that the business fixed for this regular term closed and the court adjourned on Friday, December 12th-1879, at 11.45 A. m.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-7\">If the plaintiffs in error had presented their appeal immediately after their alleged disappointment on December 10th 1879, they had time enough during the sitting of the court until noon of December 12th, and possibly might then have been in time, but they made no move until December 29rh, a week after they had notice of an application for a mandamus, by a rule accepted by their attorney. A special court had been ordered to meet on December 15th 1879, and did meet and continue in session for jury trials during that week.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b532-8\">Mr. Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"ARB\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 26th 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The overseers had no power to bind the townships by the agreement of submission. The defendant in error had an undoubted right to refuse to ratify it. There was nothing in the agreement, nor in the refusal to ratify it, that extended the time within which an appeal might be taken. The statute fixed the next Court of Quarter Sessions as the time. The next term, after the order of removal,, commenced on the first Monday of December. The court actually remained in session until Friday of the second week, being the 12th day of the month. On the morning of the 10th the agreement was repudiated, and notice thereof given. There was, after this, ample time to apply for or take an appeal from the order of removal before the court adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">A term of court is a fixed period of time: Horton et al. <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 Wright 270.' Under authority given by the Act of 18th March 1875, the court had ordered the several courts of the county \u201cto continue two weeks, or so long as is necessary to dispose of the business.\u201d It is true, any business commenced within the term of two weeks, might be prosecuted and completed beyond that time, or the court might by adjournment meet on some day thereafter to dispose of pending business, or other business, not required to be done at a regular term. A court, however, thus convened, would be an adjourned court, and not a regular term.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">In fact, on the 11th of October preceding, it had been ordered that a special term, for trial of both civil and criminal causes, be held, commencing on the third Monday of December, being the 15th; and that a venire issue for jurors for said week. That court met and continued in-session during the week. It adjourned to the'22d, then to the 23d, and further, to the 29th December. On this last day the petition was presented praying the court to grant the appeal. Thus, it clearly appears, the regular December term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>had expired. A special term had intervened and by adjournments continued. The court in session on the 29th was no part of the previous regular term, but was an extension of the special term. The learned judge was clearly right in holding the application for an appeal came too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
