Muhammad argues that the district court erred in affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision, because: (1) substantial evidence did not support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision not to accord substantial weight to the opinions of Dr. Alaa Elrefai, T.I.M.\u2019s treating psychiatrist; and (2) substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s determination that T.I.M\u2019s impairments did not functionally equal an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P, appendix I, and that T.I.M. thus was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In November 2006, Muhammad filed an application for disability benefits on behalf of her six-year-old child, T.I.M. Muhammad identified T.I.M.\u2019s disabling condition as ADHD. The Commissioner denied the application, and Muhammad requested a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The ALJ conducted a hearing in October 2008. During the hearing, Muhammad testified that T.I.M. had attended the first grade, and currently was in the second grade, at Epic Elementary School (\u201cEpic\u201d). Muhammad explained that T.I.M.\u2019s school performance had improved during the second grade because he was enrolled in special education classes. As a special-education student, T.I.M. received individualized attention from two or three teachers, and participated in a modified curriculum with a reduced workload. T.I.M. recently had received three A\u2019s and two B\u2019s in his report card. Muhammad explained that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior during the second grade had varied, and that he had \u201cups and downs,\u201d but that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior was \u201cbetter\u201d than it had been during the previous academic year.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Muhammad further testified that the individualized attention in the special education program had improved T.I.M.\u2019s ability to stay \u201con task\u201d in the classroom. Muhammad helped T.I.M. with his homework, and had noticed that T.I.M. had difficulty retaining or recalling information that he recently had reviewed. T.I.M. would not complete his homework if Muhammad left him by himself, and, as a result, she had to sit with him until he completed his homework. T.I.M. saw Dr. Elrefai, who worked at Western Mental Health Center (\u201cWestern\u201d), twice a year, and saw counselors at Western once every one to two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">The evidence reflected that, in November 2006, Muhammad completed a function report, in which she reported that T.I.M. did not experience any limitation in his ability to communicate with others (ie., having a conversation, telling a story, and using complete sentences). She reported that T.I.M.\u2019s impairment limited his ability to understand and use information that he had learned, but that T.I.M. was able to recite numbers, define common words, ask for the meaning of a word, and understand a joke. Muhammad also reported that T.I.M.\u2019s impairment affected his behavior with others. She also stated, however, that T.I.M. was \u201cloving,\u201d showed affection toward others, enjoyed being with other children his age, and enjoyed playing board games and games such as tag, hide- and-seek, and \u201cpretend\u201d games. Muhammad explained that, although T.I.M. was \u201cvery smart,\u201d it was difficult for him to focus, and his attention span endured for only a minute.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The record also included a teacher questionnaire, which Votura Mack, T.I.M.\u2019s kindergarten teacher at South Hampton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Elementary School (\u201cSouth Hampton\u201d) completed in January 2007. Responding to questions concerning T.I.M.\u2019s ability to acquire and use information, Mack reported that T.I.M. had \u201cno problem\u201d with comprehending oral instructions, understanding vocabulary, completing math problems, understanding and participating in class discussions, learning new material, recalling material that he previously had learned, and applying problem-solving skills in class discussions. T.I.M. had a \u201cslight problem\u201d with reading and comprehending written material, providing organized oral explanations and adequate descriptions, and expressing ideas in written form.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Responding to questions regarding T.I.M.\u2019s ability to attend and complete tasks, Mack reported that T.I.M. had no problem with carrying out single-step instructions, or completing his work without making careless mistakes. He had a slight problem with paying attention when spoken to directly, sustaining attention during play or sports activities, and carrying out multi-step instructions. Mack further reported that T.I.M. had \u201can obvious problem\u201d with maintaining focus while changing from one activity to another, and working at a reasonable pace. T.I.M. had a \u201cserious problem\u201d with maintaining the focus necessary to finish an assigned task, completing schoolwork and homework, and working without distracting himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">In the evaluation, Mack also answered questions concerning T.I.M.\u2019s ability to interact with and relate to others. Mack reported that T.I.M. had no problem with playing cooperatively with other children, making and keeping friends, seeking attention appropriately, relating experiences and telling stories, interpreting facial expressions and body language, and using adequate vocabulary and grammar in everyday conversation. T.I.M. had a slight problem with respecting and obeying adults in authority. T.I.M. had an obvious problem with expressing anger appropriately, handling frustration, asking for permission in an appropriate manner, and using language appropriate to the situation and the listener. Mack specified that T.I.M. sometimes kicked and cursed when asked to perform a task, and that, while he was able to work independently, he wasted time by not staying on task.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">In a separate form addressing T.I.M.\u2019s behavior at school, Mack reported that, between August and November 2006, T.I.M. \u201cconstantly\u201d left his seat and moved from desk to desk. T.I.M. called Mack names once a week, and had kicked her. Mack also reported that, as of May 2007, T.I.M.\u2019s behavior had \u201cdefinitely]\u201d improved, and that he had a \u201cbad week\u201d only once a month. T.I.M.\u2019s kindergarten report card showed that he received grades of \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d in all categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In a report entitled \u201cIndividualized Education Program,\u201d (\u201cIEP\u201d), which was completed after T.I.M. finished the first grade, Epic staff reported that, during the first grade, T.I.M. had received several disciplinary write-ups. He displayed aggression toward others by kicking his teacher and engaging in frequent name-calling. He frequently left his seat in the classroom, used \u201cugly\u201d language toward peers and his teacher, and had difficulty staying on task. During this school year, T.I.M. received an average grade of \u201cF\u201d in language arts, a \u201cD\u201d in reading, and a \u201cD\u201d in math. He received an average grade of \u201cA\u201d in music, physical education, science, and social studies. At the end of the first grade, T.I.M. could read only a few words, and experienced difficulty with math and written work, despite the fact that he had received the assistance of a tutor. Stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>dardized achievement testing showed that T.I.M.\u2019s ability in mathematical reasoning and reading comprehension was at the low end of the average range, and that his basic reading ability was within the average range. T.I.M.\u2019s listening comprehension was below average. Due to his deficient grades and behavioral problems, T.I.M. was transferred to special education classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">T.I.M.\u2019s medical records showed that, in the fall of 2006, Muhammad sought treatment for T.I.M. at Western. A December 2006 treatment plan showed that T.I.M. had been diagnosed with ADHD, and that he experienced educational problems. The treatment plan also noted that Muhammad had stated to Western staff that she hoped that TJ.M.\u2019s treatment would enable him to \u201cbe more focused\u201d and \u201cpay attention,\u201d and decrease his hyperactivity. The treatment plan included T.I.M.\u2019s global assessment functioning score (\u201cGAF\u201d) of 52, which was associated with \u201cmoderate\u201d difficulty in social and school functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In February 2007, Dr. Thomas Boll, Ph. D., examined T.I.M. at the request of the Commissioner. Boll observed that T.I.M. \u201cwas able to provide reasonable amounts of information,\u201d and maintained good eye contact. During the examination, T.I.M. \u201ctend[ed] to bounce in his chair,\u201d and, after a short time, became \u201cmoderately distractable, and wandered about the room playing with objects.\u201d Boll found that T.LM.\u2019s speech, conversation, and articulation were adequate and normal, that his thought processes and achievement of developmental milestones were normal, and that T.I.M. did not suffer confusion or have \u201cloose associations.\u201d In addition, Boll determined that T.I.M.\u2019s thought content was normal, and that his affect and mood were normal, noting the absence of anxiety or mood swings. Boll noted that, while T.I.M. had \u201csome disruption\u201d with his concentration, persistence, and pace, his \u201cappearance, behavior, level of activities, interests and ability to relate to others is normal.\u201d Boll specified that, in making the findings described above, he had considered not only his personal observations, but also T.I.M.\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">T.I.M.\u2019s records further showed that, between November 2006 and December 2007, Dr. Elrefai changed T.I.M.\u2019s prescription several times, noting that some prescriptions were ineffective. In December 2007, Dr. Elrefai prescribed Focalin for T.I.M., noting that this medication \u201cworked fine.\u201d Between the end of December 2007 and May 2008, T.I.M.\u2019s prescription remained stable. Between January and December of 2007, James Wagner, a child therapist at Western, noted that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior at school varied. In January and February 2007, Wagner noted that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior had improved, and that he had received a good grade in conduct. In May 2007, Wagner noted that T.I.M. was \u201cdoing well,\u201d and that, while T.I.M. still experienced behavioral problems, these problems had decreased. At the end of August 2007, Wagner noted that T.I.M. was \u201cdoing well overall,\u201d that he was not aggressive, and that there were no reported issues with his behavior at school. Also in August 2007, Wagner wrote a letter to Epic concerning T.I.M.\u2019s treatment, in which he noted that T.I.M.\u2019s most recent GAF score was 62, which was associated with mild symptoms and \u201csome\u201d problems with school functioning. In December 2007, however, Wagner reported that Muhammad had described T.I.M.\u2019s behavior at school as \u201cuncontrollable.\u201d Nevertheless, in March and June 2008, a licensed professional counselor at Western noted that T.I.M. had made progress toward the objectives outlined in his treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In August 2008, Dr. Elrefai completed an evaluation, in which he opined that T.I.M. had marked limitations in the areas of acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and interacting with and relating to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The ALJ denied benefits. The ALJ found that T.I.M. had the following severe impairments: (1) ADHD; and (2) a specific learning disability. The ALJ also found, however, that T.I.M. did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met, medically equaled, or functionally equaled an impairment listed in the federal regulations at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P, appendix 1, and that T.I.M. thus was not disabled. The ALJ explained that, in evaluating the extent of T.I.M.\u2019s limitations, he found that Mack\u2019s evaluation was \u201chighly probative\u201d of T.I.M.\u2019s \u201ctrue functioning\u201d because, in her professional capacity, Mack had close contact with T.I.M. over the course of a school year and was able to observe him in both academic and social settings. The ALJ characterized Mack\u2019s statements in her evaluation as stating that T.I.M. had only a slight problem in the area of acquiring and using information, and moderate problems in the areas of attending and completing tasks and interacting with others. The ALJ also noted that, in May 2007, Mack reported that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The ALJ evaluated the extent of T.I.M.\u2019s limitations in each of the six \u201cdomains\u201d of functioning set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)-(i). The ALJ found that T.I.M. had some, but \u201cless than marked,\u201d limitations in the following domains: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; and (8) interacting with and relating to others. In support of these findings, the ALJ relied heavily on Mack\u2019s evaluation and Dr. Boll\u2019s report. The ALJ noted that T.I.M. had received deficient grades in math, language arts, and reading during the first grade, but also noted that standardized achievement testing had shown that T.I.M.\u2019s ability in these areas was within the average range, and that T.I.M. had received satisfactory grades during kindergarten and second grade. In addition, the ALJ noted that medication, along with T.I.M.\u2019s participation in a special education program, had improved his performance at school, and that T.I.M.\u2019s GAF score had increased to 62 by August 2007. Addressing the final three domains of functioning, the ALJ determined that T.I.M. had no limitations in his abilities to move and manipulate objects, care for himself, or in his general physical health.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Based on the above, the ALJ concluded that T.I.M.\u2019s impairments did not functionally equal a listed impairment, because he did not suffer from extreme limitations in any of the six domains of functioning, nor did he suffer from marked limitations in at least two of these six domains. The ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Elrefai had opined that T.I.M. suffered from marked limitations in the domains of acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and interacting with and relating to others. The ALJ discounted Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinions because he found that these opinions conflicted with Western\u2019s underlying treatment notes regarding T.I.M., T.I.M.\u2019s improved GAF score, T.LM.\u2019s improved behavior and school performance, Mack\u2019s evaluation, and Muhammad\u2019s testimony. The ALJ additionally found that Dr. Elrefai saw T.I.M. only twice a year, and that these visits were \u201cprimarily for renewing his prescriptions.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinions were not \u201cwell-supported\u201d by the record. Muhammad\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision was denied by the Appeals Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Muhammad subsequently filed a complaint in the district court, alleging that the ALJ\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. The Commissioner answered, requesting that the court affirm the denial of benefits. The district court entered an order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s judgment, stating that it had reviewed the record, and found that the ALJ\u2019s decisions were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In reviewing an ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the opinion of a treating physician, we consider whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1241 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cThe testimony of a treating physician must ordinarily be given substantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1053 (11th Cir.1986). An ALJ is required to specify \u201cwhat weight is given to a treating physician\u2019s opinion and any reason for giving it no weight.\u201d <em>Id,.; see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2). An ALJ must have \u201cgood cause\u201d to discount the opinion of a treating physician. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240. \u201c \u2018[G]ood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240-41. \u201cA treating physician\u2019s report may be discounted when it is not accompanied by objective medical evidence.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">When determining the weight to accord to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, an ALJ should consider, among other things, the frequency with which the physician examines the patient, as well as the duration and nature of the doctor-patient relationship. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(2)(i)-(ii). When evaluating the evidence, the ALJ may consider data provided by non-medical sources such as educational personnel, including school teachers. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.913(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinions that T.I.M. had marked limitations in the domains of acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, and interacting with and relating to others. Although Dr. Elrefai was T.LM.\u2019s treating psychiatrist, the ALJ had good cause to discount his opinions because the evidence supported a finding contrary to Dr. Elrefai\u2019s conclusions. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. Specifically, T.I.M.\u2019s improved GAF score of 62, his kindergarten and second-grade report cards, his average-range scores on standardized achievement tests, Dr. Boll\u2019s report, Mack\u2019s evaluation responses, and Muhammad\u2019s statements in the 2006 function report conflicted with Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinion that T.I.M. had marked limitations in his ability to acquire and use information.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">In addition, Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinion that T.I.M. had marked limitations in his ability to interact with and relate to others was also contradicted by Mack\u2019s evaluation, in which she reported that T.I.M. had no trouble in making and keeping friends, playing cooperatively with other children, or telling stories. Moreover, in the function report, Muhammad had described T.I.M. as \u201cloving,\u201d and had reported that T.I.M. enjoyed being with other children his age and playing games such as hide- and-seek. Dr. Boll found that T.I.M.\u2019s ability to relate to others was \u201cnormal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">While Dr. Elrefai opined that T.I.M. had marked limitations in his ability to attend and complete a task, this opinion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>somewhat contradicted by T.I.M.\u2019s treatment notes from Western, which indicated that, as of March and June of 2008, he had made progress toward achieving the goal of increasing his ability to remain focused on a task. In addition, Wagner reported that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior largely had improved during most of 2007. Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinion also conflicted, to a certain extent, with T.LM.\u2019s improved GAF score of 62, and Muhammad\u2019s testimony that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior at school had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Accordingly, while Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinions were consistent with some of the evidence, such as T.I.M.\u2019s poor grades and unruly behavior during the first grade, and Muhammad\u2019s testimony that she had to sit with T.I.M. in order for him to complete his homework, the record also included substantial evidence that supported conclusions contrary to Dr. Elrefai\u2019s conclusions that T.I.M. had marked limitations in several domains. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. Moreover, in his report, Dr. Elrefai did not specify what evidence he had considered in forming his opinions, nor did he offer any explanation or point to objective medical evidence in support of his conclusions that T.I.M. had marked limitations in several domains. Accordingly, Dr. Elrefai\u2019s report was conclusory in nature. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240\u201441; Cr<em>awford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159. In addition, while Dr. Elrefai was T.I.M.\u2019s treating physician, the record shows that he examined T.I.M. approximately twice a year. Accordingly, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Elrefai\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe [ALJ]\u2019s factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">An individual under the age of 18 is considered to be disabled if he has a \u201cmedically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and ... which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i). \u201cFederal regulations set forth the process by which the SSA determines if a child is disabled and thereby eligible for disability benefits.\u201d <em>Shinn ex rel. Shinn v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>391 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2004). As part of this process, the ALJ must determine whether the child has a medically determinable impairment that is severe. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1278; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">If the child has a severe impairment, the ALJ next determines whether the impairment \u201ccauses marked and severe functional limitations for the child.\u201d <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1278 (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(d)). This determination is made based upon a consideration of the Listing of Impairments, which is included in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404, Subpart P, appendix 1. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1278; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.925(a). A child\u2019s impairment is recognized as causing \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations if those limitations meet, medically equal, or functionally equal\u201d an impairment described in the Listing of Impairments. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279 (quotation and alterations omitted); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(d). If a child\u2019s impairment does not meet or medically equal a listed impairment, an ALJ may still find that the child is disabled if his impairment functionally equals a listed impairment. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">In determining whether a child\u2019s impairment functionally equals a listed impairment, an ALJ must consider the extent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>which the impairment limits the child\u2019s ability to function in the following six \u201cdomains\u201d of life: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for oneself; and (6) health and physical well-being. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279; 20 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). A child\u2019s impairment functionally equals a listed impairment, and thus constitutes a disability, if the child\u2019s limitations are \u201cmarked\u201d in two of the six life domains, or if the child\u2019s limitations are \u201cextreme\u201d in one of the six domains. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Federal regulations set forth benchmarks that children of normal functioning should have achieved at a certain age. <em>Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)-(i). These regulations provide that, in the domain of acquiring and using information, a child between the ages of 6 and 12 should be able to learn to read, write, complete mathematics problems, and discuss history and science. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)(2)(iv). Children of this age also should be able to demonstrate what they have learned through oral and written work, and use what they have learned in group work and class discussions. In addition, a child between the ages of 6 and 12 should be able to use an increasingly complex vocabulary to share information, ask questions, and express ideas. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The regulations further provide that the domain of attending and completing tasks examines a child\u2019s ability to focus his attention on activities, and finish activities at an appropriate pace. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h). In this domain, a child between the ages of 6 and 12 should be able to \u201cfocus [his] attention in a variety of situations in order to follow directions, remember and organize [his] school materials, and complete classroom and homework assignments.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(h)(2)(iv). In addition, the child should be able to transition between activities without distraction, stay in place when appropriate, and sustain his attention well enough to read by himself or complete a household chore. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">The federal regulations explain that the domain of interacting and relating with others addresses a child\u2019s ability to initiate and sustain emotional connections with others, develop and use appropriate language, cooperate with others, comply with rules, and respond to criticism. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(i). In this domain, a child between the ages of 6 and 12 should be able to develop lasting friendships with his peers, express his ideas and tell stories, and begin to understand how to work in a group to solve a problem. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(i)(2)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The regulations provide that a child\u2019s limitation is \u201cmarked\u201d where it is \u201cmore than moderate,\u201d but \u201cless than extreme.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(e)(2)(i). A marked impairment \u201cseriously\u201d interferes with a child\u2019s \u201cability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An \u201cextreme\u201d limitation is a limitation that is \u201cmore than marked,\u201d and \u201cinterferes very seriously with [the child\u2019s] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(e)(3)(i). In determining whether a child has \u201cmarked\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d limitations in a domain, an ALJ should consider how the child performs in a supportive setting, as well as the effects of medication or other treatment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Here, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that T.I.M. is not disabled, as he did not suffer extreme limitations in any one of the six domains, or marked limitations in at least two of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>six domains. First, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that T.I.M. had less-than-marked limitations in the domain of acquiring and using information. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)(2)(iv). While T.I.M. received deficient grades in reading, language arts, and math during the first grade, he received A\u2019s in science and social studies, and his standardized achievement scores reflected that his ability in reading comprehension and mathematical reasoning fell within the average range. Mack reported that T.I.M. had \u201cno problem\u201d with learning new material and recalling material that he previously had learned, and T.I.M.\u2019s kindergarten grades were \u201cexcellent\u201d and \u201csatisfactory.\u201d In completing the child function report, Muhammad described T.I.M. as \u201cvery smart,\u201d and reported that T.I.M. could define common words, ask for the meaning of a word, and understand a joke. Moreover, Dr. Boll found that T.I.M.\u2019s thought processes and developmental milestones were normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Substantial evidence also supported the ALJ\u2019s determination that T.I.M. had less-than-marked limitations in the domain of interacting with and relating to others. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(i)(2)(iv). Mack observed that T.I.M. had \u201cno problem\u201d with making and keeping friends, relating experiences and telling stories, and interpreting facial expressions and body language. These observations were consistent with Dr. Boll\u2019s opinion that T.I.M.\u2019s ability to relate to others was normal, as well as with Muhammad\u2019s statements that T.I.M. enjoyed being with other children his age and playing games with other children. While T.I.M. manifested behavioral problems such as kicking and name-calling during kindergarten and first grade, Muhammad testified that T.I.M.\u2019s behavior had improved during the second grade. In addition, T.I.M.\u2019s GAF score had improved to 62 by August 2007, indicating that his ability to interact with others in an appropriate manner had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Although the evidence indicates that T.I.M. had a more serious problem in the domain of attending and completing tasks than he had in other domains, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that T.I.M.\u2019s limitations in this domain were less-than-marked, particularly in light of the fact that the ALJ was permitted to consider the improvements effected by T.I.M.\u2019s medication and his participation in a special-education program. <em>See Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1221; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a), (h)(2)(iv). As noted above, T.I.M.\u2019s GAF score had improved to 62 by August 2007. Dr. Boll found that, while T.I.M. was \u201cmoderately distractable,\u201d there was only \u201csome disruption\u201d in T.I.M.\u2019s concentration and pace, and his behavior and activity levels were normal. In addition, T.I.M.\u2019s treatment records from Western reflect that, in March 2008 and June 2008, T.I.M. had made progress toward the goals set forth in his treatment plan, such as improving his ability to concentrate and maintain focus. Wagner noted that, during the majority of 2007, T.I.M.\u2019s behavior showed significant improvement. This was consistent with Mack\u2019s opinion that medication caused T.I.M.\u2019s behavior to improve by May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Finally, we note that, even if substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s determination that T.I.M. had less-than-marked limitations in the domain of attending and completing tasks, any such error was harmless. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (holding that, although the ALJ made various errors, these errors were harmless because they ultimately were irrelevant to the denial of the claimant\u2019s application for disability benefits). Even if T.I.M.\u2019s limitations in this domain were marked, he still would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>not be disabled because he did not have marked limitations in at least one additional domain. <em>See Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(d). Although a minor claimant is disabled if he has extreme limitations in only one domain, the evidence described above demonstrates that T.LM.\u2019s limitations in the domain of attending and completing tasks were not extreme. <em>See Shinn, </em>391 F.3d at 1279; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(d). Accordingly, even if the ALJ erred in evaluating T.I.M.\u2019s limitations in this domain, substantial evidence still would support his ultimate determination that T.I.M. was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
