Miles appeals the 210-month sentence imposed pursuant to an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">We review the district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A district court acts within its discretion in departing upward pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3 if its reasons for departure advance the objectives of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and are justified by the facts of the case. <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Although Miles states that his sentence is unreasonable because the reasons for the departure fail to advance the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2), he argues that it is unreasonable because it fails to advance the objectives of other subsections of \u00a7 3553(a), specifically \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(4)(A), and (a)(6). To the extent he argues that the district court failed to consider these other factors and that the district court erred in its application of \u00a7 4A1.3, these are procedural errors that he did not preserve by objection or other argument in the district court. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586 (listing failure to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and improperly calculating the guidelines as procedural errors). Accordingly, these arguments are reviewed for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-18\">The district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in selecting the 210-month sentence and addressed specifically the guidelines range, its reasons and method of departing pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3, and Miles\u2019s history and characteristics. Thus, Miles has not shown that the district court erred, plainly or otherwise, by failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Nor has Miles shown that the district court erred in determining that an upward departure was warranted under \u00a7 4A1.3 or in applying the incremental approach to the upward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-19\">Although the 210-month sentence was a substantial departure from the 100 to 125 month range calculated without the \u00a7 4A1.3 upward departure, the facts of Miles\u2019s case justify the extent of the upward departure. As described in the presentence report (PSR) and considered by the district court, Miles has an almost 20-year history of committing numerous crimes and of being in and out of prison. Those crimes included numerous theft and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>credit card abuse offenses, a drug offense, assault offenses, and an escape offense, for which Miles either received or spent very little time in prison. This pattern of criminal behavior escalated in July 2007 when he committed four bank robberies. Thus, the upward departure is justified by the facts of Miles\u2019s case. Additionally, the record reflects that the district court reviewed Miles\u2019s PSR, listened to his attorney\u2019s arguments at sentencing, considered the documents submitted in support of Miles at sentencing, listened to Miles\u2019s statements to the court, and consulted the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the sentence imposed advances the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to promote</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">respect for the law, the need for adequate deterrence, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by Miles. Accordingly, Miles has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by upwardly departing to the extent it did or that the 210-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Zunigar-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
