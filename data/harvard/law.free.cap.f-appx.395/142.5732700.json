The appeal was untimely, and we DISMISS.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">A timely notice of appeal in a civil case is mandatory and jurisdictional and must be filed within 30 days of the entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken. <em>Bailey v. Cain, </em>609 F.3d 763, 765 (5th Cir.2010); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if the party moves for such an extension within 30 days of the expiration of the time to appeal. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5). None of the documents that Jackson filed within this time frame clearly evince an intent to appeal. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Because Jackson failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his Section 2254 application, we lack jurisdiction to consider the instant appeal, and it is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See Bailey, </em>609 F.3d at 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Jackson\u2019s motion for leave to supplement his brief on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
