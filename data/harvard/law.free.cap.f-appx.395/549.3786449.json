Corbin, John A. Barley, and Catherine, Edward and Jason Francis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-18\">A. Breach of Contract Litigation in State Court</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-19\">Paletti\u2019s claims arise out of: (1) a 1990 real estate contract in which Paletti and his brother Mark Paletti agreed to purchase a marina in Dixie County, Florida from Yellow Jacket Marina and Richard E. Corbin, and (2) the subsequent state court litigation between the contracting parties in Florida\u2019s Third Judicial Circuit Court in Dixie County (\u201cthe breach of contract action\u201d). John A. Barley was the attorney for Yellow Jacket Marina and Corbin in the state court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-20\">The state court proceedings were protracted and involved a bench trial, multiple judgments and several state court appeals. In 1996, after a bench trial, then-plaintiffs Yellow Jacket Marina and Corbin obtained a judgment in their favor (\u201cthe 1996 final judgment\u201d). This verdict was overturned on appeal in 1999. <em>See Paletti v. Corbin, </em>742 So.2d 343 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999). Finally, after a July 2001 jury trial on the remaining claims, the state court entered an October 2002 final judgment of $683,917 in damages for breach of contract against the Palettis and in favor of Yellow Jacket Marina and Corbin (\u201cthe October 2002 final judgment\u201d). The Florida First District Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment in September 2004. <em>See Paletti v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Corbin, </em>894 So.2d 249 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">B.The Palettis\u2019 Wrongful Execution Litigation in State Court</p>\n<p id=\"A-W\">Between 1996 and 1999, while the 1996 final judgment was on appeal, county sheriffs began conducting execution sales of real property owned (at least in part) by the Palettis in several Florida counties, including Pinellas, Alachua and Gilchrist counties. The Palettis challenged these execution sales in the underlying state court breach of contact action, alleging counter-claims of wrongful execution and seeking declaratory relief and cancellation and recision of the sheriffs\u2019 sales. The Palettis\u2019 counterclaims named Yellow Jacket Marina, John Barley and John A. Barley &amp; Associates, P.A. as counter-defendants and third-party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Catherine, Edward and Jason Francis (\u201cthe Francises\u201d) were the current owners of one of the properties sold. First American Title Insurance Company had issued a title insurance policy in favor of the Fran-cises. Because the Palettis\u2019 state court claims clouded their title, the Francises filed a claim under the policy. First American Title Insurance Company retained counsel to represent the Francises. Thereafter, the Francises intervened in the state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">On May 3, 2006, the state court granted third-party defendant Barley\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the Palettis\u2019 wrongful execution claims. The state court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that because the October 2002 final judgment had been entered and affirmed on appeal, the doctrines of law of the case and res judicata barred the Palettis from challenging the executions and any claim for recision, cancellation or declaratory relief was moot. The state court entered final judgment in favor of Yellow Jacket Marina, Barley and Barley\u2019s law firm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 25, 2008, the First District Court of Appeal dismissed the Palettis\u2019 appeal, ending the Palettis\u2019 challenge to the executions. <em>Paletti v. Yellow Jacket Marina, Inc., </em>980 So.2d 494 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">C. Timothy Paletti\u2019s Bankruptcy</p>\n<p id=\"ALp\">Meanwhile, on October 27, 2006, Timothy Paletti filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On February 2, 2007, defendant Barley filed a complaint objecting to the discharge of the October 2002 judgment debt, arguing that it was nondischargable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). After an October 4, 2007 hearing, the bankruptcy court granted Paletti\u2019s motion to dismiss the adversary action. On January 23, 2008, the bankruptcy court discharged Paletti\u2019s debt for the breach of contract damages awarded to Yellow Jacket Marina and Corbin. Apparently, Paletti had previously filed for bankruptcy in 1996, but the Palettis\u2019 district court pleadings provide little information about this earlier bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">D. Federal Court Action</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">On September 30, 2008, the Palettis, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed their initial plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, entitled \u201cNotice of Appeal,\u201d which purported to appeal several orders from the Florida First District Court of Appeal relating to the Dixie County breach of contract action. A magistrate judge directed the Palettis to file an amended complaint, warning them that the federal courts do not act as an appeals court for state court decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">In response, the Palettis filed an amended complaint against Defendants Yellow Jacket Marina, Inc., Corbin, Barley, the Francises and First American Title Insurance Company. The amended complaint alleged claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985 and 1986; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362; and Florida law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">According to the Palettis\u2019 amended complaint, the defendants, among other things: (1) conspired to wrongly execute judgment liens against the Palettis\u2019 property, resulting in unlawful foreclosures and sheriffs\u2019 sales from 1997 to 1999; (2) conducted armed home invasions of the Palettis\u2019 property; (3) transported stolen property across state lines; (4) maliciously engaged in ex parte communications with state court judges; (5) slandered titles to their property; (6) filed fraudulent documents; (7) fraudulently transferred real and personal property prior to filing for their own bankruptcy; (8) intervened in bad faith in the state court litigation; and (9) prepared title insurance policies in bad faith. The Palettis also alleged that between November 2006 and April 2007, defendants Cor-bin and Barley obtained ex parte orders in Dixie, Gilchrist and Alachua Counties \u201ccausing \u2018unreasonable search and seizure\u2019 ... violating [the] Constitutional Homestead of Timothy M Paletti .... \u201d The Palettis\u2019 amended complaint sought a jury trial \u201cFor Damages on Wrongful Executions Conducted Under Color of Law[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">The Palettis also filed a \u201cPetition for Declaratory Judgment,\u201d citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, asking for (1) declaratory judgment as to six pieces of real estate owned by the Palettis which they alleged were subject to execution and forced sale in violation of Florida\u2019s Homestead Act and the federal stay in bankruptcy,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) sanctions and the appointment of a federal prosecutor to investigate the criminal accusations against the defendants; and (3) the return of the six properties to their possession. In a reply brief, the Palettis clarified that they sought declaratory judgment regarding (1) the jurisdiction and authority of the federal bankruptcy court, and (2) \u201cthe matters and conflicting orders of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>state court rendered to the lower tribunal of records after the automatic federal stay of proceedings .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing, among other things, that (1) the Palettis\u2019 complaint failed to state a civil rights claim because the defendants were private parties not acting under color of law; and (2) the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the Florida state courts\u2019 judgments.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">A magistrate judge issued a report (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R\u201d) recommending the defendants\u2019 motions be granted and that the Palettis\u2019 action be dismissed. The R &amp; R determined that the Palettis\u2019s amended complaint: (1) did not allege any facts suggesting the defendants acted under color of state law; (2) failed to identify any constitutional right or federal law the defendants violated; and (3) raised \u201ca matter for state court determination, as it concerns a breach of contract related to a real property transaction that has been embroiled in state court for nearly two decades.\u201d The R &amp; R also concluded that the Palettis\u2019 request for declaratory judgment was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Over the Palettis\u2019 objection, the district court adopted the R &amp; R, granted the defendant\u2019s motions and denied the Palet-tis\u2019 request for declaratory judgment. Timothy Paletti filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">A. Dismissal of Declaratory Judgment Request Under <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine recognizes that federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts and precludes them from reviewing final state court decisions.\u201d <em>Green v. Jefferson Cnty. Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 199, 175 L.Ed.2d 127 (2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies only to cases that are \u201cbrought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 5.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005); <em>see also Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1272-74, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cThe doctrine bars the losing party in state court from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u201d <em>Brown v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>611 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-14\">Here, the district court correctly concluded that Paletti\u2019s declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ment claim was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. Based on Paletti\u2019s amended complaint and his response to the defendants\u2019 motions, by the time Paletti filed this federal action, he was the state-court loser in both the breach of contract action and the wrongful execution action. The protracted state court proceedings ended no later than April 28, 2008, before Paletti filed this federal action on September 30, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">Furthermore, Paletti sought a declaration from the district court, and now this Court, that the state court orders authorizing the execution sale of his properties were void because they violated the federal bankruptcy stay and Florida\u2019s homestead exemption. In other words, Paletti\u2019s request for declaratory judgment \u201ccomplaints] of injuries caused by state-court judgments\u201d and \u201cinvit[es] district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded the district court from engaging in such a review. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Paletti\u2019s declaratory judgment claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">B. Dismissal of Civil Rights Claims for Failure to State a Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Upon a defendant\u2019s motion, the district court may dismiss an action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, \u201ca complaint must ... contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-11\">To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3), the plaintiff must allege that two or more people conspired to deprive him of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the laws. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). To keep \u00a7 1985(3) from serving as a \u201cgeneral federal tort law,\u201d if the alleged conspirators are private actors, the plaintiff must allege that the conspiracy was aimed at rights constitutionally protected against private impairment. <em>Cook v. Randolph County, </em>573 F.3d 1143, 1156 (11th Cir.2009); <em>Park v. City of Atlanta, </em>120 F.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir.1997). Only rights that are \u201cserious constitutional right[s]\u201d are enforceable against private conspirators under \u00a7 1985(3). <em>Cook, </em>573 F.3d at 1156. So far, the Supreme Court has identified only two rights \u2014 the rights to interstate travel and against involuntary servitude \u2014 as sufficiently serious to protect against private, as well as public, encroachment. <em>Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 278, 113 S.Ct. 753, 764, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993) (rejecting the right to an abortion as one of the rights protected against private conspiracies by \u00a7 1985(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-12\">Claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986 are \u201cderivative of \u00a7 1985 violations.\u201d <em>Park, </em>120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>F.3d at 1159-60. To state a \u00a7 1986 claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant knew of a \u00a7 1985 conspiracy and failed to prevent it, despite having the power to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 1160; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Paletti failed to state a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy claim because he did not allege that the defendants, all private actors, conspired to violate the kind of \u201cserious\u201d right, such as the right to interstate travel or the right against involuntary servitude, that is constitutionally protected against private infringement. There is no constitutionally protected right against a private party obtaining a \u201cwrongful execution\u201d of a judgment lien in state court. Because no \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy was alleged, he likewise failed to state a \u00a7 1986 claim. Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing Paletti\u2019s \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986 civil rights conspiracy claims for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The district court properly dismissed Paletti\u2019s request for declaratory relief on <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>grounds and his civil rights conspiracy claims for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, because the district court dismissed all claims over which it had original jurisdiction, it was within its discretion to dismiss Paletti\u2019s state law claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3) (permitting district court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if all claims over which the court had original jurisdiction are dismissed).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-15\">. Although both Timothy and Mark Paletti were plaintiffs in the district court, only Timothy Paletti filed a notice of appeal. Mark Paletti did not sign the notice of appeal and has not otherwise made any intent to appeal known. Accordingly, to the extent Timothy Paletti attempts to bring this appeal on behalf of his brother, Mark Paletti is not a party to this appeal. <em>See Theriault v. Silber, </em>579 F.2d 302, 302 n. 1 (5th Cir.1978) (explaining that a <em>pro se </em>party's notice of appeal \u201cis effective only for himself\u201d). When we refer to Paletti, we mean Timothy Paletti.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1046-8\">. A schedule attached to the state court's final judgment listed the four Sheriff's deeds and one Sheriff's sale at issue: (1) Sheriff's deed by the Alachua County Sheriff dated October 21, 1998, signed October 27, 1998 and recorded in OR Book 2198 Page 1897 on October 28, 1998; (2) Sheriff's deed by the Gilchrist County Sheriff dated October 28, 1998, signed November 30, 1998 and recorded in OR Book 278 Page 626 on December 1, 1998; (3) Sheriff's deed by the Alachua County Sheriff dated October 21, 1998, signed October 27, 1998 and recorded in OR Book 2198 Page 1895 on October 28, 1998; (4) Sheriff\u2019s deed by the Gilchrist County Sheriff dated March 9, 1999 and recorded in OR Book 283 Page 480 on March 17, 1999; and (5) October 20, 1998 Sheriff's sale of interests in the Pal-ettis in property at 1431 22nd Avenue North, St. Petersburg, Pinellas County, Florida.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">. On appeal, Paletti makes no mention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242, which are criminal statutes that do not provide a private right of action. Paletti\u2019s appeal brief does contain passing references to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 632, but he does not make any substantive argument challenging the dismissal of this particular claim. <em>See Smith v. Secy, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>572 F.3d 1327, 1342 n. 8 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cFailure to offer any argument on an issue in a brief abandons that issue.\u201d); <em>Greeribriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (stating that passing references to issues in an appeal brief are insufficient to raise a claim on appeal, abandoning the claim). Accordingly, we do not address these claims on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">. The Palettis listed: (1) a home at 1431 22nd Avenue North, St. Petersburg, Florida; (2) a home at 750 N.W. 34th Street in Gainesville, Florida in Alachua County, which was subject to execution by the Sheriff on October 28, 1998; (3) a residential/professional townhome at 430 N.E. 1st Avenue in High Springs, Florida in Alachua County, for which Defendant Barley obtained a third alias writ of possession on April 25, 2007; (4) home and land at 8960-8962 N.E. 90th Avenue in High Springs, Florida in Gilchrist County subject to Sheriffs execution in May 1999; (5) land at 8640 N.E. 60th Street, High Springs, Florida in Gilchrist County which was the subject of a Sheriff's deed in October 1998; (6) the marina and restaurant in Dixie County.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">. Because the Francis defendants attached copies of court records to their motion to dismiss, the magistrate judge issued on order converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment and advising the Pal-ettis of their obligation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 to respond to the summary judgment motion with evidentiary materials. Additionally, defendant First American Title Insurance Company filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that all of its actions were taken pursuant to contractual obligations and that the Palettis had failed to state a claim against it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1048-16\">. After the R &amp; R was issued, the Palettis filed a notice of voluntary dismissal dismissing their \u00a7 1983 claims, but reiterating their request for declaratory judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1048-17\">.
