We granted Smith\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Whether the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992), when it: (1) failed to address Smith\u2019s claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance with respect to the state\u2019s failure to prove the seven elements of capital murder; and (2) failed to address his claim that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to raise in a motion for a new trial the two non-proeedurally-defaulted ineffective assistance claims raised in Smith\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">On appeal, Smith argues that the district court did violate <em>Clisby </em>as stated in the COA. Defendants respond that Smith\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the state failed to prove the seven elements of capital murder \u201cwas effectively resolved by the district court\u2019s decision, even if not technically addressed.\u201d Defendants also assert that it is unnecessary to remand Smith\u2019s claim that appellate counsel was ineffective because \u201cthe district court already indirectly resolved the issue by finding that none of the claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel were meritorious.\u201d Finally, Defendants contend that, regardless, it is unnecessary to remand because Smith\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">We \u201creview <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.\u201d <em>Gamble v. Sec\u2019y Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>450 F.3d 1245, 1247 (11th Cir.2006). Out of \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d we, in <em>Clisby, </em>exercised our supervisory authority over the district courts and instructed them to resolve all claims for relief raised in a petition for habeas corpus relief, regardless of whether habeas relief is granted or denied. 960 F.2d at 935-36. When a district court fails to resolve all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern reversible error. Smith alleged two constitutional violations of his right to effective assistance of counsel, as he claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the state failed to prove the seven elements of capital murder and that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to allege ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a motion for new trial. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report after <em>de novo </em>review of the record, but the magistrate judge failed to mention, consider, or rule on those two claims. Contrary to Defendants claims, the district court\u2019s decision did not indirectly resolve these claims. Moreover, the merits of Smith\u2019s claims are irrelevant when considering whether the district court resolved Smith\u2019s claims under <em>Clisby. See id. </em>at 935-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Because the record shows that the district court failed to address or resolve Smith\u2019s claims that: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the state failed to prove the seven elements of capital murder; and (2) his appellate coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>sel was ineffective for failing to raise ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in a motion for a new trial, the district court\u2019s judgment violated <em>Clisby. </em>Thus, we vacate the judgment without prejudice and remand for the district court to resolve these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
