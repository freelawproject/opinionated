In support of his motion, Sills noted that his trial attorney had failed to preserve two objections to a wiretap warrant and that his appellate counsel had failed to argue that the use of several intercepted conversations as evidence violated his constitutional right to confront witnesses. The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion on the ground that the attorneys\u2019 alleged errors had caused Sills no prejudice, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Sills was indicted on federal drug and firearms charges after a state investigation produced evidence that he had been involved in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Before trial, Sills\u2019s attorney, along with counsel for his codefendants, moved to suppress a bevy of wiretap evidence on the ground that the State\u2019s application for the wiretap had been deficient. Specifically, the defendants argued that the State had based its warrant application on stale information and had failed to explain why a wiretap, in light of other possible investigative techniques, was necessary. After a magistrate judge recommended denying the motion to suppress, some of the other defendants objected before the district judge \u2014 who then denied the motion \u2014 but Sills\u2019s attorney failed to preserve the issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">At trial, when the Government tried to introduce several recordings of intercepted conversations involving Sills, his attorney objected on the ground that admitting them into evidence would deny Sills his constitutional right to confront the alleged co-conspirator heard on the tapes. The court overruled the objection, and the jury found Sills guilty. On direct appeal, Sills\u2019s appellate counsel did not present the confrontation question to this court, and we affirmed his conviction. <em>United States v. Dennard, </em>258 Fed.Appx. 299 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">Sills filed a motion to set aside his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on the ground that the assistance he had received from his former attorneys was constitutionally deficient. The district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny the motion on the ground that any unprofessional errors of counsel had not prejudiced Sills\u2019s case. The district court issued a certificate of appealability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1), and Sills, now <em>pro se, </em>appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The Constitution guarantees the accused in any criminal prosecution \u201cthe right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const, amend VI. \u201cIt has long been recognized that the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970), and the requirements for effective trial assistance apply equally to a defendant\u2019s attorney on direct appeal, <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1187 (11th Cir.2001). To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance at either stage, the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance \u201cfell below reasonable professional standards\u201d and that he suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Id. </em>We review ineffective-assistance claims <em>de novo. Gomez-Diaz v. United States, </em>433 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A. <em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">By denying Sills the opportunity for further review of the suppression issues, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(b)(2), his attorney\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation on the motion to suppress arguably fell short of reasonable professional standards. But \u201c[e]ven if a defendant shows that particular errors of counsel were unreasonable,\u201d he must still \u201cshow that they actually had an adverse effect on the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In other words, if the arguments forsaken by Sills\u2019s attorney have no merit, there can be no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">By failing to object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, defense counsel denied Sills the opportunity to raise two arguments before the district court and, later, on appeal. First, Sills could have argued that the wiretap application was defective because it was based on stale information. <em>See United States v. Bervaldi, </em>226 F.3d 1256, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2000). But there is no reasonable probability that the preservation of that argument would have led to a different result. For one thing, the district court denied the motion to suppress over the objections of Sills\u2019s codefendants, who did raise the staleness argument. More important is that we rejected the same argument in an appeal from one of the co-defendants\u2019 convictions and concluded that \u201cthe district court properly denied the motion to suppress.\u201d <em>Dennard, </em>258 FedAppx. at 302. Sills can therefore demonstrate no prejudice, and his ineffective-assistance claim concerning this argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">The second argument that Sills\u2019s attorney failed to preserve concerns the necessity of the wiretap. \u201cEach application for an order authorizing or approving the interception of a wire, oral, or electronic communication\u201d must include \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1). Sills argues that the State\u2019s warrant application ran afoul of this requirement by failing to explain why a wiretap was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">The underlying argument is that the State did not try hard enough to investigate the suspected drug conspiracy through more conventional means. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>considered a similar argument in <em>United States v. Suarez:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWg\">The affidavit in support of a search warrant \u201cmust simply explain the retroactive or prospective failure of several investigative techniques that reasonably suggest themselves.\u201d <em>United States v. Van Horn, </em>789 F.2d 1492, 1496 (11th Cir.1986). However, a comprehensive exhaustion of all possible investigative techniques is not necessary before applying for a wiretap. <em>United States v. Alonso, </em>740 F.2d 862, 868 (11th Cir.1984). The statute was not intended \u201cto foreclose electronic surveillance until every other imaginable method of investigation has been unsuccessfully attempted, but simply to inform the issuing judge of the difficulties involved in the use of conventional techniques.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">601 F.3d 1202, 1214 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">Despite Sills\u2019s contention that the State\u2019s warrant application reflected \u201cimpatience\u201d rather than an honest attempt to explain the necessity of a wiretap, the application\u2019s supporting affidavits summarized a wide range of investigative techniques that the State had either attempted or considered. The affidavits revealed, for instance, that the State\u2019s confidential informants had no information on the conspiracy\u2019s inner workings and that the drug organization comprised a close-knit group of individuals unlikely to trust undercover agents. The State also explained its concern that search warrants and grand jury subpoenas would frustrate its goals by alerting the conspirators to the criminal investigation. Given these facts, we agree with the district court that the State\u2019s application adequately \u201c \u2018informed] the issuing judge of the difficulties involved in the use of conventional techniques.\u2019 \u201d <em>Suarez, </em>601 F.3d at 1214 (quoting <em>Alonso, </em>740 F.2d at 868). The alleged errors of Sills\u2019s trial counsel caused him no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">B. <em>Appellate Counsel\u2019s Performance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Sills also argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the argument that admitting the intercepted telephone conversations as evidence violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI (\u201c[T]he accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him____\u201d). Sills contends that the district court erred by rejecting his Confrontation Clause argument at trial and that his attorney\u2019s failure to raise that argument on direct appeal caused him prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">The question here is whether the statements contained in the intercepted conversations were \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. <em>See Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (\u201cOnly statements of this sort cause the declarant to be a \u2018witness\u2019 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d). The Supreme Court has not precisely defined the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d but in our circuit this much is clear: statements made in furtherance of a criminal conspiracy are not testimonial. <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340, 1347 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Giles v. California, </em>554 U.S. 353, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2691 n. 6, 171 L.Ed.2d 488 (2008) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A]n incriminating statement in furtherance of the conspiracy would probably never be[ ] testimonial.\u201d). Nor are statements made by acquaintances during a private conversation. <em>United States v. U.S. Infrastructure, Inc., </em>576 F.3d 1195, 1209 (11th Cir.2009) (citing <em>United States v. Brown, </em>441 F.3d 1330, 1360 (11th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">In light of this court\u2019s binding precedent, Sills\u2019s appellate counsel would not have been able to convince us that the admission of the recordings violated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>rights under the Confrontation Clause. As a result, Sills cannot show that the failure to raise that argument caused him any prejudice, and his claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Because there is no reasonable probability that Sills would not have been convicted but for the alleged errors of his attorneys, the district court properly denied his motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
