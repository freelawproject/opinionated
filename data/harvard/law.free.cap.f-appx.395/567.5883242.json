Burnett brought a claim against the defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that they violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Burnett contends that the district court erred by finding that the arresting officers were entitled to qualified immunity on his malicious prosecution claim. He also contends that the district court abused its discretion by awarding costs to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of qualified immunity and resolve all issues of material fact in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Bryant v. Jones, </em>575 F.3d 1281, 1294 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cTo be eligible for qualified immunity, the official must first establish that he was performing a \u2018discretionary function\u2019 at the time the alleged violation of federal law occurred.\u201d <em>Crosby v. Monroe County, </em>394 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2004). If the official makes that showing, \u201cthe plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that the official is not entitled to qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff must show that the defendant has committed a constitutional violation and that the constitutional right the defendant violated was clearly established when the violation occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">\u201cTo determine whether an official was engaged in a discretionary function, we consider whether the acts the official undertook are of a type that fell within the employee\u2019s job responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). There can be no serious dispute that the police officer defendants in the present case were acting within their discretionary authority when they stopped Burnett and arrested him for racing and driving under the influence of alcohol. The official responsibilities of a police officer on patrol include making traffic stops and arresting people who are suspected of committing traffic violations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>See id.; see also Lee v. Ferraro, </em>284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]here can be no doubt that [the defendant police officer] was acting in his discretionary capacity when he arrested\u201d the plaintiff.). Thus, despite Burnett\u2019s arguments to the contrary, the district court correctly shifted the burden to Burnett to show that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Lee, </em>284 F.3d at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Burnett, the officers had arguable probable cause to arrest him for racing. <em>See Crosby, </em>394 F.3d at 1332 (\u201cQualified immunity applies when there was arguable probable cause for an arrest even if actual probable cause did not exist. Arguable probable cause exists if, under all of the facts and circumstances, an officer reasonably could \u2014 not necessarily would \u2014 have believed that probable cause was present.\u201d). Burnett testified in his deposition that he was driving a truck with holes in the muffler, and the truck was loud while idling or driving. He also testified that he was driving about forty miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">That testimony supports Officer Wright\u2019s statement that he heard the truck\u2019s loud motor and then saw the truck and another vehicle accelerate from a stop and travel at a high rate of speed for a short distance. Based on those observations, a police officer reasonably could have believed that there was probable cause to arrest Burnett for racing. <em>See </em>Ga.Code \u00a7 40-6-186(a)(2), (b) (making racing a crime and defining it as \u201cthe use of one or more vehicles in an attempt to outgain, outdistance, or prevent another vehicle from passing\u201d); <em>cf. Dodd v. State, </em>205 Ga.App. 472, 422 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1992) (holding that there was enough evidence to find defendants guilty of racing where officers heard the sound of two cars \u201caccelerating at a high rate of speed,\u201d observed them going above the speed limit, and believed the cars were trying to outrun each other, even though the distance between the two cars stayed the same).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Even though Officers Guest and Simpson did not personally observe what Officer Wright witnessed, they reasonably relied on the information that Wright provided about the suspected racing offense. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>759 F.2d 1486, 1494 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks and alteration omitted) (\u201cProbable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the collective knowledge of law enforcement officials, of which they had reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d). Guest and Simpson had arguable probable cause to stop Burnett and arrest him for racing. Because there was arguable probable cause to arrest Burnett for that offense, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Brown v. City of Huntsville, Ala., </em>608 F.3d 724, 735 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cIf the arresting officer had arguable probable cause to arrest for any offense, qualified immunity will apply.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with regard to Burnett\u2019s malicious prosecution claim against the officers. <em>See Wood v. Kesler, </em>323 F.3d 872, 881 (11th Cir.2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(\u201cTo establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, the plaintiff must prove a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures in addition to the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Burnett also contends that the district court abused its discretion by ordering him to pay costs to the defendants. \u201cAppellate jurisdiction is limited to <em>final </em>decisions of the district court.\u201d <em>Mekdeci v. Merrell Nat\u2019l Lab., </em>711 F.2d 1510, 1523 (11th Cir.1983). The district court has not fixed the amount of costs that Burnett will be required to pay. Therefore, the award is not final and we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cHere, the order in controversy is not final. While the district court has announced its intention to award costs to [the defendant], it has yet to fix the amount.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\">. Burnett also contends that the officers lacked arguable probable cause to arrest him for DUI even though Burnett later testified he had consumed three or four beers on the night of the arrest, Officer Wright smelled alcohol on Burnett\u2019s breath, and he refused to take a required, state-administered chemical test. We need not address the arrest for DUI because we have already determined that there was arguable probable cause to support Burnett\u2019s arrest for racing. <em>See Brown, </em>608 F.3d at 735.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
