Cannion argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court failed to provide a written statement to explain why it departed upward and that omission prevents any meaningful review of the reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2); United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-16\">Cannion pleaded guilty to distributing and conspiring to distribute cocaine base without the benefit of a plea agreement, and the district court accepted his pleas of guilty. The presentence investigation report provided a base offense level of 30 and an adjusted offense level of 27. The report discussed Cannion\u2019s prior convictions, which included several drug-related crimes, grand theft of a motor vehicle on three occasions, possessing a concealed firearm, aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer, obstructing an officer with violence, and battery. With a criminal history of VI, the report provided a sentencing range between 130 and 162 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-18\">The government objected to the presentence report and asked the district court to depart upward on the ground that Cannion\u2019s criminal history category failed to account for Cannion\u2019s extensive criminal background. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. The government requested that the district court depart upward to a base offense level of 38, which would result in an adjusted offense level of 35 and an advisory guideline range of 292 to 365 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-19\">At the sentencing hearing, the government mentioned several of Cannion\u2019s felony convictions and argued that, because his crimes were \u201csubstantial in number and serious in character,\u201d his sentence should \u201cbe calculated as a career offender.\u201d When the district court asked Cannion about the departure, defense counsel responded, \u201cRegardless ... of how Mr. Cannion is characterized ... as a career offender or not, there is no objection to the upward departure.\u201d The district court later asked if Cannion had \u201cany objection ... to the proposal by the United States\u201d of \u201can adjusted offense level of 35,\u201d and Cannion responded \u201c[n]o objection.\u201d Cannion requested a sentence at the low end of the guideline range. The district court \u201cadopt[ed] the facts statement in the presentence report\u201d and the \u201cOffense Lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>el of 35 and a Criminal History Category of VI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The district court sentenced Cannion to 292 months of imprisonment. The district court explained that its decision was based on \u201cthe applicable policies and guidelines of the United States Sentencing Commission ... the advisory sentence that is derived from them ... [and] the factors [of] 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d The district court did not include in its written judgment a statement that explained the \u201cspecific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The government argues that Cannion is barred by the doctrine of invited error from complaining about the lack of a written explanation for the upward departure, but we disagree. A party invites error by inducing or agreeing to a decision that it later claims constitutes error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>449 F.3d 1154, 1157 (11th Cir.2006). Cannion assented to the decision to depart upward, but Cannion did not waive his right to a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a district court complied with section 3553(c). <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2006). An error in sentencing is reviewed for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Any error in failing to provide Cannion a written statement is harmless. The district court was not required to \u201cexplicitly discuss\u201d its reasons for bypassing each offense level under section 4A1.3(c), <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>71 F.3d 380, 383 (11th Cir.1995), and \u201cwhat transpired [at the sentencing hearing], taken together with the court\u2019s closing remarks ... provides a sufficient statement of the court\u2019s reasons\u201d for enhancing Cannion\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1573 (11th Cir.1990). The district court considered the \u201cthe applicable policies and guidelines\u201d and agreed with the government that an upward departure was necessary to address the quantity and gravity of Cannion\u2019s prior crimes that were described in the presentence investigation report. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 2(B) (\u201c[T]he nature of ... prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal record.\u201d). Cannion does not dispute the reasonableness of the upward departure and the record contains sufficient information that would have permitted Cannion to challenge the departure on appeal. Cannion was not harmed by the lack of a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Cannion\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
