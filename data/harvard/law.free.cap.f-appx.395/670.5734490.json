An immigration judge denied his asylum application as untimely and denied his requests for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) on the merits. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his subsequent appeal. Wang seeks judicial review of these decisions by way of petition, which we dismiss in part and deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-23\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-24\">In 1999, Wang left China and illegally entered the United States. In 2008, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the Department of Homeland Security initiated proceedings to have him removed from the country, Wang filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT. Wang claimed that in 1990, his pregnant wife had drowned in a river during an attempt to escape from government officials enforcing a prohibition on unregistered pregnancies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wang called one of the officials responsible for her death a barbarian and filed an official complaint about the incident. When another \u201cfamily-planning\u201d official later came to his house, Wang\u2019s refusal to pay a fine for the pregnancy led to a violent confrontation. In anticipation of his arrest, Wang escaped to a nearby city, where he lived for nine years until leaving the country. Although his older brother told him that the officials came looking for him every few days, they never found him.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Once in the United States, Wang began dating another Chinese immigrant, and despite the couple\u2019s inability to obtain a marriage license, Wang considers her his wife. The couple had a child in 2008, and they also live with the wife\u2019s son from a previous marriage in China. Wang testified that he fears sterilization and other persecution in China on account of his resistance to China\u2019s family-planning policies, his failure to pay the fine for his first wife\u2019s unregistered pregnancy, and his new wife\u2019s decision to have a second child with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">An immigration judge (IJ) determined that Wang\u2019s application for asylum was untimely because it had not been \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The BIA agreed with the IJ. Wang argues that the IJ violated his constitutional right to due process by failing to consider whether the 2008 birth of his child was a changed circumstance sufficient to justify his delay in applying for asylum. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Attorney General responds that we must reject Wang\u2019s due-process claim because he had no protected liberty interest in asylum. <em>Cf. Lonyem v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>352 F.3d 1338, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cTo establish due process violations in removal proceedings, aliens must show that they were deprived of liberty without due process of law, and that the asserted errors caused them substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">The Attorney General correctly notes that asylum is a form of discretionary relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (\u201c[T]he Attorney General <em>may </em>grant asylum to an alien____\u201d (emphasis added)). And it is true that \u201cthe failure to receive relief that is purely discretionary in nature does not amount to a deprivation of a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, </em>329 F.3d 1217, 1224 (11th Cir.2003). Nevertheless, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.\u201d <em>Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 306, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). And \u201cCongress and the executive have created, at a minimum, a constitutionally protected right to petition our government for political asylum.\u201d <em>Haitian Refugee Ctr. v. Smith, </em>676 F.2d 1023, 1038 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(5th Cir. Unit B 1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore turn to the merits of Wang\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">\u201cDue process requires that aliens be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Lapaix v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 1138, 1143 (11th Cir.2010). Wang\u2019s contention that the IJ failed to consider the birth of his child as a changed circumstance is, at base, a claim that the IJ denied him a \u201cfull and fair hearing,\u201d <em>Ibrahim v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987). But although the IJ had an obligation to give reasoned consideration to Wang\u2019s claims and the evidence supporting them, we do not require immigration judges to address each argument and piece of evidence separately. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Here, the IJ duly noted the birth of Wang\u2019s child and determined that his asylum application was still untimely. Insofar as the Constitution is concerned, Wang thus received the reasoned consideration to which he was entitled. Having disposed of Wang\u2019s due-process claim, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s untimeliness determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We therefore dismiss the petition to the extent it requests judicial review of the decision denying Wang\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">In considering Wang\u2019s claims for withholding of removal, we review both the BIA\u2019s decision and those parts of the IJ\u2019s decision adopted in its opinion. <em>Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350 (11th Cir.2009). We review any legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>but we may not reject factual findings unless they are so unsupported by evidence that the record compels it. <em>Id. </em>at 1350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">Wang is only entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d in China because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In other words, he must demonstrate that if he is removed to China, it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted on account of one of those protected grounds. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. One way to satisfy this burden is to prove past persecution, which gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that future persecution is more likely than not. <em>Id. </em>For the purposes of this determination,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion, and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Wang argues the BIA erred by finding that he was not likely to be persecuted if removed to China. He first claims that he suffered past persecution for his \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d after complaining about his first wife\u2019s death. Yet regardless of whether Wang\u2019s conduct was \u201cother resistance,\u201d he has not demonstrated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>was persecuted for it. Because he was only \u201cfined and threatened with arrest, but was neither detained nor physically injured diming his encounter with the family planning officials,\u201d Wang \u201csuffered no harm amounting to persecution.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 555 </em>F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Wang also argues that he is likely to be sterilized or otherwise persecuted in China for violating its family-planning policies. His purported violations include \u201creproductive behavior\u201d outside a legal marriage, his failure to pay the fine for his first wife\u2019s unregistered pregnancy, and having two children \u2014 namely, his own child and his new wife\u2019s son from her previous marriage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">We are mindful of our deferential standard of review for the BIA\u2019s factual determinations, and the record here does not compel us to reject its finding that Wang failed to establish a sufficient likelihood of future persecution. First, we agree with the BIA\u2019s determination that Wang is unlikely to be held accountable for his wife\u2019s son from a previous marriage because he has neither legally married the mother nor adopted the child. Second, although family-planning officials continued to look for him until he left China, Wang lived unmolested for nine years in a city only a short distance from the place where he had violated local population-control rules. Finally, the State Department reports submitted to the IJ indicate that the typical response to a violation of China\u2019s population-control program in Fujian Province, where Wang lived, is economic sanctions. Although \u201cextraordinarily severe\u201d fines may amount to persecution in some circumstances, <em>In re T </em>\u2014 Z\u2014, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 171 (BIA 2007), Wang has presented no evidence that the fines he might face would subject him to \u201csevere economic disadvantage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 173. Without that evidence, we cannot reject the BIA\u2019s finding that Wang would not be likely to face persecution in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">That leaves only Wang\u2019s CAT claim for consideration. But because he mentions that claim only in the procedural-history section of his brief \u2014 and without any substantive discussion \u2014 he has abandoned it. <em>See Yu v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1328, 1330 n. 1 (11th Cir.2009). At any rate, an alien who fails to satisfy the statutory requirements for withholding of removal under the INA rarely qualifies for CAT relief. <em>Compare </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2) (\u201cAn applicant ... may demonstrate that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the future in a country if he or she can establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted .... \u201d), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (\u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal under [the CAT] to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d). Because the record does not compel a finding that Wang is likely to be persecuted in China, we cannot conclude that he is likely to suffer torture covered by the CAT. <em>Cf. id. </em>\u00a7 1208.18(a)(2) (\u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Because we lack jurisdiction to consider Wang\u2019s asylum claim, we dismiss that part of his petition. We deny his requests for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>PETITION DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\">.

Although we lack jurisdiction to review ordinary determinations regarding the timeliness of an asylum application, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we may nevertheless consider constitutional claims and questions of law, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\">.
