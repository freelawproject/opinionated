Thorton was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment on Count 6 and 202 months imprisonment on Count 7, with those sentences to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-25\">The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), provides a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years for anyone who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) after three convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. In this case, Thorton pled guilty to violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ing \u00a7 922(g)(1). At his sentencing hearing, the district court determined that he had three previous convictions for qualifying offenses making him subject to the \u00a7 924(e)(1) sentence enhancement. The district court, however, did not impose the enhancement and instead sentenced Thor-ton to only ten years in prison on that count because his written plea agreement stated that was the maximum sentence he could receive. Thorton argues that the citation to \u00a7 922(e)(1) should be removed from his written judgment of conviction because he was not sentenced under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We do not need to decide whether the district court erred by failing to apply the ACCA because the government has not cross appealed Thorton\u2019s sentence. <em>See Greenlaw v. United States, </em>554 U.S. 287, 128 S.Ct. 2559, 2564, 171 L.Ed.2d 399 (2008) (holding that a court of appeals may not increase a defendant\u2019s sentence in the absence of an appeal or cross appeal by the government). Because Thorton\u2019s written judgment of conviction does not accurately reflect the district court\u2019s oral sentence, we remand to the district court to delete the reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) in the written judgment of conviction. <em>See United States v. Ridgeway, </em>319 F.3d 1313, 1315 (11th Cir.2003) (noting that an oral sentence controls when it is in conflict with the written judgment of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Thorton also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). \u201cGenerally, we review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute because it is a question of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>607 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2010). However, we review Thorton\u2019s challenge only for plain error because he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See id. </em>\u201cPlain error occurs if (1) there was error, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Thorton asserts that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power because possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is not conduct which has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Thorton\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir.2001). He also argues that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional as applied to him because the government failed to prove that his possession of a firearm had a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Thorton\u2019s argument is without merit. Section 922(g) \u201conly requires that the government prove some \u2018minimal nexus\u2019 to interstate commerce, which it may accomplish by \u2018demonstrat[ing] that the firearm possessed traveled in interstate commerce.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>607 F.3d at 715-16 (quoting <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1274). Thorton admitted as part of his guilty plea that the firearms he had possessed had traveled in interstate commerce. We conclude that no error occurred, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Thorton also asserts that \u00a7 924(c) is an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power. That argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Relying on <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), Thorton argues that \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(c) violate the Second Amendment. Because he raises these arguments for the first time on appeal, we again review only for plain error. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Wright, </em>607 F.3d at 715. As for Thorton\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1), we have already rejected it. <em>See United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 770-71 (11th Cir.2010). His challenge to \u00a7 924(c) is also without merit. Section 924(c) imposes enhanced penalties on \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm....\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Heller, </em>\u201cthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 2816. Nothing in that decision suggests that \u00a7 924(c) violates the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Finally, Thorton contends that \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), which requires a district court to sentence a defendant to \u201cnot less than five years\u201d in prison, is ambiguous because it does not specify the maximum sentence that may be imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). He argues that under the rule of lenity the maximum sentence should be five years rather than life imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Pounds, </em>230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2000) (observing that \u201cevery conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) carries with it a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, regardless of what subsection the defendant is sentenced under\u201d). We find no merit in Thorton\u2019s argument. Congress\u2019 express inclusion of a minimum sentence in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), but not a maximum sentence, does not make that provision ambiguous. It merely evidences Congress\u2019 intent to give district courts discretion in determining the maximum sentence to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We affirm Thorton\u2019s convictions and sentences and remand for the limited purpose of removing the citation to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) on his written judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
