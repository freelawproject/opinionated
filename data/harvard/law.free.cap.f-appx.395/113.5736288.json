Wyatt\u2019s petition challenged his 1996 murder conviction, for which he was sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The district court\u2019s order denying Wyatt a COA stated that the order dismissing Wyatt\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without prejudice was not final or appealable, but we have long held that a \u201cdismissal for failure to prosecute\u201d under Rule 41(b) is \u201ca final judgment disposing of the action and is appealable.\u201d <em>Dudley v. Cmty. Pub. Serv. Co., </em>108 F.2d 119, 121 (1939); <em>see also Larson v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1030, 1031-32 (5th Cir.1998) (affirming a sua sponte dismissal without prejudice for want of prosecution under Rule 41(b)). Accordingly, the Rule 41(b) dismissal of Wyatt\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without prejudice is appealable, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 2253(a), and a COA is required for him to proceed. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">To obtain a COA, Wyatt must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In this case, the district court ordered Wyatt to show cause on or before February 10, 2010, why his \u00a7 2254 petition should not be dismissed as time barred. On February 17, 2010, the district court dismissed the case without prejudice for want of prosecution under Rule 41(b). Two days later, Wyatt\u2019s response to the show-cause order arrived at the district court. At the end of the response, Wyatt declared \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that he deposited the document in the prison mail system \u201con this 10th day of February, 2010.\u201d Wyatt did not specify that he prepaid first-class postage, but the record shows that he used two first-class stamps.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-13\">Under Rule 3(d) of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases, Wyatt timely filed his response to the show-cause order, and the district court erred in finding that Wyatt missed the deadline and in dismissing Wyatt\u2019s case for failure to prosecute on that basis. Thus, \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). In addition, because Wyatt\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition sets forth a facially valid constitutional claim, and given that the state court records were not filed in the district court, \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id.; Houser v. Dretke, </em>395 F.3d 560, 562 (5th Cir.2004). Therefore, Wyatt is entitled to a COA. <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">\u201c[Bjefore acting on its own initiative\u201d to dismiss an apparently untimely \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred, a district court \u201cmust accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.\u201d <em>Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 210, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006). Because the district court effectively denied Wyatt an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>opportunity to present his position, this case should be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Although we ordinarily permit full briefing after granting a COA, \u201cthe sole issue ... is indisputably resolved by the petitioner\u2019s COA application and the record, making further briefing on that issue unnecessary.\u201d <em>Whitehead v. Johnson, </em>157 F.3d 384, 388 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we GRANT Wyatt a COA, VACATE the judgment of the district court, and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
