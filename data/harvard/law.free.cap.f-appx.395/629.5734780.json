The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant on all of Plaintiffs employment discrimination claims, including claims brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Florida Civil Rights Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.79, Defendant made Plaintiff an offer of judgment on the whistleblower and workers\u2019 compensation claims; Plaintiff rejected the offer. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees on the these claims because the claims arose from the same facts and circumstances as Plaintiffs Title VII and FCRA claims; and Defendant was unentitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on those claims because they were not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">On appeal, Defendant argues that the district court erred in not granting it attorneys\u2019 fees on the whistleblower and workers\u2019 compensation retaliation claims because an award of attorneys fees under the offer-of-judgment statute is not restricted to frivolous or bad faith claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Matter of Trinity Indus., Inc., </em>876 F.2d 1485, 1496 (11th Cir.1989). And we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and fact findings for clear error. <em>Jones v. United Space Alliance, L.L.C., </em>494 F.3d 1306, 1309 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">The Florida offer-of-judgment statute provides that in a civil action where the defendant prevails, if, before judgment, the \u201cdefendant file[d] an offer of judgment which [was] not accepted by the plaintiff within 30 days, the defendant shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.79(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Per <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm\u2019n, </em>434 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978), prevailing defendants cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees in Title VII cases unless the underlying claim was \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d In <em>Jones, </em>we applied <em>Christiansburg </em>to limit the application of section 768.79 to cases brought under the FCRA. We concluded that defendants cannot recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the FCRA, even after an offer of judgment, unless the action is determined to be frivolous because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number><em>Jones, 494 F.3d at </em>1310-11 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>(1) Florida courts have limited the application of [section] 768.79 in federal civil rights cases under [section] 1988 [the federal attorneys\u2019 fee statute] to those that are \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\u201d; (2) cases brought under [section] 1988 and Title VII attorneys\u2019 fees provisions are to be governed by the same standard; and (3) the FCRA is to be interpreted consistently with Title VII.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The district court relied on <em>Jones </em>in concluding that Defendant was unentitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on the whistleblower and workers\u2019 compensation claims. We discern no error in the court\u2019s decision. Title VI and whistleblower retaliation claims employ the same analysis, just as Title VII and FCRA claims do. <em>See Sierminski v. Transouth Fin. Corp., </em>216 F.3d 945, 950 (11th Cir.2000); <em>Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1389 (11th Cir.1998). And Florida courts have recognized the similarity and overlap between claims under the FCRA and the Florida Whistleblower Act. <em>See Rivera v. Torfino Enter., Inc., </em>914 So.2d 1087, 1089-90 (Fla.2005) (noting that the FCRA and the Whistleblower Act both protect against retaliation); <em>Underwood, v. Rhone-Poulenc Rarer Pharm., 890 </em>So.2d 429, 431 (Fla.2004) (concluding that appellant\u2019s FCRA claim was intertwined with his whistle-blower claim because the claims had a similar factual basis).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">All of Plaintiffs civil rights claims were based on the same set of facts. And these facts \u2014 whether brought pursuant to state or federal civil rights statutes \u2014 are governed by the same legal standards. Thus, because Florida law prevents awards of attorneys\u2019 fees, even after an offer of judgment, in state and federal civil rights cases absent a showing of frivolity, the court did not err in declining to award fees under section 768.79.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The record also supports the district court\u2019s alternative ruling that the offer of judgment was facially invalid and also precluded an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. The offer failed to discuss specifically Plaintiffs request for injunctive relief and failed to address how much of the settlement was attributable to each plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Dudley v. McCormick, </em>799 So.2d 436, 441 (Fla.2001) (reversing an award of attorneys\u2019 fees based on Fla.R.Civ.P. 1.442(c)(3), because the settlement proposal neither specified separate amounts for each plaintiff nor designated one plaintiff as the offeree); <em>Di Paola v. Beach Terrace Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>718 So.2d 1275, 1277 (Fla.1998) (reversing an award of attorneys\u2019 fees because offer of judgment failed to state whether defendant agreed to the entry of injunctions to satisfy the plaintiffs request for injunctive relief, yet it claimed to allow judgment on \u201call claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\">. Defendant does not challenge the denial of attorneys' fees on the Title VII and FCRA claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-16\">. Because the offer-of-judgment statute is substantive law, we look to Florida law to determine whether section 768.79 should be applied in this case. <em>Jones, </em>494 F.3d at 1309-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">.
