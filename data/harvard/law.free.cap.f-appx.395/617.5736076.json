We affirmed his convictions but vacated his sentence and remanded for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). On remand, the district court imposed a 293-month sentence, and Evans again appeals. Evans now argues (1) his original CCE conviction should be reversed, and (2) the district court committed a number of reversible errors at resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After careful review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss Evans\u2019s appeal as to his original CCE conviction and we otherwise affirm Evans\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-16\">Evans argues that, in our prior decision rejecting his faulty-jury-instruction challenge to his CCE conviction, we erroneously relied on <em>United States v. Moor-man, </em>944 F.2d 801 (11th Cir.1991). Evans contends that <em>Moorman </em>was abrogated by <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), and concludes that he is therefore entitled to a vacating of his CCE conviction and sentence. This argument fails because both Evans and this Court are bound by the law-of-the-case doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In our previous decision, we concluded that Evans\u2019s argument regarding the district court\u2019s refusal to give particular jury instructions was meritless. <em>See United States v. </em>Evans, 276 Fed.Appx. 926, 927 (11th Cir.2008). As such, our rejection of this claim and our consequent affirming of Evans\u2019s CCE conviction constitute the law of the case \u2014 in other words, Evans cannot now challenge what has already been decided. Because Evans has not shown that any exception to the law-of-the-case doctrine applies, <em>see United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996), we dismiss Evans\u2019s appeal as to this claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 293-month sentence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Evans\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the court correctly calculated Evans\u2019s guideline range \u2014 which did not change from his previous sentencing \u2014 and the court explicitly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Considering the reasons previously set forth by the sentencing judge in open court, the judge\u2019s reaffirmation of those reasons at the resentencing hearing, and the sentencing order\u2019s reincorporation of those reasons, we conclude that the court adequately addressed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sufficiently stated its reasons for the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1181-82 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Finally, and contrary to Evans\u2019s argument, nothing in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), or <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), required the district court to specify an alternate crack-to-powder ratio, or to explain why it rejected his suggested one-to-one ratio. Although <em>Spears permits </em>a district court to specify an alternate ratio, neither <em>Kimbrough </em>nor <em>Spears requires </em>a district court to expressly adopt a such a ratio. <em>See Spears, </em>129 S.Ct. at 843-44. Thus, because Evans\u2019s sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">. Evans was also convicted of trafficking in contraband cigarettes in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2342(a) &amp; 2344; discharging pollutants in violation of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1311(a) &amp; 1319(c)(2)(A); unlawfully transporting farm labor in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1811(a), 1812, 1841 &amp; 1851(a); structuring currency transactions to circumvent reporting requirements in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313(a), 5324(a)(3) &amp; 5324(d)(2) and 31 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 103.11 &amp; 103.22; and witness tampering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-18\">. Specifically, Evans contends that the district court failed to (i) adequately address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (ii) provide a statement of reasons for imposing the sentence, and (iii) articulate its own crack-to-power-cocaine ratio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b645-8\">. Under the law-of-the-case doctrine, \u2018\u2018[a]n appellate decision binds all subsequent proceedings in the same case,\u201d unless one of the following exceptions applies: (1) new evidence is presented, (2) there has been an intervening change in controlling law dictating a different result, or (3) the prior appellate decision is clearly erroneous and would result in manifest injustice if implemented. <em>United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1520 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">. We also note that Evans\u2019s contention that <em>Richardson </em>abrogated <em>Moorman </em>as to this issue is meritless. <em>Compare Moorman, </em>944 F.2d at 803 (\"[Jjurors need not be in unanimous agreement as to the identities of the five subordinates involved in a continuing criminal enterprise ....\u201d) <em>with Richardson, </em>526 U.S. at 824, 119 S.Ct. 1707 (\"[Ajssuming, without deciding, that there is no unanimity requirement in respect to\u201d the CCE statute's \"five or more other persons\u201d requirement).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b645-17\">. We review Evans\u2019s sentence for reasonableness, meaning we determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1321 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b645-18\">. A sentence must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1321-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
