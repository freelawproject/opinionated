In 1984, the former INS issued an Order to Show Cause charging that Diaz De Leon-Munoz was deportable because he had, within five years of entering this country and for gain, aided and abetted another alien\u2019s illegal entry into the United States. These proceedings were terminated that same year. In 2007 the Department of Homeland Security issued a Notice to Appear charging that Diaz De Leon-Munoz was deportable because his 1983 conviction was considered an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. An immigration judge concluded that Diaz De Leon-Munoz was removable on this basis, and the Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">This court is now presented with Diaz De Leon-Munoz\u2019s petition for review. Consistent with his arguments to the BIA, he contends that res judicata bars the instant removal proceedings because they are based on the same conviction as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>prior, terminated proceedings. Although we are generally precluded from reviewing removal orders when such orders are grounded in a conclusion that an alien should be deported from this country due to his commission of an aggravated felony, we have jurisdiction to review this legal issue. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 542, 544 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Test Masters Educ. Servs., Inc. v. Singh, </em>428 F.3d 559, 571 (5th Cir.2005). Diaz De Leon-Munoz\u2019s res judicata argument \u201clacks merit\u201d because \u201cthe current removal proceeding pending against [him] is based on a wholly separate provision\u201d than the prior removal proceeding. <em>See Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 305 n. 2 (5th Cir.2004). His petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
