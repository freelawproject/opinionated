White contends that the district court erred by finding that he was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction because of his career-offender status; his theory is that his downward-departure sentence he received resulted from the sentencing court\u2019s disagreement with the career-offender guidelines and its belief that the operation of the guidelines overstated his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">We review only for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to deny reduction of a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005), but we review <em>de novo </em>its conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In a section 3582(c) proceeding, a district court may not modify a term of imprisonment unless a defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The applicable policy statements provide that a sentence reduction is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if \u201c \u2018the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range <em>because of the operation of another guideline.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A))), cer<em>t. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 965, 173 L.Ed.2d 156, <em>and </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1601, 173 L.Ed.2d 689 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Amendment 706, which has been made retroactive, amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) \u201cto provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706. Nevertheless, if a defendant was sentenced as a career offender, his base offense level was determined under the career-offender guidelines in \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), and the drug-quantity guidelines in \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) ultimately played no role in his sentence. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. For that reason, Amendment 706 does not result in a lower guidelines range for the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1330. That is what the record before us indicates happened in this case. The sentencing court did grant White a downward departure from the career-offender-driven range based on his substantial assistance to the government, but the resulting sentence was not based on a sentencing range that was later lowered by Amendment 706. The sentencing range from which the downward departure departed was set by the career offender guidelines, which remain unaffected by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">White is like the movant in <em>Moore. </em>Amendment 706 reduced his base offense level but did not lower his applicable guideline range, which was dictated by his career offender status. As a result, White, like Moore, is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying him one.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
