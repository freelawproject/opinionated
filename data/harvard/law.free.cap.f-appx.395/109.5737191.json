Nubine has also moved to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-23\">To obtain a COA, Nubine must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). For claims dismissed on procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>grounds, Nubine must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). To the extent the dismissal was on the merits, he must \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEach component of the \u00a7 2253(c) showing is part of a threshold inquiry, and a court may find that it can dispose of the application in a fair and prompt manner if it proceeds first to resolve the issue whose answer is more apparent from the record and arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Nubine reiterates his contention that policymakers at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice are engaged in a conspiracy to violate his rights. Nubine, however, does not address the district court\u2019s contention that the conspiracy claim is unexhausted and procedurally barred from federal habeas review. Nubine has therefore abandoned the issue for purposes of his COA application. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Nubine argues that the district court erred by refusing to allow him to conduct discovery with respect to his habeas claims. He also contends that his due process rights were violated in connection with his loss of 23 days of good time credits as a result of his disciplinary conviction. As to the above issues, a COA is denied because Nubine has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Nubine\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Although the district court treated Nubine\u2019s filings solely as a habeas petition, Nubine also made allegations regarding a conspiracy to violate his civil rights and he raised complaints about the temperature in the area he was confined and the food he was being served. Nubine asserts that his district court filings set forth claims regarding the conditions of his confinement that were cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Additionally, he contends that the allegations as to a conspiracy \u201cshould not have gone unanswered\u201d by the district court. Giving his pro se filings the benefit of liberal construction, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993), Nubine is arguing that it was error for the district court not to have addressed his civil rights claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Where a habeas petition contains both habeas claims and civil rights claims properly brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the district court should separate out the \u00a7 1983 claims and address them. <em>See Patton v. Jefferson Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir.1998). As the district court did not separate and address Nubine\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, we will vacate the judgment to the extent it dismissed such claims and remand the civil rights claims for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">COA DENIED AS TO HABEAS CLAIMS; IFP DENIED; DISMISSAL OF CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS VACATED; REMAND FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS AS TO CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b135-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
