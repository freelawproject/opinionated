Ayestas Zelaya appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Ayestas Zelaya argues his second state conviction for simple possession did not constitute an aggravated felony but concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-20\">After Ayestas Zelaya filed his brief, however, the Supreme Court held in an immigration proceeding that \u201cwhen a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a \u2018felony punishable\u2019 as such \u2018under the Controlled Sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>stances Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2589, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he mere possibility that the defendant\u2019s conduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of conviction, could have authorized a felony conviction under federal law is insufficient....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Ayestas Zelaya now moves, without opposition, to vacate and remand for resentencing. IT IS ORDERED that, in light of <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>Ayestas Zelaya\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence and to remand his case to the district court for resentencing is GRANTED. The motion to issue the mandate forthwith is also GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
