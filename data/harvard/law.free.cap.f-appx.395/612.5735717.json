He argues <em>pro se </em>that the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) and Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) erred by finding his asylum application untimely. Further, Cruz-Solis contends that the IJ erred in its credibility determination. Finally, he argues that the record compels granting his application for withholding of removal or CAT relief because he established that his father was persecuted by the Ladinos guerilla based on his Mayan ancestry. Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">Cruz-Solis, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered into the United States without inspection at an unknown place around January 1, 1995. In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) issued him a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d), charging him as removable pursuant to INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(A) due to being a citizen of Guatemala and lacking U.S. citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">On February 15, 2008, Cruz-Solis filed his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. According to his application, Cruz-Solis was born on June 19, 1984, in the village of Patzalan. Cruz-Solis claimed that he feared persecution by the Ladinos who created problems for indigenous people in Guatemala, specifically Mayans.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">In January 2009, Cruz-Solis appeared before an Immigration Judge with an attorney and conceded removability. At a removal hearing in March 2009, Cruz-Solis testified that he came from Guatemala and originally spoke Awakateko. He left on December 20, 1994, and arrived in the United States on January 1, 1995. He testified that he left Guatemala because the Ladinos guerrillas made threats against his family when he was eleven years old. Specifically, on December 5, 1994, the Ladinos attempted to recruit Cruz-Solis\u2019 father to join their guerrillas even though he was a member of the Civil Patrol. When his father refused, the Ladinos beat him. The Ladinos did not harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Cruz-Solis or his mother. Cruz-Solis claims that his father paid someone to bring him to the United States at the beginning of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">His father now lives in El Salvador, but his mother remains in Guatemala, Huehuetenango \u2014 an urban province approximately a half hour to one hour from where they used to live when the Ladinos beat his father. She left in 2002 because the neighbors \u201cbother[ed] her,\u201d but he did not elaborate on why. Cruz-Solis indicated that his brother moved to Mexico. Cruz-Solis further testified that he did not file his asylum application until 2008 because he was arrested, although it is unclear when precisely this occurred or how long he spent in jail. Cruz-Solis also testified that he was afraid to return to Guatemala because of the Ladinos incident with his father and their threat against his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Cruz-Solis submitted exhibits as well. He included a Wikipedia article from March 2009 on \u201cAguacat\u00e1n,\u201d which is a municipality in Guatemala, in the province of Huehuetenango. It is the only municipality in the world where Awakateko is the native language. The article also stated that the municipality suffered much violence during the civil war in the 1980\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Cruz-Solis also submitted a 2008 Country Report on Guatemala from the U.S. State Department. The report noted that, as a general matter, widespread social violence, including killings, and discrimination against indigenous communities. The IJ also noted that there were no reports that the government or its agents committed any politically-motivated killings. With respect to discrimination against indigenous people, the report stated that some people in those communities attained high positions, but they were generally underrepresented in mainstream society. It did not detail specific instances or discuss general patterns of violence presently threatening these groups. Finally, Cruz-Solis submitted a declaration, recounting the Ladinos\u2019 attack on his father. He asserts that the group always attacked Mayans.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">On March 18, 2009, the IJ rendered an oral decision denying Cruz-Solis\u2019 application. With respect to asylum, the IJ indicated that Cruz-Solis turned twenty-one in 2005, however, Cruz-Solis did not file an application for asylum until three years later. The IJ then reasoned that there was no adequate explanation for his failure to file an application for asylum sooner, particularly when he lived in a community with a number of Guatemalans who could assist him. The IJ explained that even if the one-year period to file began when he turned twenty-one, the application was still significantly late. The IJ invoked the pretermitted aspect of Section 208 of the INA. Thus, the IJ only analyzed Cruz-Solis\u2019 withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">The IJ concluded that there was little evidence to support Cruz-Solis\u2019 claim other than his testimony and the Country Report. The Country Report showed that indigenous Guatemalans had a presence with some political awareness and prominence. With respect to Cruz-Solis\u2019 testimony, the IJ found him not credible because he left aspects of his testimony unexplained. The IJ noted Cruz-Solis provided few details on how he supported himself as a child in this country, and other than his own admission, it was not possible to verify when he entered the into the United States. In sum, the IJ found that Cruz-Solis did not prove that he would be tortured if he was to return to his home country, and that he did not meet the standard for withholding of removal or CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">In a <em>pro se </em>appeal to the BIA, Cruz-Solis reiterated that he fled Guatemala in 1994 because his father was beaten by the Ladinos. He argued that the IJ erred by not taking into account the harms he suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>fered in Guatemala by the Ladinos and the cumulative effect of the harm. He did not challenge the IJ\u2019s credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">On January 14, 2010, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and dismissed his appeal. The BIA explained that Cruz-Solis failed to carry his burden to establish that his life or freedom would be threatened in Guatemala. The BIA also found Cruz-Solis\u2019 application for asylum untimely. Cruz-Solis did not challenge this determination on appeal. The BIA reasoned that the threats directed at Cruz-Solis were not based on a protected ground such as his Mayan heritage. Rather, the threats were based on the father\u2019s membership in the Civil Patrol and unwillingness to join the Ladinos guerrillas. Thus, the BIA concluded that the abuse of Cruz-Solis\u2019 father, without more, is insufficient to meet the heightened burden for withholding of removal. With respect to the CAT, the BIA found that he did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured by the government or those acting with its acquiescence. Cruz-Solis\u2019 <em>pro se </em>petition to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">This Court liberally construes briefs filed by <em>pro se </em>aliens. <em>See Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444 n. 3 (11th Cir.1997). We review <em>de novo </em>our subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that [the BIA] expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Therefore, we will review both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">We review the IJ and the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>and their factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Hernandez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1336, 1339 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Under this highly deferential standard, we view the record in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision unless the record compels it; \u201cthe mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 820 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">\n<em>A. Asylum</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">An application for asylum must be \u201cfiled within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). The lone exception applies when the alien proves \u201cthe existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). With respect to whether an application is timely, \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). We have held that this provision deprives us of jurisdiction to determine \u201cwhether an alien filed within one year or established extraordinary circumstances to excuse an untimely filing.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). In addition, we lack jurisdiction to review any issue that is not administratively exhausted, including matters not raised before the BIA. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Camocho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343, 1346-47 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">In this case, we are statutorily precluded from determining whether Cruz-Solis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>asylum application was timely or whether its untimely filing was justified by extraordinary circumstances. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). In any event, Cruz-Solis did not challenge the denial of asylum or the finding of untimeliness before the BIA. Because Cruz-Solis did not exhaust his administrative remedies, we do not have jurisdiction to hear this claim. Accordingly, we dismiss this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\n<em>B. Credibility Determination and Withholding of Removal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Adverse credibility determinations are factual findings and are also \u201csubject to the substantial evidence test, and may not be overturned unless the record compels that result.\u201d <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA, if he can show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened ... because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). An applicant seeking such relief bears the burden to show either: (1) past persecution in his country based on a protected ground, or (2) that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of the protected ground if he returned to his country. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006). This standard is more stringent than the standard for asylum. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\u201c[Pjersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and \u25a1mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (alteration omitted) (citation and quotation omitted). We are more likely to conclude that the record compels a finding of past persecution when the applicant has suffered physical injury along with death threats. <em>Compare Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (threats at gunpoint and severe beating constituted past persecution); <em>with Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232-33 (death threats without injury did not constitute past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">Further, any persecution must be \u201con account of\u2019 a protected ground, which in the present case, would be Cruz-Solis\u2019 political beliefs or his Mayan ancestry. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Evidence consistent with private acts of violence or failure to cooperate with guerrillas does not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). In addition, where a petitioner\u2019s family remains in the country or region unharmed, it may contradict claims of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Cruz-Solis did not challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination before the BIA. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Camacho-Salinas, </em>460 F.3d at 1346-47 n. 1. However, even if the IJ had not made an explicit adverse credibility determination, Cruz-Solis was not harmed, and an isolated threat by the Ladinos is not extreme enough to be considered persecution, neither was the threat of harm based on a protected status. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258. Accordingly, Cruz-Solis has not demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">\n<em>C. CAT Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">To qualify for CAT relief, an applicant carries the burden of proof to \u201cestablish that it is more likely than not that he [ ] would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Torture is the intentional infliction of \u201csevere pain or suffering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>whether physical or mental.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). The regulations require the applicant to demonstrate that the torture would be inflicted \u201c \u2018by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez, </em>492 F.3d at 1239 (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Here, the record reflects that Cruz-Solis\u2019 mother remains unharmed in Guatemala, approximately a half hour to one hour from where they used to live. AR at 78. Although Cruz-Solis presented' evidence of an isolated threat, the incident involved his father, which does not establish that it is more likely than not that Cruz-Solis will suffer torture if he returned. Finally, Cruz-Solis has not met his burden to demonstrate he would be tortured by the government or by those acting with its acquiescence in Guatemala. Thus, he is not entitled to CAT relief. Accordingly, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
