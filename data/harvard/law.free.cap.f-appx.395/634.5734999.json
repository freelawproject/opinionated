Hanna appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of Hanna\u2019s application for disability insurance benefits. Reversible error has been shown; we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-24\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">A person who applies for Social Security disability benefits must prove his disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. The ALJ must evaluate (1) whether the claimant engaged in substantial gainful work; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the severe impairment meets or equals an impairment in the Listings of Impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform his past relevant work; and (5) whether, in the light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On appeal, Hanna argues that the ALJ erred in concluding, at step four, that Hanna retained the RFC to return to his past relevant work as a packaging supervisor. He contends that his hand tremors limited him to no more than occasional fine and gross manipulation; and the testimony of the medical expert (\u201cME\u201d) and vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) \u2014 which the ALJ relied on in making its RFC determination \u2014 supported these limitations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A claimant\u2019s RFC is \u201cthat which [the claimant] is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his ... impairments.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004). In making an RFC determination, the ALJ must consider all the record evidence, including evidence of non-severe impairments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The ALJ determined that Hanna had the RFC to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but that he was limited to \u201coccasional hand and finger movements, overhead reaching, and occasional gross and fine manipulation.\u201d In making this determination, the ALJ relied, in part, on the testimony of the ME. The ME, who considered all the medical evidence, initially stated that because of Hanna\u2019s tremors, his fingering/fine manipulation and handling/gross manipulation would be impaired depending on the task. The ME later stated that \u201cmost\u201d fingering/fine manipulation activities would be limited and that handling/gross manipulation activities would be limited to the extent they required steadiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment, as it was based on the ME\u2019s testimony, is problematic for many reasons. For instance, the ME did not specify whether the stated limitations were based on the medical evidence before Hanna\u2019s insured date or also included evidence from after this date; so it is unclear whether the assessment was significant to the relevant time period. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211 (a claimant is eligible for disability benefits where he demonstrates disability on or before the last date for which he was insured).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, given that the ME opined only that Hanna\u2019s manipulation limitations were task-based without specifying how often he could perform such tasks, it is unclear how the ALJ concluded that Hanna could occasionally engage in all forms of hand and finger movements, gross manipulation, and fine manipulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ME noted that tremors could impair tasks such as handwriting and doing precise manipulative work with the upper extremities. And the record indicated that Hanna did do some writing and handling of small objects at his job as a packaging supervisor. <em>See Lucas v. Sullivan, </em>918 F.2d 1567, 1574 (11th Cir.1990) (the ALJ may make an RFC determination only after considering the specific duties of claimant\u2019s past work and evaluating claimant\u2019s ability to perform them in spite of his impairments); <em>see also Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1219-20 (11th Cir.2001) (remand is necessary where the ALJ fails to evaluate properly the effect of medical symptoms on claimant\u2019s ability to work).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The ALJ also agreed with the VE\u2019s testimony that, under the RFC determination, Hanna could return to his past work. But this conclusion is not clear from the record. The VE answered many hypothetical questions and initially interpreted the ME\u2019s assessment to mean that Hanna\u2019s gross manipulation abilities were unlimited and so, with only a restriction to fine manipulation, he could perform his past relevant work. In a separate hypothetical, the VE stated that a claimant could not return to his past work as a packaging supervisor if restricted to occasional fingering, handling, and gross and fine manipulation. The ALJ also did not include the ME\u2019s steadiness restriction in the RFC assessment; and the VE testified that a person restricted to handling that required steadiness would not be able to return to Hanna\u2019s past work.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The ALJ must state the grounds for his decision with clarity to enable us to conduct meaningful review. <em>Owens v. Heckler, </em>748 F.2d 1511, 1516 (11th Cir.1984). The ALJ has not done so here. To the extent the ALJ based Hanna\u2019s RFC assessment on hearing testimony by the ME and VE, the assessment is inconsistent with the evidence. The ALJ did not explicitly reject any of either the ME\u2019s or VE\u2019s testimony or otherwise explain these inconsistencies, the resolution of which was material to whether Hanna could perform his past relevant work. Absent such explanation, it is unclear whether substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s findings; and the decision does not provide a meaningful basis upon which we can review Hanna\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s decision with instructions that it be returned to the Commissioner for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994) (we must reverse when the ALJ has failed to \u201cprovide the reviewing court with sufficient reasoning for determining that the proper legal analysis has been conducted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\">. Disability is the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-12\">. Hanna originally sought disability benefits because of a brain tumor and seizure disorder. But on appeal, his arguments are about only his hand tremors. So, we do not consider the RFC restrictions stemming from his seizure disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\">. Hanna did submit evidence about treatment after his last insured date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b662-12\">. The ME stated that, depending on the task, Hanna could face \"frequent\u201d to \"constant\u201d restrictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
