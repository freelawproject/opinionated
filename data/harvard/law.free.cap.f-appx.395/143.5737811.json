The district court sentenced him to 800 months in prison on Count One and 120 months on Count Two with the sentences to run concurrently. Plummer seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of audita querela challenging his sentence in light of <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>553 U.S. 377, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Plummer is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues and is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Plummer argues that two of the prior convictions used to enhance his sentence did not meet the criteria outlined in <em>Rodriquez </em>and \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. (n.l) and, as a result, he is entitled to relief in the form of a writ of audita querela. \u201cThe writ of audita querela permits a defendant to obtain relief against a judgment because of some legal defense arising after the judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993). A prisoner may not seek a writ of audita querela if he \u201cmay seek redress under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Plummer <em>cannot </em>assert this claim in a petition for writ of audita querela because redress is available under \u00a7 2255. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, even if Plummer is entitled to raise this claim in a petition for writ of audita querela, the claim is unavailing. Plummer\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Plummer\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">IFP DENIED.
