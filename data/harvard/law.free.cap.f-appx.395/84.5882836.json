He claims: his aggravated assault conviction was overemphasized by Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (unlawfully entering or remaining with the United States), and, therefore, his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and, he should have been sentenced below the Guidelines range because of his benign motives for reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">Athough <em>post-Booker, </em>the Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United, States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Angeles challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence; therefore, as noted above, our review is for an abuse of discretion. Because Angeles\u2019 sentence was within the properly calculated Guidelines range, it is presumed to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Angeles\u2019 contention that \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s emphasis on defendant\u2019s criminal history renders a sentence unreasonable is unconvincing. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). His personal history and characteristics, including his motives for reentering the United States, are also insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Angeles has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Angeles also contends that his sentence should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal-reentry Guideline, \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical data. He acknowledges, however, that this contention is foreclosed by our court\u2019s precedent and raises it only to preserve it for further review. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
