Chugach Support Serv., Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1231, 1234 (11th Cir.2005). The USERRA provides, in pertinent part, that \u201ca member ... in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment ..., promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4311(a). An employer violates the USERRA if the applicant\u2019s membership in a uniformed service is a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s adverse employment action, \u201cunless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such [membership].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4311(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">According to the statutory context above, we have held that the plaintiff must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination by showing, by a preponderance of evidence, that his protected status was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s adverse employment decision. <em>Coffman, </em>411 F.3d at 1238. \u201cA motivating factor does not mean that it had to be the sole cause of the employment action,\u201d but it has to be one of the factors that the employer \u201crelied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision on that consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and citation omitted). After the plaintiff meets the initial burden, the burden shifts to the employer to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, the affirmative defense that \u201clegitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1238-39 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In this case, the district court did not err in concluding that legitimate reasons standing alone would have induced Defendants to hire Jimmy Collins as the most qualified candidate to be assistant principal at Hanceville Middle School regardless of Gambrill\u2019s military involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Upon review of the entire record on appeal, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
