On appeal, Thompson asserts that the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">In reviewing sentences for substantive reasonableness, we consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and a sentence within the guideline range is ordinarily expected to be reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Thompson has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. As an initial matter, the applicable guideline range was 70 to 87 months, and Thompson\u2019s sentence of 70 months was at the low end of that range. <em>See id. </em>(recognizing that when a sentence falls within the advisory guideline range, we ordinarily expect that the choice is a reasonable one). Moreover, the statutory minimum for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) is 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, and the maximum is life imprisonment. The fact that Thompson received a sentence of 5 years and 10 months \u2014 well below both the statutory maximum and minimum, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(ii) \u2014 lends credence to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">As for Thompson\u2019s claim that the district court failed to give due consideration to Thompson\u2019s background under \u00a7 3553(a)(1), we are unpersuaded. The district court expressly said that it had considered all of the statutory sentencing factors, including \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and other pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, such as the significant quantity of marijuana involved and Thompson\u2019s role in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Next, while Thompson claims that his sentence, based upon his role in the offense in comparison to that of his codefendants, created a disparity in their sentences, the record shows that Thompson conceded at sentencing that he recruited one of these codefendants, and that he and his codefendants were not \u201cexactly similarly situated.\u201d In addition, the PSI stated that another of these codefendants delivered only money and communications equipment, whereas Thompson was the recipient of 4,217.5 pounds of marijuana. Thompson did not object to any of the facts established in the PSI, and the district court noted Thompson\u2019s involvement and advanced role in the crime in determining his sentence. Thus, Thompson has not shown that his and his codefendants\u2019 situations were similar enough that the differences between their sentences are unwarranted. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">With respect to Thompson\u2019s argument that his status as an alien will likely lead to his deportation upon release from incarceration, Thompson\u2019s deportation will likely occur no matter the length of the sentence, and Thompson has not explained how giving him a lower sentence based on this likelihood comports with the goals of sentencing. Indeed, we have noted, albeit in the similar context of downward departures, that we are not aware of any case in which we have \u201cupheld a downward departure upon collateral consequences related directly or indirectly to the defendant\u2019s status as an alien.\u201d <em>United States v. Maung, </em>320 F.3d 1305, 1308 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Additionally, Thompson argues that a variance should have been granted based upon the assistance he provided to law enforcement, but offers no additional legal or factual support for this argument, beyond contending that he could have given more assistance had he been the first among the defendants to be arrested. This is speculative, and in any event, because his cooperation was considered under the safety-valve provisions, he benefit-ted with a sentence that was nearly half the statutory minimum sentence of 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Finally, Thompson, relying on <em>Spears v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), argues that lower courts are not bound to apply the Sentencing Guidelines, and may impose a variance even if based solely on the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>disagreement with them. However, the district court acknowledged that the Guidelines were no longer mandatory and that it may deviate from the guideline range should it not find the range reasonable. Furthermore, the district court did find the minimum sentence provided for by the Guidelines, 70 months, to be reasonable and in compliance with the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">In sum, Thompson has not satisfied his burden to show that the court abused its discretion by imposing a sentence at the low end of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b567-9\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\">. Thompson argues that a sentence imposed below the statutory minimum is not by itself conclusive evidence that the sentence imposed is reasonable, relying on <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Indeed, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>we also considered where within the guideline range the imposed sentence fell and whether the sentence was supported by the statutory factors. <em>Id. </em>However, the sentence here was at the bottom of the guideline range, and, as discussed below, Thompson has not shown that it was not supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
