During the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that \u201cthe Sentencing Commission and Congress made a determination\u201d that Silva\u2019s prior alien transportation offense \u201cjustified a 16-level\u201d increase in his offense level. Further, the court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the place of the Court to second guess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>those determinations.\u201d Silva contends that this statement shows the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Because Silva failed to preserve the issue with an objection in the district court, we review his claim for plain error only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To demonstrate plain error, Silva must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If he makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to remedy the error but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Here, the district court made no obvious error. It is true, as appellant points out, that the Guidelines are not mandatory and are only one factor to consider during sentencing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, a district court should not presume the Guidelines are reasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the court in this case did not act as though the Guidelines were mandatory. While the court chose not to \u201csecond guess\u201d the Guidelines, it also found that \u201cpolicy reasons obviously support\u201d the decision of Congress and the Sentencing Commission to recommend a 16-level enhancement for a prior alien transportation offense. In addition, the district court concluded the Guidelines were \u201cappropriate\u201d for Silva in light of the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court specifically noted that Silva was intelligent and with \u201ca good family,\u201d yet he did not \u201cregard our immigration laws as laws that he needs to obey.\u201d The court\u2019s consideration of these other factors demonstrates that it did not err in presuming the Guidelines to be mandatory or reasonable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">Even if Silva could establish that the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory, he cannot show that this error affected his substantial rights. The district court never expressed a desire to sentence Silva to anything less than 46 months. It found that Silva \u201cdeserves a bottom of the guideline sentence.\u201d Thus, Silva cannot show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for the district court\u2019s error,\u201d he \u201cwould have received a lower sentence.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
