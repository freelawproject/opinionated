He argues that the Louisiana State Penitentiary officers used excessive force when they sprayed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>with an excessive amount of a chemical irritant and that their use of force was in retaliation for his successful appeal of a prior unrelated prison disciplinary conviction. He seeks damages, a declaratory judgment, and an injunction requiring officers to videotape any future use of force involving chemical agents. The district court determined that Williams\u2019s claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648-49, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Williams\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Mayfield v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>529 F.3d 599, 603-04 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Cousin v. Small, </em>325 F.3d 627, 637 (5th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">First, Williams argues that the district court erred in dismissing his claim that the defendants acted in retaliation for his successful appeal of a prior unrelated disciplinary conviction. Williams alleged under penalty of perjury that he was charged and convicted of an offense; Captain Hinyard had investigated and recommended that he be convicted; and his disciplinary conviction was overturned on appeal. He also alleged that about two weeks after his successful appeal, Captain Hinyard and others used excessive force against him in retaliation. In light of the foregoing, Williams has alleged a chronology of events from which retaliation may be plausibly inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164-65 (5th Cir.1995). Because an inmate is not required to demonstrate a favorable outcome of a disciplinary case if he is alleging a retaliatory motive, the district court erred in dismissing Williams\u2019s retaliation claim as barred by <em>Heck. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Next, Williams argues that the district court erred in dismissing his excessive force claim and did not apply the summary judgment standard; that <em>Heck </em>and <em>Balisok </em>are inapplicable because he is not challenging a disciplinary conviction or the length of his confinement; and that the defendants waived the argument that his claims were barred by <em>Heck </em>by failing to raise it in the district court. He contends that the district court\u2019s decision was unreasonable and contrary to federal law, citing <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), and he argues that the district court failed to follow <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992), and <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The record reflects that Williams was adjudicated as an habitual offender. Louisiana law provides that habitual offenders are not eligible to earn good time credits. La.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:571.3(0(2) (inmate sentenced as habitual offender under La. Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 15:529.1 is ineligible to receive good time credits). Although Williams argued that <em>Heck </em>and <em>Edwards </em>do not apply as a result in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, the district court did not specifically address this contention. It is therefore not clear as a matter of law that William\u2019s action would necessarily affect the duration of his confinement. <em>See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584; <em>see also Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 754-55, 124 S.Ct. 1303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>158 L.Ed.2d 32 (2004); <em>see also Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005). We therefore also vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s excessive force claim as barred by <em>Heck </em>and <em>Edwards </em>for further consideration of this issue. <em>See Edwards, </em>520 U.S. at 646-48, 117 S.Ct. 1584; <em>see also Muhammad, </em>540 U.S. at 754-55, 124 S.Ct. 1303; <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Finally, Williams\u2019s claim for prospective injunctive relief, if successful, would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed in the prior disciplinary proceeding. See <em>Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242; <em>see also Kyles v. Garrett, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 942 (5th Cir.2009) (unpublished). The nature of Williams\u2019s request is distinguishable from that in <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998)(en banc), as the relief sought here is purely prospective and would not call into question the past events. <em>See Wilkinson, </em>544 U.S. at 78-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242. Therefore, summary judgment was not appropriate on his claim for prospective injunctive relief. We do not, however, express any opinion as to the underlying merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and dismissal of William\u2019s claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
