In a two-count complaint, appellant claimed that appellee discriminated against her in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by faffing to make reasonable accommodations for her disabilities. As the district court noted in its February 18, 2010 order granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, appellant \u201chad a long history of migraine headaches and suffered from depression.\u201d Order at 2. She also suffered from \u201can eating disorder.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">The district court\u2019s summary judgment order lays out the salient facts regarding appellant\u2019s relationship with appellee\u2019s law school over a period that extended from the fall of 2004 to her dismissal from the school in the late summer of 2008. The district court concluded, on the basis of those facts, that appellant failed to establish that she suffered from a disability as defined by the ADA or Section 504. The court went one step further and assuming that appellant had established such disability, she failed to show that appellee failed reasonably to accommodate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-21\">We discern no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of appellant\u2019s claims. We therefore affirm its judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-17\">. Appellant claims in her brief that the district court erred when it failed to address her claim that appellee retaliated against her following her formal request for an accommodation of her disabilities. Appellant's complaint did not present the claim; thus, the court committed no error in failing to consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
