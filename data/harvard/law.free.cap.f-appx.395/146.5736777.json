Ruiz argues that his within\u2014 guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and thus is flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a) because the Sentencing Guidelines accounted for a prior conviction both to increase his offense level and to calculate his criminal history score. Ruiz further contends that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense and that the guidelines range did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), we rejected the same empirical data argument. <em>See also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). We also held that there was no impermissible double counting in the guidelines calculations that rendered the sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">Ruiz\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors and the appropriateness of his within \u2014 guidelines sentence. This disagreement does not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Ruiz has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within \u2014 guidelines sentence, and he has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>550 F.3d 382, 405-06 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 54, 175 L.Ed.2d 44 (2009), <em>overruled on other grounds by United States v. Balleza, </em>613 F.3d 432, 433 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b173-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
