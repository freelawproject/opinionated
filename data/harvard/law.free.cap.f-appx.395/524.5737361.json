The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) as to Williams\u2019 claim the inculpatory evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction because that evidence was based solely on the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements (insufficient-evidence claim). This Court then expanded the COA to include Williams\u2019 claim his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to the State\u2019s use of those prior inconsistent statements (ineffective-assistance claim). After, review, we affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-25\">Williams first contends the district court erred in denying his insufficient-evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>claim because, without the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements, the State could not have proven the elements of the offense. Williams asserts Supreme Court precedent holds a conviction based solely on such evidence violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">When considering a district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations <em>de novo. Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>568 F.3d 894, 907 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 1141, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2010). We will not grant habeas relief on a state prisoner\u2019s claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision: \u201c \u2018(1) ... was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) ... was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Putman v. Head, </em>268 F.3d 1223, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\"><em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), provides the federal due process benchmark for evidentiary sufficiency in criminal cases. <em>See Green v. Nelson, </em>595 F.3d 1245, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2010). \u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>99 S.Ct. at 2789.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">A conviction for aggravated battery upon an elderly victim under \u00a7 784.08(2)(a), Fla. Stat., requires proof the defendant intended to cause the elderly victim great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 784.045(1)(a), 784.08, Fla. Stat.; <em>Beard v. State, </em>842 So.2d 174, 175-76 (Fla. 2d DCA 2003). Intent \u201cmust be determined by surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Beard, </em>842 So.2d at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">The district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019 insufficient-evidence claim. Notably, even assuming prior inconsistent statements, standing alone, are insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Williams\u2019 conviction did not rest solely on such evidence. In particular, the State introduced two admissions by Williams that he had struck the victim. These admissions, along with evidence of the victim\u2019s injuries, the victim\u2019s vulnerable age, and other surrounding circumstances, sufficiently established each element of Williams\u2019 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Williams next asserts the district court erred in denying his ineffective-assistance claim. He asserts his trial attorney\u2019s failure to object to the State\u2019s use of the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements as the only substantive evidence of guilt amounted to deficient performance. Further, according to Williams, this deficient performance was prejudicial because his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>conviction rested solely on those prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">An ineffective-assistance claim presents a mixed question of law and fact which we review <em>de novo. Williams v. Allen, </em>598 F.3d 778, 788 (11th Cir.2010). To succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim, the petitioner must show his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because (1) his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The first prong requires the petitioner to show, \u201cconsidering all the circumstances,\u201d his attorney\u2019s \u201crepresentation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2064-65. Judicial review of an attorney\u2019s performance \u201cmust be highly deferential,\u201d and the court must \u201celiminate the distorting effects of hindsight\u201d and evaluate the attorney\u2019s performance from that attorney\u2019s perspective at the time the challenged conduct occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 2065. To meet the second prong, the petitioner must \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2067. The petitioner \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2068.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019 ineffective-assistance claim. Specifically, Williams\u2019 trial attorney was not deficient for failing to object to the State\u2019s use of the victim\u2019s prior inconsistent statements as the only substantive evidence of guilt. As discussed in issue one, there was other evidence that sufficiently established Williams\u2019 guilt, and such an objection would have been merit-less. Further, even assuming deficient performance, Williams suffered no prejudice because the totality of the evidence before the jury renders it reasonably improbable that, without the prior inconsistent statements, the jury would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-17\">. We note the State, on appeal, has changed its position on exhaustion as to the insufficient-evidence claim. Specifically, while the State conceded exhaustion in the district court, it now asserts that exhaustion is incomplete. Despite the State\u2019s arguments, however, we will examine the merits of Williams\u2019 insufficient-evidence claim. The district court ruled on the merits of the claim and exhaustion is not jurisdictional. <em>See Mauk v. Lanier, </em>484 F.3d 1352, 1357 (11th Cir.2007) (noting the exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional). As the district court did not examine the exhaustion issue because of the State\u2019s apparent concession or waiver of the issue, we decline to examine the exhaustion issue for the first time on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\">. We note that neither <em>Jackson </em>nor the other two Supreme Court cases cited by Williams provide that prior inconsistent statements are insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction. <em>See Jackson, </em>9b S.Ct. at 2792 (holding the circumstantial evidence in the record supported a finding of intent to kill); <em>Fiore v. White, </em>531 U.S. 225, 121 S.Ct. 712, 713-14, 148 L.Ed.2d 629 (2001) (holding the petitioner\u2019s conviction for operating a hazardous waste facility without a permit violated due process because the prosecution presented no evidence of failure to possess a permit); <em>Bridges v. Wixon, </em>326 U.S. 135, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1452, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945) (holding only that a court may not admit hearsay for substantive, as opposed to impeachment, purposes).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
