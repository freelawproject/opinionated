On appeal, Cabrera-Sanehez argues that his 41-month sentence is substantively unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>sonable. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s base offense level was 8, but he received a 16-level enhancement because of a prior conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense. He also received a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 21. With Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s criminal history category of II, his applicable guidelines range was 41-51 months. His offense of conviction carried a statutory maximum of 240 months. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The district court sentenced Cabrera-Sanchez to 41 months of incarceration (the bottom of the guidelines range) and a 3-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Cabrera-Sanchez argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in the light of his personal history and characteristics. He contends that the district court should have granted his request for a sentence below the applicable guidelines range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence in the light of the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A deferential abuse of discretion standard governs our review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging a sentence in the light of the record and the section 3553(a) factors bears the burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We do not deem a sentence within the advisory guidelines range per se reasonable, but \u201cordinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. And we will not vacate a sentence as unreasonable unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the section 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range or reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">That the district court considered Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s arguments in support of a below-guidelines-range sentence is clear. The district court expressly recognized Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s desire to be with his family, but also indicated concern about Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s prior 4 deportations. That the district court considered the advisory guideline range and the section 3553(a) factors when fashioning the sentence is also clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">In the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that Cabrera-Sanchez\u2019s sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was substantively unreasonable. The sentencing court\u2019s relative weighing of facts and circumstances is given deference absent a showing of a clear error of judgment; and no such error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\"> In support of a lower sentence, Cabrera-Sanchez argues that (1) he returned to the United States to be with his family, for whom he is the chief source of financial support; (2) his family now plans to move to Mexico with him and he will never return to the United States; (3) although he has previously been deported, he has never previously been incarcerated for being in the country illegally; and (4) his offense was a victimless crime, his previous drug-related conviction is 9 years old, and he has no history of violence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
