Riley also appeals the grant of summary judgment to Williams on Riley\u2019s state law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-26\">The district court granted summary judgment to Williams after it concluded that the undisputed facts in this case, taken in the light most favorable to Riley, conclusively demonstrate that Williams did not violate any of Riley\u2019s constitutional rights during the course of Riley\u2019s arrest. The district court also concluded that there was no evidence that Williams acted with malice during the arrest, as required under Georgia law to establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-27\">Our review of the briefs on appeal and the record in this case indicate no error in the district court\u2019s analysis of the facts or application of the law to those facts. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b694-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
