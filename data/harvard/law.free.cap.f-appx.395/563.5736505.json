Stat. \u00a7 501.204(1) \u2014 appeals from an order denying his motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Although we approve the district court\u2019s denial of Goble\u2019s motion as it pertained to fees under the Lanham Act and the FDUTPA, we reverse the court\u2019s order with respect to Goble\u2019s motion for fees on the contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Goble was the sole shareholder of North American Clearing (NAC), a stock-brokerage firm that entered into a software-licensing agreement with Brokerage Computer Systems (BCS). The companies\u2019 business relationship soured, and NAC sued BCS, which in turn filed counterclaims under the Lanham Act, under the FDUTPA, and for breach of contract. When NAC was forced into receivership, BCS filed a new lawsuit asserting the same claims directly against Goble.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">After the district court granted Goble\u2019s motion for final summary judgment, he moved the court for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to provisions in the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a); the FDUTPA, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.211(2); and BCS\u2019s contract with NAC. Over Goble\u2019s objection, the district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny the motion. This is Goble\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">A. <em>Fees Under the Lanham Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Parties who prevail on claims under the Lanham Act may recover their reasonable attorney\u2019s fees \u201cin exceptional cases.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). Defendants can qualify as prevailing parties, but even when a case is exceptional, we will only review the district court\u2019s decision on a motion for attorney\u2019s fees for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lipscher v. LRP Publ'ns., Inc., </em>266 F.3d 1305, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Goble\u2019s motion for fees under the Lanham Act. For the purposes of that statute, \u201can exceptional case is one that can be characterized as malicious, fraudulent, deliberate and willful, or one in which evidence of fraud or bad faith exists.\u201d <em>Tire Kingdom, Inc. v. Morgan Tire &amp; Auto, Inc., </em>253 F.3d 1332, 1335 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Aside from the evident weakness of BCS\u2019s claim and the company\u2019s decision to sue Goble only after NAC had entered receivership, nothing supports the contention that BCS acted maliciously or in bad faith by suing Goble under the Lanham Act. The district court thus acted within its discretion when it denied Goble\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">B. <em>Fees Under the FDUTPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Like prevailing parties under the Lanham Act, the prevailing party in an action under the FDUTPA may, according to the court\u2019s discretion, recover his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.2105; <em>Humane Soc\u2019y of Broward Cnty., Inc. v. Fla. Humane Soc\u2019y, </em>951 So.2d 966, 971 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007). A magistrate judge concluded that Goble had failed to establish his entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees under the FDUTPA because he had made no reference to the factors Florida courts consider when determining the appropriateness of discretionary fee awards. <em>See Humane Soc\u2019y of Broward Cnty., </em>951 So.2d at 971. The district court refused to consider Goble\u2019s objection to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation on the ground that his objection was not specific. <em>Cf. Marsden v. Moore, </em>847 F.2d 1536, 1548 (11th Cir.1988) (\u201cParties filing objections to a magistrate\u2019s report and recommenda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tion must specifically identify those findings objected to. Frivolous, conclusive, or general objections need not be considered by the district court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Although we believe Goble\u2019s objection was adequately specific, his argument before the district court was deficient in the same respect as his argument before the magistrate: he failed to discuss the factors relevant to the appropriateness of a fee award under the FDUTPA. We limit the scope of our review in civil appeals to arguments actually raised in the district court, and Goble\u2019s omission before that court of any argument concerning the factors that might justify an FDUTPA fee award constituted a waiver for the purposes of this appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). We therefore will not disturb the district court\u2019s ruling on Goble\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees under the FDUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">C. <em>Fees Under the Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">BCS\u2019s breach-of-contract claim against Goble depended on the theory that Goble had used NAC as his \u201calter ego.\u201d In other words, according to the complaint, \u201cGoble was the company and the company was Goble.\u201d The licensing agreement on which BCS sued contained a provision concerning attorney\u2019s fees: \u201cIf any legal action or arbitration is necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to any other relief to which that party may be entitled.\u201d Yet the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny Goble\u2019s request for fees under that provision on the ground that Goble was not a party to the contract. In other words, the court concluded that the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d meant \u201cprevailing party [to the contract].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s analysis. \u201cCourts should attempt to give words and phrases used in contracts the natural meaning or that meaning most commonly understood when considered in reference to [the] subject matter and circumstances.\u201d <em>Rupp Hotel Operating Co. v. Donn, </em>158 Fla. 541, 29 So.2d 441, 445 (1947).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The term \u201cprevailing party\u201d in the context of a provision describing \u201clegal action or arbitration\u201d is most naturally understood as a reference to the prevailing party in a legal action. <em>Cf. </em>FDUTPA, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.2105(1) (\u201cIn any civil litigation resulting from an act or practice involving a violation of this part ..., the prevailing party ... may receive his or her reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs from the nonprevailing party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">The district court\u2019s reading of the term, by contrast, would require the word \u201cparty\u201d to bear two meanings at once: \u201cparty to the litigation\u201d and \u201cparty to the contract.\u201d The magistrate judge concluded that such a reading was appropriate because the contract concerned the obligations of BCS and NAC to each other, without any reference to Goble\u2019s rights or responsibilities as an individual. But in our view, the provision regarding attorney\u2019s fees speaks plainly enough: in \u201cany legal action or arbitration ... necessary to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Although Goble was not technically a party to the <em>contract, </em>it was foreseeable that he might, given his role as NAC\u2019s owner and signatory to the contract on its behalf, become a party to <em>litigation </em>\u201cnecessary to enforce the terms of [the] Agreement.\u201d In these circumstances, allowing Goble to recover his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees is consistent with the apparent intent underlying the fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>provision \u2014 especially in light of BCS\u2019s alter-ego allegation that Goble was a <em>de facto </em>party to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Furthermore, even if the term \u201cprevailing party\u201d were patently ambiguous, ambiguities in a contract \u201cdo[ ] not allow courts to rewrite contracts, add meaning that is not present, or otherwise reach results contrary to the intentions of the parties.\u201d <em>Excelsior Ins. Co. v. Pomona Park Bar &amp; Package Store, </em>369 So.2d 938, 942 (Fla.1979). Given BCS\u2019s alter-ego allegations, it would be unreasonable for us to assume that the contract allowed BCS to seek attorney\u2019s fees from Goble \u2014 as it did in its complaint \u2014 without affording him the same opportunity if he prevailed on the claims against him. \u201cA reasonable interpretation of a contract is preferred to an unreasonable one,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 941, and we will not adopt a one-sided interpretation of the fees provision here without any evidence that such an asymmetry was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Although the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Goble\u2019s requests for fees under the Lanham Act and the FDUTPA, Goble was entitled to recover his reasonable attorney\u2019s fees on BCS\u2019s claim for breach of contract. <em>See Lashkajani v. Lashkajani, </em>911 So.2d 1154, 1158 (Fla.2005) (\u201cProvisions in ordinary contracts awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs to the prevailing party are generally enforced. Trial courts do not have the discretion to decline to enforce such provisions, even if the challenging party brings a meritorious claim in good faith.\u201d (citation omitted)). We therefore affirm the parts of the district court\u2019s order denying Goble\u2019s requests for attorney\u2019s fees under the Lanham Act and the FDUTPA, reverse the part of the order denying his request for fees on the breach-of-contract claim, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\">. The contract here provides that it is to be construed in accordance with Florida law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
