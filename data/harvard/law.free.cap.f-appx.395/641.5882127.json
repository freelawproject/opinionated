On appeal, Woodard argues that the district court improperly applied a four-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for his possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense because the state charge for aggravated assault that triggered the enhancement was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-22\">We review a district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s determination that the defendant used a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 <em>&amp; </em>n. 8 (11th Cir.1995) (involving the substantively identical U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (1994)). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, this court, after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-23\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a four-level increase is applied if a felon possesses a firearm \u201cin connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). \u201cIn connection with\u201d is defined by the guidelines to mean the firearm \u201cfacilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.l4(A)). \u201cAnother felony offense\u201d is \u201cany federal, state, or local offense ... punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.l4(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In Georgia, an assault occurs when a person either \u201c(1) [ajttempts to commit a violent injury to the person of another; or (2)[c]ommits an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately receiving a violent injury.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-20(a) (2010). Aggravated assault occurs when a person assaults \u201c[wjith a deadly weapon or with any object, device, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-21(a)(2) (2010). The minimum penalty for this felony offense is one year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 16-5-21(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm as the district court did not clearly err in finding that Woodard possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony offense. Because Woodard did not object to the PSI\u2019s narration of Woodard displaying a gun to Hill and yelling threatening statements at another person, the district court did not clearly err in finding that those facts constitute aggravated assault under Georgia law. Therefore, the district court properly applied the \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6) enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
