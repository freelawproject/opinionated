We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">Chen, a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, operated an internet caf\u00e9 in China where customers played a video game called The Legendary World. He also hired several experienced players who played the game to win virtual items that Chen would then sell to his customers for profit. Chen admits that his business was using pirated copies of The Legendary World and paid no royalties to the copyright holder, and he also acknowledges that the Chinese government considers this internet gaming to be a form of illegal gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">Although the Chinese government inspects internet caf\u00e9s on a regular basis, Chen testified that he evaded detection of the illegal activity at his caf\u00e9 for several months by simply closing his shop on the days when it was scheduled for inspection. Chinese authorities eventually shut down Chen\u2019s internet caf\u00e9 and issued a notice for his arrest. Chen\u2019s business partner and several employees were arrested, but Chen escaped and fled to the United States, entering the country illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-19\">Chen concedes removability, but seeks asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). He claims that he has faced past persecution and has a well-founded fear of future persecution for his political opinions and his membership in a particular social group, which he identifies as \u201cthe internet gaming community.\u201d He also argues that he is entitled to protection under CAT because he will likely be tortured if he returns to China. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied each of Chen\u2019s claims and ordered removal. The Bureau of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Because the BIA adopted the decision of the Immigration Judge without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We have jurisdiction to review only those issues where \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d), by first presenting the issue to the BIA. <em>Oman v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318, 321-22 (5th Cir.2009). When an alien appeals an IJ\u2019s decision and submits a brief to the BIA, \u201cthat brief becomes the operative document through which any issues that a petitioner wishes to have considered must be raised.\u201d <em>Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 319 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We review an IJ\u2019s determinations on asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under that standard, this court will not reverse the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">To qualify for asylum, an alien must demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of one of five protected grounds: (1) race, (2) religion, (3) nationality, (4) membership in a particular social group, or (5) political opinion. <em>Tesfamichael v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 109, 113 (5th Cir.2006). To demonstrate entitlement to withholding of removal, a petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on the basis of\u2019 one of the five grounds for asylum. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1138. This is a higher burden than for asylum; thus, a petitioner\u2019s failure to establish entitlement to asylum necessarily defeats a claim for withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Chen first argues that he faces persecution for his membership in a social group which he identifies as \u201cthe internet gaming community.\u201d To be eligible for asylum, however, the social group \u201cmust share a common immutable characteristic that they cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences.\u201d <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Chen presented no evidence that membership in the online gaming community is so fundamental to one\u2019s identity or conscience that it functions as an immutable characteristic. Indeed, Chen was primarily involved with internet gaming as a means of employment, and we have held that one\u2019s occupation is normally not so fundamental that it can be considered immutable. <em>Id. </em>at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Chen also argues that he was subject to persecution for his political opinions, but he has not offered any evidence that he was singled out for any political views. To the contrary, there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen\u2019s caf\u00e9 was seized because it was engaged in unlawful gambling and because it was using pirated computer software. Chen fails to identify any persecution by the Chinese government except for the closing of his illegal business.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Chen was not persecuted on account of political opinion or membership in any protected group, but because he was running an illegal business. And because Chen did not establish grounds for asylum, it follows that Chen also cannot meet the more stringent burden for withholding of removal. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Chen also argues before this court that he is eligible for protection under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>CAT because he is likely to be tortured if removed to China. But in contrast to his asylum and withholding claims, Chen made no argument regarding torture or CAT in his brief to the BIA. Because Chen did not fairly present this issue to the BIA, he has not exhausted the claim and we lack jurisdiction to review it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 318-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">In any event, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Chen has not shown it \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured if returned to China. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Chen presented a letter from his business partner attesting that the partner was imprisoned for three and a half months, but that letter makes no mention of torture. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 345 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe normal incidents of lawful sanctions do not constitute torture.\u201d). Chen claims to have been in contact over the internet with several of his former employees, but failed to preserve any of those alleged communications, even though he admits that his attorney had warned him that he would need to offer documents to support his claims. Thus, even if Chen had raised his CAT claim before the BIA, the evidence does not support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
