Rodriguez-Lopez asserts that the district court plainly erred in assessing him two criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because he did not commit the instant offense \u201cwhile under a criminal justice sentence.\u201d He insists that the error affected his substantial rights because without the two criminal history points he would have faced a guideline imprisonment range of 63 to 78 months, instead of 77 to 96 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-21\">To show plain error, Rodriguez-Lopez must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-24\">At the time Rodriguez-Lopez reentered the United States on June 10, 2009, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>was no evidence that he was under a \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4Al.l(d). Thus, the district court erred in applying the two criminal history points, and the error is obvious. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. There is nothing in the record, however, to indicate \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that the district court would resentence Rodriguez-Lopez to a lower sentence. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>596 F.3d 273, 277 (5th Cir.2010), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(May 5, 2010) (No. 09-10607). In fact, the district court denied Rodriguez-Lopez\u2019s request for a below-guidelines sentence. Accordingly, Rodriguez-Lopez has failed to show that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s error. <em>See Jones, </em>596 F.3d at 277; <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Rodriguez-Lopez also contends that (1) the district court committed significant procedural error in its consideration and weighing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and (2) the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we engage in a bifurcated review of the sentence imposed by the district court. <em>United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. If there is no such error, we then review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Here, after hearing arguments from both parties, the district court briefly but amply stated its reasons for choosing a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rodriguez-Lopez is essentially asking us to substitute his assessment of the appropriate sentence for that of the district court, which we will not do. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. He has not established that the district court abused its discretion in imposing his sentence, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See id.; United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Rodriguezs Lopez has failed to show that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456. The sentence is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
