Executors, to whom real property is devised by their testator\u2019s will, have an insurable interest therein by virtue of the trust; and where the insurers issue a policy to the testator in his life time, which does not require him to show that he was owner in fee, nor forbid an assignment of the property, and after his death they-renew the insurance in favor of his executors, without inquiry or representations as to their interest, the executors may recover thereon, although before the rertewal their interest has been, without the knowledge of the insurers, but in good faith, changed to a mortgage interest, by their selling the property, and taking back, at the same time, a purchase-money mortgage.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-8\">2. Thus, where an insurance company of the City of Hew York, insured a resident of the city upon a house, described as \u201chis dwelling house \u201d in another state, but without any representations or inquiries as to its occupancy, or as to the nature of his interest; and after his death, of which they were informed, they issued <em>to </em>his executors, also residents of Hew York, \u00e1ldessive annual renewal receipts, in the name of the estate or of the executors, and before the last of such renewals, which was given to the sole surviving executrix, she, in good faith, but without notice to the company, had sold the property, taking back a purchaser-money mortgage:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b412-9\"><em>Held, </em>1st.

Before the last of these receipts was given, the co-executor died, and the plaintiff, as executrix, sold and conveyed the property insured, and took back a mortgage to secure a part of the purchase-money; after which the dwelling house insured, was burned. The plaintiff,, on demanding payment of the loss, offered to assign the-mortgage to the company, but they refused to pay, on the ground that the change in the interest was without their knowledge or assent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-13\">The provisions in the policy and in the conditions annexed, which they relied on, and the only provisions having any bearing upon the question, were the following: \u201c This insurance [the risk not being changed] may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>continued for such' farther term as shall be agreed on, provided the premium therefor is paid and indorsed on this policy, or a receipt given for the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-4\">\u201c The interest of the insured in this policy, is not assignable, unless by consent of this corporation, manifested in writing; and in case of any transfer or termination of the interest of the insured, either by sale or otherwise, without such consent, this policy shall from thenceforth be void and of no effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-5\">\u201c If any person insuring any building or goods in this office, shall make any misrepresentation or concealment; or if, after insurance is effected, either by original policy or by the renewal thereof, the risk shall be increased by any means whatever within the control of the assured; or if such building or premises shall be occupied in any way so as to render the risk more hazardous .than, at the time of insuring, such insurance shall be void and of no effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">\u201c Property held in trust, or on commission, must be insured as such, otherwise the policy will not cover such property; and in case of loss, the names of the respective owners shall be set forth in the preliminary proofs of such loss, together with their respective interests therein. <em>Goods on storage must he separately ancl specifically insured.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">\u201c If the interest in property to be insured be a <em>lease-hold </em>interest, or other interest not <em>.absolute, </em>it must be so represented to the company, and expressed in the policy in writing, otherwise the insurance shall be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">\u201c Hote.\u2014By \u2018 property held in trust,\u2019 is intended, property held under a deed of trust, or under the appointment of a Court of law, or property held as collateral security; in which latter case, this company shall be liable only to the extent of the interest of the assured in such property.\u201d \u201c Insurances once made may be continued for such further time as may be agreed on, the premium required therefor being paid and indorsed on the policy, or a receipt given for the same; and all insurances, original or renewed, shall be considered as made under the original representation, in-so far as it may not be varied by a new representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tion in writing, which in all cases it shall be incumbent on the party insured to make, where the risk has been changed, either within itself or by the surrounding or adjacent buildings; and if, at or before the time of renewing any policy of insurance on property where the risk has been increased by the erection of buildings, or by the use or occupation of the premises insured or of the neighboring premises, the assured shall fail to give information thereof, said policy and renewal shall be void and of no effect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-5\">- By Ms will the testator devised the rest, residue and remainder of his real and personal estate, (including the premises on which .the buildings insured by the defendants were erected,) to his executors, who should qualify, in trust to manage,' sell and convey the same, for the purposes in the will named, and gave an absolute power of sale to such of his executors as should qualify.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-6\">The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Barbour and a Jury, on the 13th of January, 1862; and at the close of the trial the Oourt directed a verdict for the plaintiff.

The only interest insured by the policy was that of Anson G-.

Co., </em>19 N. Y. R., 305.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-10\">II. Plaintiff had no insurable interest, except as executrix, vested with the fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-11\">As mortgagee she took simply a chattel interest, and \"all the interest and estate wMch was insured she had formally conveyed, with warranty, at the time of the last renewal. <em>(Curtis </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>1 Smith, 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b415-12\">III.

The last certificate was a renewal of the original policy,, and the interest of Mr. Phelps, which was absolute, continued so in his devisees under the will, to the extent of their mortgage interest. The granting of a deed and taking back a mortgage did not change the nature of the insurable interest, to the extent of the mortgage. (Ellis on Fire Ins., [Shaw\u2019s ed.,] 69; <em>Etna Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>16 Wend., 397; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Mass. F. &amp; M. Ins. Co., 2 </em>Pick., 249; <em>Jackson v. Mass. Mut. Fire Ins.

If the policy became void, the certificate was a new insurance of the interest of the executrix, whatever that might be, whether owner or mortgagee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b416-7\">III. It is not necessary that any representation should be made as to the interest of the insured, if no inquiries are made. (Pars. Merc. Law, 509; <em>Traders\u2019 Ins.

If the insurer deems it material to know the interest, he should make special inquiries. <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>The Manf. Ins. Co., </em>10 Pick., 40; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Ins.

C., 551.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b416-8\">By the Court\u2014Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">At the date of the policy (December 4,1857,) the assured resided in the City of Hew York. The policy does not so state, nor is the fact directly proved. He died on the 18th of May, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>1858, having left a last will and testament, which was duly proved before the Surrogate of the County of Kew York, and letters testamentary were issued thereon to the execu-. trix and executor therein named, July 30th, 1858. The plaintiff and John L. Mason, (since deceased,) qualified as executrix and executor. The fact of the residence of all these parties in the City of Hew York was so well known that no mention appears to be made of it, either in the policy, pleadings, proofs, or points made on this appeal. Of course the insured property was not supposed to be occupied by the testator personally when the policy was made, but it'was known that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">It does not appear that any representation was made that the testator owned it in fee, nor does it appear that any questions were asked on the subject. The description of the property, in the policy as \u201c his frame dwelling house\u201d and \u201cMs frame barn,\u201d would not in case of a loss in his lifetime, make it indispensable to his right to recover, that he should prove he owned them in fee. <em>(The \u00c6tna Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>16 Wend., 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">His death did not terminate the policy. <em>(Burbank </em>v. <em>Rockingham Mut. Ins. Co., 4 </em>Foster, 550.) If he had conveyed the property in his lifetime, taking back, <em>eo instanti, </em>a mortgage to secure the purchase-money, he would, notwithstanding, have had a continuous interest in the property. That fact would not have forfeited the policy, under the clause, which declares that \u201cin case of any transfer or termination of the interest of the insured \u201d in tMs policy, \u201c either by sale or otherwise,\u201d without the consent of the corporation, manifested in writing, \u201cthis policy shall from thenceforth be void and of no effect.\u201d The provision in this policy, on this subject, is in the words of that in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Saratoga M. F. Ins. Co., </em>(1 Hill, 497,) and it was there construed to refer to a transfer of interest in the policy\u00bb and not to a change of interest in the property insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Hor would a conveyance by the assured in his lifetime, and taking back, <em>eo instanti, </em>a mortgage to secure the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>chase-money, have been a bar to a recovery, in case of a subsequent loss in his lifetime, and during the term for which the property was insured. <em>(Morrison </em>v. <em>Tennessee M. &amp; F. Ins. Co., </em>18 Missouri, <em>262; Norcross </em>v. <em>Insurance Companies, 17 </em>Penn. St., 429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">There is no provision in the policy which, in terms, declares that it should, in such a contingency, become null and void. On general principles, the fact of a change in the nature or extent of the assured\u2019s interest in the property, would not invalidate the policy, the interest having been continuous, from the inception of the policy to the time of the loss, and the risk not having been increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We think that the rights of the present plaintiff to recover, are quite as clear, if not more free from doubt, than those of the testator would have been were he living, and a certificate of renewal had been issued to him after conveying, and taking a mortgage of the premises to secure the purchase-money, and a loss had occurred after such renewal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">After the death of the testator, and on the third of December, 1858, the company issued a certificate of the renewal of the policy for one year, on a receipt of the premium therefor, from \u201c <em>the-estate </em>of Anson G. Phelps, Jr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">On the 30th of November, 1859, a further or second certificate of a renewal of the policy for one year from the fourth of December, 1859, was executed and delivered, on a receipt of the premium therefor from \u201c Mrs. Jane G. Phelps, <em>Executrix, </em>and John L. Mason, <em>Ex'r </em>of A. G. Phelps, Jr.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">On the 3d of December, 1860, (John L. Mason having died in the meantime,) the company issued a further certificate of the renewal of the policy for one year from the 4th of December, 1860, on the receipt of the premium therefor \u201c <em>from Mrs. Jane G. Phelps, </em>&amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The loss occurred on the 14th of February, 1861.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Ho representations were made, and no questions were asked at the time of either renewal, as to the nature or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>extent of the interest designed to be protected by extend ing the policy and continuing it iu force.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The company knew that Anson G. Phelps, Jr., was dead, and the renewals' were not granted, to keep him insured on property owned by him in fee; whether the estate had been devised by his will, to his executors, in fee, upon specified trusts, or whether they had been clothed with authority to sell, and had exercised that authority, and in so doing had taken a mortgage to secure the purchase-money, \"the company did not consider it important to inquire. The plaintiff did not misrepresent, and has not practiced bad faith, and has done nothing subsequent to any renewal to increase the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Since the renewal granted to \u201cMrs. Jane G. Phelps, &amp;c.,\u201d alone, there has been no change in her condition as to the property; she was then a mortgagee of the premises, under a mortgage to her as executrix, and continued to be such up to the time of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Executors, as such, are merely representatives of the personal property of a deceased; as mere executors, they have no interest in or control over the real estate of their testator. When property is devised to executors in trust, they act <em>quo ad hoc </em>as trustees, and account for their acts in regard to the real estate so devised, as trustees, (2 R. S., 82, \u00a7 6; Id., 94, \u00a7\u00a7 65 and 66.) By chap. 272, of the Laws of 1850, the powers of the Surrogate were extended, in the matter of settling the accounts of trustees created by a last will and testament.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Whatever may be the legal effect of granting the several renewals, under the circumstances under which they were made; and whatever may be the obligation thereby imposed on the insurance company, there are no words found either in the policy or in the renewal certificates which, (being construed in their usual acceptation,) declare in terms, such legal effect, or the nature and extent of such obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Looking at the parties intended to be insured by the graht of the renewal certificates, and considering the facts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that executors merely as such, can have no interest in the real estate owned by the testator at the time of his decease, but may be made by the will trustees of the real estate, with a power to sell on credit, or may be invested with a naked power to sell and convert, and to sell wholly or in part on credit, and that no representations were made or questions asked; the insurance company must be deemed to have intended to insure, and to have insured such interest in the real estate in question as had become vested in the executors by the terms of the will, and 'by their lawful acts in the due exercise of the powers conferred on them thereby and the grant of letters testamentary to them thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The risk originally taken not being increased by this construction of the policy, and this construction not being opposed to anything expressed in it, or by the fair import of either of its provisions, this construction should be maintained, as <em>obviously </em>conforming to the intent of the insurer and insured, manifested by their acts and th\u00e9' circumstances under which they were performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
