Elston, Plaintiff and Appellant, v. William C. Potter, Defendant and Respondent.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b644-12\">In an action to recover the possession of specific personal property, an order of arrest which recites that the cause of action is for a detainer or conversion, and requiring the Sheriff to hold the defendant to bail, in a specified sum, is unauthorized. In such an. action, the ground of arrest is a concealment, &amp;c., of the property, and the order must require an undertaking to pay the amount which may be recovered.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b644-13\">(Before all the Justices.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b644-14\">Heard, October 11, 1862;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOB\">decided, October 18, 1862.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-15\">Appeal from an order, made at Special Term, vacating an order of arrest theretofore granted in the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The action was brought to recover the possession of a railroad bond, which plaintiff claimed to own, and alleged that defendant had converted. The plaintiff obtained, upon affidavit, an order for the arrest of the defendant, which order, omitting the formal parts, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-5\">\u201c It having been made to appear to me by affidavit, that th\u00e9 above named plaintiff has a sufficient cause of action against said defendant, for wrongfully detaining or converting personal property, and that said defendant has disposed of or concealed said personal property, with intent to deprive the plaintiff of the benefit thereof, and to prevent its being found and taken by said Sheriff. You are required forthwith to arrest William 0. Potter, the defendant in this action, for the cause aforesaid, and hold him to bail in the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, and to return this order,\u201d &amp;e.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-6\">The JuStice who granted the order, subsequently, on motion of the defendant, vacated it, and from the order entered upon this decision the plaintiff now appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-7\"><em>J. C. Dimmick, </em>for plaintiff, appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-8\"><em>A. Prentice, </em>for defendant, respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b645-9\">By the Court \u2014Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABq\">The authority and direction to the Sheriff \u201c <em>to hold the defendant to bail,\u201d </em>are contained and to be found only in the order of arrest. (\u00a7 183, Code.) The order of arrest in this action states \u201c that the plaintiff has a <em>sufficient cause of action </em>against said defendant for <em>wrongfully detaining </em>or <em>converting personal property,\u201d </em>&amp;c. Under such an order the Sheriff could demand only such an undertaking as is required under subdivision 1 of section 179 of the Code, \u201c that the defendant shall at all times render himself amenable to the process of the Court,\u201d &amp;c. (\u00a7 187.) Such an order of arrest was obtained in the action in the Supreme Court and voluntarily abandoned by the plaintiff. The counsel for the respective parties conceded, and it appears by the papers used upon this appeal, that this is an action \u201c to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>recover the <em>possession </em>of personal property, &amp;c., and in such an action the order of arrest is granted upon the ground that the property is concealed, &amp;c., by the defendant so that it cannot be found, and with the intent that it shall not be found and taken by the Sheriff, and requires the Sheriff to take from the defendant an undertaking to pay the amount which may be recovered against the defendant. (Sub. 3, \u00a7 179 and \u00a7 211, Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The order of arrest was therefore properly discharged, and the order made at Special Term must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
