Draper, the broker of White, the plaintiff, gave the defendants, who were also stock brokers, a written order, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-9\">\u201c Few York, 18th July, 1861.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-10\">\u201c Messrs.

Draper obtained the ten per cent from the plaintiff, and paid it to the defendants as security to the seller on the purchase. Fo purchase was, in fact, made by the defendants, but a contract to purchase and to receive within sixty days at the buyer\u2019s option.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-15\">On the 31st August the contract was closed by Draper, by the plaintiff\u2019s order, at a loss, leaving, however, out of the 81,000, a balance of $613.38 in the defendants\u2019 hands,t to recover which the action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-16\">The defendants claimed to set off a debt due from Draper to them, which more than exhausted the balance in their hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-17\">The Referee overruled the set-off, and reported in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of the balance and interest*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>It did not appear that at any time Draper disclosed, or the defendants knew that he was the plaintiff\u2019s broker, or that the $1,000 was his money.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-5\"><em>Clarkson N.

And the parol evidence to show that Draper was an agent, was evidence to contradict what the writings say, and therefore inadmissible. <em>(Newcomb </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>1 Denio, 229; <em>Fenly </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>5 Sandf., 101.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-8\">III. In any event defendants were entitled to prove the offset they claimed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">Where one deals with another, on behalf of a third person, the person dealt with has a right to set off, when called on by such third person, any claim which he may have against the agent. (Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7.390, 404, 420, 423; Paley\u2019s Agency, by Dunl., pp, 325, 151; 1 Parsons on Contracts, 53.) And this whether the amount to be set off was due when the credit was given the agent, or subsequently. For the principal derives his rights through his agent, and stands in his stead. (Authorities cited; <em>George </em>v. <em>Claggett, </em>7 Term B., 359 ; <em>Rabone </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>Id., 361; <em>Lime Rock Bank </em>v. <em>Plimpton, </em>17 Pick., 159 ; <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>24 Wend., 458.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-10\">IV. Nor does defendants being stock brokers affect this rule, for the course of dealing among stock brokers is not as brokers,- but as principals. <em>(Child </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>8 Term R., 614.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-11\"><em>Jeremiah Larocque, </em>for plaintiff, respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-12\">I.

Plaintiff could sue in' his own name, although the defendants had not previously known him as the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>in the transaction. <em>(Del. and Hud.

If plaintiff could sue in his own name, there was, of course, an end of any right of set-off. (2 R. S., 354, marg. page; Code, \u00a7 150.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">IV. Defendants, neither by their answer nor offer of evidence, sought to, nor could they, assert or maintain any right of lien upon the balance of this special deposit, for the prior indebtedness of Draper to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">1. A stock broker, as such, has no general lien upon anything which has not been specifically pledged to him. (Russell on Factors and Brokers, 193 and 194, and cases cited; 32 Law Library, N. S., 127, 128.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">2. Even in such eases, the right of lien exists only in regard to claims arising out of the same factorship, banking or insurance business. It does not exist in regard to indebtedness not connected with that business. (Cross on Lien, 260,277 ; 18 Law Library, N. S., 172,182; Smith\u2019s Mer. Law, 340; 1 Law Library, N. S., 202; <em>Weldon </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>3 Esp. N. P. R., 268; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul., 485; <em>Lanyon </em>v. <em>Blanchard, 2 </em>Camp. R., 597; 1 Condy\u2019s Marshall, 301.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-8\">V. The evidence as to defendants\u2019 prior knowledge, that the orders given by Draper were not for his own account, having been withdrawn, the- exception falls, taken by the defendants; but if it had not been withdrawn, although unnecessary, it would have been admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-9\">VI. Defendants\u2019 offer of proof that they understood the order to be for Draper\u2019s own account, and had no notice to the contrary, was irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-10\">VII The evidence of usage of brokers in Hew York, was also entirely irrelevant and inadmissible. <em>(Horton </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>19 N. Y. R., 170.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-11\">VIII. The exception to the Referee\u2019s not finding whether the order was or not given by Draper as an order on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>own personal account, without notice or knowledge of any agency, is not well taken. He did. find that it was for plaintiff\u2019s account; and the question of knowledge was immaterial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-5\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnUj\">That Draper was in fact the broker of the plaintiff; was employed by him to make the purchase; and that the plaintiff furnished the $1,000 deposit, is conceded. The defendants claim of set-off rests, in Draper\u2019s having-given the order in his own name, and his furnishing the money as his own, without disclosing his principal. The elementary writers make a distinction between factors and brokers. The latter are described as persons employed to make bargains and contracts between other persons in matters of trade, for a compensation commonly called brokerage; while the former is intrusted with the property which is the subject of his agency. (1 Parsons on Contracts, 78; Story on Agency, ^ 28.) Parsons says, (vol. 2, p. 250,) a broker being one to whom goods are not intrusted, and who usually and properly sells in the name of his principal, and who is understood to be only an agent. Whether he sells in his own name or not, he stands only on the footing of an agent; and hence, he says, if an action be brought by the agent, in his own name, for a debt due to his principal, the defendant may set off a debt due from the principal. And Story says, (\u00a7 28,) if a broker sells the goods of his principal, in his own name, (without any special authority to do so,) inasmuch as he exceeds his authority, the principal will have the sam\u00e9 rights and remedies against the purchaser, as if his name had been disclosed by the broker.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The right to set off a debt against the factor when the principal is not disclosed, arises, first, from the factor\u2019s having the goods in his possession, and, second, from his general lieu. In the case of brokers, with the single exception of insurance brokers, a general lien does not exist. (Russell on Factors, 193.) And it is only in virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of this general lien in favor of factors, that they have the right to dispose of the property as their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The <em>$1,000 </em>deposit was as security that-the contract of purchase would be fulfilled. It was to indemnify the defendants against loss, if Draper should fail to comply . with the terms of the contract. It could be held for that purpose, and for no other. Upon Draper\u2019s failing to complete the purchase, it could be retained to meet any loss occasioned by a depreciation of the stock. In this case it was so used to the extent of $386.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The defense of set-off of a debt against Draper was properly overruled. Feither under the Revised Statutes, as a set-off, nor under the Oode, as a counterclaim, cohid it be allowed. It did not exist in favor of the defendants against the plaintiff. (3 R. S., (5th ed.,) 635, Code, \u00a7 150.)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The transaction constituted Draper the broker of the plaintiff, and it is immaterial whether he made the contract in his own name or in the name of his principal. He had no general lien on the plaintiff\u2019s money which gave him a right to dispose of it to the plaintiff\u2019s prejudice; and so long as the defendants parted with nothing, made no new advance upon the contract or upon the moneys deposited as s\u00e9curity, they acquired no right to absorb the plaintiff\u2019s money in extinguishing a debt due from Draper to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">It was not necessary to prove that Draper was the plaintiff\u2019s broker. The transaction itself sufficiently characterized the nature of his agency, and the existence of the fact \u25a0of agency., whether known to the defendants or not, would deprive the defendants of the right to retain the plaintiff\u2019s money to pay Draper\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Any evidence, therefore, tending to show that the defendants were informed for whose account the order was given, was immaterial, and its admission under objection was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The subsequent withdrawal of this evidence, however, .by the plaintiff, cured the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The defendants have no equity. They lost nothing, and should not gain anything from a third and innocent party.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">I see no reason for' disturbing the judgment. It must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b429-6\">Bosworth, Ch. J.'</author>\n<p id=\"AqVv\">Bussell, on Factors and Brokers, states the law to be, that only one class of brokers possess the right of general lien possessed by factors, (pp. 191, 196.) That class consists of insurance brokers. I find no case which holds that a stock broker possesses this right. The justice and equity of the case are with the plaintiff, and I am unwilling to reverse a judgment which is just in itself, without any authority to justify the reversal, especially when the judgment is supported not only by its intrinsic justice, but by standard writers upon elementary law.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b429-7\">Barbour, J. (dissenting.)</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">It is quite clear, upon the testimony, that the funds furnished to the defendants by Draper, to be used as security, were not the identical $1,000 which had been sent to the latter by the <em>plaintiff; </em>Draper having given his own check to the defendants for a much larger amount, out of which the $1,000 was to be taken and applied by them, and having deposited to his own credit, or otherwise appropriated the funds transmitted to him by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled to recover the specific funds deposited, as in an action of replevin, or for the delivery to him of personal property of which he is the owner, and which is unlawfully detained from him. If he has any standing in Oourt to recover the money deposited by Draper, it must be by virtue of his right to claim the substituted fund. It may be added here, that the finding of the Beferee to the effect that the $1,000 placed in the .hands of the defendants by Draper was the same money which was received by him from the plaintiff is erroneous, the evidence, which is entirely uncontradicted, showing that it was not the same. He has also erred in finding, as a fact, that the' deposit was made with the defendants when the order was given, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>instead of at the time the statement of the purchase was rendered by them. As these questions of fact, particularly the former, may be. of importance if the case should be taken to the Court of dernier resort, I think that, under the defendants\u2019 exceptions, the General Term should reverse the judgment and direct a new trial for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Upon the trial the defendants offered evidence to prove, first, that in receiving the order, the defendants understood the order to be for Draper\u2019s account, and his only, and that they had no notice or information to the contrary until after this action was commenced; second, that by the uniform and established usage and custom of brokers and dealers in stock in the City of Hew York, the purchaser and seller are uniformly regarded and treated, each by the other, as principal, and as making any sale and purchase on his own account, unless at the time of giving the order he declares the same to be for the account of some other person named by <em>him; </em>and, third, that at the time the order was given, Draper was indebted to the defendants in a sum exceeding $9,000, which, at the time of the trial, was still due and unpaid. The testimony in each case was objected to by the counsel for the plaintiff, and excluded by the Referee, whereupon the defendants duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The exclusion of the evidence thus offered was erroneous in each instance. The proof of the non-disclosure of' the name of the plaintiff, and of the custom of 'brokers, was not offered for the purpose of invalidating the order, or changing the effect of the terms employed, but to support it by removing any ambiguity that might have been supposed to exist, involving the intentions of the parties, by reason of the relation which had been proved between the plaintiff and Draper, and was therefore admissible. It was upon this principle that the Court held, in <em>Child </em>v, <em>Morley, </em>(8 Term R., 614,) that the fact as to whether, by the general usage of the Stock Exchange, brokers contracting for the sale of stocks, and not disclosing the names of their principals, were considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>impliedly pledging their own credit for the faithful performance of the contract, may be proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">So, too, as to the evidence of Draper\u2019s indebtedness to the defendants. It is true that an unknown principal may recover for goods sold by his agent, and will be liable, when discovered, for goods purchased by him; but, Avhen the name of the principal is not disclosed, that is so only in eases where he assumes the liabilities and obligations of his agent, and stands in his place. Where a principal permits his\u00ab,agent to deal as apparent principal, and after-wards intervenes, the person dealing with such agent is entitled to be placed in the same situation as if the agent had been the real contracting party, and is entitled to the same defense, whether it be by payment or set-off, as he would have been entitled to against the agent and apparent principal, had there been no such intervention. <em>(Carr v. Hinchliffe, </em>4 B. &amp; C., 547; <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>2 Com. B. R., 821; <em>George </em>v. <em>Clagett, </em>7 Term R., 359; <em>Ratone </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>Id., 360, <em>n.; Tucker </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>4 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ad., 745; <em>Isberg </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>22 L. <em>&amp; </em>Eq. R., <em>551; Hogan </em>v. <em>Shorb, </em>24 Wend., 458; Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 390, 404, 420, 423; Paley on Agency, 151, 325; 1 Parsons on Cont., 53.) And, in this case, Draper so dealt with the defendants as to exclude the idea that he acted as agent for another person. It is not a mere .question of lien; but the defense of the defendants rests upon their right to offset a demand which they had against the person with Avhom they dealt, in liquidation of a balance that otherwise would have been due from them to Mm, according to the conditions of the contract between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">It may properly be said, too, that although the defendants are called brokers, they did not act simply, if at all, as brokers, in the restricted sense in which that term is used in the books; that is, as applied to persons who are merely gobetweens for the parties in interest, within the knowledge of such parties, maMng their bargains for them, selling by samples, &amp;e., and never having the property in their possession, nor meddling with its proceeds. Here the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ants, under Draper\u2019s directions, did all this; and may, therefore, be considered, with reference to this transaction, as factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The admission of parol evidence to show that the plaintiff was the real party in interest, although that fact was not disclosed to the defendants, seem also to have been erroneous,'the only object and effect of it being to contradict the written order, which directs the defendants to purchase the. stocks for the account and risk of Draper, and the bought and sold note, furnished to Draper*at the time the $1,000 was advanced, which declares upon its face that the stock was purchased for his account and risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new \u25a0trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
