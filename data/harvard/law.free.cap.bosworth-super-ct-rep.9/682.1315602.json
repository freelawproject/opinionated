Three dollars and sixty cents of it was allowed for postage. The rest was for a copy of certain proceedings in French Tribunals, referred to in the defendants\u2019 answer. Ko expenses had accrued on the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">This item was probably sufficiently set forth in detail, as required by the 311th section of the Code of. Procedure, and there was no surprise on the plaintiffs in calling it \u201c commission \u201d instead of \u201c records.\u201d There does not appear to be any repeal of the provision of the Bevised Statutes, (2 B. S., [4th ed.,] 841, [653,] \u00a7 7,) which required an affidavit to be presented that copies of documents proposed to be taxed were \u201c <em>actually and necessarily used, or were necessarily obtained for use,\" </em>which was not produced in this case. The 311th section of the Code did not ori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>ginally embrace in its specification of what might be included in necessary disbursements, either witnesses\u2019 fees or the compensation of commissioners. These were added by a subsequent amendment. It is plain, therefore, that the only disbursements to be allowed are those specified. <em>(Case </em>v. <em>Price, </em>17 How. Pr., 348.) Even surveyors\u2019 fees, unless in partition or dower cases, are not allowed. <em>(Haynes </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>15 How. Pr., 216.) Copies of documents or records obtained from public officers in this State, may be charged as officers\u2019 fees, but' there is no provision for copies of foreign documents, that I have been able to find. Under the original Code, only the fees specified by the 20th section of the act \u201c concerning the fees of certain officers,\u201d (2 R. S., 634,) were allowed as disbursements allowed bylaw. <em>(Dewitt </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>3 How. Pr., 282.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The motion must be denied, with seven dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
