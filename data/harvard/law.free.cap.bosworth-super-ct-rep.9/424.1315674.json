The lease provided that the price of admission to the building, for individuals, should at no time exceed fifty cents, and that in case of default in payment of rent, or in any of the covenants, on the part of the lessees, the lessors might re-enter and remove all persons from the premises; and the lessees covenanted and agreed, in said lease, that they would erect such building and charge no more than fifty cents for admission, and that, at the expiration of the term they should quit and surrender the demised premises in as good state and condition as reasonable use and wear thereof would permit, damages by the,elements excepted. \u00ab</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-4\">The building, a costly structure, of a permanent character, was erected by the lessees, and used by them for the purposes mentioned in the lease, for some time. In December, 1854, John H. White was appointed by the Supreme Court, Receiver of the property of the association, including their interest in the Crystal Palace building, and entered into possession. In the fall of 1856 the American Institute was permitted, by the Receiver, to hold a fair in it, for six or eight weeks, and again in 1857. Rent was paid to the city, according to the provisions of the lease, up to the first of May, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\">On the 31st of May, 1858, the Comptroller of the city sent an officer, with some policemen, who in the absence of the Receiver then having the superintendence of the building, took possession thereof, and, on the return of that person, upon the same day, he surrendered the premises to the officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">In June, 1858, the Corporation procured from the defendants a policy of insurance against fire, upon the building, then known as the Crystal Palace, together with the furniture and fixtures therein, lately owned by the Association for the Exhibition of Industry of all Rations, for account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of whom it might concern. The policy covered a risk of $5,000, and contained the usual clauses in regard to hazardous and extra hazardous goods, or occupations, requiring the company\u2019s consent to their exercise or deposit, to be expressed in writing in or upon the policy, in default whereof the policy should be of no effect. In October, 1858, the building, with most of its contents, was destroyed by fire, the loss upon the building largely exceeding the amount of insurance upon it; and proofs of such loss were duly made by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">Upon the trial the plaintiffs waived all claim for loss on the property insured, other than the building itself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-6\">At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, the counsel for the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was denied and the decision excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-7\">The defendants then proved that the plaintiffs let the premises to the trustees of the American Institute, two days after the policy was issued, and that the fire occurred while they were in possession of the building, with their property and fixtures, and the property of their exhibitors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-8\">The defendants then produced testimony\" showing, among other things, that at the time of the loss there were in the building a number of articles deposited, and operations carried on, as a part of the exhibition, which were specified in conditions of the policy as extra hazardous; and evidence was also given tending to show that the exhibition of the Institute was then ah unusually large one, and that the quantity of steam machinery, &amp;e., was greater than in former years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-9\">The plaintiffs subsequently offered in evidence policies of insurance, which the defendants had issued to the Eeceiver of the property of the Association for the Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations, before the plaintiffs took possession; and offered, in connection with these policies, which were in substantially the same terms as the one sued on, to prove that the exhibition, at the time of loss, was substantially of the same character as those which were had during the life of such former policies. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>To all this evidence the defendants objected, but their objection was overruled, and the evidence received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-4\">Exceptions were taken by the defendants to sundry other rulings of the Judge during the progress of the trial, and also to portions of his charge, as well as to his refusal to charge as requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-5\">The Jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed, and from the judgment entered thereon the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-6\"><em>John W.

It is not -competent for attorneys, not counsel to the Corporation, to prosecute this suit. The charter and ordinances of the city devolve on the counsel of the Corporation, \u201call the law business of this Corporation.\u201d (1 Laws of 1857, p. 882, \u00a7 26.) An attorney may always be called on to show his authority, unless there has been an acquiescence in his appearance. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>19 Wend., 101; 99 <em>Plaintiffs </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>4 Duer, 636; <em>King of Spain </em>v. <em>Oliver, </em>2 Wash.

And if he does not show it the name of the party may be struck out. <em>(Maries </em>v. <em>Maries, </em>23 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 221.) Or perpetual stay be awarded. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>19 Wend., 101.) Or the suit be dismissed on defendant\u2019s motion. <em>(Frye </em>v. <em>Calhoun Co., </em>14 Ill., 132.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">Hor can an attorney delegate his authority. <em>Delegatus non potest delegare; Vicarius non habet vicarium. </em>(Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 384; Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, 24; 2 Kent Com., 633; Paley\u2019s Agency, 175; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>5 Eng.

Moreover, plaintiffs being a corporation, can appear only by attorney duly authorized.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-5\">II. The city had no insurable interest. Such interest to the amount of the loss claimed must be averred and proved. (Pars, on Merc. Law, 408, 507; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Albany Ins. Co., </em>3 Denio, 301; <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Chenango Ins. Co., </em>2 Comst., 210.) A mere possibility of ownership is not enough. (Pars. on Merc. Law, 507 ; <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Rockett, </em>8 Paige, 437; <em>Niblo </em>v. <em>American Ins. Co., </em>1 Sandf. S. C. R., 551; <em>Laurent </em>v. <em>Chatham Ins. Co., </em>1 Hall, 44, and see 18 Pick., 419.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-6\">There was no forfeiture of the building to the lessors, on the expiration of the term, by reason of the non-removal of the building during the term. In support of this point the counsel cited and commented on the following authorities, as showing the true doctrine of forfeiture of fixtures by an outgoing tenant. <em>(Penton </em>v. <em>Robart, </em>2 East, 88; <em>Weeton </em>v. <em>Woodcock, </em>7 M. &amp; W., 14; per Ld.

R., 124; <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>19 Conn. R., 154; <em>Ombony </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>19 N. Y. R., 238; Grady on Fixtures, 183; 35 Law Lib., N. S.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">III. The Court erred as to the violation of the conditions, both in the charge and in refusals to charge as requested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>1. This is not an equitable action to reform the contract, but a strictly legal action to enforce a contract set out <em>in hcec verba.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-5\">And the only question is, what are the terms of the contract, and have they been violated ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">2. In order to arrive at the terms of the contract, its language is to determine where there is no ambiguity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">In insurance law, this rule is very rigidly adhered to. (2 Park on Ins., 975; <em>Hobby </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>17 Barb., 111; <em>Sillem </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>26 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 238; <em>Mead </em>v. <em>N. W. Ins. Co., </em>3 Seld., 530; 7 Gray, 257; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>37 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 561; <em>Wall </em>v. <em>E. Riv. Ins. Co., </em>3 Duer, 264; see also 3 Gray, 583; 30 Penn. R., 315; 3 Dutch., 134.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-8\">3. In this policy there was no ambiguity. It is an insurance on the building described, its fixtures, furniture and contents, and not a word as to any use that was to be, or might be made of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-9\">The risk was on the building, &amp;c., as then used, and as then situated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-10\">And the insurance was to protect the property in its then condition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-11\">4. There was also a large increase to the risk, not only beyond the condition of things when the insurance was made, but beyond that of any former use of the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-12\">Any alteration materially increasing the risk voids the policy. (2 Parsons on Mer. L., 504; 1 Dutch., 78; <em>Westfall </em>v. <em>H. R. Ins. Co., </em>2 Kern., 289; <em>Glen </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>20 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 364; <em>S. C., </em>8 Exch., 607.) And it was out of this increase of risk that the loss occurred in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-13\"><em>5. Yet </em>the Judge ruled, that the plain language of the contract might be disregarded, and an increase of the risk be set aside, by evidence of the manner in which the building had been used in times past.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-14\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remedy, if any, was in an action to reform the contract. (1 Story Eq. Jur., \u00a7 152 ; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Dwarris, </em>11 Exch., 493; <em>S. C., </em>33 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 514 ; <em>Wheelton </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>8 Ellis and Bl., 232 ; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>U. Ins. Co., </em>2 Johns. Ch. R., 630.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>But even in such case it must be made out by proof that such was the intention of the parties to allow such increase of the risk, and it would be open for the insurance company to show that they had no such intention, whereas it is now taken for granted, without proof, that they had. (1 Story Eq. J., <em>\u00a7\u00a7 </em>152, 158; <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>2 Johns. Ch. R., 585; <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>U. Ins. Co., </em>Id., 630.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">Now, there is no proof in this case that the insurance company intended to assume the risk of another exhibition in the building. It is a mere inference from a former use of the building.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-6\">And, at all events, if such an inference is to be drawn, it is for the Jury, and not an inference of law, as assumed by the Judge in his charge. <em>(Gillespie </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>2 Johns. Ch. R., 585; <em>Keisselbrack </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>4 Johns. Ch. R., 144.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-7\">IY. The Court erred in admitting the evidence of previous insurances on the premises, and in its charge to the Jury on the evidence thus introduced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-8\">This was in effect admitting parol evidence, to vary the written agreement, and permitting the Jury on such evidence to read the policy in a manner differing from its language and plain import.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-9\">1. It is of paramount importance that parties should be held to perform contracts as they have made them, and in no other manner. <em>(Chaffee </em>v. <em>Cattaraugus Ins. Co., </em>18 N. Y. R., 384; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Same, </em>Id., 390; <em>Plumb </em>v. <em>Same, </em>Id., 394; <em>Lamatt </em>v. <em>Hudson R. Ins. Co., </em>17 N. Y. R., 199; 1 Parke on Ins., 46; Pars, on Mer. L., 494.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-10\">2. The \u201c conditions \u201d relate not merely to the state at the time of the policy, but are a warranty that it shall remain so. <em>(Westfall </em>v. <em>Hudson R. Ins. Co., </em>2 Duer, 490; <em>Sillem </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>26 Eng. L. &amp; Eq., 238; Parsons on Mer. Law, 499, and note; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>N. Eng. Mutual, </em>31 Maine, 219.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-11\">3. The conditions must be strictly performed, whether the risk be increased or not. (2 Park on Ins., 661.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-12\">4. Proof of usage is not admissible to explain or vary the language, unless it be so general a usage of trade as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>necessarily to enter into and form part of the contract. (1 Park on Ins.,46; <em>Blackett </em>v. <em>Royal Ass. Co., </em>2 C. &amp; J., 244; <em>Gabay </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>3 B. &amp; Cr., 793; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>French, </em>4 East, 134; 2 Greenl.

Evidence of a particular use of the building before-the policy is not admissible, and is no excuse for a departure from the language of the contract. <em>(Mead </em>v. <em>N. W. Ins. Co., </em>3 Seld., 534; <em>Macomber </em>v. <em>Howard Ins. Co., </em>7 Gray, 257; <em>Illinois Mutual </em>v. <em>O'Neile, </em>13 Ill.., 89; <em>State Mutual </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>30 Penn., 315; <em>Wall </em>v. <em>E. R. Ins.

The plaintiffs, as owners of the fee of the land, in possession at the time of the insurance and of the fire, had an insurable interest. The building was not a removable fixture, but a part of the realty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-7\">II. The policy described the building as \u201c the iron and \u201c glass building <em>known </em>as the Crystal Palace on Reservoir \u201c Square; it also covered the furniture and fixtures lately \u201c owned by the Association for the Exhibition of the</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-8\">Industry of all Nations;\u201d also, \u201c the property of exhibitors \u201cremaining in the said building.\u201d This description of a building and its contents, was a description of the purpose of its occupation, as much so as if described as a cabinetmaker\u2019s warehouse, or a distillery, or a printing house.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-9\">It was also a conspicuous object in a public square of the city in which all parties resided, and which had been continuously a public place of exhibition long before and up to the date of the policy. It was of course insured as a building to be occupied and used for the purpose indicated by the description, and not as a building to be left vacant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-10\">The restriction of the modes of use in the policy on which the defendants place their defense admits the right of use in every way not within the restriction. <em>(Harper </em>v. <em>Albany M.

The merchandise, machinery, &amp;c., in the building were all within the use described in the policy, of a place of the public Exhibition of the Industry of all Rations; and they were therefore within the description covered by that of the building insured as a'building to be used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-6\">IV. The use and occupation of the building was not \u201c an appropriation, applying or using, for the purpose of carrying on or exercising any trade or vocation specified \u201c in any of the classes of proscribed hazards, nor a storing \u201c or keeping therein of any of the goods or merchandise \u201c proscribed as hazardous.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-7\">1. The exhibition, by way of experiment, of machinery, Sc., or of articles of industry, was not carrying on or exercising any trade, nor the storing or keeping of merchandise. These latter* clauses apply to a substantial business, and not to a mere exhibition. (1 Phil. Ins., 479, pl. 882, 883, and cases there cited; <em>Hynds </em>v. <em>Schenectady Ins.

Exceptions to exempt an insurer are all to be restricted in their construction, the policy being a contract framed by him. <em>(Anderson </em>v. <em>Fitsgerald, </em>4 House of Lords\u2019 Cases, 484; 24 Eng.

There is no evidence that the risk was increased by any means within the control of the insured.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b441-10\">By the Court\u2014Barbour, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeJ7\">The objection of the defendants\u2019 counsel to the appearance of Mann &amp; Rodman as attorneys for the plaintiffs in the action, was not well founded. The General Term of this Court has decided, in a similar case, that, although it is made the duty of the counsel to the Corporation, by statute, to bring and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defend their suits, and to perform all their law business, there is nothing in the statute intended or calculated to prohibit the employment of other attorneys or counsel by the city authorities, as was done, with the consent of the Oorporation Counsel himself, in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Neither the exception of the defendants to the denial of their motion to dismiss the complaint when the plaintiffs rested, nor their exception to that part of the charge of the Judge, in which he instructed the Jury that the plaintiffs, as the owners of the land upon which the building stood, had an insurable interest to the extent of the value of the building, was well taken. The plaintiffs were the owners in fee of the land upon which the building stood. They were, therefore, the owners of the building, which was a permanent structure, and attached to the freehold and formed a part of it, unless there was something in the lease to the association taking the case out of the general rule, that buildings of that description belong to the realty, which, clearly, there is not. No right to remove the building is reserved or granted to the lessees in the lease; but, on the contrary, the \"premises, which were of great value, were demised to the lessees at a merely nominal rent, in consideration of which, they, on their part, undertook and covenanted that they would erect thereon a building of a certain description, and that, at the expiration of the term, they would quit and surrender the demised premises, in as good state and condition as reasonable use and wear thereof would permit, damage by the elements excepted. This language imports an intent to surrender the structure which was, by the terms of the l\u00e9ase, to be erected, as well as the land upon which it was to stand. It seems hardly possible to suppose that the parties designed to provide against an injury by use and wear to a block of ground, then wholly vacant, and which,, under the lease, was only to be used by placing a building upon it; nor that they intended to except mere land, occupied as this was to be, from damage by the elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>There is nothing in the case, as presented to the General Term, showing, or tending to show, that the Justice before whom the cause was tried refused or omitted to charge the Jury, in substance, everything that he was requested to charge them by the counsel for the defendants. The case states that the Judge refused to give the instructions to the Jury, as requested, \u201c <em>except so fa/r as they tvere embraced in the charge which was, in fact, given;\u201d </em>and that he charged the Jury, \u201c <em>among other things,\u201d </em>certain matters as set forth in the case; but there is no statement showing what those other things, charged by him, were. For aught that \u2022\u00abappears, therefore, none of the requests were omitted by the Judge; and it follows that the exception, in this regard, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The evidence of former insurances upon the property, by the defendants, tended to show, in connection with other facts proved, that the defendants were fully aware, at the time the policy was issued to the plaintiffs, of the general purposes for which the Crystal Palace had been, and then was used; and that they designed to assume a risk of the same character as those covered by the prior policies, in almost the same words. It was, therefore, properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">There was but one important fact, to be determined by the Jury, upon which there was any doubt; that is, whether the risk was so increased, after the issuing of the policy, as to render the same inoperative. Upon that subject the Judge charged, substantially, that the plaintiffs had a right, after the policy, to occupy and use the building for the same purposes for which it had theretofore been used within the knowledge of the defendants when the risk was <em>taken\u2022, </em>but that if it was used otherwise than as a mere place of exhibition, or was so occupied or used as to render the hazard greater at the time of the Are than when the insurance was effected, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. The charge, in this regard, was undoubtedly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Upon a careful examination of the entire case and exceptions, we are of opinion that no error, was committed upon the trial which authorizes us to disturb the verdict. The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
