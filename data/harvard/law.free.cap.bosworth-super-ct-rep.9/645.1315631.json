In interrogatories to take the deposition of a witness upon commission, a cross-interrogatory, asking if a log-book was kept, on a certain vessel, and if so, whether it did not contain a statement upon a subject in question, and requiring the witness to produce the log-book, is not sufficient to require the book or a copy of it, to be annexed to the deposition. The witness sho\u00fald be required to annex a copy, if it be desired, to make it an exhibit.</headnotes>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b653-9\">Special Term,</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AG\">October 21, 1862.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AOZ\">Before Robertson, J.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b653-10\">The facts of this case are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b653-11\"><em>A.

In whose \u201c possession or control is it ? Produce the same, if you \u201c have it? Or state why you do not produce it ? Was or \u201c not an engineer\u2019s log-book kept on board said steamship ? \u201cIf it was, where is it now? When did you last see it, \u201c and where? In whose possession or control is such log- \u201c book now ? Does not such engineer\u2019s log-book contain \u201c a statement of the whole quantity of fuel on board at the \u201c time of starting on each voyage, and of the daily con- \u201c sumption of fuel and the quantity remaining, and also \u201cremarks upon the subject of the fuel? If you know \u201c where such engineer\u2019s log-book is, or can procure it, pro- \u201c duce the same ? If not, state why you do not produce it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The next cross-interrogatory asks the witness, in ease he does not produce the log-books, to state whether his answer to certain direct interrogatories are from recollection ; or if not, from what sources he refreshes his memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The witness, in answer to the first of such interrogatories, produced his own log-book, having obtained it from the ship-owners for the purpose. He also said \u201cThere \u201c was also an engineer\u2019s log-book kept on board the said \u201c steamship; such last mentioned log-book is now also pro- \u201c duced to him, having been obtained from the owners for \u201cthe purpose of this inquiry. He further answers the \u201c special inquiries as to the contents of such log-book in the affirmative. To the other cross-interrogatory the witness answered that the log-books have been produced, and he had answered the direct interrogatories referred to therein, from recollection and an examination of such logbooks.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>I do not think I can now properly entertain the motion to suppress the answers to the direct interrogatories objected to; the objection goes not to the irregularity of the execution of the commission, but the admissibility of the witness\u2019 evidence, as resting on independent recollection or the contents of. the books.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The fact of the engineer\u2019s log-book required being in the custody of third persons, would not be an excuse for not annexing it, or a copy, if produced before the Commissioners. In such cases a copy may be substituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>(Comm. Bank of Penn. </em>v. <em>Union Bank of N. Y., </em>19 Barb., 391; <em>S. C., </em>on appeal, 1 Kern., 203; 6 Cow., 444.)</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The Revised Statutes provide, (2 R. S., 394, \u00a7 16, sub. 3; same statute, 5th ed., p. 676:) \u201cIf any exhibits arepro- \u201c duced and proved before them, they shall be annexed to \u201cthe depositions.\u201d The sole question, therefore, is whether the cross-interrogatory in relation to the log-book of the engineer was put in such form as to require it to be made an exhibit; otherwise the witness had a right to look at the book produced and testify, without annexing any copy to his answer. <em>(Steinkeller </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>2 M. &amp; R., 372.) Of course, as the physical book itself is not required to be annexed, there can be no substitute for it, so as simply to prove the appearance of the book. If the contents were required to be produced and proved, it then became an exhibit. The mere production of the book physically, before the Commissioners, would not enable either party to get at its contents, unless the interrogatory pointed at such contents. The owner of the book might possibly object to an examination, and for that reason it might never have been made, or have been waived; but the interrogatory must require such an examination, in order to satisfy the Court that the Commissioners and the witness have not done their duty, and attempted, at least, to get at such contents by inspection at the time of the examination. I apprehend it is not enough to ask a witness, by an interrogatory annexed to the commission, if a book produced is a certain book of account, and if he answers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>in the affirmative, object to the deposition, because it does not have a copy of the contents of such book annexed. Parties are not entitled, on the examination of a witness by commission, any more than in Court, to have the whole of the contents of a book belonging to another person, although identified, inspected. The fact of the existence of an engineer\u2019s log-book was, by such cross-interrogatory, inquired into and proved; also that of its contents; the latter, however, only according to the witness\u2019 recollection of them, because he was not even requested to look at that log-book in testifying. But no one was required to testify as'to the exact contents of such book, or read it, or verify a copy of entries in it. Indeed it would not seem that the character of such entries were of any importance, as their identification by the master would not make them evidence; the more important object seems to have been to lay the foundation for the next interrogatory, and the objection to the witness\u2019 answers to several direct interrogatories, as being derived from such books, and not acts of independent memory. There being no request in such interrogatory to the witness, to look at the contents of the book, or annex a copy of them, it was hardly an exhibit, except in its closed state, as being the book kept by the engineer, in order to refresh the memory of the witness as to its existence. It has always been usual in interrogatories as to written documents, to \u2022 require witnesses to annex copies, where they were intended to be exhibits, and I do not see why this, or something equivalent, is not an essential test. The witness could, in this case, have answered all the interrogatory without producing or seeing the book, and his answer would have been properly taken and regular; I do not see why his testifying, in addition, that such book was present, required it, or a copy, to be annexed, any more than if it had been any other physical object.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">If the contents of the engineer\u2019s log-book, or the book itself, be necessary for the defendants,\u00a1 they are at liberty to take measures for its production; or if they intended <em>to </em>get'at its contents by this interrogatory, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>would probably afford them an opportunity of correcting the accidental slip. I do not think, however, the commissioners decided erroneously in supposing the contents of the engineer\u2019s log-book were not required to be annexed by the interrogatory in question; but the motion must be denied with seven dollars costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
