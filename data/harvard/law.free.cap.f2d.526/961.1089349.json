Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1054-16\">GEE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1054-17\">Joseph Labit was injured while working for Santa Fe Marine, Inc. on an offshore floating drilling vessel. In his Jones Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suit, a jury found that Santa Fe Marine was negligent and that Labit was 50% contributorily negligent, and it assessed the value of his injury at $15,-000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Labit\u2019s timely motion for a new trial was denied, and he now appeals from the judgment of the district court. He assigns as error the following points: (1) the evidence was insufficient to justify the jury\u2019s finding of contributory negligence; (2) the district court erred in failing to grant a new trial because of the grossly inadequate size of the jury\u2019s award; and (3) the district court erred in failing to give his requested jury instruction with regard to the defendant\u2019s non-production of an employee-witness. We have considered the facts and law applicable to the first two issues and find them to be without merit. Such choices as these represent are normally for the jury, and there was evidence firmly supporting the choices made here. The third complaint is likewise meritless, but we think it appropriate to discuss the relevant facts and law as to it in some detail in order to provide guidelines for future trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-18\">At trial, Labit requested a form of the \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This requested instruction was aimed at the defendant\u2019s failure to call Donald R. Northern. Northern worked for Santa Fe Marine as a \u201cdriller,\u201d and he was in' charge of the three-man group in which Labit was working at the time of his injury. Labit took Northern\u2019s deposition prior to trial, and Northern was present in the courthouse for the entire trial be-, cause he was listed as a witness by the plaintiff. Moreover, Labit\u2019s attorney was allowed to comment in closing argument on Santa Fe Marine\u2019s failure to call Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Under these circumstances, it was not error to refuse the requested instruction. In this circuit, any inference from a party\u2019s failure to call a witness equally available to both parties is impermissible. <em>E. g., United States v. Chapman, </em>435 F.2d 1245 (5th Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 912, 91 S.Ct. 1392, 28 L.Ed.2d 654 (1971). While our eases indicate that \u201cequal availability\u201d in the context of this principle refers to something more than physical accessibility,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> they do not require the district court to articulate the reasons for its refusal to permit the inference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Factors showing that Northern was \u201cequally available\u201d in the context of a suit by an injured employee against a mutual employer are Northern\u2019s relatively subordinate status,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the fact that Northern was physically present at trial,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the fact that plaintiff had Northern\u2019s testimony available in deposition form. Furthermore, we note that the requested instruction did not follow the form approved in this circuit, which specifically identifies the potential witnesses to which the inference is appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">The propriety of giving a \u201cmissing witness\u201d instruction is necessarily a matter committed to the discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Burgess v. United States, </em>142 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 440 F.2d 226, 234 (1970) (Fahy, J.). Refusal of the instruction in this case was a permissible exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aju\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1054-13\">. 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1054-14\">.
