Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 </em>Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-12\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Ernesto Araon Estrada was found guilty of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We reject his argument that the conviction was based on an illegal search and seizure and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">Appellant makes no contention that the search and seizure in and of themselves were improper, except insofar as they resulted from an illegal stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle by Border Patrol agents. To justify the stop, the government argued below that the \u201cChekar\u201d device, by which the agents first detected appellant\u2019s vehicle proceeding north on Farm to Market Road (FM) 1017 toward Hebbronville, Texas, constituted a \u201cpermanent checkpoint\u201d where stops are permissible even without reasonable suspicion under <em>Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). This court has now rejected that argument on the basis of the more recent Supreme Court decision in <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>422 U.S. 891, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975). <em>United States v. Del Bosque, </em>523 F.2d 1251 (5 Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">Nevertheless, we believe that there were ample grounds for reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop. First, appellant was travelling at night on a road over which the transportation of illegal aliens often took place. Second, after Border Patrol agents stopped another vehicle just north of the intersection of 'FM 1017 A.2d and FM 285, appellant\u2019s vehicle turned off FM 1017 to the east on FM 285 and came to a stop at a trash barrel some three blocks from the intersection. Finally, appellant\u2019s vehicle suddenly resumed motion when approached by Border Patrol agents at the trash barrel. We find that, considered together, these constituted \u201cspecific articulable facts . . . that reasonably warranted] suspicion\u201d on the part of the agents and that the stop was therefore justified. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brignoni Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 884, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 2582, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">Our decision is not affected by the fact that the Border Patrol agents made it their practice to search every vehicle travelling north on FM 1017, time and manpower permitting, regardless of any grounds for reasonable suspicion or lack thereof. The legality of the officers\u2019 action depends upon the objective facts known to them at the time appellant\u2019s freedom was restricted by the stop, and not upon the officers\u2019 subjective reasons for their actions. <em>See United States v. Saunders, </em>476 F.2d 5, 7 (5 Cir. 1973); <em>Dodd v. Beto, </em>435 F.2d 868 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(5 Cir. 1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 845, 92 S.Ct. 145, 30 L.Ed.2d 81 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"AOF\">Therefore the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
