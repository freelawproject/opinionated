The bankrupt estate was reopened in 1974 upon Mioton\u2019s petition for the purpose of having the bankruptcy judge determine the status of the corporate stock and its disposition. He sought the same determination as to the savings certificate. The bankruptcy judge entered a decree holding that the appellant was not entitled to a disclaimer or exemption of this property and ordered that it be delivered to the trustee. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Under Louisiana law Mioton\u2019s interest in the shares of stock, subject to a perfect usufruct, La.Civil Code art. 535; <em>Succession of Heckert, </em>La.App. 4th Cir. 1964, 160 So.2d 375, and the savings certificate, subject to an imperfect usufruct, La.Civil Code, art. 536; <em>Vivian State Bank v. Thomason-Lewis Lumber Co. </em>(1927), 162 La. 660, 111 So. 51, could not be sold by the trustee in bankruptcy until the usufruct ended, and they were distributed to Mioton and his brother. Until that time Mioton had only a one-half undivided interest in the succession itself and not in the particular items of property in the succession subject to the usufruct. <em>Griffin\u2019s Succession v. Davidson, </em>La.App. 2d Cir. 1960, 125 So.2d 30, 32. Hence, until the usufruct terminated and the stock and savings certificate were distributed the trustee could do no more than wait so that he could claim these items for the benefit of appellant\u2019s creditors. In these circumstances, it may not be maintained successfully that the trustee had abandoned the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
