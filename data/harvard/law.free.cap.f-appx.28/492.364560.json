Six months later, plaintiff sued the defendant in this case for his injuries arising from the same accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We agree with the District Court that the August 13, 1999, release bars this action under Kentucky law. Kentucky Revised Statutes 411.182(4) and <em>Richardson v. Eastland, Inc., </em>660 S.W.2d 7, 9 (Ky.1983), make it clear that when such a release bars actions that may \u201cnow exist\u201d or \u201chereafter accrue\u201d against named parties and \u201cany other person ... charged with responsibility\u201d for the injury, the release is not limited to the named parties. The parties have waived oral argument, and we find no basis for reversing the District Court based on the record presented and the briefs of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
