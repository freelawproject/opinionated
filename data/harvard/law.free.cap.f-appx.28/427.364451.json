Thomas appeals his conviction alleging violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. Mitchell D. Osborne appeals his sentence alleging violations of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and error by the district court in calculating the sentence. Both of the defendants were convicted on federal charges stemming from a scheme to distribute crack cocaine. We conclude that the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">Thomas and Osborne were involved in a plot to distribute crack cocaine in Bedford County, Tennessee. Thomas pled guilty to conspiring to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base (crack), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Osborne went to trial and was found guilty of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-20\">The events leading to these convictions began when Thomas traveled from California to Tennessee with nine ounces of crack cocaine. Shortly after arriving, Thomas contacted Osborne and his girlfriend, Debra Hicks, to inform them that he had drugs to sell. Thereafter, Osborne approached a confidential informant (Cl) alerting him to a supply of crack cocaine in Bedford County. Federal and state law enforcement agents, who compose the 17th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Judicial District Drug Task Force, arranged for the Cl to make a controlled buy. The Cl went to the trailer Osborne and Hicks shared, and Hicks informed the Cl that she would have go to another location to purchase the crack. The Cl volunteered the use of his vehicle while he waited at the trailer. Agents then observed Hicks driving in the Cl\u2019s car to a hotel room rented by Thomas. She returned shortly with crack, and the sale was consummated between Hicks, Osborne, and the Cl. With this information, agents arrested Thomas, Osborne, Hicks, and a fourth codefendant, Eric Gant, on both state and federal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Thomas filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on a three-month delay between the time of indictment and his initial appearance before the magistrate judge. Thomas also requested an evidentiary hearing on the matter. The government failed to file a response to Thomas\u2019s motion, despite the district court\u2019s request that it do so. Ultimately, however, the district court denied Thomas\u2019s motion. Upon Osborne\u2019s indictment, he moved to dismiss alleging that the Cl\u2019s act of loaning Hicks his car constituted improper government conduct. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">At the conclusion of Osborne\u2019s trial, the district court held a hearing to determine an appropriate sentence. Based on testimony elicited at the hearing and the trial, the district court determined that Osborne was \u201caccountable for at least the 9 ounces of cocaine base\u201d that Thomas transported from California.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">We turn initially to the defendants\u2019 arguments regarding their convictions. Upon review, it is clear, as we shall explain, that neither Thomas nor Osborne present claims sufficient to warrant reversal of their convictions, or, in Osborne\u2019s case, vacating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Thomas argues that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was violated by post-indictment delay. Thomas was taken into state custody in May 1999 and was indicted on federal charges on June 22, 1999. He was not brought before a federal magistrate judge until September 13, 1999, at which time the federal arrest warrant was executed. He contends that despite the relatively short duration of the post-indictment delay, the circumstances of this case warranted an examination by the district court, which failed to hold a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">\u201cIn determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated, an appeals court reviews questions of law de novo and questions of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>94 F.3d 204, 208 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees defendants the right to a speedy trial. U.S. Const. amend. VI. The Supreme Court has provided a framework for analyzing speedy trial claims, holding that \u201c[l]ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant\u201d are all relevant factors used to determine whether the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right has been violated. <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). Unless the length of delay is unreasonable, and thus presumptively prejudicial, the Sixth Amendment is not violated. <em>Smith, </em>94 F.3d at 208-09 (citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Although Thomas frames his appeal in terms of the district court\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>to hold an evidentiary hearing, his argument is essentially a Sixth Amendment challenge. It is clear that under the test announced by <em>Barker, </em>Thomas cannot support his claim of a Sixth Amendment violation of his right to a speedy trial. A three-month, post-indictment delay does not trigger a presumption of prejudice. We held in <em>United States v. Howard, </em>218 F.3d 556, 564 (6th Cir.2000), that \u201c[a] delay of five months is not per se excessive under the Sixth Amendment\u201d; and we have never found a three-month, post-indictment delay to raise a Sixth Amendment issue. <em>See, e.g., United States v. White, </em>985 F.2d 271, 275 (6th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Holyfield, </em>802 F.2d 846, 848 (6th Cir.1986). Because Thomas fails to prove that his delay was presumptively prejudicial, the remaining <em>Barker </em>inquiry need not be conducted and his Sixth Amendment claim fails. <em>See Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 651-52, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Osborne argues that the Cl engaged in outrageous conduct attributable to the government when he loaned Hicks his car to purchase crack cocaine. Specifically, he contends that the Cl\u2019s conduct amounted to a denial of his right to due process, and that, as a result, evidence of the sale should be suppressed, and his conviction should be overturned. The United States responds that Osborne\u2019s argument must be interpreted as one sounding in \u201cinducement,\u201d the significance of which we explain, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The \u201coutrageous government conduct\u201d defense presents a question of law to be reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Warwick, </em>167 F.3d 965, 974 (6th Cir.1999). \u201cUnder the outrageous government conduct defense, conviction may be improper even if the evidence establishes a predisposition to commit the crime: this defense looks only at the government\u2019s conduct and determines whether it is sufficiently outrageous so as to violate the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Four factors are taken into consideration when determining whether police conduct impinged constitutional due process protections: \u201c(1) the need for the type of government conduct in relation to the criminal activity; (2) the preexistence of a criminal enterprise; (3) the level of the direction or control of the criminal enterprise by the government; [and] (4) the impact of the government activity to create the commission of the criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>855 F.2d 299, 304-05 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The government argues that when a defendant alleges inducement, he must assert the defense of entrapment, which is confined to situations where the defendant can demonstrate no predisposition to commit the crime. As an initial matter, despite the government\u2019s claims to the contrary. Osborne\u2019s defense does not sound in inducement. Osborne concedes that he makes no assertion that he was induced to make any sale to the Cl, and he admits he first approached the Cl to gauge his interest in purchasing crack cocaine. Osborne is making the parity argument that the government should not be able to participate in activity for which private actors will be criminally culpable. Thus, we examine Osborne\u2019s argument to determine whether the government\u2019s conduct violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">On its face, and according to the factors described in <em>Johnson, </em>Osborne\u2019s argument that the government violated the Due Process Clause when the Cl loaned Hicks his vehicle is patently meritless. First, it is standard law enforcement practice for the police to use a confidential informant, or an undercover agent, to participate in a controlled narcotics buy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Cl\u2019s conduct did nothing more than suggest to Osborne that the government agent was a willing participant in the illegal act, which is an essential element of a controlled buy. Second, the criminal enterprise was ongoing, and the Cl was only one of many buyers of Osborne\u2019s drugs. There was a great deal of evidence indicating that Osborne had long been involved in selling crack from the trailer he shared with Hicks, and the government\u2019s actions did nothing to assist in that enterprise. Third, the government exercised no control over the commission of the crime. Osborne approached the Cl with an offer to procure crack on his behalf, and it was only after Osborne\u2019s confederate, Hicks, indicated she would have to obtain the drugs from another location, that the Cl volunteered his car for Hicks\u2019s use. Fourth, as stated, the criminal activity was ongoing prior' to the Cl\u2019s involvement. The government\u2019s activity had no effect on the commission of Osborne\u2019s crime. Osborne\u2019s due process rights were not offended in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">As a final matter, Osborne contends that the trial court erred when it enhanced his sentence by attributing to him the nine ounces of cocaine base that Thomas transported to Tennessee. Osborne argues that he should be sentenced based on the .5 grams of cocaine on his person when he was arrested. He asserts that because he never worked jointly with his supplier, Thomas, the quantity of drugs possessed by his supplier is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs for which a defendant is responsible is a factual finding which must be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>168 F.3d 916, 921 (6th Cir.1999). The sentencing court may hold a defendant accountable for a specific quantity of drugs only if the defendant is more likely than not responsible for a quantity greater than or equal to that amount. <em>United States v. Owusu, </em>199 F.3d 329, 338 (6th Cir.2000). In determining the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, the court of appeals will defer to a district court\u2019s credibility determinations unless they have no foundation. <em>Id. </em>at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">For drug offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and the Drug Quantity Table determine a defendant\u2019s base offense level. Relevant sentencing conduct includes all reasonably foreseeable acts committed in furtherance of jointly undertaken criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B). A defendant is a member of \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d if he is a part of a \u201ccriminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2). In particular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">With respect to offenses involving contraband (including controlled substances), the defendant is accountable for all quantities of contraband with which he was directly involved and, in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-11\"><em>Id. </em>at (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The district court determined that Osborne, Hicks, and Thomas were all members of a jointly undertaken criminal activity The court concluded that without the assistance of Osborne and Hicks, Thomas would have been unable to sell crack cocaine in Tennessee. As a critical member of Thomas\u2019s scheme, Osborne both furthered the criminal conduct and reasonably foresaw that Thomas would be transporting up to nine ounces of crack to Tennessee. The court\u2019s findings were based on the testimony of the Cl, the co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>defendant Gant, and the law enforcement members of the task force. Gant\u2019s testimony indicated that with the counsel of Osborne and Hicks, Thomas decided he should rent a series of motel rooms from which to sell the drugs. As Gant described it, \u201c[Thomas] had the crack and they had the customers.\u201d The trial court chose to credit Gant\u2019s testimony. We are satisfied that the district court did not clearly err in determining that nine ounces of cocaine base transported by Thomas from California should be attributed to Osborne for sentencing purposes. Therefore, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s calculation of Osborne\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">For the reasons discussed above, we AFFIRM the convictions of Thomas and Osborne and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence of Osborne.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
