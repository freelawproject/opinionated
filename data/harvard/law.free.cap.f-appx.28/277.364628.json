GOODWIN, United States District Judge for the Southern District of West Virginia, sitting by designation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b302-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Harley V. McCartney, complaining of a variety of physical and psychological ailments, filed an application for disability insurance benefits. After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge found that McCartney was not \u201cdisabled\u201d within the meaning of Title II of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-433. McCartney then challenged that finding by filing suit in federal district court. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration Commissioner, and McCartney appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">Pursuant to regulations promulgated to implement the Social Security Act, the ALJ must complete a five-step evaluation in determining whether one is entitled to social security disability benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. Pursuant to that prescribed procedure, the ALJ found that McCartney (1) had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since June 15, 1992; (2) suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome, back pain and flat feet; but (3) did not suffer an impairment or combination of impairments that met or equaled the criteria of any of the relevant listings of impairments; (4) was able to perform his work as a production inspector; and (5) was also able to work as unarmed security guard. Tr. 2123.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the ALJ denied McCartney\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-16\">McCartney challenges the adequacy of the ALJ\u2019s analysis at step three, that is, the ALJ\u2019s determination that McCartney did not meet the requirements of Listing 12.06, which is one of the Listings of Impairments that step three references. McCartney also asserts that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>court afforded the ALJ\u2019s findings undue deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">McCartney complains that the ALJ failed to review medical evidence pertinent to step three of the analysis, and that the ALJ\u2019s \u201cstep four analysis of the evidence cannot be substituted for the detailed analysis of the evidence in comparison to Listing 12.06 that is required by this case.\u201d Br. of Appellant, at 18. McCartney also appears to argue that, had the ALJ carefully examined all the presented evidence, he would have found that McCartney satisfies the step three requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As a threshold matter, the issue before this court is not whether substantial evidence supports McCartney\u2019s claim for benefits, but whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s final decision. <em>Smith v. Chater, </em>99 F.3d 635, 637 (4th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). As to McCartney\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that the ALJ must have analyzed the medical evidence at step three, rather than at step four, we agree with the district court that the ALJ need only review medical evidence once in his decision. In step four, the determination of residual functional capacity, the ALJ did in fact thoroughly examine McCartney\u2019s physical and psychological limitations, including his ailments, their effect on his daily activities, the effectiveness of medications, and other functional restrictions. Tr. 16-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">Not only did the ALJ examine relevant medical evidence at step four, but more importantly, the ALJ also completed the required psychiatric review form, which tracks the requirements of the Listings used at <em>step three. </em>That form outlines the steps the ALJ takes to evaluate whether McCartney\u2019s mental impairment meets those requirements. Tr. 24-26. The ALJ found that McCartney did not meet the requirements at step three, that is, the requirements of Listing 12.06. That listing (\u201canxiety related disorders\u201d) is met when the claimant presents evidence of both parts A and B under that listing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ determined that anxiety-related disorders caused McCartney to have only \u201cslight\u201d restrictions of his activities of daily living and only \u201cslight\u201d difficulties in maintaining social functioning. Tr. 25; <em>see also </em>Tr. 20 (the ALJ\u2019s decision). <em>\u201cSlight </em>\u201d impairment does not amount to a <em>\u201cmarked </em>\u201d difficulty as required by subparts B(1) and B(2) of the Listing. Because McCartney could not satisfy (1) and (2) of Part B, he had to show evidence of (3) and (4). However, the ALJ concluded that there is no medical evidence of \u201cdeficiencies of concentration,\u201d as required by subpart B(3), or \u201crepeated episodes of deterioration,\u201d as per B(4). Tr. 25. Because the record is clear that the ALJ analyzed McCartney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>conditions through the prism of Listing 12.06, we reject McCartney\u2019s claim that the ALJ\u2019s decision was procedurally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Furthermore, as evidenced by the psychiatric review form and by the ALJ\u2019s decision, there was sufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that McCartney did not meet Listing 12.06. McCartney claims that the evidence shows that his PTSD meets part B of Listing 12.06 because he has three of the four listed conditions and part B requires only two. McCartney claims that he has marked difficulty maintaining social functioning (as required under B(2)), experiences frequent deficiencies in concentration (as required under B(3)), and repeated episodes of deterioration in work settings (as required under B(4)). However, the record shows that even after McCartney began to exhibit symptoms of PTSD, McCartney functioned adequately in work settings at a managerial level from 1990 until he volunteered for a layoff in 1992. Thus, at the very least, he does not meet the requirements of B(3) and B(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The ALJ also found, relying on medical evidence, that McCartney\u2019s impairments are not \u201cmarked,\u201d but \u201cslight.\u201d Having reviewed the record and McCartney\u2019s submissions, we conclude that McCartney has not demonstrated that the evidence is insufficient for \u201ca reasonable mind [to] accept [the ALJ\u2019s] conclusion [that McCartney does not satisfy Part B criteria],\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">McCartney makes a catch-all claim that the district court accorded undue deference to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, such as the ALJ\u2019s determination that McCartney lives in rural West Virginia by choice, not because of his mental condition and fears, and that McCartney\u2019s symptoms are not credible because he refused to increase the dosage of his medication. However, the district court properly reviewed the ALJ\u2019s decision, requiring that the ALJ\u2019s findings be supported by \u201cspecific references to the evidence upon which [the ALJ] bases his decision.\u201d J.A. 60 (citing <em>See v. Washington Metro. Transit Auth., </em>36 F.3d 375, 384 (4th Cir.1994)). The district court also evaluated the ALJ\u2019s explanations of his findings, including the weight the ALJ ultimately accorded to the conflicting opinions of Drs. Ongjoco and Agnani. The district court concluded that Dr. Ongjoco\u2019s opinion was \u201cnot only a trespass on an issue [the determination of disability] expressly reserved for the Commissioner but also was less consistent with the other evidence of record.\u201d J.A. 65. In sum, the district court accorded proper level of deference to the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-11\">. \"Tr.\u201d refers to the administrative record transcript.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. 12.06 Anxiety Related Disorders:</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The required level of severity for these disorders is met when the requirements in both A and B are satisfied....</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">[Subpart A requires medically documented findings of persistent anxiety, or persistent irrational fear and the like,]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">B.
