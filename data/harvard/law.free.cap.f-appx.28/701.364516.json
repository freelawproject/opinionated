FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b726-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-15\">Alcan Aluminum Corporation (\u201cAlcan\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s post-judgment interest rulings and the court\u2019s order taxing costs against Alcan. We dismiss the post-judgment interest appeal for lack of? jurisdiction and affirm the district court\u2019s cost-taxing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b726-17\">The first time this case came before us, we rejected Alcan\u2019s arguments that the district court should have awarded Alcan a larger judgment and that the court erred in granting a stay of the judgment against certain underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London (\u201cLloyd\u2019s\u201d) on the ground that Lloyd\u2019s had posted a supersedeas bond.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On remand, Lloyd\u2019s successfully moved the district court for two rulings regarding the accrual of post-judgment interest and for an order taxing the costs of Lloyd\u2019s supersedeas bond against Alcan. Alcan now appeals these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b726-19\">Alcan\u2019s notice of appeal of the district court\u2019s post-judgment interest rulings was due on November 26, 1999, which was the Friday after Thanksgiving day. Alcan filed its appeal on the following Monday, November 29, 1999. Alcan\u2019s filing was timely only if the district court clerk\u2019s office was \u201cinaccessible\u201d on the Friday after Thanksgiving,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or if that day was \u201cdeclared a holiday\u201d in California.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>This court ordered a limited remand to the district court to determine if the clerk\u2019s office was \u201cinaccessible\u201d on the Friday in question. The district court found that it was not. This factual finding is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the district court clerk\u2019s office was not \u201cinaccessible\u201d within the meaning of Rule 26(a)(3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on Friday, November 26, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We reject Alcan\u2019s alternative argument that the Friday after Thanksgiving is \u201cdeclared a holiday\u201d by California Government Code Section 19853. Section 19853 is administrative in nature and merely sets forth employment policy for state employees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast, California Government Code Section 6700 explicitly lists \u201c[t]he holidays in this state[,]\u201d and the list does not include the Friday after Thanksgiving.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Friday after Thanksgiving has not been \u201cdeclared a holiday\u201d in California within the meaning of Rule 26(a)(4).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Thus, Alcan\u2019s notice of appeal was due on Friday, November 26, 1999. Alcan\u2019s Monday, November 29, 1999, filing was, therefore, not timely. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to hear Alcan\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s post-judgment interest rulings because a timely filing of a notice of appeal is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-15\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b727-16\">The district court granted Lloyd\u2019s motion to.tax the costs (premiums) of Lloyd\u2019s supersedeas bond against Alcan. We review the district court\u2019s award of costs for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court was well within its discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-17\">After appealing the stipulated judgment, Alcan moved the district court to order Lloyd\u2019s to satisfy the judgment. Alcan\u2019s appeal automatically stayed the judgment, however, and Alcan had no right to force Lloyd\u2019s to pay.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, but for Alcan\u2019s insistence that Lloyd\u2019s satisfy the judgment when Lloyd\u2019s had no legal obligation to do so, Lloyd\u2019s would never have had to post the bond. The bond then served to protect Alcan\u2019s interests.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the district court was well within its discretion in taxing the costs of the bond against Alcan.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Alcan\u2019s arguments are meritless because they ignore the foregoing facts and invite us to conclude that Lloyd\u2019s had no rights to protect during the pendency of Alcan\u2019s appeal. However, Lloyd\u2019s had a right to a stay during the pendency of Alcan\u2019s appeal. That right was created by Alcan\u2019s decision to appeal, and Alcan\u2019s actions forced Lloyd\u2019s to pay to protect that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Alcan\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s post-judgment interest rulings was not timely, and it is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. The district court appropriately taxed Lloyd\u2019s supersedeas bond premiums as costs against Alcan, and that order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">No. 99-56951 is DISMISSED; no. 00-55163 is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Costs to Appellees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b726-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b726-13\">.
