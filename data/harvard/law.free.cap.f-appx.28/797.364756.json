In a Memorandum Opinion and Order issued November 5, 2001, the district court concluded that Mr. Fleming could not satisfy the conditions for next friend status and, therefore, lacks standing to pursue these matters, and dismissed the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Fleming filed a notice of appeal and, shortly thereafter, the district court issued an order denying a certificate of appealability (COA). Mr. Fleming has now submitted a lengthy document to this court entitled \u201cAppeal from Denial of Next Friend Standing and Motion for Stay of Execution.\u201d Under the circumstances, we will accept this document as a motion for a COA, which is a prerequisite to appeal from any \u201cfinal order in a habeas corpus proceeding ... aris[ing] out of process issued by a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). For the reasons that follow, we deny a COA and dismiss this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">\u201cBefore granting a stay, ... federal courts must make certain that an adequate basis exists for the exercise of federal power.\u201d <em>Demosthenes v. Baal, </em>495 U.S. 731, 737, 110 S.Ct. 2223, 109 L.Ed.2d 762 (1990). \u201cA grant of a stay is an exercise of judicial power, and [the federal courts] are not authorized to exercise such power on behalf of a party who has not first established standing.\u201d <em>Brewer v. Lewis, </em>989 F.2d 1021, 1025 (9th Cir.1993). Thus, the focus of the district court\u2019s analysis, as well as our consideration of COA, properly rests on the jurisdictional issue of next friend standing, and \u201c[t]his threshold inquiry ... in no way depends on the merits of the [underlying habeas issues].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-14\">Next friend standing in the habeas context, including capital eases, has \u201cat least two firmly rooted prerequisites\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>First, a \u201cnext friend\u201d must provide an adequate explanation \u2014 such as inaccessibility, mental incompetence, or other disability \u2014 why the real party in interest cannot appear on his own behalf to prosecute the action. Second, the \u201cnext friend\u201d must be truly dedicated to the best interests of the person on whose behalf he seeks to litigate, and it has been further suggested that a \u201cnext friend\u201d must have some significant relationship with the real party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 163-64, 110 S.Ct. 1717 (citations omitted). Ultimately, to demonstrate standing \u201cthe burden is on the \u2018next friend\u2019 clearly to establish the propriety of his status and thereby justify the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 110 S.Ct. 1717. Of course, our present consideration of the question for stay and COA purposes implicates a broader, preliminary standard: has Mr. Fleming made \u201ca substantial showing\u201d sufficient to demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate\u201d whether this matter was properly dismissed for lack of standing? <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983); <em>Vargas v. Lambert, </em>159 F.3d 1161, 1167 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The district court held that Mr. Fleming\u2019s case for standing faltered on the first <em>Whitmore </em>prong. The district court recounted the pertinent averments from Mr. Fleming\u2019s affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">Mr. Fleming states that he knew who Mr. Clark was in high school, though they attended different schools, and first made acquaintance with him after 1979 through his sister\u2019s husband, who knew Mr. Clark quite well. Additionally, between 1981 and 1982, Mr. Fleming was married to a woman to whom Mr. Clark was a \u201cstep-uncle.\u201d During this period, Mr. Fleming and Mr. Clark went out to bars and socialized together with other friends. After 1982, however, Mr. Fleming lost touch with Mr. Clark. Around Christmas of last year, Mr. Fleming wrote a card to Mr. Clark and they began a correspondence. Mr. Fleming attended a court proceeding involving Mr. Clark this past summer, but was not allowed to speak with him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">District Court Memorandum Opinion and Order at 2. The court then assessed these facts in light of <em>Whitmore </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-10\">[Mr. Fleming\u2019s] association with Mr. Clark is attenuated, at best, and the Court cannot find that theirs is a significant relationship. In fact, Mr. Fleming appears to be nothing more than an intruder and uninvited meddler. Additionally, Mr. Clark has informed the Court through his lawyer that he does not want to be transported for a hearing in this matter. The Court is unable to conclude that Mr. Fleming is truly dedicated to the best interests of Mr. Clark.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-11\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-12\">Mr. Fleming has not cited any authority in which a comparable relationship was deemed sufficient to support a determination of next friend standing. However, this court has not found any authority denying next friend status on this basis either. All of the case law applying <em>Whitmore </em>has thus far turned, rather, on the second prong, regarding the real party\u2019s inability to litigate on his own behalf, which is negated where the real party \u201chas given a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to proceed, and his access to court is otherwise unimpeded.\u201d <em>Whitmore, </em>495 U.S. at 165, 110 S.Ct. 1717. Consequently, while we do not necessarily gainsay the district court\u2019s reliance on the first prong, we look to <em>Whitmore\u2019s </em>second prong for a conclusive, undebatable resolution of the standing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Moreover, as to this waiver question, we may rely on a pertinent state court factual finding, made after a four-day hearing held less than three months ago, that \u201cClark is mentally competent to abandon any and all challenges to his death sentence, including State post-conviction collateral review and Federal habeas corpus as he has the mental capacity to understand the choice between life and death and to make a knowing and intelligent decision not to pursue further remedies.\u201d <em>Clark v. LeMaster, </em>Order in No. D-0911-CR-0200100057 (Roosevelt County District Court 2001). This determination is presumptively correct under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). <em>See Vargas, </em>159 F.3d at 1168; <em>see also Baal, </em>495 U.S. at 735, 110 S.Ct. 2223 (pre-AEDPA ease applying presumption of correctness under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Although he addresses the issue of eompetency/waiver at length, Mr. Fleming has not offered even a remotely persuasive argument to rebut the presumption that conclusively undermines his next friend standing. He asks this court essentially to re-weigh the credibility of the opposing expert witnesses who appeared in the state court proceeding. Far from providing the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d necessary to rebut the statutory presumption, such challenges to witness credibility implicate our \u201cspecial deference to ... matters which the trial court is in the best position to assess.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Gibson, </em>254 F.3d 1155, 1160 (10th Cir.2001). Further, Mr. Fleming has not offered any \u201cmeaningful evidence\u201d to suggest that Mr. Clark \u201cmight have become incompetent some time after the State\u2019s evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Baal, </em>495 U.S. at 736, 110 S.Ct. 2223.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">Instead, Mr. Fleming advances several conclusory legal points, none of which hold up to scrutiny. We shall briefly address those warranting any comment. First, he notes that this is a capital case. However, he fails to cite any authority holding either that the standard for next friend status is broadened, or that the \u00a7 2254(e) presumption is attenuated, in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Second, he argues that the state trial court determination of valid waiver has not been reviewed on appeal (the state supreme court declined to hear any appeal in the matter based on Mr. Clark\u2019s own objection thereto). Again, however, he cites no authority holding that the unqualified reference in \u00a7 2254(e) to any \u201cdetermination of a factual issue made by a State court\u201d is limited to determinations made by trial courts which have been affirmed on appeal. <em>See Duncan v. Morton, </em>256 F.3d 189, 195 (3d Cir.) (recognizing that \u00a7 2254(e) presumption \u201capplies to the factual determinations of both state trial and appellate courts\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 269, 151 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001); <em>see also Sumner v. Mata, </em>449 U.S. 539, 545, 101 S.Ct. 764, 66 L.Ed.2d 722 (1981) (noting that earlier version of presumption, in \u00a7 2254(d), likewise \u201cma[de] no distinction between factual determinations of a state trial court and those of a state appellate court\u201d). Indeed, to apply such a requirement in the present context, where the state appeal was dismissed based on the waiver upheld by the trial court, would mean that the state court\u2019s very effectuation of the waiver found to be valid would undercut its presumptive validity in a subsequent federal proceeding brought by a third party (contrary to the real party\u2019s expressed wishes).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Third, he argues that the waiver has never been \u201cscrutinized\u201d by a federal court. This argument displays a very basic misunderstanding of \u00a7 2254(e): the whole purpose of the presumption would obviously be lost if it were applicable only after a federal court first scrutinized the factual determination to which it applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Finally, he insists that Mr. Clark could raise \u201cdead bang winner\u201d challenges to his conviction and sentence. As already noted, however, the merits of possible underlying habeas claims is irrelevant to the threshold jurisdictional question whether Mr. Fleming has standing to assert such issues on Mr. Clark\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">For the reasons stated above, we deny a certif\u00edcate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. The motion for stay is, accordingly, denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b822-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-11\">. The threshold, jurisdictional nature of this dispositive issue likewise precedes consideration of traditional rules favoring stays of execution in capital habeas cases to effectuate the overriding interests of the condemned petitioner, since, if the putative next friend is found to lack standing, such interests are-by definition and by the petitioner's own choice \u2014 not before the court. <em>See Brewer, </em>989 F.2d at 1024-25 (relying on <em>Baal).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
