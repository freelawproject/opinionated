Gwin, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b520-18\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-19\">Sandra Anderson, a Michigan resident proceeding pro se, appeals a district court order dismissing her civil rights complaint filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, et seq. (Title VII) and Michigan\u2019s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1). Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed <em>See </em>Fed R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-20\">Anderson filed a complaint alleging, among other things, sex discrimination by her former employer, Brink\u2019s Inc. Anderson also alleged \u2014 although it is not clear in what way \u2014 that Brink\u2019s acted improperly during litigation of her prior suit, case number 96-73207, in which the district court entered judgment for Brink\u2019s on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>September 8, 1997. In large part, however, it appears that Anderson is claiming malpractice by her former attorney, who is not a party to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Anderson\u2019s current complaint, as it relates to defendant Brink\u2019s, is an attempt to circumvent the district court\u2019s ruling that dismissed Anderson\u2019s previous case. Specifically, Anderson sought to collaterally attack or relitigate the district court\u2019s September 8, 1997, order granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the court\u2019s August 14, 2000, order denying Anderson\u2019s motion to reopen the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Anderson\u2019s current lawsuit, filed almost three years after her previous complaint was dismissed, includes a new charge of discrimination that she apparently filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on December 10, 1999. Anderson\u2019s new EEOC charge makes various allegations against Brink\u2019s relating to events that allegedly occurred in 1995. The new complaint makes further allegations regarding events between April 14, 1990, and September 5, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">On February 26, 2001, Anderson filed a motion to win judgment. On March 2, 2001, Anderson filed a motion for reversed judgment. On March 7, 2001, Anderson filed a motion for judgment On March 15, 2001, Brink\u2019s filed a motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2001, Anderson filed a motion to amend the complaint, and on April 17, 2001, Anderson filed a motion to appoint counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The district court denied Anderson\u2019s motion to win judgment, the motion for reversed judgment, and the motion for judgment as untimely. The court also denied Anderson\u2019s motion to amend the complaint, and Anderson\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. Finally, the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of res judicata. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Upon review, we conclude that Anderson has abandoned her appeal taken from the district court\u2019s order because her appeal does not contain a challenge to the district court\u2019s rationale for denying her various motions and dismissing the case. <em>See Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 881 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
