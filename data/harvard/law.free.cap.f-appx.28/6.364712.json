Hampton has appealed a decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (BAP) that affirmed a decision of the bankruptcy court declaring Hampton\u2019s debt to her ex-husband nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). In an appeal from a BAP ruling, \u201cwe focus on the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, scrutinize that court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law\u201d, giving \u201cno particular deference\u201d to the conclusions of the BAP tribunal. <em>In re Healthco Intern., Inc., </em>132 F.3d 104, 107 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-22\">We have carefully reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the record before us. The Bankruptcy Code excepts from discharge any debt \u201cfor willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(6). Hampton disputes the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual conclusions that the injury she caused was willful and malicious. But, the bankruptcy court is \u201centitled to make reasonable credibility deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>minations,\u201d <em>In re Strangie, </em>192 F.3d 192, 197 (1st Cir.1999) and the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions were not clearly erroneous. We, therefore, <em>affirm </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment, dated June 14, 2000, essentially for the reasons stated in the court\u2019s Memorandum of Decision of that same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The appellee not having submitted a separately filed motion pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38, his request recited in the final paragraph in his brief for costs and damages for a frivolous appeal is denied. <em>See In re I Don\u2019t Trust, </em>143 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
