Claimant alleg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>es an inability to work beginning June 13, 1994 due to multiple fractures, injuries to his back and spine, arthritis, tendinitis and a mental impairment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security benefits. <em>See Flaten v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1457 (9th Cir.1995). The Commissioner\u2019s decision must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error. <em>Id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The ALJ provided specific and cogent reasons for rejecting claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of symptoms because claimant\u2019s own testimony and objective medical reports undermined his credibility. <em>See id. </em>at 1464.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The ALJ properly discredited part of treating physician Dr. Mysliwiec\u2019s assessment of claimant\u2019s condition because it lacked objective clinical findings, conflicted with the reports of examining physicians, and was based on claimant\u2019s subjective complaints. <em>See Matney v. Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that an ALJ may reject the conclusory opinion of a treating physician if the opinion is unsupported by clinical findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s contention, the ALJ properly considered Dr. Kruger\u2019s psychological report. This report did not reveal a severe mental impairment that had more than a minimal effect on claimant\u2019s ability to work. <em>See Yuckert v. Bowen, </em>841 F.2d 303, 306 (9th Cir.1988). Because the evidence did not show a nonexertional limitation, the ALJ properly relied on the grids. <em>See Razey v. Heckler, </em>785 F.2d 1426, 1430 (9th Cir.1986). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that claimant is capable of performing light duty work without significant limitation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Finally, the Appeals Council\u2019s denial of claimant\u2019s request for remand was proper because the new evidence submitted did not refer to the relevant time period for his disability claim. <em>See Flaten, </em>44 F.3d at 1461 n. 4 (noting that any deterioration in claimant\u2019s condition subsequent to the relevant time is irrelevant).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b747-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
