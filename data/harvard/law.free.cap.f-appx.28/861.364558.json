R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">Tony Lamar Vann appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI), its director, A. Dewade Langley, and its deputy director, Jerry V. Hire. Vann\u2019s complaint charges that the defendants created and maintained false or incorrect information in his criminal history record, resulting in his being denied parole and access to a lower-level security classification and prison programs. The complaint asserts legal claims for \u201cfalse documentation,\u201d slander, irreparable injury to reputation, conspiracy, \u201cimparting or conveying false information,\u201d and \u201cfalse records and reports.\u201d R. doc. 2 at 3. Vann seeks damages, including punitive damages, and expungement or deletion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>false information from his criminal history record.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The magistrate judge assigned to this case filed a report and recommendation in which he reasoned that Vann had failed to allege the deprivation of any constitutional right. The district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed Vann\u2019s complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We review this dismissal <em>de novo, </em>accepting the well-pleaded allegations of Vann\u2019s complaint as true, and viewing them in the light most favorable to him. <em>Stidham v. Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training, </em>265 F.3d 1144, 1149 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Vann\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the district court deprived him of his Seventh Amendment right to jury trial by entering the 12(b)(6) dismissal. The proper entry of a 12(b)(6) dismissal does not violate the Seventh Amendment, however, because where such a dismissal is appropriate, there is no issue for trial. <em>Christensen v. Ward, </em>916 F.2d 1462, 1466 (10th Cir.1990). As will be seen, the 12(b)(6) dismissal was entirely appropriate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">1. Damage claims</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The OSBI is charged by Oklahoma statute with maintaining criminal history records on persons subject to the mandar tory reporting provisions of the State Bureau of Investigation Act. Okla. Stat. title 74 \u00a7 150.9(A). Vann does not allege that OSBI or its officers did anything to harm him other than maintaining and disseminating false information about him, collected pursuant to the Act, to prison officials. A government agency\u2019s publication of false or defamatory information is not, by itself, a constitutional violation; rather, the plaintiff must show that an additional action taken on the basis of the information (sometimes called \u201cstigma plus\u201d) deprived him of a liberty or property interest secured by the Constitution. <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 712, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Vann advances three specific actions that prison officials took as the result of receiving the false information that affected his interests. First, he lost access to a lower level security classification. Second, he was denied access to prison programs. Finally, he was denied parole. We must determine whether any of these affected interests is constitutionally protected for purposes of the \u201cstigma plus\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">State statutes and regulations, including prison regulations, can create liberty interests subject to due process pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>tections. <em>Kirby v. Siegelman, </em>195 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.1999). In <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995), however, the Supreme Court limited the scope of recognized liberty interests applicable to prisoners to those representing an \u201catypical, significant deprivation in which a state might conceivably create a liberty interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293. Following <em>Sandin, </em>this court has held that an inmate has no liberty interest in a particular security classification in prison. <em>Lile v. McKune, </em>224 F.3d 1175, 1183-84 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted, </em>532 U.S. 1018, 121 S.Ct. 1955, 149 L.Ed.2d 752 (2001) (No. 00-1187). Under <em>Sandin, </em>Vann had no constitutionally-protected interest in his security classification for purposes of the \u201cstigma plus\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Vann fails to identify any specific prison program to which he has been denied access. Generally speaking, denial of access to prison programs does not constitute an atypical, significant deprivation sufficient to establish a liberty interest. <em>Stanley v. Litscher, </em>213 F.3d 340, 342 (7th Cir.2000) (treatment program); <em>Murdock v. Washington, </em>193 F.3d 510, 513 (7th Cir.1999) (cooking class), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1134, 120 S.Ct. 2015, 146 L.Ed.2d 963 (2000). For this reason, Vann\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim for denial of a liberty interest in access to prison programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The magistrate judge further concluded that as an Oklahoma state prisoner, Vann did not have a liberty interest in parole. <em>See, e.g., Shirley v. Chestnut, </em>603 F.2d 805, 807 (10th Cir.1979). Vann\u2019s claim about parole suffers from an additional defect. If he were successful in showing that parole was denied because of false information contained in his criminal history report, this would necessarily cast doubt on the parole decision itself. Before bringing a damage claim that casts doubt on the length of a prisoner\u2019s continued incarceration, the prisoner must first pursue a successful action for habeas corpus. <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>see also Butterfield v. Bail, </em>120 F.3d 1023, 1024 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1 (9th Cir.1997) (barring action for damages where inmate, who had not yet pursued his claim through a writ of habeas corpus, sought damages because false information in prison file was used to deny parole).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">We conclude that Vann has failed to allege that the defendants\u2019 allegedly false statements damaged any of his constitutionally-protected interests. His damage claims under \u00a7 1983 therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">2. Claims for injunctive relief</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">By definition, the injunctive relief that Vann seeks here cannot be obtained in a \u00a7 1983 proceeding unless he has first shown a constitutional violation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (stating that a plaintiff who alleges a \u201cdeprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States may seek injunctive relief). Vann has failed to allege a constitutional violation and is therefore not entitled to injunctive relief pursuant to \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Vann\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). This proper dismissal did not deprive him of his Seventh Amendment right to jury trial. The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. We note at the outset that it is unclear whether Vann can bring a cause of action for deprivation of a liberty interest based on actions taken by third parties (prison officials) in response to allegedly defamatory remarks made by defendants (OSBI and its officers). At least one circuit has interpreted <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) to foreclose claims that third parties relied on false or defamatory information to deny plaintiff employment. <em>See Aversa v. United States, </em>99 F.3d 1200, 1216 (1st Cir.1996). A recent case from this circuit also seems to hold that <em>Siegert </em>bars liberty interest claims for denial of employment based on actions taken by third parties. <em>Stidham, </em>265 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-13\"><em>Stidham </em>does not expressly overrule <em>Lancaster v. Independent School District No. 5, </em>149 F.3d 1228, 1235 (10th Cir.1998), however. Our decision in <em>Lancaster </em>implies that a liberty interest claim \" 'for stigma or other disability that foreclosed [an employee\u2019s] freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities\u2019 \u201d survives <em>Siegert. Id. </em>(quoting <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972) (emphasis omitted)). This rule may open the door for other types of \"third party claims\u201d like the one Vann asserts here. We need not resolve whether <em>Stidham </em>or <em>Lancaster </em>correctly states the rule, however, because Vann\u2019s claims fail for the other reasons noted herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b888-13\">. Vann also includes, in his brief on appeal, the following arguments: (1) that counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>the defendants violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f) by failing to address issues that he raised; and (2) that the magistrate judge improperly cited unpublished opinions without attaching them to his report and recommendation. These remaining arguments are frivolous and do not justify reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
