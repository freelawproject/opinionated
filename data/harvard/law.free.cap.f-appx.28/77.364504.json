The district court, after giving Brown notice and an opportunity to be heard, dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>on the ground that Brown may not, under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), pursue such claims unless and until his convictions are invalidated. On appeal Brown contends principally that the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Heck </em>was erroneous because he was acquitted of the charges relating to two of his alleged victims. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the matter should be remanded for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-19\">In order to recover compensatory damages in an action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove not only that his federal rights were violated but also that the violation caused him actual, compensable injury. <em>See, e.g., Memphis Community School District v. Stachura, </em>477 U.S. 299, 307-09, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986). Conviction and imprisonment do not constitute compensable injury unless and until the conviction is invalidated. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2864. Further, in order to establish a claim for malicious prosecution under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the prosecution ended in his favor. <em>See, e.g., Murphy v. Lynn, </em>118 F.3d 938, 947 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1115, 118 S.Ct. 1051, 140 L.Ed.2d 114 (1998); <em>Russell v. Smith, </em>68 F.3d 33, 36 (2d Cir.1995); <em>Janetka v. Dabe, </em>892 F.2d 187, 189 (2d Cir.1989). However, \u201ccourts have held that an acquittal satisfies the favorable termination requirement even when there has been a conviction on a related charge, or one arising from the same incident or event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190 (where defendant was charged with two distinct offenses involving distinct allegations and different victims, acquittal on one charge constituted a favorable termination even where he was convicted of the other charge); <em>cf. Posr v. Doherty, </em>944 F.2d 91, 100 (2d Cir.1991) (in considering a defendant\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, court must \u201cseparately analyze the charges claimed to have been maliciously prosecuted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In this Court, as in the district court, Brown asserts that he was acquitted of the robbery charges with respect to two of his alleged victims. The district court in its opinion did not mention this contention and appears to have assumed that Brown did not have a favorable termination of any of the criminal charges against him. Defendants have not disputed Brown\u2019s assertion in this Court, having declined to file a brief on appeal. <em>(See </em>Letter from Deputy County Attorney Gerald R. Podlesak to Court of Appeals dated February 20, 2001 (\u201c... I believe that is [sic] not in the County of Nassau [sic] best interest to respond to Mr. Brown\u2019s papers.\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We are unable to determine the correctness of Brown\u2019s factual assertion on the present record. If that assertion is correct, and if Brown asserts claims of malicious prosecution with respect to charges of which he was acquitted, it is not clear that the court properly dismissed the complaint in its entirety. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for further development of the record and for consideration of Brown\u2019s claims in light of the above authorities. We express no view as to whether Brown can establish the elements of a malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for development of the record and further consideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
