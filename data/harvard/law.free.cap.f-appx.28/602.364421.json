We agree with the tax court that Schladweiler did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>not carry his burden of proving that the IRS\u2019s deficiency assessments were arbitrary or erroneous with regard to any issue. <em>See Page v. Commissioner, </em>58 F.3d 1342, 1347 (8th Cir.1995) (taxpayer\u2019s burden). The record shows that Schladweiler received credit for every business expense he properly documented, and Schladweiler provided no evidence refuting the calculation of additional unreported gross income for 1993. The tax court also correctly determined that the IRS was entitled to assess accuracy-related penalties, based on Sehladweiler\u2019s negligent failure to keep adequate records. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(b), (c) (negligence includes failure to make reasonable attempt to comply with code); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.6662-3 (negligence includes taxpayer\u2019s failure to keep adequate books or records).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-35\">. The HONORABLE L. PAIGE MARVEL, United States Tax Court Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
