Transport Express, Inc. petitions for review of a Final Order of the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) denying A.D. Transport\u2019s motion for a change of its \u201cconditional\u201d safety rating. The agency issued that rating after it found that A.D. Transport was in violation of \u00a7 395.8(k)(1) of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">A.D. Transport argues that the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 395.8(k)(1) is inconsistent with the clear and unambiguous language of the regulation. A.D. Transport also argues that the FMCSA\u2019s ruling was not merely an interpretation of the regulation, but involved rule making that required notice and a comment period.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We find the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the language of the regulations. Furthermore, the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation does not impermissibly expand the regulations, so that no notice or comment period is necessary. Accordingly, we affirm the FMCSA\u2019s Order in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In late 1999, Congress enacted the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, Pub.L. No. 106-159, 113 Stat. 1748 (1999). The purposes of the Act are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">(1) to improve the administration of the Federal motor carrier safety program and to establish a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in the Department of Transportation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">(2) to reduce the number and severity of large-truck involved crashes through more commercial motor vehicle and operator inspections and motor carrier compliance reviews, stronger enforcement measures against violators, expedited completion of rulemaking proceedings, scientifically sound research, and effective commercial driver\u2019s license testing, recordkeeping and sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-14\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">On establishing the FMCSA as an administration of the Department of Transportation, Congress identified:</p>\n<p id=\"b473-16\">SAFETY AS HIGHEST PRIORITY.\u2014 In carrying out its duties, the [FMCSA] shall consider the assignment and maintenance of safety as the highest priority, recognizing the clear intent, encouragement, and dedication of Congress to the furtherance of the highest degree of safety in motor carrier transportation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101 (codified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 113).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-17\">Among its responsibilities, the FMCSA must maintain, by regulation, a procedure for determining the safety fitness of commercial motor carriers. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.73 (delegating to the Administrator of the FMCSA the function and authority vested in the Secretary of the Department of Transportation by 49 U.S.C., Subtitle IV, part B). Accordingly, the FMCSA has established procedures to determine the safety fitness of motor carriers in 49 C.F.R. Part 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-18\">Pursuant to Part 385, motor carriers are assigned either a \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cconditional,\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d safety rating. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The safety rating is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>based on the degree of compliance with the safety fitness standard for motor carriers. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.5. To meet the safety fitness standard, a motor carrier must demonstrate that it has \u201cadequate safety management controls in place\u201d that ensure compliance with \u201capplicable safety requirements.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The factors considered in determining safety fitness and assigning a safety rating include information from safety reviews, compliance reviews, and any other data. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.7. A compliance review is \u201can on-site examination of motor carrier operations ... to determine whether a motor carrier meets the safety fitness standard.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Following a compliance review, a safety rating is assigned \u201cusing the factors prescribed in \u00a7 385.7 as computed under the Safety Fitness Rating Methodology set forth in appendix B\u201d of Part 385.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.9. Once a \u201cconditional\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d safety rating is assigned, a motor carrier may correct its deficiencies and request a rating change at any time. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.17. Additionally, if the motor carrier believes there has been an error, the carrier may request that the FMCSA conduct an administrative review. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">A March, 1999, compliance review at A.D. Transport resulted in a \u201cconditional\u201d safety rating. The investigator\u2019s report cited shortcomings with regard to A.D. Transport\u2019s method for keeping driver-related records. Section 395.8(k) states, \u201cRetention of driver\u2019s record of duty status. (1) Each motor carrier shall maintain records of duty status and all supporting documents for each driver it employs for a period of six months from the date of receipt.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The report following the March, 1999, review noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Motor Carrier sanitizes toll receipts for company drivers by maintaining them in large boxes. Additionally, company has no means to produce toll receipts for owner operators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">(App. at 18).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The report required that A.D. Transport:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Require all drivers to submit toll receipts so that records of duty status can be verified for accuracy. The motor carrier must establish a system to produce toll receipts for all owner operators within a reasonable amount of time (2 days). Do not sanitize toll receipts by maintaining them in a manner which would preclude log verification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">(App. at 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In response to the report and \u201cconditional\u201d rating, A.D. Transport certified to the FMCSA that it would comply with the Federal Motor Safety Regulations and follow a newly devised Safety Management Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">In January, 2000, The FMCSA conducted a second compliance review at A.D. Transport. At the time of the second review, A.D. Transport had 183 drivers. (App. at 53). The investigator reported that, after completing a tour of the facility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8u\">a list of 25 drivers was provided to Acting Safety Director.... This was a request that the motor carrier produce driver\u2019s record of duty status for a specific month ... along with the corresponding fuel Tax Trip Reports. When the motor carrier produced these doeuments, it was discovered that the toll receipts were not in the Fuel Tax report envelopes. The motor carrier produced the toll receipts for the months of October, November and December of 1999. However, they were maintained in large white envelopes. The contents of those envelopes were examined and it was discovered that they contained hundreds of toll receipts, very few of which could be identified by truck or driver. Because these toll receipts were maintained in a manner, which would preclude standard logbook verifications, the motor carrier was cited for failing to maintain them as a supporting document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">(App. at 58).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">A.D. Transport made other supporting documents available, but these documents did not enable the investigator to easily verify information in the drivers\u2019 logbooks. Additionally, the inspector could not rely on A.D. Transport\u2019s computer because its program had crashed with a loss of all its data. The investigator noted, \u201cIn conclusion this investigator was left with no reliable supporting documentation, which could be used to verify records of duty status for accuracy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-16\">As a result of the January, 2000, compliance review, the investigator cited A.D. Transport for a violation of \u00a7 395.8(k)(1), describing the violation as \u201c[flailing to preserve driver\u2019s record of status supporting documents for six months.\u201d (App. at 54). This violation led to the \u201cconditional\u201d safety rating being challenged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>On February 17, 2000, A.D. Transport filed a Petition for Administrative Review, seeking review of the \u201cconditional\u201d rating. (App. at 81). A.D. Transport sought an upgrade of its safety rating, arguing that the \u201cCompliance Review was not based on the correct interpretation of the regulations .... \u201d (App. at 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">On May 22, 2000, the FMCSA issued a Final Order affirming the \u201cconditional\u201d rating and denying A.D. Transport\u2019s request for an upgrade in safety ratings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its Order, the FMCSA ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">It is reasonable to believe that supporting documents must be maintained by the carrier in a manner that will allow an agency investigator to compare those documents to the RODS [record of driver status]. The supporting documents regulation contains a reasonableness standard. It states that a motor carrier shall maintain records of duty status and all supporting documents for each driver it employs for a period of six months from the date of receipt. The heading to 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k) provides assistance in answering the question because it indicates that the retention of the required documents is for each driver employed by the carrier. Petitioner\u2019s practice of placing all toll receipts into one large envelope per month does not comply with the regulation because the rule requires each RODS to be maintained along with each driver\u2019s supporting document. Here, Petitioner attempts to maintain all supporting toll receipts with every other driver\u2019s similar records. This \u201csalad shooter\u201d approach does not comply with the spirit of the law and frustrates proper enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArE\">(App. at 9). A.D. Transport appeals from this order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2344.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to substantial deference. <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965). We defer to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule or regulation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., </em>325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); <em>Arctic Express, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>194 F.3d 767, 771 (6th Cir.1999). When an agency promulgates regulations it is, however, bound by those regulations. It may not attempt to subvert the rule-making process through interpretations that find no support in the regulation\u2019s language. <em>Ohio Cast Products, Inc. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Comm\u2019n, </em>246 F.3d 791, 794 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Fluor Constructors, Inc. v. OSHRC, </em>861 F.2d 936, 939-40 (6th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">A.D. Transport argues that the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k) is inconsistent with the clear language of the regulations, and, therefore, we should not defer to the FMCSA\u2019s ruling. A.D. Transport contends that the manner by which it kept toll receipts satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>fied the plain meaning of the regulations and interpretive guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A.D. Transport asserts that its practice of keeping all drivers\u2019 toll receipts together in large envelopes is equivalent to maintaining and preserving support documents in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The FMCSA disagreed, finding that the language of the regulations requires the maintenance of an individual driver\u2019s RODS (record of duty status) along with the driver\u2019s supporting documents. Thus, A.D. Transport\u2019s practice of placing all drivers\u2019 toll receipts into a single large envelope for each month and thereby separating the toll receipts from the RODS did not comply with the regulations. The FMCSA noted that \u201cit is reasonable to expect motor carriers to retain all supporting documents along with individual driver\u2019s RODS.\u201d (App. at 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We hold that the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k) is reasonable and consistent with the language of the regulations. As the FMCSA has noted, \u201cCommon sense tells us that toll receipts that cannot be identified as having been secured by any particular driver are utterly useless in showing the validity vel non of any particular driver\u2019s record of duty status.\u201d (Final Br. for Resp\u2019t at 23). Here, A.D. Transport\u2019s practice rendered the toll receipts nearly useless in verifying a driver\u2019s RODS.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">There is no doubt that A.D. Transport has made a plausible semantic argument. Yet, simply because a plausible argument can be made that A.D. Transport \u201cmaintained\u201d the toll receipts does not render the FMCSA\u2019s construction of the regulations unreasonable or inconsistent. <em>See Fluor Constructors, Inc., </em>861 F.2d at 940. The FMCSA\u2019s construction \u201cneed not be the <em>only. </em>reasonable one before we will sustain it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Marshall v. Whirlpool Corp., </em>593 F.2d 715, 721 (6th Cir.1979), aff<em>'d, </em>445 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 883, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980)) (emphasis in original). \u201cEven if inartful drafting of the regulations lends itself to more than one possible construction, we nevertheless \u2018find that a common sense consideration of the regulations with a view toward\u2019 safety compensates for cloudy regulations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Texas Eastern Prods. Pipeline Co. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>827 F.2d 46, 50 (7th Cir.1987)). Accordingly, we defer to the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Additionally, the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation better serves the purposes of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>1999. The FMCSA\u2019s reading of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 396.8(k) facilitates review and verification of a driver\u2019s RODS. Verification, in turn, helps assure that drivers are not on the roads for too long.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">A.D. Transport\u2019s reading of the regulations would hinder the effectiveness of compliance reviews. While the plain meaning of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k) should not be strained to alleviate a safety hazard, we refuse to set aside a reasonable interpretation by the FMCSA which effectuates the Act\u2019s purpose of improving the Federal motor carrier safety program and promoting safer operation of commercial motor vehicles. <em>Fluor Constructors, Inc., </em>861 F.2d at 941 (citing <em>Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, </em>445 U.S. 1, 13, 100 S.Ct. 883, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980) (\u201csafety legislation is to be liberally construed to effectuate the congressional purpose\u201d); <em>Quality Stamping Prods. v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>709 F.2d 1093, 1096 (6th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">A.D. Transport also argues that the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k) \u201cgoes beyond the scope of the regulation,\u201d and, therefore, constitutes legislative rule making requiring notice and a comment period under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b). According to A.D. Transport, the ruling of the FMCSA is void because the FMCSA did not provide the required notice and comment period. <em>See D &amp; W Food Ctrs., Inc. v. Block, </em>786 F.2d 751, 757 (6th Cir.1986) (\u201c[A] rule required to be published which is not published is void, and may not be enforced against a non-complying party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">(b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register, unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">.... Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, this subsection does not apply-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">(A) to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Thus, interpretative rules fall within an exception to the Act and do not require notice and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">An interpretative rule is a rule that clarifies or explains an existing law or regulation. <em>Your Home Visiting Nurse Servs., Inc. v. Sec. of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>132 F.3d 1135, 1139 (6th Cir.1997). A rule is interpretative if it \u201cmerely explains \u2018what the more general terms of the Act and regulations already provide.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Powderly v. Schweiker, </em>704 F.2d 1092, 1098 (9th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Here, the FMCSA\u2019s Final Order did not change any existing law or policy. Furthermore, the FMCSA\u2019s interpretation does not depart from the literal language of the regulation. Rather, the FMCSA merely explained what the more general terms of the Motor Carrier Safety Regulations already provide. In other words, the FMCSA did nothing more than interpret an existing regulation. Accordingly, we hold that the Final Order of the FMCSA was an interpretative rule exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b478-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the Final Order of the FMCSA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-11\">. The Federal Regulations define the safety ratings as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">(1) <em>Satisfactory safety rating </em>means that a motor carrier has in place and functioning adequate safety management controls to meet the safety fitness standard prescribed in \u00a7 385.5. Safety management controls are adequate if they are appropriate for the size and type of operation of the particular motor carrier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-20\">(2) <em>Conditional safety rating </em>means a motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with the safety fitness standard that could result in occurrences listed in \u00a7 385.5(a) through (k).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>(3) <em>Unsatisfactory safety rating </em>means a motor carrier does not have adequate safety management controls in place to ensure compliance with the safety fitness standard which has resulted in occurrences listed in \u00a7 385.5(a) through (k).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">(4) <em>Unrated carrier </em>means that a safety rating has not been assigned to the motor carrier by the FMCSA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b474-9\">. Section 385.5 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">To meet the safety fitness standard, the motor carrier shall demonstrate that it has adequate safety management controls in place, which function effectively to ensure acceptable compliance with applicable safety requirements to reduce the risk associated with:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">(a) Commercial driver\u2019s license standard violations (part 383), (b) Inadequate levels of financial responsibility (part 387), (c) The use of unqualified drivers (part 391), (d) Improper use and driving of motor vehicles (part 392), (e) Unsafe vehicles operating on the highways (part 393), (f) Failure to maintain accident registers and copies of accident reports (part 390), (g) The use of fatigued drivers (part 395), (h) Inadequate inspection, repair, and maintenance of vehicles (part 396), (i) Transportation of hazardous materials, driving and parking rule violations (part 397), (j) Violation of hazardous materials regulations (Parts 170 through 177), and (k) Motor vehicle accidents and hazardous materials incidents.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-15\">. If a \u201cconditional\u201d or \"unsatisfactory\u201d safety rating is issued, such a rating is \"provisional,\" and will not become final until sixty days (forty-five days for carriers transporting hazardous materials) after receipt of written notice of the rating by the carrier. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b474-16\">. The Regulatory Guidance for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations defines \"supporting documents\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-17\">Supporting documents are the records of the motor carrier which are maintained in the ordinary course of business and used by the motor carrier to verify the information recorded on the driver's record of duty status. Examples are: Bills of lading, carrier pros, freight bills, ... toll receipts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-18\">62 Fed.Reg. 16370, 16425 (April 4, 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b475-11\">. The investigator\u2019s report also noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">The motor carrier maintained all toll receipts in large boxes. It is the opinion of this investigator that this was done to preclude log verifications. Closer inspection revealed that some drivers wrote their names and/or truck numbers on their toll receipts.

Nine current drivers could only be selected for review because of the way the motor carrier maintained their toll receipts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-18\">(App. at 22). The investigator, however, recommended that no enforcement action for \"failing to maintain support documents\u201d be taken \u201cbecause the motor carrier had never been previously cited.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\">. On June 13, 2000, A.D. Transport filed a Petition for Change of Safety Rating Based on Corrective Actions with the FMCSA. The petition stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Now, since June 12, 2000, the driver\u2019s packets have been kept in tact [sic].

The FMCSA granted A.D. Transport\u2019s petition, and by letter dated July 3, 2000, A.D. Transport\u2019s conditional rating was upgraded to a satisfactory rating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\">. In support of its argument, A.D. Transport cites language in the regulation requiring motor carrier operations to \"maintain\u201d supporting documents. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.8(k)(1). A.D. Transport also cites language in the regulations discussing the \"fail[ure] to preserve drivers records.\u201d 49 C.F.R. Part 385 Appendix B. Finally, A.D. Transport cites language in the regulatory guidelines defining supporting documents as \"the records of the motor carrier which are maintained in the ordinary course of business.\u201d 62 Fed.Reg. 16370, 16425 (Apr. 4, 1997).

A.D. Transport argues that the toll receipts were not useless and could have been used to verify an individual driver\u2019s RODS. A.D. Transport contends that the investigator could have sorted through the receipts, arranged them in order of date and time, and then compared receipts to the various driver logs. In light of the hundreds of toll receipts collected each month, such a task would be an arduous one at best. Moreover, all this task would reveal is that a particular truck passed through a certain toll at a certain date and time. Assuming the toll receipt failed to identify driver or truck (as most receipts fail to do), the investigator would still be left with the question of whether that truck was driven by the driver whose logbook is under review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
