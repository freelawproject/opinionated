Perry seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order entered on January 10, 2001, dismissing his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001) petition. Appellant had thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s order to file his notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was received in the district court on September 10, 2001, nine months late. However, Appellant has provided documentation that he contends shows he mailed his notice of appeal through a prison mail system on January 22, 2001, within the thirty-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>time period provided by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Because there is a factual dispute as to the timeliness of Perry\u2019s filing of the notice of appeal, we remand the case to the district court to determine the timeliness of Perry\u2019s filing.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-19\"> By this remand, we indicate no view as to the appropriate resolution of the timeliness of Perry's notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
