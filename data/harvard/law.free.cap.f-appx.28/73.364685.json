Connor, Judge) denying Besicorp\u2019s motion for reconsideration and reargument pursuant to Rule 6.3 of the Local Civil Rules of the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The facts underlying this appeal are set forth thoroughly in the district court\u2019s opinion of March 26, 1999. <em>Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group Inc., </em>43 F.Supp.2d 376 (S.D.N.Y.1999) <em>(\u201cBGI I </em>\u201d). By order dated March 18, 1999, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for injunctive relief on the grounds that the defendant Besicorp had filed a materially misleading proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a then-imminent merger. The order instructed the defendants to file any motion for reconsideration and reargument \u201cwithin ten days after the docketing of the forthcoming Opinion.\u201d Order of Mar. 18, 1999, at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The court\u2019s opinion, <em>BGI I, </em>was entered on March 29, 1999. Excluding weekends and holidays, that gave Besicorp until April 12 to move for reconsideration. With the plaintiffs\u2019 consent and the court\u2019s approval, Besicorp secured a one-week extension. On April 19, the final day of that week, Besicorp made a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 6.3 of the Local Civil Rules of the Southern District of New York. On June 23, 1999, the court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">On July 21, 1999, Besicorp appealed <em>both </em>the court\u2019s denial of its motion for reconsideration and reargument <em>and </em>the court\u2019s underlying decision to grant the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The plaintiffs moved to dismiss because Besicorp failed to appeal within the thirty-day period prescribed by Rule 4(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Besicorp argued that the district court \u2014 by approving its request for a one-week extension to file a motion for reconsideration \u2014 had implicitly assured Besicorp that its time to appeal the initial injunctive order and opinion would be tolled, and therefore that its appeal should be deemed timely under the \u201cunique circumstances\u201d doctrine set forth in <em>Thompson v. INS, </em>375 U.S. 384, 84 S.Ct. 397, 11 L.Ed.2d 404 (1964) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">A motions panel of this Circuit rejected that argument and dismissed Besicorp\u2019s appeal except to the extent that it sought review of the district court\u2019s decision to deny Besicorp\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>Lichtenberg v. Besicorp Group Inc., </em>204 F.3d 397 (2d Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cBGI II\u201d). </em>But in declining to dismiss the appeal in its entirety, the motions panel emphasized that Besicorp\u2019s appeal \u201ccalls up for review only the denial of the reconsideration motion, not the merits of the underlying judgment [i.e., <em>BGI </em>I] whose alteration was sought.\u201d <em>BGI II, </em>204 F.3d at 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Besicorp now asks us to revisit the decision of the motions panel in <em>BGI II </em>and thereby reach the merits of <em>BGI I. </em>While we recognize that a ruling on an issue by a motions panel does not as a matter of law \u201cbar reconsideration of that issue by the merits panel,\u201d <em>United States v. Ecker, </em>232 F.3d 348, 349 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Rezzonico v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 144, 149 (2d Cir.1999)), we do not revisit such an issue \u201cabsent \u2018cogent\u2019 or \u2018compelling\u2019 reasons,\u201d <em>Rezzonico, </em>182 F.3d at 149 (citation and internal quotation- marks omitted). We find none here. The only issue before us is the propriety of the district court\u2019s decision to deny Besicorp\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration under an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tion standard. <em>Branum v. Clark, </em>927 F.2d 698, 704 (2d Cir.1991). In order to prevail, the moving party \u201cmust demonstrate that the Court overlooked controlling decisions or factual matters that were put before the Court on the underlying motion.\u201d <em>Fulani v. Brady, </em>149 F.R.D. 501, 503 (S.D.N.Y.1993), aff<em>'d sub nom. Fulani v. Bentsen, </em>35 F.3d 49 (2d Cir.1994). A motion for reconsideration is not an opportunity for the moving party \u201cto argue those issues already considered when a party does not like the way the original motion was resolved.\u201d <em>In re Houbigant, Inc., </em>914 F.Supp. 997, 1001 (S.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Besicorp seeks to reargue the merits of <em>BGI I </em>in the guise of facts that the district court allegedly neglected to consider. But it has failed to demonstrate that the court overlooked any fact of consequence or controlling legal authority at the time the court decided <em>BGI I. </em>Although Besicorp claims that the district court overlooked our decision in <em>Minzer v. Keegan, </em>218 F.3d 144 (2d Cir.2000), that case had not yet been decided when the district court denied the motion for reconsideration on June 23, 1999. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s refusal to reconsider its injunctive order.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
