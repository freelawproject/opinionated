She first contends that the district court erred in declining to reduce her offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b), which provides for a two-point reduction where a defendant was a \u201cminor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d In addition, Basey argues that the district court erred in concluding that she failed to provide the government with sufficient information regarding her criminal activity so as to receive an additional two-point reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6) (the \u201csafety valve\u201d guideline). For the reasons set forth below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Aya\">A. Factual background</p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">The present case arises from two crack cocaine sales arranged by Basey in 1998. These sales occurred after David Jackson, a friend of Basey for several years, requested Basey\u2019s assistance in purchasing crack cocaine. Jackson was then serving as an informant for the Tri-County Metro Narcotics Task Force (TCM), which was investigating drug-related activities in Lansing, Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">The first crack cocaine sale occurred on October 9, 1998. On that date, Jackson informed the TCM that he had the opportunity to purchase two ounces of crack cocaine from Corey Goss at Basey\u2019s apartment. Officers with the TCM gave Jackson $1,800 to purchase the drugs. Jackson then met Basey at her apartment, at which time she informed him that Goss was late and would be arriving shortly. Approximately 45 minutes later, Goss called Basey to request that she meet him at a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>residence to complete <em>the </em>sale. Jacks on remained in the apartment while Basey left to meet Goss. When Basey returned shortly thereafter with two ounces of crack cocaine, she explained that Goss preferred to make the sale through her because Jackson had been \u201cout of the game\u201d for a while. Jackson accepted the crack cocaine, paying $1,500 for the two ounces. Basey kept $750 for herself and gave the remainder of the proceeds to Goss.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Jackson arranged to purchase another two ounces of crack cocaine through Basey on December 4, 1998. Prior to the sale, Jackson again met with officers from the TCM, who provided him with $2,200 to purchase the drugs. He then went to Basey\u2019s apartment to complete the sale. When he arrived at Basey\u2019s apartment, Jackson was told by Basey that they would be purchasing the crack cocaine at a nearby K-Mart store from a supplier named Tony Benson. Jackson and Basey then went to the parking lot of the store, with Benson arriving a short time later. Basey left Jackson\u2019s vehicle and walked over to Benson\u2019s vehicle. She returned with two ounces of crack cocaine. On this occasion, Jackson paid $2,000 for the drugs. Basey again kept one-half of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">B. Procedural background</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">A federal grand jury in the Western District of Michigan indicted Basey on two counts of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). She was charged in Count One with distributing five or more grams of the drug on or about October 9, 1998. Count Two charged Basey with distributing the same amount on or about December 4, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Basey subsequently entered into a plea agreement with the government. The plea agreement called for Basey to plead guilty to Count One of the indictment. In return, the government agreed to dismiss Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">The plea agreement also included certain stipulations regarding Basey\u2019s sentence. First, the government agreed that it would not object if the presentence investigation report (PSR) recommended, pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b), that Basey receive a two-point reduction for playing a minor role in the crack cocaine sale charged in Count One. Second, the government stipulated that Basey would be eligible for an additional two-point reduction under United States Sentencing Guideline 2Dl.l(b)(6) if, before the sentencing hearing, she provided the government with \u201call information and evidence she has concerning the offense charged in Count One\u201d of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Basey entered a plea of guilty to Count One on March 22, 2000. The PSR was issued shortly thereafter. It recommended that Basey not receive a two-point reduction as a minor participant under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) because she had refused to identify her crack cocaine supplier, so that there was \u201cno one to compare [her] culpability with.\u201d Basey objected to the PSR, arguing that she was entitled to a two-point reduction under this section of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">The district court conducted a sentencing hearing on July 5, 2000. At the hearing, Basey offered little argument in support of her contention that her offense level should be reduced under \u00a7 3B1.2(b). She did contend, however, that her refusal to identify her crack cocaine supplier was the only reason preventing her from receiving a reduction under both \u00a7 3B1.2(b) and \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Before addressing Basey\u2019s objection, the district court gave her another opportunity to divulge the identity of her crack cocaine supplier so that she could receive a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>point reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d guideline of \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). She refused to do so. The district court then considered whether Basey was eligible for a two-point reduction as a \u201cminor participant\u201d under \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Finding that Basey had played \u201can indispensable and important role in the commission of the offense,\u201d the district court declined to grant such a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Basey now appeals. She contends that the district court erred in faffing to reduce her sentence pursuant to both \u00a7 3B 1.2(b) and \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">A. Standard of review</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">A district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>928 F.2d 1450, 1458 (6th Cir.1991). This court will not, however, set aside a district court\u2019s findings of fact from a sentencing hearing unless the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Moored, </em>38 F.3d 1419, 1423 (6th Cir.1994). A factual finding is clearly erroneous where, although there is evidence to support that finding, \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">B. The district court did not err in declining to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The first issue on appeal concerns Basey\u2019s eligibility for a two-point reduction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is eligible for a two-point reduction under this section if she \u201cwas a minor participant in any criminal activity.\u201d To receive the reduction, a defendant must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d and \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the criminal activity at issue. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 3 &amp; background; <em>United States v. Latouf, </em>132 F.3d 320, 332 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe Defendant must prove the mitigating factors that justify a reduction [under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) ] by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">In the present case, Basey challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to meet this burden. According to Basey, the district court denied her a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2(b) solely because the offense to which she had pled guilty would not have occurred without her participation. She concedes that, as the sole participant charged in her offense of conviction, she was indispensable to that offense. But she contends that the district court should have looked beyond the particular elements of her offense of conviction in determining whether she qualified for a \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">Specifically, Basey maintains that the district court should have examined all of the circumstances surrounding the offense; namely, the \u201clarger\u201d distribution scheme underlying the sale of crack cocaine to Jackson. She characterizes her role in this scheme as \u201cequivalent to that of a courier.\u201d As a courier, Basey argues that she was far less culpable than the supplier of the crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">Basey correctly identifies the proper scope of \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant\u2019s eligibility for a reduction under that section is not determined \u201csolely on the basis of elements and acts cited in the count of conviction.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual Ch. 3, Part. B, intro, comment. Instead, a district court applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u00a7 3B1.2(b) must also determine whether the defendant was a minor participant in the relevant conduct attributable to that defendant. <em>Id.; United States v. Fouch, </em>No. 96-1542, 1997 WL 130081, at *2 (6th Cir. March 19, 1997) (unpublished table decision) (\u201cThe law is clear that a district court must consider all relevant conduct in weighing a defendant\u2019s role in the offense.\u201d). Such conduct includes \u201call acts ... that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction [or] in preparation for that offense .... \u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3 (defining relevant conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The district court, however, did not misinterpret the proper scope of \u00a7 3B1.2(b) in refusing to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level. Rather than focus on the specific elements of the charge to which Basey had pled guilty, the district court considered all of the circumstances relating to the October 9, 1998 crack cocaine sale to Jackson. The district court recognized that Basey had not supplied the crack cocaine, but it nevertheless found that she had played an \u201cimportant\u201d role in the sale by \u201cmeeting a buyer of drugs at her apartment, contacting the supplier of drugs about the sale, picking up the drugs from the supplier and delivering the drugs to the buyer at her apartment.\u201d Basey\u2019s role in brokering the sale, coupled with her receipt of one-half of the sale\u2019s proceeds, adequately supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that her conduct was \u201cnot less culpable than the average participant in the offense .... \u201d Her equal share of the proceeds, in fact, is more consistent with being a full partner in <em>the </em>offense rather than being a simple courier as Basey contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Although the district court further characterized Basey\u2019s role in the sale as indispensable, this finding was not based solely upon the fact that she was the only participant charged with distributing crack cocaine to Jackson. Instead, the district court noted that the supplier was unwilling to sell crack cocaine directly to Jackson. It therefore determined \u201cthat the distribution would not have occurred but for [Basey\u2019s] role in the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The only shortcoming in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.2(b) was its failure to explicitly analyze Basey\u2019s role in the December 4, 1998 crack cocaine sale. Both parties agree that this sale was relevant conduct attributable to Basey. The December sale, therefore, should have been considered in determining whether Basey was entitled to a \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reduction. But the omission was harmless, because Basey acknowledges that she played the same role in the December 4, 1998 sale as she had in the October 9, 1998 sale. The district court\u2019s finding that she played an important role in the October sale is therefore equally applicable to the December sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Basey finally argues that even if the district court used the correct legal standard in judging the relative severity of her conduct, its conclusion that she was not entitled to a downward adjustment was clear error. She maintains that she only reluctantly participated in the crack cocaine sales to Jackson, who she says used their friendship to pressure her into arranging the sales. Furthermore, Basey contends that the government prosecuted her for participating in these sales solely to force her to reveal the sources of her supply. But Basey fails to explain how either her motivation for arranging the crack cocaine sales or the government\u2019s motivation in prosecuting her for doing so diminishes her role in the sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not err in declining to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>C. The district court did not err in declining to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Basey next argues that her offense level should have been reduced pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). This section provides a two-point reduction for a defendant who has a base offense level of 26 or greater and meets the criteria set forth in United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5C1.2, a provision that in turn incorporates the criteria listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The purpose of these latter two provisions is to \u201callow less culpable defendants who fully assist[ ] the Government to avoid the statutory mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">There is no dispute that Basey had a base offense level greater than 26. Basey now contends that she also met the criteria of \u00a7 3553(f), and that she therefore should have received a two-point reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">But Basey never argued to the district court that she was entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). Her only objection to the PSR concerned its failure to recommend that she receive a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We therefore limit our inquiry to whether the district court committed plain error in fading to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6). <em>United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201cWhere, as here, a criminal defendant has failed to object below, he or she must demonstrate that the error was plain as defined by Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) before we may exercise our discretion to correct the error.\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The first step in a plain error analysis requires the court to determine \u201cwhether an error occurred in the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Vincent, </em>20 F.3d 229, 234 (6th Cir.1994). If no error occurred, the \u201cinquiry is at an end.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the present case, then, we must initially decide whether Basey was entitled to a two-point reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The parties agree that Basey\u2019s eligibility for a reduction under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6) turns on whether she complied with \u00a7 3553(f)(5). This provision requires a defendant, among other things, to disclose to the government any information in her possession that concerns her criminal activity. According to the government, Basey did not comply with this requirement when she refused to name the individuals who supplied the crack cocaine purchased by Jackson. Basey, however, maintains that she did not have to identify the crack cocaine suppliers in order to satisfy \u00a7 3553(f)(5) because the government had already discovered the suppliers\u2019 identities prior to her sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The language of \u00a7 3553(f)(5) does not support Basey\u2019s contention. This provision requires the disclosure of \u201call information and evidence\u201d regarding the criminal activity at issue. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). Nothing in the statutory language indicates that this \u201cblanket disclosure requirement\u201d is limited by the needs of the government in a particular case. <em>United States v. Maduka, </em>104 F.3d 891, 894-95 (6th Cir.1997) (holding that a defendant convicted of distributing heroin failed to satisfy \u00a7 3553(f)(5) when he refused to provide complete information regarding the immediate chain of distribution). Indeed, this court rejected such a limitation in <em>United States v. Adu, </em>82 F.3d 119 (6th Cir.1996). The defendant in <em>Adu </em>claimed that, although he had withheld certain information regarding his criminal activity, he had complied with \u00a7 3553(f)(5) because he had given the government \u201call they asked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124 (internal quotation marks omitted). This court held other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>wise, explaining that \u00a7 3553(f)(5) requires \u201can affirmative act by the defendant truthfully disclosing all the information he possesses that concerns his offense or related offenses.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Accordingly, Basey had to identify her crack cocaine suppliers in order to satisfy \u00a7 3553(f)(5). She declined to do so. We therefore conclude that the district court did not commit any error, much less plain error, in failing to reduce Basey\u2019s offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For all of the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
