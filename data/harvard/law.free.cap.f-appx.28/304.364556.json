Although Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was successive, the district court did not dismiss it on that basis. Because Mitchell did not obtain authorization from this court to file his successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, the district court lacked authority to consider it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
