The court\u2019s conclusion was based on its view that the limitations period was not tolled during that fourteen month period between the state superior court\u2019s denial of Mazza\u2019s new trial motion in December 1996 and Mazza\u2019s application for leave to appeal filed in February 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-20\">Two pertinent decisions have issued since this district court determination. In a <em>prospective </em>ruling, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that a capital defendant must file his application for leave to appeal within 30 days of the superior court\u2019s judgment. <em>Mains v. Commonwealth, </em>433 Mass. 30, 37 n. 10, 739 N.E.2d 1125 (2000). And, in <em>Currie v. Matesanz, </em>\u2014 F.3d \u2014, No. 01-1108, 2002 WL 226925 (1st Cir. Feb.19, 2002), we held that, in the case of a <em>pre-Mains </em>capital defendant in which there was no time limit on the filing of an application for leave to appeal, a properly filed application for state post-conviction review is \u201cpending\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) from the time it is filed in the state superior court until it is disposed of by an SJC single justice. <em>See Currie v. Matesanz, </em>slip op. at 13, \u2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-23\">This appeal is controlled by our decision in <em>Currie. </em>For Mazza, this means that his motion for a new trial was pending for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) from the time that he filed it in the superior court on May 1, 1995 until the SJC single justice denied it on August 4, 1998. Since the time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction review is not counted towards the one year period of limitations, Mazza\u2019s one year period did not begin to run until August 5, 1998. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>filing of his federal habeas period petition on July 27, 1999 was within the one year period and thus was timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We <em>vacate </em>the district court judgment of dismissal of September 28, 2000 and <em>remand </em>to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">We note that the United States Supreme Court has granted certiorari in a case that may have some bearing on the issue presented here. <em>See Saffold v. Newland, </em>250 F.3d 1262 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. granted sub nom Carey v. Saffold, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 393, 151 L.Ed.2d 297 (2001). Our remand, of course, is without prejudice to either party raising and/or the district court considering the relevance, if any, of a forthcoming Supreme Court <em>Saffold </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Appellant\u2019s motions for oral argument and appointment of counsel are <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-19\">. Mazza certified that he mailed his habeas petition on July 27, 1999. It was actually filed in the district court on August 2, 1999. Even were we to take the August 2nd date as the filing date, the habeas petition was timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
