Carter was sentenced, pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), to 360 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Carter appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence. Five co-conspirators testified to Carter\u2019s drugs transactions over the course of the charged conspiracy, and two law enforcement officers gave testimony relating the content of two confessions Carter made to them about his drug transactions as described in the indictment. Because the jury\u2019s determination regarding the witnesses\u2019 testimony is not reviewable, Carter\u2019s appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence is meritless. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Carter also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to continue his sentencing hearing when a transcript of the trial was not prepared prior to the hearing. We find no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983); <em>United States v. Speed, </em>53 F.3d 643, 644 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-11\">To the extent that Carter raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the record does not demonstrate conclusively that counsel failed to provide effective representation. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">We affirm Carter\u2019s conviction and sentence. We deny Carter\u2019s motion to appoint new counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
