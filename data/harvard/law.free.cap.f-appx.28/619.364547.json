Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief stating Catalan-Castarena believes that his sentence of 108 months was unfair because it was not commensurate with his lack of a criminal history, and that he was materially prejudiced by the ethical conflict of his prior counsel, who withdrew (citing a potential conflict of interest) before the change-of-plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">As to the first point, we note that Catalan-Castarena was granted relief under the safety-valve provision from the 10-year statutory mandatory minimum sentence; that there was no motion for downward departure; and that the sentence imposed \u2014 without objection \u2014 was at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range. The sentence is thus unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">As to the second point, we note that Catalan-Castarena did not raise it at the withdrawal-of-counsel, plea, or sentencing hearings; and does not indicate how he was prejudiced by prior counsel\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuantly to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-24\">.
