Robinson was sentenced principally to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $420,000. Nissenbaum was sentenced principally to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine. On appeal, defendants contend principally that venue in the Southern District of New York was improper, that their attorneys should have moved for severance, and that they were denied a fair trial because an expert witness usurped the function of the jury by giving testimony to the effect that defendants must have intended to commit fraud. Defendants also contend that the court made various errors in calculating their sentences under the Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). Finding no basis for reversal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Defendants\u2019 challenges to venue are foreclosed by the recent decision of this Court in <em>United States v. Kim, </em>246 F.3d 186, 191-92 (2d Cir.2001), which held that wire fraud is a \u201ccontinuing offense\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a). Here, defendants caused a fraud victim to make a $10 million wire transfer through a bank in the Southern District of New York. Venue in that district was thus proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\"> We also see no merit in defendants\u2019 contentions that their respective attorneys rendered ineffective assistance by failing to move for separate trials with respect to the various counts of fraud charged in the indictment. In order to succeed on such a claim, a defendant must show both (a) that counsel\u2019s failure to move for a severance constituted professional performance that was below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (b) that if such a motion had been made, the outcome of the proceeding would likely have been different, <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Neither defendant meets this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">As to Robinson, who was tried on several fraud counts charging three fraudulent schemes involving different victims, we see no likely difference in the outcome of the proceeding. A severance motion would likely have been denied \u2014 and properly so \u2014 given that acts unified by \u201csome substantial identity of facts or participants, or aris[ing] out of a common plan or scheme\u201d may be tried together, <em>United States v. Attanasio, </em>870 F.2d 809, 815 (2d Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>ther, even had the counts been tried separately, most of the evidence on all of the frauds would likely have been admitted against Robinson as probative of a pattern of fraud and deception. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Klein, </em>340 F.2d 547, 549 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 850, 86 S.Ct. 97, 15 L.Ed.2d 89 (1965). As to Nissenbaum, who was charged in only one of the substantive fraud counts, we see no reason to infer that his attorney\u2019s decision to eschew a motion for severance was not simply a matter of reasonable trial strategy. The fact that the government attributed two of the three fraudulent schemes solely to Robinson could easily have been viewed as bolstering the claim of Nissenbaum that he too had been duped by Robinson and was not a coconspirator or a participant in any fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The most serious contention advanced by defendants is that they were denied a fair trial when the government\u2019s expert witness, called at trial to explain complicated financial terms, gave his opinion as to what the financial notes and instruments involved in the scheme \u201creally meant,\u201d stated that certain terms were \u201cbogus\u201d and had \u201cno legitimate meaning,\u201d and testified that various words and time periods used in the papers defendants had given potential investors were \u201coften used by wrongdoers who are trying to scam money.\u201d While we have no doubt that the admission of expert testimony to explain to the jury the complexities of financial instruments was well within the discretion of the trial court and was not \u201cmanifestly erroneous,\u201d see, <em>e.g., Salem v. United States Lines Co., </em>370 U.S. 31, 35, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962) (trial court has broad discretion to admit expert testimony where it believes it would be helpful to the jury); Fed.R.Evid. 702, the testimony quoted was not necessary for responsive answers to the questions posed, and it was close to, if not beyond, the bounds of propriety. Any error, however, was undoubtedly harmless. Defendants themselves state that the jurors needed no expert testimony and were able to determine as a matter of simple common sense whether the schemes at issue were fraudulent. Further, the trial court properly instructed the jury that the expert\u2019s testimony was being offered \u201csolely to help\u201d the jury to \u201cunderstand some terminology that you might find used in some documents that are being offered by one or more of the parties\u201d; that it was \u201cup to you and you alone ... to decide whether or not the testimony coming from this witness is of any assistance to you whatsoever\u201d; and that \u201cit is absolutely up to you and you alone, based on all the evidence or lack of evidence, to decide whether one of the defendants here on trial had any criminal intent, knowledge, purpose or understanding, even if you find that they were connected in some way to a particular document. And that\u2019s a hotly contested issue in this case and certainly not something that this expert can resolve in any way.\u201d We conclude that the expert\u2019s testimony, even if it crossed the line of propriety, provides no basis for reversal. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed R.Crim. P. 52(a) (an error or irregularity that does not affect a party\u2019s substantial rights does not constitute ground for reversal).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">Defendants make a variety of challenges to their sentences, none of which has merit. Their contentions that their Guidelines offense levels should not have been increased pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.3 for abuse of a position of trust, principally because they in fact were not asset managers as they represented themselves to be, are foreclosed by this Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>United States v. Hussey, </em>254 F.3d 428, 432 (2d Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Hirsch </em>239 F.3d 221, 227-28 (2d Cir.2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The matter of whether the defendant occupies a position of trust within the meaning of this guideline is assessed from the perspective of the defendant\u2019s victims and does not depend on the defendant\u2019s actual status. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hussey, </em>254 F.3d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Robinson contends that the district court improperly increased his offense level pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice without making a finding, and without sufficient evidence, that he had absented himself from a trial session with the intent to obstruct justice. We disagree. Although an enhancement under that section is appropriate only where the court finds that the defendant <em>\u201cwillfully </em>obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice,\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1 (emphasis added), <em>see, e.g., United States v. Woodard, </em>239 F.3d 159, 162 (2d Cir.2001), \u201c[c]ertain conduct ... such as intentionally failing to appear as required at judicial proceedings, is so inherently obstructive of the administration of justice that it is sufficient that the defendant willfully engaged in the underlying conduct regardless of his specific purpose,\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>49 F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir.1995); <em>see, e.g., United States v. Cassiliano, </em>137 F.3d 742, 747 (2d Cir.1998); Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1 Application Note 4(e) (\u201c[t]ypes of conduct to which this adjustment applies [include] ... willfully failing to appear,' as ordered, for a judicial proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Here, the court found that Robinson had left New York in violation of his bail conditions; that Robinson had failed to appear for the January 31, 2000 trial session, forcing an adjournment; \u201cthat Robinson\u2019s absence from the court on January 31 was willful\u201d; that Robinson had failed to disclose his whereabouts, \u201cin an evasive attempt to explain [his] absence\u201d; and that Robinson had misrepresented the reason for his failure to return. These findings were plainly supported by the record. Although Robinson telephoned the court at 6:30 a.m. January 31 and left a message that he was \u201ciced in\u201d and would not be able to return for trial, he did not disclose the city from which he was calling. It was subsequently revealed that Robinson had gone to Washington, D.C., and there is no question that his bail conditions did not permit him to travel to Washington. Further, Robinson\u2019s statement that he had been \u201ciced in\u201d was contradicted by evidence that, on the day in question, there had been no flight delays or train delays and that shuttle airplanes had been running from Washington to New York beginning at 6 a.m. The court\u2019s findings, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]here was no reason\u201d Robinson could not have appeared for trial on January 31, that \u201cRobinson\u2019s absence from the Court was willful,\u201d and that \u201cthe record also supports a finding that Robinson specifically intended to obstruct justice,\u201d plainly warranted the enhancement for obstruction under \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Nissenbaum contends that the district court impermissibly departed from the Guidelines in finding that he should be placed in criminal history category III because, despite his lack of any prior convictions, there was a substantial likelihood of his recidivism. He contends that \u201cthe court\u2019s conclusion that he is a likely recidivist is based on visceral, subjective reaction and speculation, rather than findings of fact.\u201d (Nissenbaum brief on appeal at 44.) We disagree. The Guidelines permit the sentencing court to depart from the otherwise applicable criminal history category \u201c[i]f reliable information\u201d as to conduct that is unrelated but similar to the conduct leading to the conviction \u201cindicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect ... the likelihood that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.3; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Hernandez, </em>941 F.2d 133, 139 (2d Cir.1991). Here, a number of witnesses at a <em>Fatico </em>hearing testified that Nissenbaum had befriended them, had explained his (spurious) business transactions to them, had borrowed large sums of money from them, promising fantastic returns, and had then used their money for his personal expenses. After hearing the witnesses\u2019 testimony and considering the number of similar acts and the amounts of money involved, the court found that Nissenbaum had demonstrated a \u201cwell-practiced routine\u201d in his frauds; that he made \u201cintentional false representations that he was about to receive enormous sums of money from mysterious international banking transactions, from which he would repay\u201d his friends\u2019 loans; that he \u201cthought nothing of preying upon emotionally vulnerable and needy people,\u201d including those who \u201ctrusted him as a friend\u201d; and that the \u201cstring of frauds is enormously probative of Nissenbaum\u2019s likelihood of recidivism. The fact that the frauds continued even after Nissenbaum was arrested, even after he was indicted, and even after he was convicted is particularly telling \u2014 it gives the court little reason to believe that he can be deterred from future crimes.\u201d These findings are supported by the record, and we see no abuse of discretion, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), in the court\u2019s application of \u00a7 4A1.3 to Nissenbaum, nor any unreasonableness in the extent of the departure, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Stevens, </em>192 F.3d 263, 267 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Finally, defendants\u2019 contention that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 </em>U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the amount of loss to be taken into account in calculating their sentences should have been alleged in the indictment and decided beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury, is foreclosed by this Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>240 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 121 S.Ct. 2615, 150 L.Ed.2d 769 (2001), and <em>United States v. White, </em>240 F.3d 127, 135 (2d Cir.2001). Where, as here, the sentences imposed are below the statutory maxima for the offenses of conviction, <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See, e.g., id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">We have considered all of defendants\u2019 contentions on these appeals and have found in them no basis for reversal. The judgments of the district court are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
