Hodges, <em>pro se, in forma pauperis, </em>and incarcerated, appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">In the district court, Hodges alleged that he was deprived of his constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection by state court judges Guy James Mangano, Myriam J. Altman, William D. Friedman, Leo F. McGinty, and Fred T. Santucci (\u201cthe judicial defendants\u201d), acting in their official capacities, and by Hodges\u2019 lawyer, Steven A. Feldman, acting in his official and individual capacities. The case arose out of the judicial defendants\u2019 dismissal of Hodges\u2019 state court motion for vacatur of his burglary conviction (pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10(1)(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">It was Hodges\u2019 contention before the district court that the judicial defendants intentionally failed to conform with certain statutory requirements. Additionally, Hodges claimed that Feldman had provided ineffective assistance of counsel and was therefore liable under \u00a7 1983. Hodges asked the district court for (i) a permanent injunction enjoining the judicial defendants from further violating his rights, (ii) damages from Feldman, and (iii) court costs accrued in pursuit of the \u00a7 1983 claim. The district court denied relief, concluding: (1) that the judicial defendants were absolutely immune from suit for judicial acts performed in their official capacities; and (2) that Feldman was not a state actor and was therefore not amenable to suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">On appeal, Hodges challenges only the first ruling, arguing (1) that judicial immunity is not an absolute bar to injunctive relief; and (2) that we should enter a default judgment in his favor and impose sanctions against the judicial defendants because they failed to submit a formal appellate brief. We affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal and decline to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">1. We review a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint <em>de novo, Giano v. Goord, 250 </em>F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001), and we read a plaintiffs <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Section 1983 suits for damages are absolutely barred against judicial actors for actions performed in their official capacities. <em>Mireles v. Waco, </em>502 U.S. 9, 11, 112 S.Ct. 286, 116 L.Ed.2d 9 (1991). Moreover, under the 1996 Federal Courts Improvement Act, injunctive relief cannot be granted against a judicial actor <em>\u201cunless </em>a declaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was unavailable\u201d or <em>unless </em>the judge\u2019s conduct was \u201cclearly in excess\u201d of the judge\u2019s jurisdiction. Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, 104-317, \u00a7 309, at (emphasis added). Hodges neither alleges that a declaratory order was violated nor that declaratory relief was unavailable; and it is obvious that the judges\u2019 dismissal of Hodges\u2019 \u00a7 440.10(1)(h) motion was within their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">2. We will not enter sanctions or a default judgment against judicial defendants. We find that they complied with our scheduling order by having a letter filed by the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office, which explained that the office lacked authority to appear on behalf of the defendants because service of the complaint was not effected prior to the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
