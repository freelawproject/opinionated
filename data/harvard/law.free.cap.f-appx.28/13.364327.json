The superseding indictment filed on February 8, 2000, charged twenty-six counts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">\u2022 Count One charged Nachamie, Tunick, Martinez, and Hernandez (together with four other defendants, whose cases were severed for trial, referenced herein as the \u201cdoctor defendants\u201d) with conspiring, from 1995 through June 1998, to commit health care fraud, mail fraud, make false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, submit false claims for physicians\u2019 services to a health care benefit program, and solicit and receive payments in return for Medicare referrals, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-16\">\u2022 Count Two charged appellants and the doctor defendants with committing health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1347 and 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-17\">\u2022 Counts Three through Six charged appellants and doctor defendants with making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1035 and 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-18\">\u2022 Counts Seven through Twenty Six charged twenty instances of false claim submissions for physicians\u2019 services to a health care benefit program, in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(a)(5) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-19\">Following a jury trial: Nachamie was convicted on all counts; Tunick and Martinez, on Counts One through Three and Six through Twenty-Three; and Hernandez, on Count One. On November 22, 2000, Nachamie was sentenced to 88 months in prison; on December 1, 2000, Martinez was sentenced to 44 months in prison; on December 14, 2000, Hernandez was sentenced to 18 months in prison; and on December 21, 2000, Tunick was sentenced to one year and a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-20\">On appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-21\">\u2022 Martinez and Hernandez challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\u2022 Nachamie and Martinez argue that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">\u2022 Nachamie argues that the district court erroneously denied his request for a severance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u2022 Martinez and Nachamie argue that they were deprived of a fair trial by remarks made by the prosecutor in summation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u2022 Martinez and Tunick complain that the district court improperly charged the jmy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u2022 Nachamie argues that the district court miscalculated his offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">\u2022 Hernandez argues that the loss amount used to calculate his sentence was clearly erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u2022 Martinez contests the district court\u2019s failure to depart downward based on her family circumstances and the aberrant nature of her criminal conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence shoulders a heavy burden. <em>See United States v. Dhinsa, </em>243 F.3d 635, 648 (2d Cir.2001). The appellate court must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Mulder, </em>273 F.3d 91, 109 (2d Cir.2001), and \u201cthe court may enter a judgment of acquittal only if the evidence that the defendant committed the crime is \u2018nonexistent or so meager that no reasonable jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Guadagna, </em>183 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-13\">Martinez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to show her knowing and intentional involvement in the submission of false claims for physician\u2019s services to a health care benefit program in the period pre-September 1997 (as charged in Counts Six through Eighteen), on the ground that she had no managerial role of any sort at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-15\">The following evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the government, was sufficient to support a jury verdict that Martinez knew as early as April 1997 that unlicenced and unsupervised foreign medical graduates (\u201cFMGs\u201d) visited patients\u2019 homes and conducted medically unnecessary tests for which legitimate Medicare reimbursement was not available but was sought anyway through a fraudulent billing operation: (1) beginning in March 1997, Martinez supervised telemarketers who recruited senior citizens on Medicare by using a script that misrepresented, <em>inter alicL, </em>that Nachamie\u2019s program was a \u201cspecial health program\u201d sponsored by \u201cthe federal government\u201d and \u201cfunded by medicare\u201d; (2) at the same time, Martinez advised the telemarketers how to \u201cOvercomef ] the Most Common Objections\u201d from the recruits such as \u201cI already have a doctor\u201d and \u201cI feel fine,\u201d despite the fact that Medicare covers medically necessary treatment only, not routine screening tests; (3) four of Nachamie\u2019s employees who worked with Martinez at the Queens office with Martinez witnessed physicians arrive at the office and sign patients\u2019 charts and encounter forms (these forms, signed by doctor and patient, indicate that a visit was conducted and those procedures that were performed), without first observing patients or consulting with the FMGs who performed the tests on the patients; (4) in May 1997, Martinez supervised FMGs, instructing them (a) to conduct numerous procedures upon first visiting a patient regardless of the necessity for such tests and contrary to the encounter form indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>eating that tests should be conducted only if \u201cdeemed necessary by the examining physician\u201d; (b) to conduct \u201cstress tests\u201d but the procedure she told them to use was not an actual stress test; and (c) to \u201cbe supervised by licensed physicians\u201d without providing FMGs with a way to contact physicians (indeed, there was no such contact); (5) in August 1997, only four months after her employment with Nachamie commenced, Martinez fired Renee Caesar and upon learning from the operation\u2019s \u201cconsultant,\u201d Andrew Messana, that Caesar had contacted the FBI, Martinez closed the Queens office and dismissed the FMGs working out of that office; (6) Martinez had many years of employment experience in the medical field, and knew that billing for procedures not medically necessary was illegal; (7) Martinez conceded that some of the tests billed for were not conducted as represented; (8) Martinez\u2019s testimony that she was never involved in billing or the preparation of certain medical forms at Nachamie\u2019s organization is contradicted by her later testimony that she filled out one such form.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Hernandez was convicted on Count One only, and solely with respect to the object of the conspiracy involving the laboratory kickback scheme: i.e., Nachamie\u2019s operation sent urine samples to a Key Biscayne Laboratory (\u201cKey Biscayne\u201d) in Florida to test for the presence of drugs in exchange for an $80 referral fee per urine test from the laboratory\u2019s owner, Edgar Damos Estaco (\u201cEstaco\u201d). Hernandez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the ground that \u201cthere was no evidence that he solicited an illegal kickback.\u201d We conclude that the following evidence, viewed in the appropriate light and drawing all appropriate inferences, is sufficient to support the verdict that Hernandez was involved: (1) after cooperating witness Estaco told Hernandez in the latter part of 1997 that Estaco would pay $80 per urine sample referred to Key Biscayne for testing, Hernandez introduced Nachamie and other individuals to Estaco to begin such referrals; (2) after several meetings attended by Hernandez, Nachamie and others (captured on audio tape), Estaco agreed to pay Nachamie and Hernandez $80 per urine test referral; (3) Estaco testified that Hernandez introduced Estaco to Nachamie with the purpose of facilitating the kickback scheme; (4) at a meeting concerning the kickback scheme attended by Hernandez, Nachamie, Tunick and Estaco, they accused each other of wearing a recording device, and to prove otherwise, Nachamie, Hernandez and Estaco partially undressed; (5) the government introduced into evidence the checks paid from Key Biscayne to Nachamie, Martinez and Hernandez; and (6) two of Nachamie\u2019s employees testified that Estaco entered into a kickback arrangement involving Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Nachamie and Martinez challenge various evidentiary rulings made by the district court, which we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Tropeano, </em>252 F.3d 653, 657 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Messana (a witness for the government) attributed to Nachamie a racially charged comment. Nachamie\u2019s counsel suggested to Messana that the prosecutor had prepared Messana to give that testimony in order to pander to the racial mix of the jury, a suggestion that Messana denied. After Messana stepped down, the government recalled to the stand Agent Brady, the government\u2019s case agent and party-representative at trial, who had attended Messana\u2019s witness preparation session with the prosecution, and who corroborated Messana\u2019s denial. Nachamie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>argues that the district court erred in permitting the government to recall Brady because Brady should have been sequestered. However, the sequestration rule (Fed.R.Evid.615(2)) allows a law enforcement official \u201cwho has been in charge of an investigation to remain in court despite the fact that he will be a witness.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615, Advisory Committee Note (citing <em>United States v. Infanzon, </em>235 F.2d 318 (2d Cir.1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Nachamie asserts that he was unfairly limited in his re-cross-examination (\u201cre-cross\u201d) of Agent Brady. On re-cross, Nachamie asked Agent Brady to name other FBI agents who, like Agent Brady, do not take notes or write reports during witness preparation sessions. The district court cut off this line of questioning. The district court\u2019s limitation of Nachamie\u2019s recross was not unfair and was within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Rosa, </em>11 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cThe scope and extent of cross-examination are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the decision to restrict cross-examination will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d) Nachamie\u2019s counsel had already brought out the absence of any notes made by Agent Brady at the pretrial interview with Messana, and thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in curtailing Nachamie\u2019s questions on re-cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Nachamie challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request to recall the government\u2019s proffered expert, Dr. Burke, to the stand after Nachamie learned that\u2014 inconsistent with Dr. Burke\u2019s testimony \u2014 a medical malpractice case against Dr. Burke had been settled for $150,000. This ruling was not an abuse of discretion. Nachamie had ample opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Burke, and could have discovered the settlement prior to Nachamie\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Burke. Also, the court\u2019s refusal to allow Nachamie to recall Dr. Burke did not prejudice Nachamie: Dr. Burke\u2019s expert testimony that the procedures Nachamie and his co-conspirators fraudulently billed to Medicare were not medically necessary was corroborated by other evidence in the record. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>82 F.3d 574, 576 (2d Cir.1996) (even when a court has improperly limited inquiry, reversal is not warranted where the \u201cerror was harmless or \u2018unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Yates v. Evatt, </em>500 U.S. 391, 403, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 114 L.Ed.2d 432 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Martinez challenges the district court\u2019s refusal \u201cto order the government to produce for examination\u201d Saverio Senape, a former Nachamie employee who had agreed to cooperate with the government. This claim is frivolous. Martinez knew of Senape and his role in the Nachamie operation, and the government had given defense counsel the name of Senape\u2019s lawyer. Martinez apparently made no effort to call Senape as a witness. Martinez argues that <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the Confrontation Clause, and the Due Process clause require the government to process Senape for a pretrial interview with Martinez\u2019s counsel; to the contrary, it is enough for the government to direct the defense to the relevant witness. <em>See United States v. Salerno, </em>868 F.2d 524, 542 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Martinez claims that the district court erred in limiting the introduction of character witness testimony such as evidence of Martinez\u2019s good deeds and charitable works, which demonstrated Martinez\u2019s \u201cgood will, selflessness, and moral character.\u201d Evidence of specific instances of good conduct is admissible when character is an essential element of the charge, but not otherwise. Fed.R.Evid. 405(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Martinez\u2019s character was not an essential element of any of the charges against her; the district court therefore did not err in limiting evidence of Martinez\u2019s charitable works. Even so, the district court did permit some testimony as to specific instances of Martinez\u2019s charity toward senior citizens, enabling Martinez to argue that (contrary to the government\u2019s allegation) Martinez could not have intended \u201cto take advantage of the elderly.\u201d Further, while character witness testimony was limited to charitable works involving the elderly,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court gave Martinez wide leeway to testify about her own good deeds and charitable acts, testimony that was not limited to charity toward the elderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Martinez contends that the district court prevented her from explaining on re-direct examination her actions with respect to (1) a sample encounter form that Martinez had completed and (2) a check from Key Biscayne Laboratory to Seniors for Better Health/Lydia Martinez. This is not accurate. More than an hour into the redirect examination, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>disallowed a question posed to Martinez concerning the plan \u201cfor the New Jersey office as far as office visits or home visits.\u201d The court then called a recess, after which re-direct examination continued for another fifteen minutes. During this time, Martinez answered additional questions about the sample encounter form and other topics. Martinez\u2019s counsel completed re-direct with five minutes of the allotted time remaining, and could have asked Martinez about the Key Biscayne check. In any event, the district court acted within its discretion in limiting the scope of redirect examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Nachamie challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a severance. Nachamie made this motion near the end of trial, after Martinez had testified in her own defense that she was an unknowing victim in Nachamie\u2019s fraudulent scheme. The ground for Nachamie\u2019s motion was that Martinez\u2019s defense was inconsistent with his own defense that any frauds were committed by employees, without his knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides for severance \u201c[i]f it appears that a defendant ... is prejudiced by a joinder of ... defendants ... for trial together.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 14. A trial need not be severed any time codefendants raise conflicting defenses. <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 538-39, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993); <em>United States v. Haynes, </em>16 F.3d 29, 32 (2d Cir.1994). Indeed, there is a \u201cpreference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants who are indicted together.\u201d <em>Zafiro, </em>506 U.S. at 537, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). A defendant challenging the denial of a motion to sever must demonstrate that he was so prejudiced by the joinder that he was denied a constitutionally fair trial and that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d occurred. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>901 F.2d 205, 230 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Aulicino, </em>44 F.3d 1102, 1117 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Also, Nachamie has not demonstrated that joinder of the trials denied him a constitutionally fair trial. Nachamie cites testimony by Martinez that \u201cshe didn\u2019t realize that [Nachamie\u2019s] business was submitting false claims to Medicare,\u201d and that Nachamie told Martinez about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>kickbacks he was receiving from Key Biscayne. But \u201c[a] defendant normally would not be entitled to exclude the testimony of a former codefendant if the district court did sever their trials, and [there is] no reason why relevant and competent testimony would be prejudicial merely because the witness is also a codefendant.\u201d <em>Zafiro, </em>506 U.S. at 540, 113 S.Ct. 933. Since Martinez could have presented the same testimony at Nachamie\u2019s trial had it been severed, Nachamie was not prejudiced. Further, evidence of Nachamie\u2019s involvement in the fraudulent scheme was abundant and Martinez\u2019s testimony regarding the kickback scheme went to only one of the five objects of the conspiracy charged in Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Finally, even if there had been prejudice, it would have been cured by the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury that (1) arguments of counsel are not evidence; (2) the government had to prove each defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) the jury had to evaluate the evidence against each defendant on each charge separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>TV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Martinez and Nachamie argue that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation denied them a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Locascio, </em>6 F.3d 924, 945 (2d Cir.1993). In determining whether reversal is warranted, the court should consider \u201cthe severity of the misconduct, the measures adopted to cure it, and the certainty of the conviction in the absence of the misconduct.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Shar<em>eef </em>190 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.1999). The objectionable remarks must be considered in light of the entire trial. <em>United States v. Espinal, </em>981 F.2d 664, 666 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">Martinez challenges the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about (1) a money order for $620 drawn from Coconut Grove Bank in Florida and payable to \u201cSeniors for Better Health, Inc./Lydia Martinez,\u201d and (2) two corporate checks drawn on Key Biscayne\u2019s account and payable to \u201cSenior\u2019s For Better Health,\u201d with Martinez\u2019s name written on the payee line. Estaco testified that the corporate checks were kickbacks due Nachamie and his co-conspirators for referring urine tests to Key Biscayne. He also testified that upon receipt of the checks, Martinez asked Estaco to send her a cashier\u2019s check instead, without her name on it. Estaco did this and Martinez endorsed the cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Martinez argues that the prosecutor\u2019s characterization (during rebuttal summation) of the bank money order as a \u201ccashier\u2019s check\u201d \u2014 as Estaco had called it \u2014 was unfair. She also finds unfair the prosecutor\u2019s failure to comment on the fact that both the checks and money order were made out to the same payee, despite Estaco\u2019s testimony that Martinez asked him to reissue the checks but not in Martinez\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">This conduct did not deny Martinez a fair trial. <em>Locascio, </em>6 F.3d at 945. The distinction between a cashier\u2019s check and a money order, for purposes of Martinez\u2019s conviction, is essentially immaterial. As for the prosecutor\u2019s failure to point out that the corporate checks and money order were issued in the same name, this point was ascertainable from the evidence, and the government need not point out inconsistencies between the evidence and Estaco\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">We also reject Martinez\u2019s complaint that the prosecutor improperly referenced a sample encounter form as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d and mischaracterized Martinez\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor argued that the same encounter form, entitled \u201cSample New Pts Checkup,\u201d was evidence of Martinez\u2019s knowing involvement in the fraudulent bill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ing scheme because the form, which bore Martinez\u2019s handwriting, indicated that particular procedures had been conducted at an office visit, whereas Martinez acknowledged that some procedures checked off on the form were not performed at an office, or were not performed at all. The government characterized the form as \u201ca smoking document\u201d based on its view that as supervisor of the FMGs, Martinez should have known that whatever tests were performed were not conducted in the office. While Martinez would have preferred the jury to accept her version of the story, that \u201c[t]he form was prepared merely as one to be illustrative of what a <em>legitimate </em>completed form would look like,\u201d the prosecution was entitled to argue its version and urge the jury to adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Nachamie contests the prosecutor\u2019s comment that the defendants did not care whether the elderly victims of the fraudulent scheme lived or died, an observation apparently made to counter Nachamie\u2019s contention that the purpose of the business was to provide medical care for senior citizens. Given the overwhelming evidence of business purposes, there was no error. In any event, any prejudice would have been counteracted by the district court\u2019s later instruction that the jury disregard any references in closing arguments to \u201cliving or dying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Martinez and Tunick challenge portions of the jury charge. Although our review of the charge is <em>de novo, United States v. Han, </em>230 F.3d 560, 565 (2d Cir.2000), an appellant challenging an instruction must establish both (i) that he requested a charge that \u201caccurately represented the law in every respect\u201d and (ii) that the charge given misled the jury as to the correct legal standard, did not adequately inform the jury on the law, and caused the defendant prejudice. <em>United States v. Pujana-Mena, </em>949 F.2d 24, 27 (2d Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Abelis, </em>146 F.3d 73, 82-83 (2d Cir.1998). Reversal is not warranted if the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Amuso, </em>21 F.3d 1251, 1260-61 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Martinez and Tunick both cite the conscious avoidance charge, \u201cwhich permits a jury to find that a defendant had culpable knowledge of a [disputed] fact if the evidence shows that the defendant intentionally avoided confirming the fact,\u201d <em>United States v. Ferrarini, </em>219 F.3d 145, 154 (2d Cir.2000), and argue that the instruction was improper because the theory was not advanced by the prosecution. The flaw in this argument is that \u201c[i]t is not required that the evidence supporting such an instruction be introduced by the government rather than by the defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Bautista, </em>252 F.3d 141, 147 (2d Cir.2001). The instruction was supportable in this case because Martinez and Tunick both claimed that they were unaware of the fraud and a rational juror could conclude from this record that they were \u201caware of a high probability [of the fact in dispute] and consciously avoided confirming that fact.\u201d <em>Ferrarini, </em>219 F.3d at 154 (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Tunick\u2019s deliberate ignorance can be inferred from testimony that during a meeting in September 1997, Tunick asked Messana \u201cwhat was going on\u201d because Tunick heard \u201crumblings and different things happening with FBI agents and people sitting in cars.\u201d Messana responded that \u201cit\u2019s a hot topic and a hot issue and it\u2019s a problem,\u201d and Tunick replied, \u201cWell, if there is fraud going on, that is Alan\u2019s [Nachamie\u2019s] department. I only deposit money.\u201d This, combined with Tunick\u2019s defense that he lacked knowledge of the fraudulent activity partly because he worked in Florida, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>supports a conscious avoidance charge. <em>Id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As to Martinez, her counsel stated that Martinez\u2019s defense was based on \u201cgood faith,\u201d and argued to the jury that \u201cyou are not responsible for [fraud] because you are ignorant of it.\u201d Throughout the trial Martinez disclaimed knowledge of the fraudulent scheme; as her counsel asked the jury in closing, if Martinez knew there was a fraudulent scheme, \u201cwouldn\u2019t [she] get the heck out of there as fast as [she] could?\u201d This defense sufficiently justified a conscious avoidance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Martinez also objects to the district court\u2019s instruction on the aiding and abetting charge. We have reviewed this claim and find it lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Nachamie challenges the calculation of his offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The U.S. Probation Office recommended: [1] a base offense level of six pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(a); [2] a 13 level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(N) because Nachamie\u2019s fraud caused an actual loss of $4,292,555.90; [3] a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(2) because the offense involved \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d; [4] a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(4)(A) because Nachamie misrepresented himself as acting on behalf of a government agency; and [5] a four-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(a) because of Nachamie\u2019s leadership role. This yielded an adjusted offense level of 27 and a guideline range of 70 to 87 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The government raised two objections: [1] that the calculated loss should be based on intended loss rather than actual loss; and [2] that Nachamie\u2019s offense level should be enhanced two levels because he \u201cknew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1). The district court agreed, and also imposed the four-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.1(a) because Nachamie was an organizer and leader of \u201ccriminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise expensive [sic].\u201d Nachamie did not object to either of these enhancements but argues on appeal that their imposition constituted impermissible \u201cdouble counting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">On appeal, we \u201caccept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous and ... [we] give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>106 F.3d 1118, 1121 (2d Cir.1997) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)). A defendant challenging the application of the guidelines to the facts undertakes a heavy burden. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Beverly, </em>5 F.3d 633, 642 (2d Cir.1993). Because Nachamie did not raise the \u201cdouble counting\u201d argument below, it is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Keppler, </em>2 F.3d 21, 23-24 (2d Cir.1993); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Enhancement of a sentence for both more than minimal planning and role in the offense does not amount to double-counting unless the finding as to planning is based solely on the role. <em>See United States v. O\u2019Neil, </em>118 F.3d 65, 76 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Greenfield, </em>44 F.3d 1141, 1146 n. 3 (2d Cir.1995). Nachamie\u2019s enhancement for more than minimal planning was based on a number of facts (other than his leadership role): Nachamie established at least six offices; obtained lists of senior citizens to target; wrote the script used by the telemarketers to recruit patients; hired FMGs to visit senior citizens; arranged for fraudulent forms and reports to be prepared and submitted to Medicare; submitted forms to Medicare electronically to avoid having to obtain signatures; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>established bank accounts to deposit money. The enhancements did not constitute double counting and were permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Nachamie also contests the two-level enhancement premised on the vulnerability of the victims. The district court found: that \u201cthe elderly and poor patients ... may have been dissuaded from seeking medical attention in the belief that they had been screened for major and threatening diseases\u201d; and that Nachamie \u201cvery eynical[ly] ... prey[ed] on the least sophisticated of the elderly population because he believed they would never question the services they were provided free of charge ...\u201d This finding is supported by Nachamie\u2019s tape-recorded admissions that he \u201cindoctrinated\u201d the senior citizens and their family members and real doctors rarely intervened; that \u201call I\u2019ve been doing is black people\u201d; and that he \u201cdeal[t] in the black community ... [because] dealing in our own ... everybody\u2019s got a son, a nephew, and an uncle who\u2019s a doctor.\u201d A \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is one \u201cwho is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, comment (n.2). The patients fit this description, and may be considered as victims even though all of the economic harm was suffered by the government. <em>See United States v. Echevarria, </em>33 F.3d 175, 180-81 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Nachamie challenges the calculation of the amount of loss, arguing that the district court erred by focusing on intended loss rather than actual loss. Loss is \u201cthe value of the money, property, or services unlawfully taken,\u201d and \u201cif an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1); \u00a7 2F1.1, comment (n.8). \u201cThe district court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information,\u201d <em>United States v. Carboni </em>204 F.3d 39, 46 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation and marks omitted), and the calculation of loss amount is made under the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Watts, </em>519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The district court\u2019s estimate of intended loss was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Nachamie and his codefendants submitted in excess of $12 million in claims to Medicare. The court discounted this amount by almost one-half to account for billing in excess of reimbursable amounts, beneficiary co-payments, and duplicate bills. Nachamie protests that some of his claims to Medicare were legitimate and that the district court\u2019s calculation of loss involved \u201cguesswork\u201d; but there is no evidence that any of the claims submitted by Nachamie satisfied Medicare requirements. The court thus made a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d of the amount of the loss. <em>Carboni </em>204 F.3d at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Hernandez charges sentencing error in the calculation of the loss amount. Since Hernandez was convicted on Count One only, he was held accountable only for the intended loss stemming from the kickback scheme and two other similar arrangements he had with health service \u201cproviders\u201d other than Nachamie. With respect to the loss attributable to the Nachamie kickback scheme, the court found that Hernandez was responsible for the entire amount to be billed to Medicare ($137,772) because Hernandez knew that the urine tests were medically unnecessary and/or fraudulent. Hernandez argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the district court should have considered only the amount Hernandez received in kickbacks because he did not know that the tests were fraudulent. The district court rejected this argument at sentencing, and because we see sufficient evidence that Hernandez knew the tests were not medically necessary, we affirm the district court\u2019s calculation of loss attributable to Hernandez.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">With respect to Martinez, the district court departed downward three levels on the basis that the loss overstated the seriousness of her offense. Martinez argues that a further departure was warranted because of family circumstances and aberrant behavior. A district court\u2019s failure to downwardly depart \u201cis ordinarily not reviewable, unless the refusal is due to an erroneous interpretation of law or an erroneous view of the extent of its departure authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Aponte, </em>235 F.3d 802, 803 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). None of these exceptions apply, and Martinez does not argue otherwise. We therefore reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-6\">. Despite the district court's ruling that character witness testimony was limited to evidence of charitable works involving the elderly, Martinez presented several character witnesses who testified about Martinez\u2019s charity beyond that to the elderly. The government did not object to such testimony and the court did not limit it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
