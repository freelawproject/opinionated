Donohue appeals from a November 30, 2000 judgment of the district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissing his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Donohue\u2019s complaint, brought against his former wife and several state officials, asserted various claims relating to a New York State Family Court\u2019s decision affirming an increase in his weekly child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">In an order entered on November 29, 2000, the district court dismissed Donohue\u2019s complaint pursuant to <em>Fitzgerald v. First East Seventh Street Tenants Corp., </em>221 F.3d 362, 363 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (holding that district court may dismiss a frivolous complaint <em>sua sponte </em>even when the plaintiff has paid the required filing fee). This Court has not yet ruled as to the standard of review that applies to the <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a fee-paid claim, such as the one at issue here. <em>See id. </em>at 364 n. 2. Whether reviewed for an abuse of discretion or under the more stringent <em>de novo </em>standard, however, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Donohue\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to invalidate or otherwise review the state court\u2019s decision affirming the modification of Donohue\u2019s child support payments. <em>See Ankenbrandt v. Richards, </em>504 U.S. 689, 703, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992) (holding that domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction \u201cdivests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\u201d); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482-86 &amp; n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983) (holding that district courts do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>have jurisdiction to review state court decisions or claims \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the merits of the state court determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The district court also properly determined that Donohue had failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on the grounds that (1) Donohue\u2019s wife was not a state actor, <em>see West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 48-19, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988); (2) Donohue did not allege that Governor Pataki or Attorney General Spitzer were involved in, or had notice of, the alleged constitutional violation, <em>see, e.g., Meriwether v. Coughlin, </em>879 F.2d 1037, 1047-48 (2d Cir.1989); and (3) the Chief Clerk for the Rockland County Family Court is entitled to absolute immunity from this suit, <em>see Oliva v. Heller, </em>839 F.2d 37, 39-40 (2d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Finally, to the extent that Donohue\u2019s appeal challenges the constitutionality of New York C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5241, this claim was not presented to the district court and, therefore, is not properly before us. <em>Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120-21, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s thoughtful and thorough opinion, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
