Trepka alleges that she has a qualifying disability under the ADA and that the Board failed to meet the ADA\u2019s requirements in dealing with her disability. In short, Trepka claims that the Board and its employees failed reasonably to accommodate her disability, harassed her on the basis of her disability, retaliated against her for filing complaints regarding the Board\u2019s lack of accommodation, and discharged her constructively because of her disability. The district court, assuming that Trepka had a qualifying disability, held that the Board\u2019s treatment of her did not violate the ADA. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">In March 1991, Trepka was involved in an automobile accident, resulting in \u201cmyofacial pain syndrome.\u201d The syndrome causes continuing pain in Trepka\u2019s back and neck, and her physicians state that the condition is permanent. According to her physicians, Trepka\u2019s condition prevents her from climbing stairs \u201cquickly\u201d and carrying \u201coversized\u201d loads.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Trepka, at the time of the accident and until her resignation in January 1997, was a special education teacher for the Cleveland City Schools. After a leave of absence due to her injuries, Trepka was assigned to teach an \u201cadaptive management class\u201d for behaviorally disabled students at Adlai Stevenson Elementary School. After telling the Board that her injuries would make it difficult to control disobedient children physically, she was transferred to Marion Seltzer Elementary School and a class of developmentally disabled students.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">At Marion Seltzer, the allegedly unaccommodating and abusive conduct that is the basis of this action began. On her very first day, Marion Seltzer\u2019s principal, Bonnie Terrell, asked her whether her transfer was \u201cvoluntary or involuntary.\u201d Trepka was evaluated \u201cmore often than usual\u201d by the administration, although each time receiving good to excellent reviews. In March 1996, she took a second medical leave because of her condition. When she returned, the Board reassigned her to another school in the district, but rescinded the reassignment before Trepka started teaching there because the school had no first floor room available for Trepka\u2019s class, and a second floor room would challenge her ability to climb stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">Before Trepka went on her second medical leave and was temporarily transferred from Marion Seltzer, she was assigned to Room 108 at Marion Seltzer. When Trepka returned to Marion Seltzer, Terrell placed her in Room 104, claiming that Room 108, the largest in the school, was already assigned to an overcrowded kindergarten class. Although Room 104 was also on the first floor, Room 108 was closer to Trepka\u2019s car and did not necessitate carrying materials for longer distances. Trepka demanded to be reassigned to Room 108 and rejected Terrell\u2019s alternative offers of the assistance of custodial staff or the availability of a cart to carry materials from her car to Room 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Terrell and Trepka had several tense verbal interactions during her time at Marion Seltzer. On one occasion, Terrell made several comments about Trepka\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ability to walk. Terrell also reprimanded Trepka and another teacher for having a verbal altercation in the presence of students. On yet another occasion, Terrell asked Trepka to sit on the floor with her students at a school assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In January 1997, Trepka resigned, claiming that her disability made it impossible to work under the conditions set by Terrell and the Board. After filing two complaints with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, Trepka filed the complaint in this action in January 1996, before she had resigned her teaching position. After several amendments to her complaint, the Board moved for summary judgment in January 1998. The district court granted the Board\u2019s motion for summary judgment. According to the district court, there was a genuine issue of material fact at least as to whether Trepka had a \u201cdisability\u201d as defined by the ADA. Nevertheless, the district court held that Trepka had demonstrated no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Board had failed reasonably to accommodate her disability, whether she had been harassed or retaliated against because of her disability or her requests for accommodation, or whether she had been constructively discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Trepka now appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing her causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Trepka argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment with regard to four categories of claims. First, Trepka contends that she demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact that the Board failed reasonably to accommodate her disability. Second, Trepka argues that Terrell\u2019s various comments to and treatment of Trepka establishes a genuine issue of material fact that Trepka was the victim of discriminatory harassment. Third, Trepka claims that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Board retaliated against Trepka for filing complaints regarding the accommodation of her disability during her tenure with the school district. Finally, Trepka insists that the Board\u2019s lack of accommodation and hostile treatment forced her to resign and creates at least a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was constructively discharged. We consider each of these arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">A. Trepka\u2019s Accommodation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Trepka argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on her accommodation claims. From her brief, it is difficult to determine the manner in which Trepka thinks the district court erred. We can discern two possible assertions of error. On the first theory, the Board could have reasonably accommodated her disability by placing her in Room 108, which is closer to the parking lot, rather than Room 104. Here, the Board offered two alternative accommodations: a cart or the assistance of custodians to help move materials from her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">If an employee has a qualifying disability, the employer is required to provide such reasonable accommodations as will enable her to perform the essential functions of her job. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A); <em>Gaines v. Runyon, </em>107 F.3d 1171, 1178 (6th Cir.1997). A request for accommodation by an <em>employee or her </em>physician triggers the employer\u2019s statutory duty reasonably to accommodate the employee\u2019s condition. The employer need not provide the accommodation that the employee requests or prefers. Instead, the employer retains the \u201cultimate discretion\u201d to choose another effective accommodation, even if less expensive or easier to provide. <em>Hankins v. The Gap, </em>84 F.3d 797, 800-01 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>(6th Cir.1996). Accordingly, an employee is not entitled to a particular reasonable accommodation if another reasonable accommodation is provided. <em>Ibid.; </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.9(d) (2001). To prevail, Trepka must demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact with regard not only to her entitlement to her requested accommodation, but also to the inadequacy of the offered alternatives. <em>See Gaines v. Runyon, </em>107 F.3d 1171, 1178 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Trepka does not appear to offer any evidence regarding the adequacy of the alternatives offered by the Board. Trepka\u2019s requested accommodation, her reassignment to Room 108, establishes a baseline of her view of a reasonable accommodation. The only relevant difference between the requested Room 108 and her assigned Room 104 is the distance that Trepka would be required to navigate inside the building from her car. Apparently, Trepka regularly carried teaching materials from her car to her classroom. Her placement in Room 104 increased the distance that those materials would need to be carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Her physician had previously indicated that Trepka\u2019s condition limited her ability to carry loads and to climb stairs. Trepka, however, presented no evidence that her condition limited her ability to walk. Although placement in Room 104 increased the distance that she would need to walk, each of the two offered alternative accommodations, the use of a cart and the assistance of custodial staff, would obviate the need for her to carry loads any further from her car. Indeed, her own physician, in his letter to the school requesting a room reassignment, suggested assistance in carrying her materials as an alternative. Trepka claims that she asked the custodian for assistance once and that he was late in helping her, but we hold that such evidence falls well short of demonstrating that the accommodation was unavailable. Moreover, such a claim indicates very little about the availability or adequacy of the cart. We hold that there is no genuine issue of material fact that these alternatives were offered and available, and were adequate accommodations. Because the ADA does not entitle a disabled employee to insist on one among several reasonable accommodations, we hold that the district court\u2019s summary judgment was appropriate on this theory of Trepka\u2019s accommodation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The second and only other theory of the Board\u2019s failure to accommodate is that she was not provided with adequate handicapped parking. According to Trepka, the parking facilities at Marion Seltzer Elementary School did not meet Department of Justice standards for handicapped parking. Insofar as Trepka\u2019s cause of action is under only the ADA, she must demonstrate that she required better parking as a reasonable accommodation to <em>her </em>physical limitations. One feature of the parking lot to which Trepka was assigned was the need to climb five steps to the door. Although there is evidence that Trepka\u2019s condition limited her ability to climb steps, Trepka\u2019s physician indicated that it was his recommendation that she climb steps no more than two to three times a day. The parking provided only required Trepka to climb less than a flight of stairs once a day. Absent any evidence of more profound physical limitations arising from her condition, we hold that Trepka has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether her parking needs were reasonably accommodated.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">B. Trepka\u2019s Hostile Work Environment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Trepka argues that the Board and its employees engaged in discriminatory harassment and created a hostile work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>environment for her because of her disability. In order to maintain an action for a hostile work environment under the ADA, the employee must demonstrate that: (1) she was disabled; (2) she was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on her disability; (4) the harassment unreasonably interfered with her work performance; and (5) the defendant either knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take corrective measures. <em>See Blankenship v. Parke Care Centers, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 868, 872 (6th Cir.1997) (establishing the framework of proof under Title VII for sexual harassment); <em>Crawford v. Medina General Hosp., </em>96 F.3d 830, 834 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that the elements of a hostile work environment claim are the same across discrimination contexts and applying those elements specifically to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act). The Supreme Court has elaborated on what type of conduct can constitute harassment and form the basis for a hostile work environment claim. <em>See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). To prevail, the employee must show conduct that is \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and [to] create an abusive working environment.\u201d <em>See ibid.; Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). Conduct that is \u201cmerely offensive\u201d will not suffice to support a hostile work environment action. <em>See Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 21, 114 S.Ct. 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">This court is able to find only a few instances of conduct alleged here that could even-approach harassment. Trepka claims that she was accosted on several occasions by the principal at the Marion Seltzer school, Bonnie Terrell. On September 28, 1995, Terrell had a relatively contentious oral confrontation with Trepka, yelling: \u201cAnswer me, Mrs. Trepka. Answer me. You can walk. We all see you walk. You walk these steps every day.\u201d In the Winter of 1995, Terrell asked Trepka to knock the snow off her boots before entering the building while \u201cother people were entering with snow on their boots.\u201d At an assembly, Terrell asked Trepka and another allegedly \u201cdisabled\u201d teacher to sit on the floor with their classes while other teachers were not so asked. When Trepka arrived at Marion Seltzer, Terrell asked her whether her transfer was \u201cvoluntary or involuntary.\u201d Towards the end of her employment, Trepka says that she pressed a panic buzzer to the principal\u2019s office and Terrell failed expeditiously to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The alleged conduct falls well short of even presenting a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Trepka was subjected to a hostile work environment. Perhaps the strongest instance of conduct is Terrell\u2019s stern words about Trepka\u2019s ability to walk. At most, however, those words express skepticism regarding Trepka\u2019s condition. This single incident of explicit reference to Trepka\u2019s disability is not sufficiently severe to constitute harassment under our precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">With regard to Terrell\u2019s other conduct, there is no evidence that it was undertaken \u201cbecause\u201d of Trepka\u2019s disability. Our harassment jurisprudence requires that we distinguish between harassment and discriminatory harassment. <em>See Bowman v. Shawnee State Univ., </em>220 F.3d 456, 464 (6th Cir.2000). Thus, an employee must demonstrate that the allegedly harassing conduct was motivated by a bias towards the employee\u2019s protected class. <em>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 778, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). There is no evidence on the basis of which a reasonable jury could begin to determine that Terrell acted be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>cause of Trepka\u2019s disability rather than, for example, that Terrell asked Trepka to sit on the floor once because her developmentally disabled students needed extra attention, or that Terrell asked Trepka to knock the snow off her boots because Terrell did not notice anyone else, or that Terrell did not answer the panic button because she was not in her office, or that Terrell did all of these things because she just did not personally like Trepka. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (holding that harassment motivated by personal dislike for an employee is not actionable under the discrimination laws). To avoid summary judgment, Trepka need not prove Terrell\u2019s motivation, but she should at least provide some evidence of discrimination \u2014 and we can find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment with regard to Trepka\u2019s hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">C. Trepka\u2019s Retaliation Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Trepka next contends that she was the victim of prohibited retaliation for filing complaints with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a) (prohibiting discrimination against any individual for engaging in conduct protected by the ADA, including filing a grievance). To establish an action for retaliation under the ADA, the employee must at least show that she suffered an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d <em>See Penny v. United Parcel Serv., </em>128 F.3d 408, 417 (6th Cir.1997). While there are, of course, other elements to a retaliation claim under the ADA, we need not elaborate upon them here as Trepka has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact that she suffered an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Not every action that the employee dislikes is an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d <em>See Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., </em>97 F.3d 876, 885 (6th Cir.1996). Instead, the employer\u2019s conduct must effect a \u201cmaterially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>For example, reassignments do not constitute adverse employment actions without disadvantageous changes in hours or salary. <em>See Yates v. Avco Corp., </em>819 F.2d 630, 638 (6th Cir.1987). More generally, courts look for at least a termination of employment, a demotion in wage, salary or job title, a loss of benefits, or a decrease in responsibilities. <em>See, e.g., Crady v. Liberty National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>993 F.2d 132, 136 (7th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">Trepka has suffered none of these. Her salary, promotion track, and responsibilities were not diminished by any Board action. Indeed, her job evaluations throughout were either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d At most, Trepka perceives an attitude of dislike among certain administrators. But such an atmosphere is not even close to the adverse <em>action </em>required to constitute retaliation. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment on her retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">D. Trepka\u2019s Constructive Discharge Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Finally, Trepka claims that, although she resigned and was not terminated from her position, she was \u201cconstructively discharged\u201d and therefore is entitled to relief. Trepka\u2019s incantation of the words \u201cconstructive discharge,\u201d of course, is not sufficient to establish a cause of action because, absent explicit contractual provisions to the contrary, an employer may explicitly discharge any employee at will. <em>See, e.g., Wright v. Honda of Am. Mfg., Inc., </em>73 Ohio St.3d 571, 653 N.E.2d 381, 384 (1995) (\u201cIn general, under the employment-at-will doctrine, the employment relationship between employer and employee is terminable at the will of ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>ther; thus, an employee is subject to discharge by an employer at any time, even without cause.\u201d). Rather, conduct that forces an employee to quit, constituting \u201cconstructive discharge,\u201d is actionable only if the conduct is motivated by discriminatory intent against a protected employee characteristic. The discriminatory conduct must then make working conditions \u201cso difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\u201d <em>See Kocsis v. Multi-Care Management, Inc., </em>97 F.3d 867, 887 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Indeed, simple proof of discrimination is not enough to convert an employee\u2019s resignation into an actionable constructive discharge. Instead, there must be, in addition, aggravating factors, constituting at least a continuous and severe pattern of discriminatory treatment. <em>See Yates v. Avco Corp., </em>819 F.2d 630, 637 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Consequently, because we have held as to all of her other claims that Trepka has not demonstrated one genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was discriminated against because of her disability, she is far from establishing the \u201caggravating factors\u201d necessary for a \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d action. We therefore affirm the summary judgment of the district court on Trepka\u2019s constructive discharge claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Having also held that Trepka demonstrated no genuine issue of material fact with regard to her accommodation, hostile work environment and retaliation claims, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
