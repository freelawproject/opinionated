Patison raises numerous claims challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders (1) imposing sanctions for not properly serving a subpoena; (2) revoking Patison\u2019s employment as counsel for the unsecured creditors; (3) imposing sanctions for filing a frivolous motion to reconsider; and (4) granting summary judgment in favor of the Trustee and awarding punitive damages against Patison. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). We affirm the bankruptcy court as to all of its orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>except the order awarding punitive damages. We remand with instructions on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from the bankruptcy court <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the parties are familiar with the facts of this case, we do not recite them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">I. <em>Sanction for not Properly Serving Subpoenas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The bankruptcy judge did not err in finding that Patison improperly served subpoenas by not serving deposition notices prior to serving the subpoenas. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30 states that if a subpoena is <em>to be served </em>on the person to be examined in a deposition, the notice of deposition must contain a list of the materials to be produced. The text \u201cto be served\u201d thus indicates that notice must precede service of a subpoena. In addition, there would be no need for the notice to list the documents to be produced if the notice followed the subpoena. In that case, the subpoena would already have disclosed the materials to be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The advisory committee note to Rule 45 confirms our interpretation of Rule 30. The note states that the prior notice requirement in Rule 45 only applies to subpoenas that are not connected with a deposition because depositions are covered by Rule 30.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This language implies that the committee was not negating a prior notice requirement for deposition subpoenas, but was including that requirement within the Rule 30 notice of deposition requirement. Therefore, a notice of deposition must be served prior to the service of a deposition subpoena. Because Patison failed to follow this procedure, the district court did not err when it sanctioned Patison.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">For the reasons provided by the district court, we also hold that Patison was not denied due process when the bankruptcy judge imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">II. <em>Revocation of Patison\u2019s Employment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">We do not need to decide if the court improperly proceeded by contested motion rather than by adversary proceeding for the disgorgement of fees. We will overturn the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision only if it did not afford the parties adequate procedural protections and if it failed to develop the record adequately.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Patison had the opportunity to respond to the Trustee\u2019s motion and to argue against the motion at a hearing. Full discovery was available to him under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014. The record established that Patison had been awarded fees and detailed the amount of the fees. Thus, we conclude that the district court afforded Patison adequate procedural protections and adequately developed the record regarding the fees. Accordingly, we may not overturn the court\u2019s disgorgement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">For the reasons stated by the district court, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Patison\u2019s employment. We also agree with the district court\u2019s reasoning regarding the timeliness of the motion to revoke Patison\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Patisoris continuance. Patison had more than the required minimum time between service of the motion and the hearing. He also was aware of the substance of the motion well before it was served because the Trustee had filed an almost identical motion two months earlier. He should have been able to file his opposition on time.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the majority of Patisoris evidentiary objections. Any errors that did occur were harmless. The only evidence necessary to show Patisoris conflict of interest, and thus support the court\u2019s revocation of the employment order, consisted of the transcript of the fee proceedings granting Patison his interim fees and the cancelled checks showing the amount of money that Patison took. The court correctly admitted that evidence because neither the transcript nor the statements in the transcript were inadmissable hearsay, and the checks were self-authenticating documents that satisfied the best evidence rule. Any other evidentiary errors were harmless because no other evidence was necessary to establish proof of Patisoris theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Patisoris motion for reconsideration because Patison did not present any newly discovered evidence or any proof of clear error or manifest injustice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">III. <em>Sanctions for Frivolous Motion to Reconsider</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">For the reasons stated by the district court, the bankruptcy court did not err in finding that the Trustee satisfied the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9011.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in awarding sanctions or in determining the amount awarded. Patison presented neither new evidence nor proof of clear error in his motion to reconsider. Thus, the bankruptcy court reasonably found the motion frivolous and awarded sanctions. As to the award, the judge calculated the fees herself based on the hours recorded by the law firm\u2019s computer system and the hourly rate of the lawyers. This, plus the costs, was a reasonable basis for the award. It was also reasonable to include within the sanction the fees for time spent preparing and arguing the motion for sanctions because they were incurred as a result of the frivolous motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">IV. <em>Grant of Summary Judgment and Award of Punitive Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">Patisoris evidentiary objections fail for the reasons stated by the district court. Patisoris collateral estoppel argument fails as well because there is no evidence that the court relied on the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The court made separate findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its summary judgment order, showing that it considered the matter separately from its decision regarding the employment revocation motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Patisoris argument that no evidence supported the claims for relief fails for the reasons discussed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">We will not consider Patisoris statute of limitations claims, other than for the post-petition transfer claim, because he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>raise them before the bankruptcy court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The one statute of limitations claim that Patison did raise before the bankruptcy court fails because the limitations period was equitably tolled. The court found that the Trustee was unable to discover the material facts of the fraud until August 20, 1998; thus equitable tolling until that date occurred. The Trustee filed suit within one year of the discovery date-well within the statute of limitations. Based on the evidence in the record of the Trustee\u2019s attempts to gain information from Patison, the court did not err in holding that the Trustee was diligent and that equitable tolling applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">For the reasons stated by the district court, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Patison\u2019s continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The district court did err in affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of punitive damages. The bankruptcy court did not require the Trustee to provide proof of Patison\u2019s wealth for damages awarded under state law. California requires that the plaintiff offer proof of the defendant\u2019s wealth for an award of punitive damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Federal law does not require such proof, and it is up to the defendant to offer such evidence if he wants the court to consider it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The bankruptcy court awarded punitive damages under the conversion claim and the breach of fiduciary duty claim. The conversion claim appeared to be a state law claim while the breach of fiduciary duty claim appeared to be based, at least in part, on federal law. Because it is unclear how much of the sum awarded as punitive damages was awarded pursuant to state law and how much pursuant to federal law, we must remand.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">On remand, the bankruptcy court must allocate the amount of punitive damages awarded under state law and the amount awarded under federal law. To the degree punitive damages are based on state law, the plaintiff must offer proof of the defendant\u2019s wealth. We note that the Trustee did attempt to gain information about Patison\u2019s wealth from Patison. Patison refused to comply with the Trustee\u2019s request because discovery had closed and he was under no obligation to produce further information. The court may wish to reopen discovery to allow the parties the opportunity to collect evidence of Patison\u2019s wealth in order to support a renewed motion for punitive damages under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">We affirm the district court with respect to everything except the punitive damages award. That award must be remanded to the bankruptcy court with instructions to allocate the amount of damages that pertained to state law claims and the amount that pertained to federal law claims. The state law punitive damages award must be dismissed unless the Trustee provides evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>dence of Patison\u2019s wealth. We leave up to the bankruptcy court the decision whether to reopen discovery for that purpose. Costs shall be awarded to the Appellee. AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\">. <em>In re Turley, </em>172 F.3d 671, 673 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\">. <em>In re Dudley, </em>249 F.3d 1170, 1173 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b699-18\">.
