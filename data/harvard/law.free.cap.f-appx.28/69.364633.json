Elfvin, Judge), entered on May 29, 2001, granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees, New York State Department of Correctional Services and N.Y.S. Dept. of Civil Services, and from orders entered October 30, 1997 and April 30, 1998, dismissing claims against these two parties and Defendant Appellee, N.Y. State Office of State Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Richardson, a former employee of the New York State Department of Correctional Services, brought suit against Defendants under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, federal civil rights statutes 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985, New York Executive Law \u00a7 296, and the New York State Constitution, alleging racial and gender discrimination and harassment, as well as retaliation. In October 1997, the district court dismissed Richardson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, holding that the Eleventh Amendment immunized States and their officials from such complaints. In April 1998, the district court dismissed Richardson\u2019s complaint as to the Office of the State Comptroller (identified by the district court as the State\u2019s Department of Audit and Control) for failure to state a claim and dismissed all of Richardson\u2019s other claims on Eleventh Amendment grounds except those under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In May 2001, the district court granted summary judgment to the remaining Defendants on Richardson\u2019s Title VII claims. The court held that Richardson\u2019s retaliation claims failed because she did not provide any evidence challenging the Defendants\u2019 legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating her and for not reinstating her to the position of Supervisor of the Inmate Grievance Program at the Albion Correctional Facility. The court also found that even if Richardson had stated a prima facie case for workplace discrimination, nothing in the record undermined the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons given by Defendants for each of their actions. In particular, the court noted that while the record showed a \u201cstrained relationship\u201d between Richardson and her supervisor, Sergeant William Reed, there was no evidence that Reed\u2019s treatment of Richardson resulted from a discriminatory motive. Finally, the court turned to Richardson\u2019s hostile work environment claim and found that the incidents she alleged were insufficiently severe as a matter of law to create a work environment that was abusive or hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Having reviewed all of Richardson\u2019s contentions on appeal, we find them without merit and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in its Memoranda and Orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
