Anderson, appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his case without prejudice. Mr. Anderson, a state prisoner in a Kansas corrections facility, filed suit in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that the state Department of Corrections miscalculated his total prison term in violation of his constitutional rights. In his claim, Mr. Anderson sought both equitable and legal forms of relief. The district court held that challenges to prison terms must be brought under habeas corpus rather than section 1983. Accordingly, the district court construed Mr. Anderson\u2019s claim as a petition for federal habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and dismissed the claim without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies. The district court also declined to grant a Certificate of Appealability (COA). Mr. Anderson appeals. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding construing Mr. Anderson\u2019s claims as claims for habeas relief under section 2241 and deny a COA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Mr. Anderson presented his suit as arising under section 1983, but his claim, as it currently stands, cannot be brought as a civil rights suit. As the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>held, claims that challenge the fact of conviction or length of incarceration are not cognizable under section 1983 because a more specific form of legal challenge, habeas corpus, is available for this purpose. <em>Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). Mr. Anderson\u2019s equitable relief claims are direct challenges to his length of incarceration and therefore are not cognizable under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Moreover, Mr. Anderson may not bring his section 1983 damages claims at this time. To bring a damages claim that directly or impliedly challenges the validity of conviction or incarceration under section 1983, a claimant must have first obtained a favorable decision in state court or in federal habeas proceedings on the conviction or incarceration issue he seeks to challenge. <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See also Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 645-46, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997). Because Mr. Anderson has not obtained such a determination, his damages claims are not currently cognizable under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The appropriate avenue for challenging the execution of a sentence is a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court therefore properly construed Mr. Anderson\u2019s claim as a habeas petition filed pursuant to section 2241. The district court then dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Because we agree Mr. Anderson\u2019s claim should be construed as a petition for habeas relief, he must have a COA in order to appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A); <em>see also Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cstate prisoner must obtain a COA to appeal the denial of a habeas petition, whether such petition was filed pursuant to \u00a7 2254 or \u00a7 2241, whenever \u2018the detention complained of ... arises out of process issued by a State court\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A)). The district court declined to grant a COA. Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2), Mr. Anderson\u2019s notice of appeal is deemed a renewed application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Mr. Anderson is entitled to a COA only if he makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(e)(2). A prisoner may make this showing by demonstrating that the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are 1) deserving of further proceedings, 2) subject to a different resolution on appeal, or 3) reasonably debatable among jurists of reason. <em>See Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). We agree with the district court that Mr. Anderson\u2019s federal habeas petition, so construed, is premature. Mr. Anderson\u2019s petition for state post-conviction relief is currently pending before state courts, and the state has not waived exhaustion. Consequently, the petitioner has not satisfied the prerequisites for bringing a federal habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). Accordingly, he has not made the showing required for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Mr. Anderson\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b811-12\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-19\">.
