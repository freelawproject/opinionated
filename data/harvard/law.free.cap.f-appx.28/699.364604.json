We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, and review for substantial evidence and legal error the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Osenbrock v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1157, 1162 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Zlotnikov\u2019s contention that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly disregarded treating physician Galina Gorodetsky\u2019s opinion lacks merit. Where, as here, the treating physician\u2019s opinion is contradicted by a non-treating physician\u2019s opinion that is supported by independent clinical findings, the non-treating physician\u2019s opinion may constitute substantial evidence for discrediting the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995). Zlotnikov\u2019s contention that the ALJ improperly rejected treating physician Anne Simons\u2019 opinion lacks merit, because non-treating physician C. Dean Hartwig\u2019s opinion constitutes substantial evidence for rejecting Dr. Simons\u2019 opinion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-13\">Zlotnikov\u2019s contention that he could not work as a pipe fitter lacks merit because Zlotnikov must show that a disability prevented him from performing his previous job as an electrical fitter, regardless of where Zlotnikov performed that job and whether that job exists in the United States. <em>See Han v. Bowen, </em>882 F.2d 1453, 1456 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-14\">Although the ALJ correctly noted that x-rays of Zlotnikov\u2019s back indicated disc space narrowing and osteophytic spurring at C4-C7, L1-L2 and L3-4 levels, the ALJ erred in stating that there was no evidence that these conditions did not result in degenerative changes. However, because Zlotnikov failed to carry his burden to show how this condition prevented him from engaging in his past work as an electrical fitter, Clem <em>v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 328, 331 (9th Cir.1990), the ALJ\u2019s error is harmless, <em>see Booz v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>734 F.2d 1378, 1380 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-15\">The ALJ properly considered Zlotnikov\u2019s mental and physical impairments in combination in assessing whether he could perform his past relevant work as an electrical fitter, and in assessing the credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>of his testimony about his limitations. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1289-90 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b724-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
