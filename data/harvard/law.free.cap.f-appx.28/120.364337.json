(\u201cHelena\u201d) sued Nelson Farms seeking payment for chemicals and spraying services, and Nelson Farms counterclaimed, asserting that Helena\u2019s improper application of herbicides had damaged its fields. The District Court entered summary judgment in favor of Nelson Farms for negligence, and against Nelson Farms on its claim under the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (the \u201cConsumer Fraud Act\u201d), N.J.S.A. 56:8-2. The jury determined damages, and Nelson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Farms was awarded $310,826 for the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Nonetheless, Nelson Farms appealed, contending that the judge should have found that Helena\u2019s actions violated the Consumer Fraud Act because Helena \u201cknowingly ignored label directions and applied the pesticide [improperly],\u201d because the misrepresentation by Helena was of a type contemplated by the Consumer Fraud Act such that the issue should have been submitted to the jury, and because the court erred in failing to find that the violations of federal and state law were \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d within the meaning of <em>Cox v. Sears Roebuck, </em>138 N.J. 2, 647 A.2d 454 (1994), sufficient to give rise to a violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and our review of a summary judgment decision is de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The District Court first considered whether a statement by Helena that it would match a competitor in quality and price amounted to fraudulent inducement to contract. It found that, at most, Helena may have breached an oral guarantee of quality, which does not violate the Consumer Fraud Act by itself, but must be accompanied by aggravating circumstances. See <em>D\u2019Ercole Sales, Inc. v. Fruehauf Corp., </em>206 N.J.Super. 11, 501 A.2d 990, 997-98, 1001 (Super.Ct.App.Div.1985). The District Court found that Nelson Farms had put forth no evidence of aggravating circumstances and, in particular, that there was no evidence of \u201cconcealment of an intent to provide inferior service from the outset.\u201d On appeal, Nelson Farms urges us to hold that the repeated application of the herbicide after Helena\u2019s employees realized it was not mixing well amounted to aggravating circumstances. But we agree with the District Court that this does not rise to the level contemplated by the statute. Finally, the District Court reasoned that Helena\u2019s statement was \u201cpuffing\u201d rather than fraud under the Consumer Fraud Act. See <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>288 N.J.Super. 504, 672 A.2d 1190 (Super.Ct.App.Div.1996), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>148 N.J. 582, 691 A.2d 350 (1997) (requiring that the misrepresentation must be material to the transaction, must be false, and must induce the buyer to make the purchase).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The District Court next rejected Nelson Farms\u2019 argument that Helena\u2019s failure to follow the instructions on the label amounted to an unconscionable business practice because it violated statutes that regulate the use of herbicides. The District Court found no basis in law for this argument and reasoned that misuse of herbicides can be remedied without reliance on the Consumer Fraud Act through the herbicide statutes\u2019 own enforcement provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We agree that summary judgment against Nelson Farms on its Consumer Fraud Act claim was appropriate, essentially for the reasons in the District Court\u2019s opinion. We agree that there was no evidence that either Helena\u2019s statement or its use of herbicides violated the Consumer Fraud Act. The improper herbicide application did not constitute an \u201cunconscionable commercial practice,\u201d in part because it did not reflect the lack of \u201cgood faith, honesty in fact and observance of fair dealing\u201d that Cox requires. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Helena\u2019s statement that it would meet the quality and cost of its competitor did not constitute a misrepresentation. Instead, it was an assurance given, but Helena then failed to perform in accordance with the assurance. No one alleges that the company lacked the qualifications and was not competent; rather, it just did not follow the label.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Also before us is Helena\u2019s cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>its motion for a new trial or remittitur on the ground that the jury awarded excessive damages. In its opinion, the District Court examined in detail the presentations made by competing experts, the calculations of the quantity of each crop that was lost or damaged, and the evidence as to the value of these crops. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion and that the jury\u2019s damage verdict was not \u201cso grossly excessive as to shock the judicial conscience.\u201d <em>Murray v. Fairbanks Morse, </em>610 F.2d 149, 153 (3d Cir.1979) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Finally, Helena cross-appealed from the order granting Nelson Farms\u2019 motion to add prejudgment interest to the final judgment. We agree with the District Court that this was an appropriate addition, as the New Jersey Court Rules expressly provide for interest without requiring that it be requested in the complaint or in pretrial submissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In sum, for the reasons set forth by the District Court in its opinion, we will AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
