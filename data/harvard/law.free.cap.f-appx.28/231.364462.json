Tumbleston sued her employer A.O. Smith Corporation, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001\u20141461 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001), following termination of her long term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) payments. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court denied Tumbleston\u2019s motion and granted Smith\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>i.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Prior to August 1994, Tumbleston was a customer service supervisor employed by Smith. As a Smith employee, Tumbleston was enrolled in Smith\u2019s benefits plan, which included provisions for the payment of LTD benefits under defined circumstances. Smith is the Plan Administrator for its Long Term Disability Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), and Provident Life and Accident acted as the Claims Administrator for the Plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Plan is self-funded for the first five years of a claim, and thereafter is insured by a private insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Under Smith\u2019s LTD Plan, an employee is considered totally disabled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">a. during the first 24 months if the injury or disease prevents [the employee] from performing any and every duty of [her] occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">b. thereafter only if the injury or disease prevents [the employee] from performing any and every duty of every occupation for which [she is] qualified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">J.A. 37. However, with one exception not applicable here, benefits payable for a disability \u201c[c]aused by [n]ervous or [m]ental [disease\u201d are always limited to 24 months. J.A. 34. The parties agree that the Plan Administrator is given discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the terms and provisions of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">In early August, 1994, Tumbleston left her employment with Smith and has never returned. On February 17, 1995, Tumbleston applied for LTD benefits under the Plan by completing an \u201cInitial Claim for Group Long Term Disability Benefits.\u201d J.A. 49. Tumbleston claimed that her disability was job-related, with an onset date of August 2, 1994, and listed Dr. James Bell, her family physician, and Dr. Judith Tolhurst, her psychiatrist, as treating physicians. Her claim was initially supported by an \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Statement of Disability\u201d completed by Dr. Bell. J.A. 51. In the \u201cDiagnosis\u201d section of the form, Dr. Bell listed Tumblestoris diagnoses as major depression and anxiety (created by job stress), panic disorder, and lumbosacral disc disease with sciatica. With regard to Tumblestoris disability, Dr. Bell opined that Tumbleston had been totally disabled since August 4, 1994, due to \u201cinterpersonal relationships that have led to confrontation,\u201d and stated that Tumbleston would not be able to return to work. J.A. 51. In addition, Dr. Bell indicated that Tumblestoris lifting capability was not applicable to her claim for disability, that her range of motion was not impaired, and that she had no \u201c[c]ardiac [f]unctional [c]apacity\u201d limitation. J.A. 51-52. According to Dr. Tolhurst\u2019s records, obtained by the Plan Administrator to evaluate the claim, Tumbleston had reported that in August 1994, her \u201cboss jumped on her in front of [four] people [and] she quit on med[ical] leave per Dr. Bell.\u201d J.A. 61. Because Tumbleston had dropped out of treatment, however, Dr. Tolhurst offered no opinion as to whether Tumbleston could work.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">In June 1995, the Plan Administrator asked Tumbleston to submit to an independent psychological evaluation by Jill Banks, Ph.D. Dr. Banks confirmed that Tumbleston suffered from \u201cdepression, insomnia, agitation, lack of self-confidence, indecisiveness, and inability to interact with others as she once did,\u201d apparently related at least in part to Tumbleston\u2019s prior interactions with her supervisor. J.A. 73. Dr. Banks opined that Tumbleston was \u201csignificantly depressed,\u201d that</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>she was \u201cunable to cope with stressful situations,\u201d and that her depression \u201cimpaired] her ability to carry out work-related functions.\u201d J.A. 75. The Plan Administrator approved Tumbleston\u2019s claim for benefits in August 1995, but Tumbleston was encouraged at approximately the same time to consider rehabilitative services because her LTD benefits would terminate after 24 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">During the ensuing 24 months, the Plan Administrator requested several updates from Tumbleston and Dr. Bell concerning Tumbleston\u2019s disability status. In February 1996, the Plan Administrator requested that a \u201cProof of Continuance of Disability\u201d form be completed by Tumbleston and Dr. Bell. J.A. 81. On the form, Tumbleston indicated that \u201cjob stress\u201d was the \u201cinjury or sickness causing [her] disability.\u201d J.A. 81. For his part, Dr. Bell again opined that Tumbleston\u2019s condition was due to \u201cjob stress creat[ing] major depression [and] anxiety,\u201d but listed no impairments in Tumblestoris range of motion or cardiac function. J.A. 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">On August 7, 1996, Tumbleston suffered a lumbar compression fracture and was referred to Dr. Hassler, an orthopaedist, for treatment. Dr. Hassler treated Tumbleston until September 18, 1996, when she was released to be seen as needed. In October and November 1996, the Plan Administrator again requested \u201cProof of Continuance of Disability\u201d from Tumbleston, and Tumbleston again advised that she was disabled from \u201cjob stress associated with [managers].\u201d J.A. 89. Dr. Bell also remained consistent in his opinion that Tumbleston\u2019s disabling condition was the result of \u201cjob stress creating] major depression [and] anxiety\u201d and that there were no range of motion limitations. J.A. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">On February 2, 1997, Tumblestoris benefits expired under the 24-month limitation, prompting the Plan Administrator once again to request information from Dr. Bell. At this point, however, Dr. Bell completed a \u201cPhysical Capacities\u201d assessment indicating, for the first time, and in sharp contrast to his earlier reports, that Tumbleston had significant physical limitations presumably resulting from her compression fracture and her history of lumbosacral disc disease. The Plan Administrator, in turn, requested information from Dr. Hassler, the orthopaedist who had treated Tumbleston a few months earlier. Dr. Hassler advised that, because Tumbleston had not returned to see him 'after September 1996, he assumed that she was doing very well. In addition, Dr. Hassler completed a \u201cPhysical Capacities\u201d assessment which indicated no physical limitations or restrictions and opined that Tumbleston had \u201cno permanent partial disability\u201d and \u201cno restrictions for her work.\u201d J.A. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In May 1997, the Plan Administrator notified Tumbleston that her LTD benefits would not be continued beyond the 24-month limitation period based upon a determination that she \u201cwould not be considered totally disabled from a physical standpoint\u201d and that her \u201cmental/nervous limit expired effective February 3, 1997.\u201d J.A. 136. In response, Dr. Bell wrote the Plan Administrator, stating that although Tumblestoris mental disorders were her predominant problem when he responded to the Plan Administrator\u2019s earlier inquiries, Tumbleston also suffered from physical problems that added to her disability. According to Dr. Bell, \u201c[t]his was an error made by myself because she had these problems and I should have recorded them. If I had known she had a two year clause related to mental illness, I would have added these at that time.\u201d J.A. 140. Dr. Bell advised that he felt Tumbleston was totally and permanently disabled from \u201cthe summation of all [her] medical prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>lems.\u201d J.A. 141. The Plan Administrator treated Dr. Bell\u2019s letter as an appeal and upheld the denial. Tumbleston then initiated this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. See Ellis v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir.1997). However, because the Plan gives the Plan Administrator discretionary authority to construe the terms of the Plan and determine Tumbleston\u2019s eligibility for benefits, we review the Plan Administrator\u2019s decision to deny continued LTD benefits for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Under this standard, the Plan Administrator\u2019s decision will not be disturbed if it is reasonable, even if this court would have come to a different conclusion independently. <em>See Feder v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>228 F.3d 518, 522 (4th Cir.2000). \u201c[A] decision is reasonable if it is the result of a deliberate, principled reasoning process and if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 232 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Plan gives discretion to an administrator or fiduciary who is operating under a conflict of interest, however, we must also weigh that conflict \u201cin determining whether there [has been] an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Firestone, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948; <em>see Booth v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>201 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000). We reduce the amount of deference given to the fiduciary\u2019s decision and determine, based on review of the record before the fiduciary at the time of decision-making, whether the fiduciary\u2019s decision is consistent with a decision that might have been made by a fiduciary acting free of the interests that conflict with those of the beneficiaries. <em>See Ellis, </em>126 F.3d at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">In <em>Booth, </em>we assimilated the criteria for determining the reasonableness of a fiduciary\u2019s decision, concluding that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3P\">may consider, but is not limited to, such factors as: (1) the language of the plan; (2) the purposes and goals of the plan; (3) the adequacy of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it; (4) whether the fiduciary\u2019s interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan; (5) whether the decision-making process was reasoned and principled; (6) whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of ERISA; (7) any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion; and (8) the fiduciary\u2019s motives and any conflict of interest it may have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-13\"><em>Booth, </em>201 F.3d at 342-43. In this case, the district court carefully applied these criteria and concluded that the Plan Administrator\u2019s decision to terminate Tumbleston\u2019s LTD benefits was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the court denied Tumbleston\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Smith\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">On appeal, Tumbleston raises two primary challenges to the district court\u2019s ruling. First, Tumbleston asserts that the nervous or mental disease limitation in the Plan is ambiguous as applied to her LTD claim and that the limitation should not be applied to her because her disability involves a combination of physical and mental conditions. Second, Tumbleston argues that the Plan Administrator violated its fiduciary duty to her and abused its discretion by classifying her disability as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201c[c]aused by a nervous or mental disease,\u201d J.A. 34, and limiting her benefits to 24 months without clearly informing her of this classification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We have considered Tumbleston\u2019s arguments on appeal and find no error in the district court\u2019s disposition. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order primarily upon its reasoning. <em>See Tumbleston v. A.O. Smith Corp., </em>No. 4:99-1297-23BF (D.S.C. filed Feb. 23, 2001) (J.A. 147). We address below only those portions of Tumbleston\u2019s appellate arguments that require some elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">We begin with Tumbleston\u2019s contention that the \u201cnervous or mental\u201d limitation of the Plan is ambiguous as applied to her claim. Specifically, Tumbleston asserts that it is unclear whether the \u201cnervous or mental\u201d disease limitation applies solely to disabilities caused by \u201cnervous or mental\u201d diseases, or whether it also applies to disabilities caused by a combination of physical and mental health conditions. She seeks a narrow interpretation of the limitation, which would render it inapplicable to disabilities that have both physical and mental causes, and contends that she falls outside its parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Tumbleston\u2019s argument, however, misses the mark. Tumbleston ceased aefive employment with Smith following a conflict with her supervisor. She was awarded LTD benefits based upon reports offered by herself and her family physician, confirmed in substance by her treating psychiatrist and an independent psychologist, that she was disabled solely as a result of the severe depression and anxiety caused at least in part by her interpersonal conflicts with others. For nearly two years, the nature of Tumbleston\u2019s disability was repeatedly confirmed by both Dr. Bell and Tumbleston herself to be a result of her major depression and anxiety. We have no trouble accepting that the common and ordinary meaning of \u201cnervous or mental disease\u201d would encompass Tumbleston\u2019s diagnoses of depression and anxiety, <em>see e.g., Brewer v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>921 F.2d 150, 154 (8th Cir.1990); <em>Lynd v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>94 F.3d 979, 983-84 (5th Cir.1996), and that it was reasonable to conclude that Tumbleston was permanently disabled solely as result of her nervous or mental diseases. Accordingly, we conclude that the Plan\u2019s \u201cnervous or mental\u201d limitation is not ambiguous as applied to Tumbleston\u2019s condition and that the Plan Administrator did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the provision applied to Tumbleston\u2019s claim for benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">We are likewise unpersuaded by Tumbleston\u2019s argument that the Plan Ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ministrator breached its fiduciary duty and abused its discretion by not sufficiently informing her that it was classifying her disability as having been caused by a nervous or mental disease. Specifically, Tumbleston asserts that the Plan Administrator classified her disability as being \u201cnervous or mental\u201d in nature in order to thwart and limit her benefits, that she was never made aware that the Plan Administrator classified her disability as being caused by a nervous or mental disease and, indeed, that \u201cto the best of [her] knowledge [she] was never told and [she] never understood that [she] had a mental disease.\u201d J.A. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Having reviewed the administrative record, we are unpersuaded. Tumbleston\u2019s initial claim for disability, accompanied by medical support from Dr. Bell, refers only to an alleged disability arising from her depression and anxiety and, in particular, her inability to successfully engage in the interpersonal relationships required in her position. There is at best a perfunctory reference by Dr. Bell to <em>diagnoses </em>of physical conditions in the section of the claim form requesting such information, but there is no reference to a physical <em>disability, </em>existing either alone or in combination with Tumbleston\u2019s disabling mental conditions. Based upon the information submitted by Tumbleston, the Plan Administrator notified Tumbleston that her claim for LTD benefits was being approved. The Plan clearly states that disability claims for nervous and mental diseases are limited to two years, and Tumbleston was made aware at the time her claim was accepted that her benefits were scheduled to terminate after 24 months. At no time thereafter did Tumbleston seek or obtain benefits in whole or in part for a physical disability resulting from her lumbosacral disc disease or any other physical malady. In every update requested and received by the Plan Administrator thereafter, Tumbleston and Dr. Bell both held firm in their opinion that Tumbleston\u2019s disability was related to her depression and anxiety, and Dr. Bell held firm in his opinion that Tumbleston had no physical limitations or restrictions even after she was released from the care of her orthopaedist.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In sum, Tumbleston\u2019s argument fails on two levels. First, the record is utterly devoid of any indication that the Plan Administrator tried to improperly limit her benefits by classifying Tumbleston\u2019s claim as one for disability resulting from a nervous or mental condition, as opposed to a physical disability, or tried to hide that classification from Tumbleston. On the contrary, Tumbleston and her family physician classified her disability as resulting from major depression and anxiety from the outset, and we see no indication that her claim should have been interpreted as one arising from anything other than her nervous or mental diagnoses. Second, we find no abuse of discretion in the Plan Administrator\u2019s determination, rendered at the conclusion of the 2A-month period and based upon the reports of Drs. Bell and Hassler, that Tumbleston had failed to demonstrate that she was totally and permanently disabled as a result of her physical maladies alone. <em>See Booth, </em>201 F.3d at 345 (\u201c[I]t is not an abuse of discretion for a plan fiduciary to deny benefits where conflicting medical reports were presented.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">To conclude, we agree with the district court\u2019s determination that the Plan Administrator did not abuse its discretion by terminating Tumbleston\u2019s LTD benefits under the provisions of the Plan which limit such benefits to 24 months in circumstances such as these. The Plan provides that LTD benefits for a \u201cnervous or mental\u201d disease are limited to a 24-month period. Tumbleston was found to be totally disabled from \u201cmajor depression and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>anxiety\u201d arising from \u201cjob stress\u201d and an inability to successfully engage in interpersonal relationships necessary to perform her employment duties, conditions which fall easily within the ordinary meaning of a \u201cnervous or mental disease,\u201d and Tumbleston drew LTD benefits for the entire 24-month period. After the 24 months had passed, the Plan Administrator reasonably concluded that Tumbleston had not demonstrated that she was physically disabled from \u201cperforming any and every duty of every occupation for which [she was] qualified,\u201d J.A. 37, and denied her claim for continued benefits. Applying the modified abuse of discretion standard to the record before us, we are satisfied that the Plan Administrator\u2019s denial of LTD benefits was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\">. Because Provident acted on Smith's behalf, we refer to the two together as the \"Plan Administrator. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-8\">. Tumbleston's complaint does not contain a separate cause of action for breach of fiduciary duly. Rather, this argument appears to be offered as purported evidence of the Plan Administrator\u2019s motives and of the conflict of interest \u2014 factors which are to be weighed in determining whether the Plan Administrator abused its discretion in interpreting and applying the nervous or mental limitation to Tumbleston's claim for LTD benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\">. Tumbleston relies heavily upon the decision in <em>Cothran v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>No. 99-1238, 1999 WL 1092644 (4th Cir. Dec.3, 1999), which Tumbleston argues is \"strikingly similar\u201d to her facts. The district court disagreed, and so do we. In particular, we are satisfied that the nervous or mental limitation in Smith's LTD Plan is not ambiguous as applied to Tumbleston's disabling conditions. In addition, we note that under our internal rules, unpublished opinions are not precedential. Indeed, \"[i]n the absence of unusual circumstances,\u201d we are bound as a court \u201cnot [to] cite an unpublished disposition in any of [our] published opinions or unpublished dispositions.\u201d Local Rule 36(c). No such unusual circumstances are present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
