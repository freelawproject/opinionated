White had a history of photographing employees of the City of Hartford (City) in activities White thought were inappropriate or an abuse of power. After White photographed John C. Scarbrough, the Street and Water Superintendent, removing a political sign critical of the Mayor from private property, Scarbrough verbally and physically attacked White. When White\u2019s wife, Mary S. White, attempted to intervene, Scarbrough threw her against a wall. Because the Whites believed Scarbrough was acting in his official capacity by removing a sign that he considered to be a hazard to pedestrians with the assistance of a City backhoe, the Whites sued Scarbrough and the City for violating their civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> granted partial summary judgment in favor of the City, finding that there was no unconstitutional custom or policy that caused the Whites\u2019 injuries. The Whites settled their suit against Scarbrough individually, but the Whites appeal the grant of summary judgment to the City. Having reviewed the record de novo and considered the facts and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the Whites, we conclude the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the City. <em>See Riedl v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>248 F.3d 753, 756 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-17\">We conclude the Whites failed to show the City had an unconstitutional custom or policy that caused their injuries. <em>See Spencer v. Knapheide Truck Equip. Co., </em>183 F.3d 902, 905 (8th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1157, 120 S.Ct. 1165, 145 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2000). The City has a written policy preventing City employees from abusing the public but no policy preventing photography of City employees. Assuming without deciding that the City\u2019s earlier warning and arrest (but not prosecution) of White for harassment create a policy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>preventing White\u2019s civic photography, Scarbrough\u2019s assault is a departure from the earlier lawful preventative action. <em>Springdale Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Springdale Sch. Dist., </em>133 F.3d 649, 651-52 (8th Cir.1998). Thus the Whites\u2019 injuries were not caused by the City\u2019s antiphotography policy. Further, the Whites do not assert that the City\u2019s antiphotography policy is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-15\"> The Honorable Robert T.
