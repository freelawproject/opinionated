The plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated a collective bargaining agreement by failing to abide by the agreement\u2019s recall provisions and in its handling of his grievances against his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-25\">On February 28, 2001, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be granted. The magistrate judge decided that the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from pursuing his ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims because they rely upon issues that were decided against the plaintiff in an unsuccessful earlier action against his employer. <em>See Jefferies [sic] v. United Tech. Corp., Sikorsky Aircraft Div., </em>Civ. No. 3:97CV1344 (DJS) (D.Conn. Aug. 12, 1999). The magistrate judge also concluded that the plaintiffs action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 fails because the plaintiff has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>submitted evidence showing that the defendant was acting under color of state law. The district court endorsed the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, and entered judgment against the plaintiff on April 20, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">We conclude from our review of the record that the magistrate judge correctly decided that the plaintiff is collaterally estopped from pursuing his claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because of the finding in <em>Sikorsky </em>that the plaintiff was not disabled within the meaning of either of these acts. For a party to be collaterally estopped from raising an issue, there must have been a prior proceeding in which the party had a full and fair opportunity to litigate, and which involved an issue that (1) was identical to the issue in the current proceeding, (2) was actually litigated and decided, and (3) was necessary to support a valid and final judgment on the merits. <em>Flaherty v. Lang, </em>199 F.3d 607, 613 (2d Cir.1999). The <em>Sikorsky </em>proceeding meets these requirements. Moreover, identity of both parties is not an element of collateral estoppel, and thus the plaintiff is incorrect in his argument that he may re-litigate the issue of his disability based on the fact that <em>Sikorsky </em>involved a different defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We also find without merit the plaintiffs argument that he may re-litigate the issue of his disability based on the presentation of allegedly new evidence. Although the discovery of \u201csignificant new evidence\u201d can overcome the preclusive effect of a prior preceding, <em>see Khandhar v. Efenbein, </em>943 F.2d 244, 249 (2d Cir.1991), the EEOC guidelines concerning disability to which the plaintiff refers are not evidence at all. Rather, they are legal authority, codified at 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2, and they were fully available to the court in <em>Sikorsky. </em>Similarly, we reject the plaintiffs argument that summary judgment was premature because the plaintiff had not yet obtained the affidavit of a union officer. The plaintiff has not shown that the officer\u2019s testimony would have borne on the issue of his disability, and thus has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his inability to obtain the officer\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We also agree with the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 must fail because the defendant is not a state actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Finally, we acknowledge that the plaintiffs statements in his complaint regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to protect his rights and pursue his claims against his employer under the collective bargaining agreement could be read as an allegation that the defendant breached its duty of fair representation in violation of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(a). However, the plaintiff conceded at oral argument that he failed to give notice of his desire to be recalled after his layoff within the six-month period required by the collective bargaining agreement. Consequently, there was no timely claim under the collective bargaining agreement for the defendant to pursue on the plaintiffs behalf, and the plaintiff lacks a factual basis for his allegation of breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
