Demotsis also seeks to file a pro se supplemental brief raising additional issues. Although we grant Demotsis\u2019 motion to file a supplemental brief and accompanying materials and have considered his arguments therein, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Demotsis\u2019 assignments of error on appeal turn on the fact that the indictment returned against him erroneously describes methamphetamine as a Schedule III controlled substance rather than a Schedule II controlled substance. Based upon this misidentification of methamphetamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, Demotsis contends he was only eligible for the five-year statutory-maximum of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D). Because this claim was not raised in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">We find Demotsis\u2019 arguments meritless. First, we conclude the misidentification of the proper schedule for methamphetamine is harmless error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(3). <em>See United States v. Greenwood, </em>974 F.2d 1449, 1472-73 (5th Cir.1992). Second, Demotsis cannot argue he was mislead by this misidentification, as the description of the statutory penalties in his plea agreement make it clearly evident that Demotsis knowingly subjected himself to sentencing for manufacture of a Schedule II controlled substance. As a result, because Demotsis was properly subject to the twenty-year statutory maximum of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for Schedule II controlled substances, despite the error in his indictment, his 136 month sentence does not implicate <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, Phifer v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001). We therefore find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm Demotsis\u2019 conviction and sentence, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
