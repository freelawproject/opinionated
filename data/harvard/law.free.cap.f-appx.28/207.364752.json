(collectively, \u201cBlock\u201d), a competing tax preparation service provider, alleging that Block had engaged in false and deceptive advertising in connection with its offering of a new loan product during the 2000 tax season in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111-1127 (West 1998 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000) (the \u201cAct\u201d). Following a bench trial, the district court awarded Liberty $506,477 in Block\u2019s profits, plus $314,898.69 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The court additionally enjoined Block from engaging in certain advertising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>practices. In this consolidated appeal, Block challenges (a) the court\u2019s finding that Block acted willfully; (b) the court\u2019s finding of materiality; (c) the court\u2019s award of profits; (d) a portion of the court\u2019s injunctive relief; and (e) a portion of the court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">For a fee, Block, a leading tax preparation service provider, enables taxpayers to file their tax returns electronically, and thus to receive their actual tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) within approximately two weeks. Block also offers a product termed a \u201crefund anticipation loan\u201d (\u201cRAL\u201d), which enables taxpayers to obtain, through Block\u2019s partnered lending institutions, short-term loans against the anticipated amounts of their tax refunds within approximately two days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> RALs require the fulfillment of certain conditions and subject borrowers to certain obligations that tax refunds do not. Taxpayers seeking RALs, for example, must endure a loan application process requiring extensive certifications and declarations, including those regarding past bankruptcies and current outstanding debts. RAL borrowers also may be subjected to collection costs and attorneys\u2019 fees where their actual tax refunds are insufficient to cover the amounts of their corresponding loans. In addition, RAL borrowers must agree to \u201ccross-collection\u201d of delinquent loans from other banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Block has experienced difficulties in marketing the RAL product. Several states sued Block in the 1990s for engaging in deceptive advertising by concealing the fact that RALs were loans. In July 1993, for instance, Block signed a consent decree with the state of Connecticut under which it agreed not to misrepresent loans as refunds or to use the term \u201crapid refund\u201d to describe RALs. Block entered into similar agreements with the states of Florida and New York in January 1994 and January 1997, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">During the 2000 tax season, Block offered a slightly modified loan product, a \u201cno additional cost refund anticipation loan\u201d (\u201cNACRAL\u201d), in selected areas across the country. Unlike traditional RALs, NACRALs feature no interest and no fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> NACRALs, however, are identical to RALs in every other respect: they required the submission of loan applications and the making of significant certifications, and they expose borrowers to potential collection costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, and cross-collection efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Block identified the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, where it owned and operated approximately thirty-one offices, as a primary target market for the roll-out of the NACRAL product during the 2000 tax season. Liberty, a company theretofore operating approximately thirty-five offices in the United States, had no offices in the Hampton Roads area as of the 1999 tax season, but launched twenty-five new offices there in a heavily publicized effort prior to the 2000 tax season.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">Notwithstanding its earlier legal troubles arising from the marketing of RALs as \u201crefunds,\u201d Block advertised the NA-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>ORAL in Hampton Roads through posters, newspapers, radio and television commercials, and direct mailings as a \u201crefund,\u201d \u201crefund amount,\u201d and \u201ca check in the amount of your refund.\u201d Block undertook these efforts in the face of an IRS Revenue Procedure (\u201cPublication 1345\u201d) requiring tax preparation service providers, in advertising RALs, to make \u201cclear in the advertising that the taxpayer is borrowing against the anticipated refund and not obtaining the refund itself from the financial institution.\u201d IRS Pub. 1345, \u00a7 12.09, Rev. Proc. 98-50, 1998 WL 638827. None of Block\u2019s Hampton Roads NACRAL advertisements complied with Publication 1345.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Block\u2019s Hampton Roads NACRAL marketing campaign was a resounding success. The number of returns Block processed in that area jumped 24.8% from 1999 to the year 2000, whereas the number of returns Block processed in other areas of Virginia increased only 0.8% during the same period. The evidence shows that Liberty, meanwhile, struggled to keep pace with Block, at times offering free tax preparation services in an effort to compete.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">On June 14, 2000, Liberty filed an amended complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that Block had engaged in false and misleading advertising in violation of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). Following a bench trial, the district court, Judge Jackson found one of Block\u2019s advertisements to be literally false, deemed several others true but misleading, and found still others non-actionable. <em>See JTH Tax, Inc. v. H &amp; R Block Eastern, Tax Services, Inc., </em>128 F.Supp.2d 926, 935-37 (E.D.Va.2001). The court also found that Block had acted \u201cwillfully, maliciously, and in bad faith,\u201d reasoning that Block was aware of the prohibition embodied in Publication 1345 against advertising loans as refunds when it executed its 2000 Hampton Roads marketing campaign; Block\u2019s agreements with the states of Connecticut, Florida, and New York made clear that Block specifically had been placed on notice that representing loans as refunds was deceptive and improper; Block deliberately targeted Liberty, a newcomer to the Hampton Roads market, with its deceptive advertising campaign; and an internal Block \u201cRapid Refund Awareness Study,\u201d favoring the use of the word \u201crefund\u201d over the use of the word \u201cloan,\u201d indicated an \u201cabsence of mistake\u201d on Block\u2019s part regarding the effect of the use of the term \u201crefund\u201d on consumers. <em>See id. </em>at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Finding the evidence insufficient to support an award of Liberty\u2019s actual damages, the court instead awarded Liberty $506,477 in Block\u2019s profits. The court also awarded Liberty $314,898.69 in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, including $38,619.50 in fees and $2,730.20 in costs that Liberty had paid to a law firm that Block argued had violated the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct by representing Liberty in the instant litigation. The court additionally enjoined Block from advertising in violation of Publication 1345; referring to loan disbursements as \u201cadvances,\u201d \u201crefund amounts,\u201d or checks \u201cin the amount of your refund,\u201d unless Block makes clear that the product is a loan; and using the term \u201crapid refund\u201d in connection with loan products. Block now challenges several aspects of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Block first challenges the district court\u2019s factual finding that Block acted with malice, asserting that none of the court\u2019s subsidiary findings properly supports an inference that Block acted willfully. As noted above, the district court found that (1) the consent decrees are competent evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Block\u2019s prior knowledge that representing a NACRAL as a refund would be unlawful; (2) Block\u2019s failure to comply with Publication 1345 evidences deliberate misconduct; (3) the circumstances surrounding Liberty\u2019s heavily publicized entry into the Hampton Roads market and Block\u2019s targeted NACRAL campaign demonstrate that Block deliberately targeted Liberty; and (4) the internal Block report indicates \u201can absence of mistake\u201d concerning the effect on consumers of the use of the word \u201crefund\u201d to describe loan products. We conclude that the former two findings alone sufficiently support the district court\u2019s finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It is well established that a trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). \u201c[A] finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Block 'disputes the district court\u2019s use of the consent decrees to infer that it willfully engaged in false and misleading advertising. Block first points out that it never suffered an adverse adjudication concerning its RAL advertising practices. Block additionally argues that the consent decrees, which were borne of concern regarding Block\u2019s advertising of interest\u2014 bearing RALs, cannot serve as the basis for the conclusion that Block deliberately engaged in false and misleading advertising of NACRALs, because by extracting interest and bank fees from the traditional RAL product in the process of creating the NACRAL product, Block actually eliminated the concerns that gave rise to, and are embodied in, the consent decrees. We find these contentions unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">An attentive reading of each consent decree reveals a shared, simply described purpose: to halt Block\u2019s practice of misrepresenting loans as refunds. The foundational provisions of each decree evince a general concern, not only for protecting consumers from unwittingly incurring interest and bank fees, but for protecting consumers generally from unknowingly subjecting themselves to the full complement of detriments and obligations endemic to loan transactions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A number of the decrees\u2019 more specific provisions likewise reflect a concern for ensuring that the disclosure of RALs\u2019 loan characteristics other than the charging of interest and traditional bank fees would occur.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>bottom, this concern reflects a recognition that insufficient disclosure of these non-interest, non-fee characteristics threatens the welfare of consumers and the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">It is plain that NACRALs, identical as they are to RALs in all respects save the charging of interest and other traditional bank fees, pose the same threat to consumers and the marketplace, at least insofar as the RALs\u2019 and NACRALs\u2019 shared characteristics are concerned. It is equally plain that Block, in modifying its RAL product to create the NACRAL product, failed to eliminate all of the concerns animating the consent decrees. Thus, the fact that Block advertised NACRALs as \u201crefunds,\u201d \u201crefund amounts,\u201d and checks \u201cin the amount of your refund\u201d on the heels of its repeated representations by way of the consent decrees that it would no longer misrepresent loan products as refunds amply supports the district court\u2019s conclusion that Block conducted its NA-CRAL advertising campaign in bad faith. The fact that no prior judgment was entered against Block is simply irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Block\u2019s contention that the district court erroneously relied on Block\u2019s failure to comply with Publication 1345 fails for strikingly similar reasons. Block\u2019s primary contention is that Publication 1345 aims solely at prohibiting e-file providers from misrepresenting interest \u2014 bearing loans as refunds. Because, according to Block, it believed that NACRALs, which do not bear interest, did not constitute RALs for purposes of the requirements of Publication 1345, that regulation cannot possibly serve as a basis for a finding that Block intentionally misled potential NACRAL consumers by advertising them as \u201crefunds,\u201d \u201crefund amounts,\u201d and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Publication 1345 in relevant part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-10\"><em>A Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL) is money borrowed by the taxpayer from a lender based on the taxpayer\u2019s anticipated refund amount. </em>... All parties to RAL agreements, including [providers such as Block], must ensure that taxpayers understand that RALs are interest bearing loans and not substitutes for a faster way of receiving refunds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">In advertising the availability of a RAL, an Authorized <em>e-file </em>Provider and a financial institution must clearly (and, if applicable in easily readable print) refer to or describe the funds being advanced as a <em>loan, not a refund; </em>that is, it must be made clear in the advertising that the taxpayer is <em>borrowing against the anticipated refund and not obtaining the refund itself from the financial institution.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">IRS Pub. 1345, Ch. 3 &amp; \u00a7 12.09, Rev. Proc. 98-50, 1998 WL 638827. (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Although Publication 1345 at one point refers to RALs as \u201cinterest bearing loans,\u201d the first portion of the regulation clearly provides a baseline definition under which the charging of interest is neither a necessary nor a sufficient component. In defining RALS as \u201cmoney borrowed by the taxpayer from a lender based on the taxpayer\u2019s anticipated refund amount,\u201d the IRS clearly brought NACRALs and other similar products within the regulation\u2019s ambit. Moreover, by making no mention of interest in the more affirmative provisions concerning the manner in which e-file providers must advertise RALs, Publication 1345 evinces a broad purpose to prohibit e-file providers from blurring the lines between loans and refunds, irrespective of whether the loans at issue require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the payment of interest. Because the reach of Publication 1345 extends beyond mere interest \u2014 bearing loans to those, such as NACRALs, involving short-term borrowing against taxpayers\u2019 anticipated refunds but no interest charges, it was more than reasonable for the district court to find that Block\u2019s NACRAL advertisements, which were disseminated in violation of the strictures of Publication 1345, revealed a deliberate intent to mislead consumers and unfairly compete in the marketplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In view of Block\u2019s history of affirmatively representing in multiple state consent decrees that it would refrain from advertising RAL products in a misleading manner; the public nature of the provisions set forth in Publication 1345, requiring Block to do the same; the largely identical character of the RAL and NACRAL products; and the nature of Block\u2019s 2000 Hampton Roads NACRAL advertising campaign, we have little trouble concluding that the district court\u2019s conclusion that Block acted maliciously, willfully, deliberately, and in bad faith in conducting that advertising campaign was more than reasonable. In so concluding, we are ever mindful that the district court\u2019s conclusion need only be \u201cplausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Anderson, supra, </em>470 U.S. at 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504. Upon a thorough review of the record before us, we cannot fairly say that the court\u2019s conclusion was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Block next challenges the district court\u2019s factual finding of materiality. To recover under the Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate, inter alia, that the false or misleading advertisements at issue were \u201cmaterial\u201d in that they were \u201clikely to influence the purchasing decision.\u201d <em>See United Indus. Corp. v. Clorox Co., </em>140 F.3d 1175, 1180 (8th Cir.1998); J. Thomas McCarthy, 4 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a7 27:35 (4th Ed.2001). The district court rejected Block\u2019s argument that because the NACRAL includes no interest or fees, the deception involved in advertising a NACRAL as a \u201crefund,\u201d \u201crefund amount,\u201d or a check in \u201cthe amount of your refund\u201d is immaterial. The court first found that Liberty had presented probative evidence that NACRALs entail several unattractive features associated with loans. The court then found that Liberty\u2019s marketing expert, Dr. Myron Glassman (\u201cDr.Glassman\u201d), offered probative causality evidence by way of a consumer survey. The court pointed out that 21.7% of those surveyed under Dr. Glassman\u2019s direction indicated that use of the phrase \u201crefund amount\u201d would be more effective than use of the term \u201cloan,\u201d precisely because the former language communicated the impression that the product advertised was not a loan. From this evidence, the court drew the \u201cclear inference\u201d that the deception was material in that consumers prefer a refund over any type of loan product, including a NACRAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Block essentially challenges Dr. Glass-man\u2019s survey as being irrelevant. The fatal flaw, according to Block, is that the survey failed to alert its respondents to those characteristics that NACRALs and RALs do not share, i.e., the fact that no interest or bank fees are charged in conjunction with a NACRAL. We disagree and conclude that while Dr. Glassman\u2019s survey could have been designed more precisely, the survey\u2019s results are sufficient to establish that representing a loan product as a \u201crefund amount\u201d would affect a reasonable consumer\u2019s purchasing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The survey tends to show that consumers associate loans with a bundle of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>unfavorable conditions and obligations, many of which have nothing to do with the payment of interest. It thus was reasonable for the district court to find that using terms such as \u201crefund\u201d or \u201crefund amount\u201d to advertise a non-interest \u2014 bearing loan such as a NACRAL would affect a reasonable consumer\u2019s decision making process. Although Block\u2019s view of the evidence on this point is reasonable, where, as here, \u201cthere are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d Scr<em>imgeour v. Internal Revenue, </em>149 F.3d 318, 324 (4th Cir.1998). In short, one of at least two permissible views of Dr. Glassman\u2019s survey supports the conclusion that Block\u2019s misrepresentation of NACRALs is material to consumers\u2019 purchasing decisions. The court\u2019s reliance on Dr. Glassman\u2019s survey therefore was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Block raises numerous challenges to the district court\u2019s $506,477 award of Block\u2019s profits, two of which merit attention here. First, Block disputes the court\u2019s use of its gross revenues rather than its net profits to calculate the award, notwithstanding the introduction of competent evidence as to Block\u2019s costs. Second, Block maintains that the court erred in neglecting to reduce future profits to present value. On both scores, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Act provides that a prevailing plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity, to recover (1) defendant\u2019s profits, (2) any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and (3) the costs of the action.... In assessing profits the plaintiff shall be required to prove defendant\u2019s sales only; defendant must prove all elements of cost or deduction claimed.... If the court shall find that the amount of the recovery based on profits is either inadequate or excessive the court may in its discretion enter judgment for such sum as the court shall find to be just, according to the circumstances of the case. Such sum in either of the above circumstances shall constitute compensation and not a penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1117(a) (West 1998 &amp; Supp. 2000). An award of profits under the Act is committed to the discretion of the district court; we therefore review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Pebble Beach Co. v. Tour 18 I Ltd., </em>155 F.3d 526, 554 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">The district court found that during the 2000 tax season Block increased by 24.8% the number of returns it processed in Hampton Roads, in contrast to a 0.8% increase in those areas of Virginia where Block refrained from running its false and misleading ads. The court thus found that Block\u2019s NACRAL campaign was a success in that it provided an increased client base for future tax preparation services and increased cross-marketing opportunities for its mortgage and financial services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Relying on expert testimony, the court concluded that, excluding the 0.8% increase in customers in non-NACRAL areas of Virginia, Block serviced an additional 9,446 returns as a result of its false and misleading ads.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Excluding the presence of other potential injured parties as unsupported by Block\u2019s evidence, the court determined that the relevant sphere of Block competitors included seventy Jackson Hewitt of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>fices and seventeen Liberty offices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court then used its \u201cequitable discretion\u201d to quantify Liberty\u2019s market share at 18%, resulting in a determination that Block had improperly obtained 1,700 taxpayer returns vis-a-vis Liberty. Using an \u201caverage fee per client\u201d of $83.22, the court calculated Block\u2019s immediate gains at $141,474.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Seizing upon an expert\u2019s report indicating that nearly 43% of Block\u2019s tax clients showed an interest in additional services, the court used this figure as an \u201cequitable proxy\u201d for that percentage of the 1,700 clients Block had improperly obtained vis-a-vis Liberty that would use Block\u2019s services in the future. Thus, the court found that 731 of Block\u2019s unjustly obtained clients would remain Block clients in future years. Relying again on an expert report indicating that the \u201caverage retention of a client\u201d is six years, the court determined that Block effectively would be enriched by an amount equal to the product of Block\u2019s \u201caverage fee per client\u201d and the number of long-term clients improperly retained, 731, over a period extending six years beyond the 2000 tax season. The court thus concluded that Block would pocket an additional $365,003 in profits over that six-year period. Combining this quantum of profits with the $141,474 in profits attributable to the 2000 tax season, the court awarded Liberty $506,477 in Block\u2019s profits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The plain language of the Act clearly indicates that a defendant\u2019s \u201cprofits\u201d are to be calculated by reducing the amount of the defendant\u2019s \u201csales\u201d by appropriate \u201celements of cost or deduction,\u201d so long as the defendant proves those elements. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1117(a). One of Block\u2019s experts testified that for the ten month period ending on February 29, 2000, Block earned average revenues per tax return in the amount of $95.92; its per return costs came to $67.85; and the resulting net earnings per return amounted to $28.07. (J.A. at 594-96, 1234.) The district court, while purporting to enter an award of Block\u2019s \u201cprofits,\u201d inexplicably neglected to address Block\u2019s evidence of costs, awarding Block\u2019s gross revenues instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">While the district court had the discretion under the Act to enter judgment for a sum it deemed just if it found under the circumstances that an award of Block\u2019s profits was \u201cinadequate,\u201d there is no indication that this is what the court did. Rather, it appears that the court simply erred in applying the terms of the Act and its own formula. We therefore hold that the court abused its discretion in awarding Block\u2019s profits insofar as it failed to consider evidence of Block\u2019s costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">Block also contends that the district court erred in failing to reduce to present value the portion of its award attributable to profits the court projected Block would earn over the six-year period following the 2000 tax season. It is well established that \u201cdamages awards in suits governed by federal law should be based on present value.\u201d <em>St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co. v. Dickerson, </em>470 U.S. 409, 412, 105 S.Ct. 1347, 84 L.Ed.2d 303 (1985); <em>see also Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. v. Pfeifer, </em>462 U.S. 523, 536-37, 103 S.Ct. 2541, 76 L.Ed.2d 768 (1983) (where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>interest safely may be earned upon the amount awarded to an injured party, the ascertained future benefits should be discounted to their present value). Here, the court failed to discount that portion of the award attributable to Block\u2019s future profits. Absent a finding that a conventional award of Block\u2019s future profits \u2014 i.e., one that reduced such profits to present value \u2014 was inadequate, the award constituted a windfall to Liberty and unnecessarily penalized Block. We therefore additionally hold that the court\u2019s failure to consider the effect of the time value of money on the portion of its award attributable to profits Block was projected to earn in future years was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">In accordance with the foregoing, we vacate the award of profits and remand for recalculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Block also maintains that the injunction entered against it is overbroad insofar as it enjoins the use of its \u201crapid refund\u201d mark. We agree and reverse that portion of the court\u2019s order. The Act vests district courts with the \u201cpower to grant injunctions, according to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court may deem reasonable, to ... prevent a violation under [\u00a7 1125(a) ].\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1116(a) (West 1998 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2000). It is well established, however, \u201cthat the essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power to grant relief no broader than necessary to cure the effects of the harm caused by the violation.\u201d <em>Forschner Group v. Arrow Trading Co., </em>124 F.3d 402, 406 (2d Cir.1997); <em>see also ALPO Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., </em>913 F.2d 958, 972 (D.C.Cir.1990), <em>costs/fees proceeding, on remand, </em>778 F.Supp. 555 (D.D.C.1991), <em>amended, </em>1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17326 (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 1991), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, remanded, </em>997 F.2d 949 (D.C.Cir.1993) (\u201cThe law requires that courts closely tailor injunctions to the harm that they address.\u201d); <em>see generally, </em>4 McCarthy \u00a7 30:3 (discussing the tailoring of an injunction to the specific case).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">We conclude that the injunction against the use of the \u201crapid refund\u201d mark exceeds the court\u2019s power to fashion an effective remedy. In enjoining certain of Block\u2019s advertising practices, the district court ostensibly sought to prohibit it from misleading consumers to believe that NACRALs are something other than loans. The first two prongs of the injunctive relief awarded in the district court adequately address this goal by prohibiting Block from advertising in violation of Publication 1345, and from using specified phrases, such as \u201crefund amount,\u201d without clearly informing the consumer that the advertised product is in fact a loan. In the context of this case, there is nothing intrinsically harmful about the \u201crapid refund\u201d mark itself that is not otherwise addressed in the first two prongs of injunctive relief. <em>See JTH Tax, Inc., </em>128 F.Supp.2d at 952 (granting three forms of injunctive relief). Consequently, redressing the harm that Block\u2019s false and misleading advertising has caused does not require a blanket prohibition on the mark\u2019s use in connection with loan products. We therefore vacate that portion of the injunctive relief prohibiting Block from using \u201cthe term or mark \u2018rapid refund\u2019 in connection with loan products, whether or not fees or interest are charged,\u201d <em>id., </em>and remand for removal of that element of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Block finally disputes a portion of the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, arguing that the court erred by ordering Block to pay to Liberty fees and costs incurred by one of Liberty\u2019s law firms that eventually withdrew from representation after a dispute arose concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>whether or not the firm had violated the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For reasons discussed briefly below, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Block argues that the representation Willcox &amp; Savage (\u201cWillcox\u201d) provided to Liberty in this case violated the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct, thereby making an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs improper. We disagree. In 1994, Willcox represented Block in a matter involving claims of false advertising of tax preparation services under the Act. As a result, Block contends, Willcox\u2019s representation of Liberty in the instant matter violated Rule 1.9(a) of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the pendency of the instant action, Willcox also was counsel of record for Block in a Virginia state court matter that remained on the court\u2019s docket despite the fact that no filing or pleading had been received from the plaintiffs for a lengthy period. Block thus maintains that Willcox\u2019s representation of Liberty independently violated Rule 1.7(a) of the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Block therefore argues that the portion of the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees attributable to Willcox\u2019s services is improper and should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The district court found that Block was not an \u201cexisting client\u201d of Willcox within the meaning of Rule 1.7(a), reasoning that the matter had been sufficiently dormant to make Willcox\u2019s duties to Block purely \u201cministerial.\u201d (J.A. at 1500-01.) The court also found, however, that the false advertising matter in which Willcox previously had represented Block was \u201csubstantially related\u201d to the instant litigation, concluding that Willcox\u2019s current representation of Liberty therefore violated Rule 1.9(a). Nonetheless, the court concluded that Block had suffered no prejudice, and thus that no equitable remedy should be had. Instead, the court held, \u201cthe appropriate remedy is for [Block] to refer [Willcox] to the Virginia State Bar for its violation of Rule 1.9(a).\u201d (J.A. at 1499.) In the court\u2019s view, this approach \u201cserve[d] the Lanham Act\u2019s goal of deterrence as well as the disciplinary goals of Virginia\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">Relying on <em>Image Technical Serv., Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>136 F.3d 1354 (9th Cir.1998), Block argues on appeal that because Willcox breached its duty of loyalty to Block in its representation of Liberty, it was reversible error to award Liberty fees and costs attributable to Willcox\u2019s representation. In <em>Image Technical, </em>the Coudert Brothers law firm represented the plaintiff, Image Technical Service, Inc., against Kodak in an antitrust action. Kodak moved to disqualify Coudert Brothers because the firm had represented a division of Kodak in other matters, and the district court granted the motion. After the plaintiff prevailed at trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>awarded it attorneys\u2019 fees, including $400,000 for Coudert Brothers\u2019 representation. On appeal, Kodak argued that it should not be required to pay any amount to Image Technical for Coudert Brothers\u2019 representation. The Ninth Circuit held that Kodak could not be required to pay the fees of conflicted counsel for their services to the prevailing party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">[A] law firm representing the antitrust plaintiffs simultaneously represented the antitrust defendant, a clear violation of the applicable ethics rules. Image Technical is under no obligation to pay any fees to the law firm, Coudert, for its conflicted representation. Absent some representation that Image Technical, the party requesting fees, will not retain the $400,000, it stands to receive a sizeable windfall. And if Image Technical does not retain the $400,000 and pays Coudert, Coudert will receive compensation which California law says it cannot recover.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">If Coudert had breached a duty of loyalty to Image Tech only, there would be a better argument for allowing Image Tech to recover and retain the fees. The $400,000 would not be so much a windfall as recompense for conflicted representation. Here, however, it compounds injustice to allow Image Tech to receive $400,000 from Kodak, the party injured by the ethical violation. Moreover, it is less of a concern that Kodak, as the defendant potentially hable for the fees, will receive a windfall if it is not ordered to pay Image Tech the fees, because Kodak is the client injured by Coudert\u2019s breach of its duty of loyalty when it simultaneously represented Kodak and Image Tech.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>Image Technical, </em>136 F.3d at 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The primary difference between <em>Image Technical </em>and the case before us is that Liberty already has paid Willcox\u2019s fees and the costs incurred in connection with Will-cox\u2019s representation. In <em>Image Technical, </em>the plaintiff had yet to pay offending counsel its fees, and the court thus was appropriately concerned that a fee award either would provide compensation to conflicted counsel in violation of California law or bestow a sizeable windfall on the plaintiff. We face no such dilemma. Even assuming Willcox has violated one or more of Virginia\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct, the court\u2019s fee award has no bearing on the question of whether conflicted counsel will be paid for its services, for Willcox already has been paid. Neither does the fee award in this case constitute a windfall to the plaintiff, for Liberty merely seeks compensation for fees it already has parted with.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Consequently, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs here does nothing more than fairly compensate a prevailing plaintiff against a defendant found to have engaged in willful misconduct under federal law. If Block seeks a remedy for conflicted representation, that remedy is most appropriately sought by filing a complaint with the Virginia State Bar, or by filing suit against Willcox under the applicable law. For these reasons, the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Block acted willfully in violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). We also affirm the court\u2019s finding that Block\u2019s false and misleading advertisements were material to a reasonable consumer\u2019s purchasing decision. In addition, we affirm the court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We vacate the court\u2019s award of Block\u2019s profits and remand for the court to redetermine the damages to which Liberty is entitled under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). We additional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>ly vacate that portion of the injunction prohibiting Block from using \u201cthe term or mark \u2018rapid refund\u2019 in connection with loan products, whether or not fees or interest are charged,\u201d and remand for removal of that element of injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">.
