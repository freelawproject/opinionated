Walter, Judge) denying his motion to amend his amended complaint and granting the defendant Stinson\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Johnson\u2019s complaint, initially filed on August 3, 1995 and amended on October 5, 1995, alleges that Stinson, superintendent of the Great Meadow Correctional Facility in which the plaintiff is incarcerated, and several other unknown correctional officers, interfered with his legal mail and thereby violated his right of equal access to the courts under the Fourteenth Amendment. He brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny Johnson\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Nettis v. Levitt, </em>241 F.3d 186, 192 (2d Cir.2001). The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion to amend his complaint as untimely. More than five years ago, Magistrate Judge Gustave DiBianco ordered Johnson to amend his complaint to identify the unknown defendants and warned him that failure to do so would result in its dismissal with prejudice as to the unidentified defendants. Because Johnson \u201cfailed to take diligent action at that time,\u201d the district court refused to permit him \u201cto vitiate [Magistrate Judge DiBianeo\u2019s] order with this untimely motion.\u201d Op. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">We have previously noted that \u201ceven when a suit is brought by a <em>pro se </em>litigant, \u2018an amended complaint adding new defendants [cannot] relate back if the newly-added defendants were not named originally because the plaintiff did not know their identities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tapia-Ortiz v. Doe, </em>171 F.3d 150, 152 (2d Cir.1999) <em>(per curiam) </em>(quoting <em>Barrow v. Wethersfield Police Dep\u2019t, </em>66 F.3d 466, 470 (2d Cir.1995)). That is the case here. Johnson does not seek to correct a misnomer or misidentification in his complaint; he seeks to add new defendants \u2014 the unknown correctional officers whom he failed to identify in 1995. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion by denying Johnson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendant Stinson <em>de novo. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mazzola, </em>175 F.3d 255, 258 (2d Cir.1999). The district court granted Stinson summary judgment because Johnson failed to allege facts from which a trier of fact could conclude that Stinson was personally involved in any of the alleged interference with Johnson\u2019s mail; and \u201c[t]here is no <em>respondeat superior </em>liability in \u00a7 1983 cases.\u201d <em>Green v. Bauvi, </em>46 F.3d 189, 194 (2d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). We have reviewed the record and agree with the district court that it does not contain any evidence that creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Stinson bears liability for the alleged mail interference in his capacity as a supervisory official. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Williams v. Smith, </em>781 F.2d 319, 323-24 (2d Cir.1986) (setting forth the three bases for liability of a supervisory official).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
