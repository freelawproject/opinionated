Now that he understands that he is in fact subject to the possibility of lifetime parole, he claims that the State has breached his plea agreement. <em>See Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">As the district court found below, there is simply no evidence to indicate that a seven year parole term was a part of the plea agreement between Watson and the State. The sole reference to parole in the written plea agreement appears in sub-paragraph (b). While it is true that this provision does refer to a 3-year parole term, this reference is followed by an asterisk that advised Watson of the life sentence exception to the normal 3 year parole term under California law. <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 3000(b) (1988) (setting the parole term for inmates except those imprisoned for second degree murder and subject to a life sentence). In addition, the plea agreement session with the prosecution was videotaped, and the district court below found that the \u201cvideotape shows no discussion of a parole term, parole eligibility, or parole consequences.\u201d Indeed, the district court went on to state that to the extent there was <em>any </em>evidence of an agreement about parole, the agreement was that the parole term be in accord with the relevant requirements of California law. Because Watson is subject to lifetime parole as California law requires, his claim that the state breached his plea agreement must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Watson also argues that his confusion with respect to the true parole term renders his guilty plea involuntary. To be consistent with due process, Watson must have been fully aware of the direct consequences of his guilty plea. <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). The California state courts concluded that Watson\u2019s plea satisfied this due process standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">An independent review of the record shows that the state courts\u2019 conclusion was not based on an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has never clearly established that a parole term is a direct consequence of a guilty plea with which a defendant must be fully aware. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (\u2018We have never held that the United States Constitution requires the State to furnish a defendant with information about parole eligibility in order for the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to be voluntary ....\u201d); <em>cf. Lane v. Williams, </em>455 U.S. 624, 630, 102 S.Ct. 1322, 71 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982) (the majority stated it was assuming, but not deciding, that failure to advise of a mandatory parole term rendered a guilty plea constitutionally invalid). The state courts\u2019 decisions were not an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law because no clearly established Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Court law exists to support Watson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We also agree with the California state courts and the district court that Watson\u2019s third claim, for ineffective assistance of counsel, does not succeed. Under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), Watson must first show that Sandler\u2019s performance fell below an objective floor of reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The state has conceded that Watson was inaccurately advised as to his parole period. We assume for the sake of argument that this misadvisement is sufficient to carry Watson\u2019s burden under <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>first prong. <em>But cf. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. at 60, 106 S.Ct. 366 (finding it unnecessary to decide whether there may be circumstances where erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility constitutes ineffective assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Where Watson\u2019s ineffective assistance claim fails is on the required showing of prejudice from Sandler\u2019s incorrect advice. A defendant establishes prejudice by showing \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [the defendant] would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, 106 S.Ct. 366. Watson claims that but for Sandler\u2019s assurances that he would do no more than seven years on parole (after about eight years in prison), he would not have pled guilty. A review of the record, however, belies Watson\u2019s counterfactual claims of prejudice due to his attorney\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">First, Watson undisputedly knew that he was pleading to second degree murder, which carried a sentence of 15 to life. Watson therefore pled guilty knowing there was a possibility (however remote) that he would be in prison for life and would never be able to go back to North Carolina. His claim that lifetime parole would have been a dealbreaker-even though he did plead guilty facing a possible life sentence-therefore seems dubious.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Second, it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that Watson would have taken the deal even if correctly advised because \u201clifetime parole\u201d is a bit of a misnomer in Watson\u2019s case. More specifically, California law mandates that individuals convicted of second degree murder and subject to life-term parole will in fact be discharged from parole after five years unless good cause is found to retain the individual. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 3000.1(b)(1988). Had Sandler correctly advised Watson, he would have known this. And as the district court explained, because California law did not preclude Watson from ever being released from parole, the foundation for his claim of prejudice-that he would not have pled guilty knowing he would never be released from parole-vanishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\">. We note here that the district court should not have relied on <em>Carter v. McCarthy, </em>806 F.2d 1373 (9th Cir.1986), as controlling authority in its analysis.
