Cooney, Jr., consented to have Dr. Robert Booth perform knee replacement surgery, but another surgeon, Dr. Arthur Bartolozzi, performed the bulk of the surgery. After the surgery, Cooney\u2019s foot became discolored and no pulses were palpable. Bartolozzi and Booth consulted a vascular surgeon, Mark Mantell. Mantell had to perform additional corrective surgery to repair a tear in the popliteal artery. Cooney died as a result of secondary complications from the vascular surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">Cooney\u2019s estate and individual family members filed suit against Booth, Bartolozzi, Mantell, and a number of other entities. The District Court granted summary judgment to Bartolozzi. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all other defendants except Booth. A jury returned a verdict in favor of Booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-19\">At trial, plaintiffs pursued three theories of liability: (1) Dr. Booth committed malpractice by performing the knee surgery on Cooney despite the fact that Cooney suffered from peripheral vascular disease, and (2) Dr. Booth committed battery on Cooney by causing him to be operated on without his informed consent in that (a) Booth failed to advise him of the additional risk of knee surgery arising from his pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ripheral vascular disease, and (b) Cooney consented only to an operation by Booth and Booth exceeded the scope of that consent by causing most of the surgery to be performed by Dr. Bartolozzi.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Prior to or during trial, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel submitted a proposed instruction (Charge \u201cNo. 6 INFORMED CONSENT\u201d) to the Court pertaining to their two informed consent/battery theories. At the conclusion of the evidence, the Court provided counsel with a tentative set of jury instructions and conducted a charge conference. The conference began with the following advice from the Court and response by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">THE COURT: ... The motions are now closed. We\u2019ll proceed now to the charge conference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">I have provided you with a draft of my proposed jury instructions. The draft embodies all of my rulings on the instructions that you have submitted [to] me, so that if they\u2019re not included in the jury instructions, they have been tentatively denied. If they have been included in a modified fashion, those rulings are my tentative rulings, subject to hearing your comments and your objections to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">So why don\u2019t we start with Mr. Klepp for the plaintiff[s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">MR. KLEPP: Judge, my first impression was that perhaps the court did not put in its draft of the charge the increased risk and substantial factor, which is embodied in the model charge 10.03B, but upon review, further review, I see that it is in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">MR. KLEPP: Also, I do not believe that the charge has anything in it with regard to the informed consent regarding battery under the cases that we have previously cited to the Court, particularly plaintiffs\u2019 request to Charge No. 6. I certainly would ask that that be included in the Court\u2019s charge with regard to the informed conseni/battery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-12\">The Court\u2019s tentative instructions were not made a part of the record so we do not know what they said with respect to informed consent. It is clear, however, that the charge ultimately given to the jury addressed both of plaintiffs\u2019 informed consent theories at some length, describing them in substantially the same manner as the requested Charge No. 6. Contrary to appellants\u2019 insistence, the Court\u2019s instructions with respect to those theories do not suggest in any way that the plaintiffs had to prove that Dr. Booth was negligent in any way. On the contrary, the Court instructed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">A physician who medically treats a patient, without the patient\u2019s informed consent, commits a battery on the patient and [ ]is hable for all injuries the patient suffered as a result of that medical treatment, regardless of the care exercised in the performance of the treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">While the Court did instruct on the concept of negligence, it did so solely in the context of plaintiffs\u2019 malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">Immediately after the jury charge, the Court called a sidebar conference and expressly inquired of counsel whether they had any objections to the charge as given. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel replied, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">The Verdict Sheet contained the following two questions, among others, that the jury answered with a \u201cNo:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-17\">1. Do you find that the defendant Robert E. Booth, Jr., M.D. was negligent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-18\">He H\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-19\">3. Do you find that the defendant Robert E. Booth, Jr., M.D. violated the doctrine of informed consent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>We have carefully compared plaintiffs\u2019 requested charge No. 6 with the portions of the actual charge directed to the same subject matter and we find no material difference. Moreover, to the extent there are any differences at all, given the District Court\u2019s comprehensive treatment of the informed consent/battery theories in its charge, the alleged errors now pointed to by appellants clearly were not preserved by counsel\u2019s general objection at the charge conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We are mindful of the fact that it is not necessary to object to an erroneous portion of a charge after it is given where the court previously has unambiguously and finally rejected an objection \u201cstating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\u201d F.R.Civ.P. 51. See <em>Smith v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, 147 </em>F.3d <em>272 </em>(3d Cir.1998). The purpose of Rule 51, however, is to ensure \u201cthat the district court is made aware of and given an opportunity to correct any alleged error in the charge before the jury begins its deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276. Here the District Court had not finally rejected Charge No. 6 at the time of the charge conference and, absent a specific objection following the actual charge, it had no way of knowing that its efforts to accommodate the general objection made at the conference had not been wholly successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The charge as given contains no plain error. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
