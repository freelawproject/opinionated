On appeal Rivera principally contends that her conviction should be set aside pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not specify the drug quantity attributable to her and because the court did not inform her, in accepting her plea of guilty, that drug quantity was an element of the offense which she had the right to have determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. She also challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of her sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) and contends that she was denied effective assistance of counsel at sentencing. The government contends that, under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, we should decline to entertain Rivera\u2019s challenges to the conviction because, after pleading guilty in 1992, Rivera failed to appear for her scheduled sentencing in 1993 and instead fled the country; she was not apprehended until 1997. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment. We agree with the government that Rivera has forfeited her challenges to the conviction. We review only her challenges to the sentence imposed on her following her recapture, and we find that those challenges lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Under the fugitive disentitlement doctrine, a court has the \u201c \u2018discretion to refuse to rule on the merits of a defendant\u2019s postconviction claims of trial error when the defendant has fled from justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>254 F.3d 424, 426 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(quoting United States v. Bravo, </em>10 F.3d 79, 83 (2d Cir.1993), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1011, 114 S.Ct. 1386, 128 L.Ed.2d 60 (1994)). This doctrine \u201cserves four rationales: 1) assuring the enforceability of any decision that may be rendered against the fugitive; 2) imposing a penalty for flouting the judicial process; 3) discouraging flights from justice and promoting the efficient operation of the courts; and 4) avoiding prejudice to the other side caused by the defendant\u2019s escape.\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>254 F.3d at 426 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Persico, </em>853 F.2d 134, 138 (2d Cir.1988) (it would be \u201cunconscionable\u201d to allow defendant to benefit from delay by forcing re-prosecution after witnesses\u2019 memories have faded). Although for the doctrine to apply there must be a sufficient nexus between the defendant\u2019s fugitive status and the appellate proceedings, <em>see Ortegar-Rodriguez v. United States, </em>507 U.S. 234, 249-51, 113 S.Ct. 1199, 122 L.Ed.2d 581 <em>(1993), </em>we have recognized such a nexus even where the defendant has been recaptured prior to an appeal in two circumstances: \u201c(1) where a fugitive\u2019s escape so delays the onset of appellate proceedings that the government would be prejudiced in locating witnesses if a trial were to take place after a successful appeal; and (2) where one of several co-defendants absconds, requiring multiple appeals if the defendant is allowed to appeal after [her] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>recapture,\u201d <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>254 F.3d at 427 (applying doctrine to a defendant\u2019s postconviction challenges where the defendant had been a fugitive for six years and the government\u2019s cooperating witness could no longer be located); <em>see also United States v. Bravo, </em>10 F.3d at 84-85 (doctrine applied to defendant who had been a fugitive for 15 years where the government\u2019s ability to assemble witnesses and evidence was undermined).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Here, Rivera pleaded guilty nearly a decade ago, admitting to participating in a drug distribution conspiracy between the mid 1980s and 1991. Although due to be sentenced in 1993, she was not sentenced until 1998 because she absconded for more than four years. Thus, any difficulty in refreshing witnesses\u2019 memories as to the quantity of heroin for which she is responsible \u2014 now dating back some 15 years\u2014 would be increased. Moreover, the cooperating witnesses and the other members of the conspiracy have already been convicted and sentenced, lessening the incentives of those persons to testify against Rivera if she were now to be tried. Accordingly, we decline to entertain Rivera\u2019s challenges to her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In challenging her sentence, Rivera contends principally that the district court erred in increasing her offense level pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice and in refusing to reduce her offense level pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 on the basis that she played a minor role in the conspiracy. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Rivera contends that the obstruction enhancement was inappropriate because the district court did not conduct a hearing or make a finding that her flight was motivated by a specific intent to obstruct justice rather than by fear for her life and the lives of her children. We disagree. Although an obstruction enhancement is not appropriate unless the obstruction was \u201cwillful[ ],\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1, certain conduct, such as intentionally failing to appear as required at judicial proceedings, is so inherently obstructive of the administration of justice that it is sufficient that the defendant willfully engaged in the underlying conduct, regardless of her specific purpose. <em>See </em>Guidelines \u00a7 3C1.1 Application Note 4(e) (obstruction-of-justice enhancement may properly be imposed for \u201cwillfully failing to appear, as ordered, for a judicial proceeding\u201d); <em>United States v. Reed, </em>49 F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Aponte, </em>31 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cIt is sufficient for these purposes that the defendant intended to fail to appear at a judicial proceeding, regardless of [her] reason for desiring to flee.\u201d). Here, there was no dispute that Rivera absconded just prior to the time she was to be sentenced and that she deliberately absented herself. We see no error in the obstruction adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Nor do we see any error in the court\u2019s refusal to decrease Rivera\u2019s offense level on the basis that she was a \u201cminor participant in [the] criminal activity.\u201d Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A \u201cminor participant means any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Application Note 3. The court\u2019s findings as to a defendant\u2019s role are reviewable only for clear error, see, <em>e.g., United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e), and the court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts is entitled to deference, see <em>id. </em>Here, the record indicated that Rivera packaged the heroin being distributed and that she participated as well in transporting it to the distribution sites from which it was to be sold on the street. Further, Rivera indicated to the government prosecutors that she was privy to \u201cdetailed in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>formation about the leaders, managers and other participants in the drug conspiracy and their methods of operation,\u201d including the movement of drugs. (Rivera brief on appeal at 23; <em>see also </em>Rivera Motion Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 To Vacate ... Sentence, No. S2-91-CR-685-31 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 11, 2000) (stating that Rivera had given the government \u201cdetailed information about the organization she worked for the bosses, managers, organizers,\u201d and \u201cspecific information about amounts of material involved, and when people came in and out of the organization\u201d).) Given Rivera\u2019s responsibilities in the conspiracy and her proclaimed intimate knowledge of its operations and personnel, we see no clear error in the court\u2019s finding that Rivera did not play merely a minor role.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Finally, although Rivera contends that she was deprived of effective assistance of counsel at sentencing because her attorney failed to object that the Probation Department had revised her presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) without interviewing her after she was recaptured, her factual premise is contradicted by the record. Although the revised PSR was originally prepared without consultation with Rivera, her attorney protested that fact, with the result that Rivera was then interviewed and allowed to state her position to the Probation Department for inclusion in the revised PSR. Accordingly, the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We have considered all of Rivera\u2019s contentions that are properly before us and have found them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
