He contends that the ALJ erred by (1) refusing to credit his testimony that he was disabled; (2) rejecting the opinions of two examining psychologists that his impairments rendered him unemployable; and (3) fashioning a vocational hypothetical that failed to include all of his impairments. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">1. <em>Moon\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">In this circuit, \u201cthe ALJ can reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of [his] symptoms only by offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th Cir.1996). Here, the ALJ relied on (1) medical opinions of three doctors who stated that Moon suffered \u201cfrom no more than \u2018moderate\u2019 limitations in function,\u201d (2) evidence of \u201ca possible exaggeration of psychological symptoms,\u201d (3) the fact that Moon had not sought treatment of his impairments, (4) Moon\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding his claimed physical limitations; and (5) inconsistencies between Moon\u2019s claimed limitations and \u201chis own description of his daily activities.\u201d These are sufficient reasons, supported by substantial evidence, to justify the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Moon\u2019s claim of disability. <em>See id. </em>at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-15\">2. <em>Examining Psychologists</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-16\">Dr. Edelmann examined Moon and offered that he was \u201cunemployable\u201d without vocational rehabilitation. The ALJ rejected that conclusion, reasoning that Dr. Edelmann\u2019s specific findings of moderate limitations and moderate social and occupational dysfunctioning did not support a finding that Moon could not be employed. Moreover, the ALJ noted that two other consulting psychologists also reviewed Moon\u2019s medical records, including Dr. Edelmann\u2019s evaluation, and each concluded that Moon\u2019s mental limitations would not prevent him from performing simple, routine or repetitive tasks with limited public contact. Finally, the ALJ explained that Dr. Edelmann\u2019s conclusion regarding Moon\u2019s employability would be discounted because it was based primarily on Moon\u2019s lack of employment skills rather than on his mental condition and also because it was offered for Moon\u2019s eligibility for state welfare programs and not within the meaning of \u201cdisability\u201d under the Social Security Act. These are \u201cspecific, legitimate, clear and convincing reasons\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Moon was also examined by Dr. Sharon Beickel. She recommended that Moon \u201cbe given a determinate period of disability ....\u201d The ALJ rejected that recommendation. As the district court noted, the ALJ did so because Dr. Beickel\u2019s assessments of Moon\u2019s limitations were inconsistent with those made by Dr. Edelmann, by other reviewing psychologists, and even by Moon\u2019s behavior at the hearing. The ALJ also noted that Moon had never requested psychological treatment and that there was evidence he exaggerated his symptoms and problems. Finally, the ALJ offered that Dr. Beickel\u2019s conclusions were largely based on Moon\u2019s own reporting of his difficulties and were inconsistent with Moon\u2019s descriptions of his daily activities. Again, these are specific, legitimate, clear and convincing reasons. Although Moon raises colorable arguments regarding some of the ALJ\u2019s reasoning, there remains ample justification for the ALJ\u2019s decision not to accept Dr. Beickel\u2019s recommendation. <em>See Edlund v. Massanari, </em>253 F.3d 1152, 1156 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and resolving ambiguities.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">3. <em>Vocational Hypothetical</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">An ALJ can rely on a vocational expert\u2019s response to hypothetical questions as a means to determine whether a claimant can engage in gainful employment. <em>See Osenbrock v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1157, 1162-63 (9th Cir.2001). Such questions must, however, \u201cset out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant, including pain and an inability to engage in certain activities.\u201d <em>See Russell v. Sullivan, </em>930 F.2d 1443, 1445 (9th Cir.1991). Moon argues that the hypothetical question posed in this case was inadequate because it failed to include limitations on the use of his right hand. The ALJ is not required, however, to include limitations not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Osenbrock, </em>240 F.3d at 1164-65. As the district court noted, Moon\u2019s claim that he cannot use his right hand is inconsistent with his testimony. Although Moon testified that he may sometimes \u201cdrop things\u201d with his right hand, he also indicated that he could grip a pencil \u201cforever\u201d and that he routinely engages in activities that require gripping and handling large and small items, \u201cincluding splitting wood, working on cars, cleaning, mopping and sweeping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Moon also argues that the hypothetical question was deficient because it failed to include all of the mental assessments made by Drs. Edelmann and Beickel. We agree that the ALJ\u2019s summation of those assessments could have been more detailed and accurate. Nonetheless, we agree with the district court that the ALJ\u2019s condensation of the medical evidence, although simplified, was sufficiently accurate to allow the vocational expert to assess Moon\u2019s capacity to do work. Moreover, it is clear that the vocational expert was not asked the questions in total isolation from the record. The ALJ specifiea\u00f1y directed the expert to \u201cconsider the agency assessment and its record\u201d when addressing the hypothetical. Thus, we agree with the district court that \u201c[t]he vocational expert answered an appropriate hypothetical question based on substantial evidence in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b691-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
