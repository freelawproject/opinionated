Skretny, Judge) dismissing their legal malpractice lawsuit against defendant Cheryl Hite Scherer, executrix of the estate of the Clarks\u2019 former attorney, James N. Hite. The Clarks filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court on June 22, 2000, alleging that Hite committed malpractice when he allowed the statute of limitations to lapse on October 17, 1989, in connection with a wrongful death cause of action involving the Clarks\u2019 daughter. Because Hite died on January 27, 1999, the Clarks sued Hite\u2019s estate. After removing the lawsuit to federal court on diversity jurisdiction grounds, defendant moved to dismiss it pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) because the applicable three-year statute of limitations had long expired. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, and in a Decision and Order dated November 28, 2000, the district court granted defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">On appeal, the Clarks rely on the relatively complicated history of legal proceedings between the parties to argue that the statute of limitations tolled between March 20, 1992, and the date of Hite\u2019s death in January 1999. March 20, 1992, was the date that Hite commenced a lawsuit against the Clarks in Buffalo City Court to recover $720 in expenses related to his representation of the Clarks on behalf of their daughter. In response to Hite\u2019s complaint, the Clarks served an answer in which they asserted legal malpractice as an affirmative defense, but they did not file the answer in city court. The next significant event in the Hite lawsuit took place on November 3, 1995, when the court on its own motion dismissed the litigation pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 3215(c) for Hite\u2019s failure to request entry of judgment after the Clarks\u2019 default. Several years later, on June 3, 1998, the Clarks attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ed to serve an amended answer on Hite in which they fashioned their malpractice allegation as a counterclaim. Hite refused service because the underlying lawsuit was defunct. Nonetheless, the Clarks in January 1999 filed a motion in Buffalo City Court seeking to vacate the default and leave to file an amended answer. The city court and New York appeals courts rejected the Clarks\u2019 attempts to revive the Hite lawsuit. Although Hite died in January 1999, no one ever substituted Hite\u2019s estate or legal representative in the pending proceedings, which concluded on August 29, 2000. In the meantime, plaintiffs began the instant lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Generally, plaintiffs contend that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to their malpractice lawsuit tolled between the start of the Hite lawsuit in March 1992 and Hite\u2019s death in January 1999 because (1) their raising malpractice as an affirmative defense in the Hite lawsuit stopped the clock pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 203(e) as long as the Hite lawsuit was pending; and (2) the Hite lawsuit terminated upon Hite\u2019s death rather than the Buffalo City Court\u2019s, dismissal order in November 1995. By excluding this period of time and taking advantage of an additional 18-month exclusion applicable to bringing lawsuits against estates, <em>see </em>N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 210(b), plaintiffs argue that their June 2000 lawsuit was timely even though the malpractice cause of action accrued in October 1989. Judge Skretny rejected plaintiffs\u2019 claim. We review the district court\u2019s ruling pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Friedl v. City of New York, </em>210 F.3d 79, 83 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The following facts relevant to calculation of the statute of limitations are not in dispute: (1) the relevant statute of limitations is three years pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. \u00a7 214(6); (2) the malpractice cause of action accrued on October 17, 1989; (3) the statute on the malpractice claim tolled while the Hite lawsuit was pending; and (4) the Clarks received the benefit of the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Brothers v. Florence, </em>95 N.Y.2d 290, 716 N.Y.S.2d 367, 739 N.E.2d 733 (2000), to extend the statute of limitations until at least September 4, 1997. The parties disagree, however, on how long the Hite lawsuit was pending. Defendant claims that the lawsuit ended on November 3, 1995, with the Buffalo city court\u2019s dismissal order. As noted above, the Clarks contend that the lawsuit ended with Hite\u2019s death in January 1999. The Clarks basically argue that the November 1995 dismissal was erroneous because the city court premised it on their default even though they served an answer on Hite. There is no dispute, however, that the Clarks failed to file their answer with the court. It was not until 31 months after the November 1995 dismissal that the Clarks tried unsuccessfully to revive the Hite lawsuit, and the New York courts uniformly rejected that effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">Plaintiffs are precluded from re-litigating in federal court their claim that the November 1995 dismissal was erroneous. <em>Colon v. Coughlin, </em>58 F.3d 865, 869 (2d Cir.1995). Moreover, the district court correctly ruled that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents the federal court from reviewing the state court action. <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 198 (2d Cir.1996). We reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the state court judgments were void based on the failure to substitute a proper party for Hite after he died because plaintiffs waived any objection to this defect. <em>See Bauernfeind v. Albany Med. Ctr. Hasp., </em>154 A.D.2d 754, 546 N.Y.S.2d 201, 202 n. 1 (3d Dep\u2019t 1989). Finally, we reject the Clarks\u2019 argument that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not bar this lawsuit by the estate of Kimberly Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>rather than the Clarks individually because the estate was not part of the fee-related Hite lawsuit. As the district court aptly noted, this argument \u201ccompletely destroys any tolling claim advanced by the Plaintiffs\u201d because they rely on the Hite lawsuit to exclude considerable periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We have considered all of plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
