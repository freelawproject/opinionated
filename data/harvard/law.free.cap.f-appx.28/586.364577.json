Petitioner argues (1) the IJ erred in discounting the validity of his evidence, (2) he proved past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution, and (3) the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) failed to produce evidence showing changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-23\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant a \u201crefugee\u201d asylum. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is an alien unwilling to return to his or her home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). With jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we review for an abuse of discretion and must uphold the BIA\u2019s decision that an alien is not eligible for asylum if the decision is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>See Feleke v. INS, </em>118 F.3d 594, 598 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The record, considered as a whole, supports the BIA\u2019s reasons for not fully crediting petitioner\u2019s testimony: he gave inconsistent testimony as to when very significant events occurred; he lacked basic knowledge about Mormonism despite claiming to have belonged to a Mormon church, where his father was a minister; he claimed to have come to the United States in part seeking religious freedom, yet never attended a Mormon church here because he could not find one; and he managed to find and chose to attend a church of the Catholic faith, the faith of his alleged persecutors. <em>See Ghasemimehr v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 1389, 1391 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam) (this court will defer to adverse credibility finding as long as \u201cspecific, cogent reason for disbelief\u201d supports finding); Rod<em>riguez-Rivera, v. INS, </em>848 F.2d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (\u201cIt is the BIA that we review.\u201d). Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in according no weight to the documentary evidence petitioner submitted, i.e., a statement from the mayor of his former town, because petitioner testified that he did not know the mayor, his letter to the mayor requesting the statement told petitioner\u2019s story, and the statement referred to events from \u201c1981\u201d whereas petitioner testified that those events occurred in the 1990s. Thus, petitioner failed to prove past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Petitioner also failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution, given that he had \u201cno idea\u201d what had happened to his parents, whom he had not seen after their house allegedly burned down, and he was not threatened during the five or six months he lived in a new town in Guatemala before coming to the United States. <em>See Feleke, </em>118 F.3d at 598 (requiring alien to establish, inter aha, objectively reasonable fear of future persecution); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995) (attacks on family members do not necessarily establish well-founded fear of persecution absent pattern of persecution tied to alien); <em>Safaie v. INS, </em>25 F.3d 636, 640-41 (8th Cir.1994) (by remaining without incident in home country after alleged persecution, alien undercut well-founded-fear claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Because petitioner failed to establish past persecution, the INS was not required to produce evidence showing Guatemala\u2019s conditions have improved, <em>see Kratchmarov v. Heston, </em>172 F.3d 551, 553 (8th Cir.1999) (burden-shifting analysis); nonetheless, it submitted documentation showing improved conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Finally, because substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum, we also affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>deportation. <em>See id. </em>at 555 (clear-probability standard for withholding is more stringent than well-founded-fear standard for asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, 1996), <em>amended by </em>Act of Oct. 11, 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656, repealed 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a (1994) and replaced it with a new judicial review provision codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 306. As the new provision does not apply to deportation proceedings that commenced before April 1, 1997, this court continues to have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
