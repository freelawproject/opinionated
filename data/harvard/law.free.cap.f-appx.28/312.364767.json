On appeal, Johnson asserts that his conviction and sentence are invalid under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Because we conclude that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to Johnson\u2019s claims, we affirm his convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">Johnson waived his right to indictment and pleaded guilty to a criminal information. The information to which Johnson pleaded guilty did not include drug quantity in the drug conspiracy charge in count one. In the plea agreement, however, Johnson acknowledged that the maximum sentence under count one was life imprisonment, and stipulated that he was responsible for between 50 and 150 grams of crack cocaine. Based upon this drug quantity and Johnson\u2019s three prior drug felony convictions, the district court determined that a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment was required under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Johnson to life imprisonment and ten years supervised release on count one; and ten years imprisonment and three years supervised release on count two, to be served concurrently with the sentence on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-20\">Because Johnson waived his right to indictment and pleaded guilty to a criminal information, which could be amended by the government without the intervention of a grand jury, the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>are not applicable. See <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>261 F.3d 397, 404-05 (4th Cir.2001) (defining nature of <em>Apprendi </em>error as a defect in the indictment), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 803, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
