This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In May 2000, a federal jury found Banks guilty of conspiring to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and conspiring to launder monetary instruments in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), (a)(1)(B)(i), (a)(1)(B)(ii), and (h). Banks had been indicted together with numerous other codefendants. At trial, nine of those codefendants testified with respect to Banks\u2019s role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">At sentencing, the Presentence Investigation Report provided for a total offense level of 26, a criminal history category of II, and a guideline range of 70-84 months of imprisonment. The district court determined that Banks was a \u201cminor participant\u201d and applied the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision under USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. Accordingly, the district court determined the total offense level to be 24, the criminal history category to be I, and the imprisonment range to be 51 to 63 months. The district court imposed the lowest possible sentence of 51 months of imprisonment to be followed by four years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">On appeal, Banks\u2019s counsel moves to withdraw and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). In response, Banks moves to dismiss counsel and to have replacement counsel appointed to represent him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">Upon review, we hereby grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as it reflects that appellate counsel has independently reviewed the entire record and proceedings. Although believing the appeal to be frivolous, appellate counsel has submitted the following issue for review: whether Banks was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">Banks\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is not cognizable on direct appeal. Banks contends that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance because counsel did not file any pretrial pleadings or discovery motions, did not subpoena or call witnesses to testify on Banks\u2019s behalf, did not object to the introduction of \u201cother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>acts\u201d evidence, failed to verbalize and explain his motion to the trial court following the close of all the evidence, and faded to obtain Banks\u2019s release on a \u201creinstated bond\u201d following his voluntary surrender. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are rarely cognizable on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Rahal, </em>191 F.3d 642, 645 (6th Cir.1999), <em>United States v. Long, </em>190 F.3d 471, 478 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1032, 120 S.Ct. 555, 145 L.Ed.2d 431 (1999). As a general rule, such claims are not suited for direct review as there has not been an opportunity to develop and include in the record evidence bearing on the merits of the allegations. <em>United States v. Goodlett, </em>3 F.3d 976, 980 (6th Cir.1993). Rather, the customary procedure is to permit the defendant to raise his ineffectiveness of counsel claim in a proper post-conviction proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, where, if necessary, additional evidence, including an evidentiary hearing, may be permitted. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>90 F.3d 1135, 1143 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Here, as appointed appellate counsel points out, Banks has raised this claim for the first time, and the record is inadequate to establish the accuracy of Banks\u2019s version of his trial counsel\u2019s performance. Thus, we decline to review Banks\u2019s ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Additionally, we have reviewed the record and discovered no error warranting reversal of Banks\u2019s conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny Banks\u2019s motion to dismiss counsel, deny Banks\u2019s motion to have new counsel appointed to represent him, and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
