Carter, a federal inmate appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2258(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We grant the petition to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d), and affirm the district court\u2019s order and judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In 1992, Mr. Carter pled guilty to and was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. He was sentenced to 192 months of imprisonment, but his sentence was later reduced to 150 months. Mr. Carter did not appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">In this petition, Mr. Carter seeks to have his sentence reduced by two years because of his post-conviction rehabilitation efforts. Doc. 3 at 12. The district court dismissed Mr. Carter\u2019s petition on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction to modify his previously imposed sentence. <em>See </em>Doc. 4. We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal determination that it lacked jurisdiction to modify Mr. Carter\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201cA district court does not have inherent authority to modify a previously imposed sentence; it may do so only pursuant to statutory authorization.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>118 F.3d 707, 709 (10th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Mr. Carter claims that the district court had jurisdiction to re-sentence him under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, the general habeas corpus statute. To invoke that jurisdiction, however, Mr. Carter must allege a constitutional deprivation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). Because he has not alleged a constitutional deprivation, we agree with the district court that it did not have jurisdiction to modify his previously imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">We GRANT Mr. Carter\u2019s petition to proceed on appeal IFP, and affirm the district court\u2019s order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b816-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
