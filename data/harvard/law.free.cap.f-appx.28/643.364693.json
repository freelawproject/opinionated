Cuevas appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, challenging his denial of parole. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">Cuevas contends California\u2019s Indeterminate Sentencing Law violates the Ex Post Facto Clause. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition de novo. <em>See Duhaime v. Ducharme, </em>200 F.3d 597, 600 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-19\">Cuevas\u2019 contention is without merit because his 7-years-to-life sentence was not greater than that permitted by the law in effect when he was sentenced. As such, there was no ex post facto violation. <em>See Morales v. California Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>16 F.3d 1001, 1005-06 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by </em>514 U.S. 499, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995); <em>Johnson v. Gomez, </em>92 F.3d 964, 968 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Morales, </em>514 U.S. at 514 (noting change in method in fixing parole release date did not violate Ex Post Facto Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-20\"> We further reject Cuevas\u2019 contention that the Board of Prison Terms\u2019 hearing violated his due process rights. A parole board\u2019s decision satisfies due process \u201cif <em>some </em>evidence supports the decision.\u201d <em>See Morales, </em>16 F.3d at 1005 (quoting <em>Jancsek v. Oregon Bd. of Parole, </em>833 F.2d 1389, 1390 (9th Cir.1987)). In addition, \u201cthe evidence underlying the board\u2019s decision must have some indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(quoting <em>Jancsek, </em>833 F.2d at 1390). Reliability may be found where the prisoner was afforded an opportunity to appear before, and present evidence to, the parole board. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Pedro v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>Oregon Parole Bd., </em>825 F.2d 1396, 1399 (9th Cir.1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Notwithstanding that the falsehoods Cuevas complains about are relatively minor, there is nothing in the record demonstrating that they are, in fact, falsehoods. Moreover, the Board\u2019s decision was based upon the evidence presented, and the evidence proffered by his lawyer only disputed one of the many factors that the Board relied upon. Although Cuevas declined to participate in the hearing, his lawyer was present and did present evidence, and Cuevas\u2019 lawyer did not object to any of the government\u2019s evidence. As there was some evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision, there was no due process violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
