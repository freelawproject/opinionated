Challenging his convictions on appeal, Crews contends that the government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove (1) the existence of an agreement as an essential element of conspiracy and (2) the fact that the visual depictions at issue moved in interstate commerce. He also contends that the district court admitted evidence in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Finally, he challenges the delayed search of his impounded automobile under the Fourth Amendment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Lester Hinson, the 14-year-old victim in this case, who obtained from friends the telephone number of Michael Crews, called Crews and spoke to both Crews and his roommate, Julius Schlee. During the conversation, he told Crews and Schlee that he was 14 years old. At the time, Crews and Schlee were about 25 years old and lived in an apartment in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Pursuant to arrangements made during the call, Crews and Schlee picked Hinson up at his home the next morning around 8:00 a.m., after Hinson\u2019s parents had left for work, and they took him back to their apartment. At the apartment, the three watched a male pornographic video and then went to a bedroom where all three took off their clothing and engaged in sexual acts. When they were finished, Schlee showed Hinson pictures on his computer of \u201cguys\u201d \u201cperforming sex acts.\u201d After the three arranged to meet the next day at 7:30 a.m., Crews and Schlee took Hinson home.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">The following morning, Crews and Schlee again picked Hinson up and took him to their apartment. The three played a game of nude Twister and then went into the bedroom where Hinson performed anal sex on Crews while Schlee stood by. When they were finished, Crews left the room, and Hinson performed anal sex on Schlee. During this encounter, Crews came back into the room, picked up the video camera that was beside the bed and started filming Schlee and Hinson. Schlee and Hinson asked Crews to stop but Crews said to \u201chold on,\u201d insisting that he wanted to take the video. He continued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>film Schlee and Hinson for about ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Later that same morning, Crews took approximately 15 to 20 nude pictures of Schlee and Hinson, using a digital camera that was attached to his computer. A few days later, Crews and Schlee sent images of these pictures via an America Online email account to Hinson, which he viewed at his home. After these encounters, Hinson never saw Crews again.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">A few weeks after the video of Schlee and Hinson was taken, Schlee saw Crews watching it and repeatedly asked Crews to destroy the tape. Crews refused, telling Schlee that he would do what he wanted with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">A year later, Crews moved from North Carolina to Virginia, presumably taking all of his possessions with him. Schlee later testified that to the best of his knowledge, Crews still had possession of the videotape of Schlee and Hinson. Indeed, Crews repeatedly threatened Schlee in the manner, \u201cI wonder what your mom would think if she saw these videos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">After Hinson\u2019s father learned about his minor son\u2019s encounters, Crews was indicted in the Eastern District of North Carolina for producing child pornography and aiding and abetting in the production of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and conspiracy to produce child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(d). Crews was convicted, and the district court sentenced him to 100 months\u2019 imprisonment. From the judgment of conviction, Crews filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">Crews contends first that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of conspiring to produce child pornography because the government failed to meet its burden of showing an agreement between Crews and Schlee to create the visual depictions at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">In order to establish that Crews and Schlee conspired to produce visual depictions of minors engaged in sexual acts, the government must prove, among other things, that they agreed to produce such visual depictions. <em>United States v. Meredith, </em>824 F.2d 1418, 1428 (4th Cir.1987). The government does riot, however, have to show an explicit agreement because \u201cagreement may be inferred from the facts and circumstances of the case,\u201d <em>United States v. Baker, </em>985 F.2d 1248, 1255 (4th Cir.1993), and \u201ca tacit or mutual understanding among or between the parties will suffice,\u201d <em>United States v. Depew, </em>932 F.2d 324, 326 (4th Cir.1991). To meet its burden of proof on a particular issue, the government must present substantial evidence sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (holding that a jury verdict must be sustained \u201cif there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">In this case, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have inferred that Crews and Schlee agreed to produce the visual depictions at issue. The initial encounter between Crews, Schlee, and Hinson was orchestrated to the point that within an hour of meeting, the three were in the bedroom performing sex acts. In addition, Schlee was aware that Crews had, in the past, made a sexually explicit video of himself with a young boy; the video camera used to take the video in this case was sitting right next to the bed; and after Schlee and Hinson\u2019s initial protest, Crews videotaped Schlee and Hinson engaging in sex acts, without further protest, for ten minutes. Taking this evidence in the light most favorable to the government, it was sufficiently substantial to support the jury\u2019s finding of an implied agreement to produce pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Crews also contends that there was insufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the visual depictions at issue in this case were \u201cactually ... transported in interstate ... commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a). We conclude there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the videotape in question was taken by Crews from North Carolina to Virginia when he moved to Virginia, and, therefore, this element was sufficiently proven by the government. Schlee testified that Crews moved to Virginia and as far as he knew took all of his belongings with him. Moreover, Crews implied that he had the videotape in his possession because (1) despite Schlee\u2019s repeated requests, Crews refused to destroy the videotape and (2) after moving to Virginia, Crews threatened Schlee with playing the tape for Schlee\u2019s mother. From this evidence, the jury could have concluded that Crews transported the videotape from North Carolina to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Crews next contends that the district court erred in admitting testimony about an earlier videotape that Crews took involving a sexual encounter between himself and another boy. He asserts that the district court admitted this evidence in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) because the evidence was irrelevant to any of the charged crimes and any probative value the videotape may have had was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We find this argument to be without merit. This videotape of a prior encounter with someone other than Hinson supported an inference that Crews and Schlee planned to create a videotape of the encounter between the two of them and Hinson because Schlee\u2019s testimony about both the contents of this tape and his knowledge that Crews had made it could be taken as circumstantial evidence demonstrating a tacit agreement between the two men to create a similar videotape with Hinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">In addition, the district court admitted evidence about the existence of this videotape but did not permit the jury to view it, thereby avoiding much of the prejudice that might have been caused had it been shown to the jury. We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Finally, Crews challenges the admission of an address book into evidence, contending that the address book was obtained through a search of his automobile, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and therefore should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Crews\u2019 automobile was searched and impounded in October 2000 pursuant to his arrest on state law charges. As part of its investigation of Crews for federal crimes, the FBI performed an additional search of the vehicle in late July 2001 and discovered the address book at issue. At the time of the search, the automobile was still being held in the impound lot, and the FBI agent believed that the vehicle had been abandoned and now belonged to the impound lot. Accordingly, he obtained permission from the lot\u2019s owner to search it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">According to Virginia law, under which the automobile was impounded, an owner who fails to reclaim an impounded abandoned car within 15 days consents to the sale of the vehicle at public auction by the entity holding the car. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-1202. The FBI agent also testified that in Virginia, a vehicle seized by the police department is turned over to a contractor station which maintains the vehicle for 30 to 60 days, during which it must make all reasonable attempts to return the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>vehicle. If the vehicle is not reclaimed by its owner during that period, it becomes the property of the station to do with what it wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The automobile at issue in this case was held by the impound lot for almost ten months before the FBI performed its search of it. Thus, by the time the search was conducted, the vehicle had become property of the impound lot, and Crews no longer had \u201ca legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle.\u201d <em>See Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (holding that when a person no longer has an expectation of privacy in a vehicle, he lacks standing to challenge a search of the vehicle). Accordingly, we conclude that Crews\u2019 constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment were not violated because he lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle. Therefore, the district court\u2019s admission of the address book into evidence did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b275-8\">DIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AA8\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The Government presented no evidence that the visual depictions at issue in this case \u2014 those involving the minor, Lester Hinson \u2014 were \u201cactually transported in interstate commerce,\u201d as is required in order to violate the provision of the federal child pornography statute under which Crews was indicted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2251(a) (West 2000). Accordingly, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the depictions had in fact been transported in interstate commerce in violation of that statute. Therefore, with respect, I must dissent from the majority\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Three background facts \u2014 all undisputed \u2014 are necessary to understand the deficiency in the evidence. First, Crews made all of the depictions of Hinson \u2014 the videotape and the digital pictures \u2014 in North Carolina. JA 338-40, 344. Second, Crews also made in North Carolina two or three other videotapes showing Julius Schlee masturbating, on which Hinson did not appear. JA 342. Third, after creating all of these videotapes, Crews later moved to Virginia, and, prior to trial, never again had face to face contact with Schlee. JA 347. With this background in mind, I examine all testimony that could conceivably demonstrate actual interstate transport of the videotape or digital pictures of Hinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Schlee testified that he repeatedly urged Crews to destroy the videotape of himself and Hinson. A \u201cweek or two after it was made\u201d (when Crews was clearly still in North Carolina), Schlee saw Crews \u201cwatching it on TV\u201d; he \u201ctold [Crews] many times, including that time, that he needed to destroy that tape,\u201d but Crews refused. JA 341-42. This testimony does not demonstrate that Crews moved to Virginia with the Hinson videotape or even that he refused to destroy the Hinson videotape after moving to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">When an investigation into Crews\u2019s and Schlee\u2019s conduct began, Crews wrote Schlee a letter implying that the tape of Hinson and Schlee had been destroyed: \u201c[T]he detectives ... asked me about a tape. They searched my house for this type [sic] but they never found the tape. As far as anyone is concerned, that evidence against you has been destroyed.\u201d JA 373. This letter is silent as to when Crews destroyed the tape, and thus provides no basis from which to infer that Crews transported it to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">The only other evidence as to what Crews took to Virginia comes from Schlee\u2019s testimony in the following exchanges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Q: Did the defendant take his computer with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">A: <em>I\u2019m assuming </em>he took everything. Q: He didn\u2019t leave anything behind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">A: Not as far as I know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Q: As far as you know, he took his collection of child pornography? [Objection. Sustained.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">Q: Did he take his computer if you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">A: <em>I don\u2019t know.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">JA 344. (Emphasis added). This testimony provides no support for a finding that Crews took his computer with him to Virginia, perhaps physically transporting the digital pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">After a subsequent discussion of Crews\u2019s electronic communications with Schlee after the move, Schlee gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">Q: What did he say to you that you took as threats?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">A: Well, he had said that <em>Lester\u2019s mom had been calling him while he was down here or in Fayetteville and asking wanting to know my name and my address down here and everything like that. He said that she continued to contact him when he moved to Virginia. His explanation was he was trying to protect me, so he was keeping quiet about it </em>but she kept calling him everyday [sic] or something like that.... It was like if I wasn\u2019t polite to him or nice to him or like that then he would tell Lester\u2019s mom everything that had been going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">Q: Did the defendant at this time, to the best <em>of your knowledge, still have those videotapes that he made of you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai6\">A: <em>Yes, sir.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">Q: Did he <em>ever use those videotapes to threaten exposure of those videotapes against you?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">A: Well, it\u2019s the same way as with Lester\u2019s mom thing. He wouldn\u2019t come out and say if you don\u2019t do this, then I\u2019m going to show these to whoever. But whenever he got in a foul mood, and I wasn\u2019t doing like I was supposed to, then he would mention something like <em>I wonder what your mom would think if she saw these videos or something like that. I confronted him one time about it. He said that the only reason I was hanging around his apartment was because if I left he would send those videos to my mother </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">JA 345-47. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-18\">Schlee\u2019s testimony simply does not support a finding that Crews took the videotape of Hinson and Schlee with him when he moved to Virginia. If, after the move to Virginia, Crews had made a specific threat to show the Hinson-Schlee videotape to Hinson\u2019s mother or Schlee\u2019s mother, a jury might be able to infer that Crews had taken it to Virginia. But there is no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-19\">Schlee never testified that Crews threatened to show Hinson\u2019s mother the videotape; instead, Crews simply refused her requests for information about Schlee. Crews did, according to Schlee, threaten to show Schlee\u2019s mother some unspecified videotapes, but nothing indicates that these threats were made <em>after </em>the move to Virginia; during the only such conversation that Schlee specifically describes, the men were plainly together <em>in North Carolina, </em>with Schlee \u201changing around [Crews\u2019s] apartment.\u201d JA 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-20\">Moreover, the reported threats to show \u201cthose videos\u201d to Schlee\u2019s mother do not even necessarily refer to the one videotape in which Hinson appears, the only one that was a basis for Crews\u2019s child pornography convictions. Although Crews made only one videotape in which Hinson appears, he made several of Schlee, an adult, masturbating alone. Crews\u2019s asserted references to \u201cthese videotapes\u201d must include something other than the single Hinson-Schlee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>videotape, and might easily mean only the Schlee solo videotapes.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Nor does the information that Schlee would not want his mother to see the videotapes in question point to the Hinson-Schlee videotape, because Schlee would not have wanted disclosure of any of the videotapes to his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">For these reasons, I am forced to conclude that the Government has provided no basis from which a reasonable jury could have found that the visual depictions of Hinson charged in the indictment were actually transported in interstate commerce.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-17\"> Schlee\u2019s testimony with regard to his \"knowledge\u201d as to Crews\u2019s transport of <em>any </em>videotapes to Virginia is weak, given that Schlee conceded that he was only \"assuming\u201d Crews \"took everything\u201d to Virginia.
