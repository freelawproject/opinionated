Laurence Anthony Masters (\u201cMasters\u201d) challenges an INS finding of removability for cultivating marijuana in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11358, his INS detention pending removal proceedings, and selective prosecution by the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-20\">We have jurisdiction over the petition for review of the BIA order pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-21\">We have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b737-23\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief. <em>Jessup v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>889 F.2d 831, 834 (9th Cir.1989). We lack jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>tion to review a removal order if the alien is removable for committing an aggravated felony, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), but we retain jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction. <em>Park v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 1018, 1021 (9th Cir.2001). Whether a particular offense constitutes an aggravated felony is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Ye v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1128, 1131 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Masters\u2019 California conviction for marijuana cultivation in violation of Section 11358 of the California Health and Safety Code is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), rendering him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). An aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) includes, among other things, a drug trafficking crime as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). A drug trafficking crime is \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). No connection to trafficking is required to meet the \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) definition of aggravated felony. <em>United States v. Zarate-Martinez, </em>133 F.3d 1194, 1200 (9th Cir.1998). Cultivation of marijuana is punishable under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812(c) (categorizing marijuana as controlled substance), 841(a)(1) (proscribing \u201cmanufacture [of] ... a controlled substance\u201d), 802(15) (defining \u201cmanufacture\u201d as \u201cproduction\u201d), 802(22) (defining \u201cproduction\u201d as \u201cplanting, cultivating, growing, or harvesting\u201d). Cultivation of marijuana is punishable as a felony under the Controlled Substances Act. <em>Zarate-Martinez, </em>133 F.3d at 1200 (using 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559 to determine whether a crime is punishable as a felony under \u00a7 924(c)(2)); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (defining a felony as any crime for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is more than one year); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) (authorizing up to five years imprisonment for cultivation of marijuana). Masters\u2019 conviction is for cultivation rather than distribution of marijuana and does not qualify for the misdemeanor exception of \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">We dismiss the petition for review of the BIA order and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Masters\u2019 challenge to his removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">Masters\u2019 claim that his INS detention was unconstitutional is now moot due to his deportation and release from INS detention. The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution \u201csubsists through all stages of federal judicial proceedings, trial and appellate .... The parties must continue to have a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., </em>494 U.S. 472, 477-78, 110 S.Ct. 1249, 108 L.Ed.2d 400 (1990) (internal quotations omitted). Stated another way, \u201c[i]f it appears that [the court is] without power to grant the relief requested, then th[e] case is moot.\u201d <em>Picrin-Peron v. Rison, </em>930 F.2d 773, 775 (9th Cir.1991). Masters was released from INS detention after this appeal was taken. Masters does not seek damages, nor could he in a habeas action. The relief that Masters requests-release from detention-can no longer be granted. We dismiss his detention claim as moot. <em>Cf. Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 8-16, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (dismissing as moot habeas petition challenging allegedly unconstitutional parole revocation procedures after petitioner was released from prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">The district court properly dismissed Masters\u2019 selective prosecution claim for lack of subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tion. Federal courts lack jurisdiction to \u201chear any cause or claim ... arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings ... against any Alien under [the Immigration and Nationality Act].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). A claim of selective prosecution constitutes a challenge to the Attorney General\u2019s decision to \u201ccommence proceedings,\u201d and federal courts lack jurisdiction to hear such claims. <em>Reno v. Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 486, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part as to case number 00-56160.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">DISMISSED as to case number 00-70353.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b737-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
