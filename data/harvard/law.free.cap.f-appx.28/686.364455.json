The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties; they are not recited herein, except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-25\">Equitable claims that the district court erred in concluding that the Leonards\u2019 claims do not fall within the settlement agreement\u2019s arbitration provision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16, \u201cestablishes that ... any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration [when] the problem at hand is ... construction of the contractas] language.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). In other words, a controversy falls within a valid arbitration clause \u201cunless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>Marchese v. Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc., </em>734 F.2d 414, 419 (9th Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The settlement agreement provides for arbitration \u201c[i]n the event any disagreements] should arise between Equitable and [the Leonards] regarding payment of claims for medical expense reimbursement under the [health insurance] policy.\u201d (second alteration in original). The Leonards\u2019 claims fall within this arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The Leonards challenge Equitable\u2019s threat to terminate, and then actual termination of the health insurance policy. When Equitable threatened to terminate coverage, it implicitly threatened to deny any future claims under the policy. Similarly, when it terminated the policy, it implicitly denied all future claims. Therefore, \u201cclaims for medical expense reimbursement under the policy\u201d are at the heart of the Leonards\u2019 suit. Accordingly, the Leonards\u2019 claims fall within the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Contrary to the Leonards\u2019 suggestion, it is irrelevant that nothing regarding the health insurance policy is in dispute. The arbitration provision is not limited to disputes that involve \u201cthe interpretation and performance of the contract itself.\u201d <em>Mediterranean Enters., Inc. v. Ssangyong Corp., </em>708 F.2d 1458, 1464 (9th Cir.1983). Rather, the provision covers all disputes that \u201cregard[ ]\u201d claims for reimbursement under the policy. In other words, the provision captures all disputes that have a \u201csignificant relationship\u201d to claims for reimbursement under the policy, even though the policy itself is not in dispute. <em>Simula, Inc. v. Autoliv, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 716, 721 (9th Cir.1999). As discussed above, the Leonards\u2019 claims bear a significant relationship to medical expense reimbursement under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Finally, we reject the Leonards\u2019 contention that paragraph fourteen of the settlement agreement allows for litigation of all disputes regarding the agreement itself. Paragraph fourteen merely provides for attorney\u2019s fees for litigation regarding the agreement. It does not guarantee a judicial forum for all disputes regarding the agreement. <em>See Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 24-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b710-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
