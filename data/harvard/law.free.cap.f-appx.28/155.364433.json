(\u201cRoche\u201d) for twenty-seven years, advised his supervisor in writing on May 23, 1994 that he intended to voluntarily retire on June 10, 1994. That was his last day of work, and his retirement became effective as of July 1, 1994. Later that year, Roche announced a voluntary early retirement program (a \u2018VERP\u201d). Chichelo sued Roche under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 93-406, 88 Stat. 829 (codified as amended in 29 U.S.C. 1001-1461 and in scattered sections of 26 U.S.C. (2001)), claiming Roche violated its fiduciary duty as an ERISA plan administrator by failing to disclose the VERP to him in response to his specific inquiries. Determining that Roche was not \u201cseriously considering\u201d a VERP when Chichelo inquired about that possibility, the District Court entered summary judgment for Roche.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-22\">On appeal, Chichelo argues the District Court\u2019s application and interpretation of \u201cserious consideration\u201d were erroneous as a matter of law, and that genuine issues of material fact were still in dispute on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-23\">This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Because we write solely for the parties, we need not set forth a detailed recitation of the background for this appeal and will limit our discussion to resolution of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This court gives plenary review to a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, reviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was entered. <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001). \u201c[S]ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is \u2018genuine,\u2019 that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Under ERISA, employers who administer their employees\u2019 retirement plans breach their fiduciary duty if they materially mislead employees who inquire regarding possible changes in those plans. <em>Fischer v. Phila. Elec. Co., </em>96 F.3d 1533, 1538 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cFischer II\u201d). An employer makes a material misrepresentation when it responds to employee inquiries by representing it is not considering a change to its pension plan, if it is in fact giving \u201cserious consideration\u201d to a change. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Chichelo made numerous inquiries of Roche executives asking whether Roche planned to implement a VERP. All of the executives responded that they knew of no such plans. Chichelo\u2019s last such inquiry was made on May 10, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The District Court construed a statement in Chichelo\u2019s May 23, 1994 resignation letter that \u201c[i]f Roche should prefer to elect that I retire early, perhaps there could be some compensatory program,\u201d as a last inquiry whether a VERP was being considered. App. at 16. Roche argues that \u201cin his resignation letter Chichelo did not inquire about whether the company might offer a VERP. What he did do was to ask for an individualized \u2018compensatory package.\u2019 \u201d Br. of Appellee at 33 n. 20. Although on a motion for summary judgment the District Court was obligated to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, see, e.g., <em>Meyer v. Riegel Prods. Corp., </em>720 F.2d 303, 307 n. 2 (3d Cir.1983), we believe the District Court adopted an unnecessarily generous view of what constitutes an employee inquiry. The \u201cserious consideration\u201d standard is designed to protect an employee by ensuring she has \u201cmaterial information on which [she] can rely in making employment decisions.\u201d <em>Fischer II, </em>96 F.3d at 1539. By sending a resignation letter, Chichelo had already made his employment decision. Chichelo\u2019s last explicit inquiry was May 10, but even if it was May 23, as the District Court found, the result would not be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The appropriateness of summary judgment for Roche turns on whether there is a genuine issue of material fact whether Roche gave \u201cserious consideration\u201d to implementing a VERP prior to May 23. An employer gives \u201cserious consideration\u201d to changing its plan \u201cwhen (1) a specific proposal (2) is being discussed for purposes of implementation (3) by senior management with the authority to implement the change.\u201d <em>Fischer II, </em>96 F.3d at 1539.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">A specific proposal follows the preliminary steps of \u201cgathering information, developing strategies, and analyzing options.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1539-40. At best, Roche may have been involved in these preliminary steps sometime after May 10. On May 1, 1994, Roche had signed a merger agreement with Syntex, another drug manufacturer. In preparing to consummate that agreement, Roche had begun to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>plan for the integration of the two companies. Roche executives contemplated that integration would entail dislocating some employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The earliest evidence Chichelo provided is that Patrick Zenner, Roche\u2019s President and CEO, appointed a task force in \u201clate spring\u201d to study the integration of the Roche and Syntex workforces. No evidence supports Chichelo\u2019s contention that one of this task force\u2019s mandates was to implement a VERP. It is only sheer speculation by Chichelo, and as such it is insufficient to create a genuine issue of fact whether a specific proposal existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Chichelo points to a number of documents as circumstantial evidence that Roche seriously considered a VERP prior to his last inquiry. First, Chichelo points to two memos from Zenner. The first memo, dated May 13, 1994, contained a \u201cbreakdown of the number of Syntex employees by business and function units.\u201d App. at 377. The second memo, dated May 26, 1994, recounts advice from competitors\u2019 CEOs regarding post-merger management, such as that one should \u201cmake decisions as quickly as you can.\u201d App. at 379. Neither of these memos create a genuine issue whether a specific proposal for a VERP existed at Roche prior to May 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The other evidence is equally unavailing. On June 9, 1994, the consultants Roche had retained the preceding year forwarded a brief summary of recent early retirement windows for other pharmaceutical companies to a manager in Roche\u2019s trust funds department. In mid-June, Roche sent a survey regarding VERPs to a number of other pharmaceutical companies. On July 20, Roche retained new consultants to assist in its integration with Syntex. On July 21, Roche\u2019s General Counsel, \u201c[i]n response to [Zenner\u2019s] request,\u201d provided Zenner with a memorandum outlining legal risks surrounding employment issues associated with the Roche/Syntex integration. That memo focused primarily on VERPs. App. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">All of this suggests there was growing momentum at Roche in favor of implementing a VERP. None of this evidence, however, creates a genuine issue of fact that a specific plan to implement a VERP existed at Roche prior to May 23, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Nor does the evidence create a material issue of fact that a VERP was being considered by decision makers at Roche for purposes of implementation prior to May 23. The discussion-for-implementation factor \u201crecognizes that a corporate executive can order an analysis of benefits alternatives or commission a comparative study without seriously considering implementing a change in benefits. Preliminary stages may also require interaction among upper level management, company personnel, and outside consultants.\u201d <em>Fischer II, </em>96 F.3d at 1540. At best, the evidence discussed above suggests that sometime in June Roche entered this preliminary stage of evaluating a VERP.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">We can understand the disappointment and frustration of a twenty-seven year employee who could have a much more favorable pension had he delayed his retirement by several months. But Chichelo was aware that there was talk about a possible merger and could have decided to delay his retirement while the internal changes that merger caused had been fully worked out. Under the law enunciated by this court, the employee cannot recover under ERISA for failure of the employer-plan administrator to give notice of impending changes unless the changes were under \u201cserious consideration.\u201d Chichelo has not produced evidence that the early retirement program was under serious consideration at the time of his inquiries.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Because no evidence supports a determination that a specific proposal for the purposes of implementation existed prior to the time Chichelo made his final inquiry, Roche cannot have \u201cseriously considered\u201d a VERP at that time. Accordingly, Chichelo has presented no genuine issue of material fact that Roche made material misrepresentations to him in violation of its fiduciary duty under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">For the reasons set forth, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
