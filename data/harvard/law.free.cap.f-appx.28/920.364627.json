O\u2019Connor (\u201cO\u2019Connor\u201d) appeals the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), affirming the decision of the Department of the Navy (\u201cAgency\u201d) that her service as a Police Officer does not entitle her to \u201cLaw Enforcement Officer\u201d (\u201cLEO\u201d) retirement credit under the Federal Early Retirement System (\u201cFERS\u201d). <em>O\u2019Connor v. Department of the Navy, </em>No. DC-0842-00-0179-1-1 (M.S.P.B. June 23, 2000). Because the Board\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with the law, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-23\">O\u2019Connor is a Warrants Officer, classified as a GS-083-05 Police Officer, assigned to the Norfolk Naval Base in Norfolk, Virginia. The Warrants Officer works under the direct supervision of the Administrative Division Officer. O\u2019Connor has served in this capacity since 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>The position description for the Warrants Officer states that the incumbent\u2019s primary duty is to serve various types of legal documents (warrants, capias, summons, subpoenas, etc.) received from law enforcement agencies on military and civilian personnel stationed on the Naval Base or assigned to ships and/or shore activities in the Naval Base area. The Warrants Officer is required to maintain a log of all documents received as well as to submit a monthly report of these documents to the Administrative Division Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Both parties have stipulated that O\u2019Con-nor was authorized to carry a firearm, had arrest authority, was required to maintain a level of physical fitness, but was not required to pass an annual physical fitness test as were those officers, who, unlike her, were hired after March 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">O\u2019Connor testified that she arrested approximately 1500-2000 people each year between 1997-1999. Investigation and apprehension of criminals accounted for 90-95% of her work day. Additionally, O\u2019Connor carries a weapon and handcuffs, carries a pager for quick notification, is on-call 24 hours a day, receives 40 hours of in-service training each year in a wide range of legal and police subjects, and drives a specially modified unmarked minivan for transporting prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">O\u2019Connor filed a request with the Agency for LEO retirement credit under FERS. The Agency rejected O\u2019Connor\u2019s request. She subsequently filed a timely appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The MSPB affirmed the Agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In its decision, the MSPB focused on the primary duties in O\u2019Connor\u2019s position description. However, other relevant evidence was considered, such as testimony from O\u2019Connor and her co-workers, as well as documentary evidence of warrants and arrests in which O\u2019Connor had participated. See <em>Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>60 M.S.P.R. 342, 345 (1994). The MSPB afforded O\u2019Connor the opportunity to prove entitlement to LEO retirement coverage by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The MSPB affirmed the final decision of the Agency denying LEO retirement credit to O\u2019Connor. The affirmance was based upon two factors: 1) the appellant\u2019s position description, testimony, and documentary evidence describing her duties as principally serving warrants issued by local and state law enforcement authorities; and, 2) no claim or showing was made that serving warrants issued by the Federal Magistrate was either the primary duty or accounted for any significant portion of O\u2019Connor\u2019s work day. The MSPB concluded that O\u2019Connor\u2019s position was administrative in nature and her primary duty was to serve various legal documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">O\u2019Connor filed a petition for review of the initial decision. The petition was denied and was made final. O\u2019Connor then filed a timely appeal of the MSPB\u2019s denial of LEO retirement credit to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">This court must affirm an MSPB decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)(1)-(3) (1994); <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). The burden of establishing reversible error in the Board\u2019s decision rests upon O\u2019Connor. <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">In order to qualify for LEO retirement coverage under 5 USC \u00a7 8412(d)(2), an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>appellant must satisfy the definition of Law Enforcement Officer as set forth at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(17). \u201cLaw Enforcement Officer\u201d is statutorily defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-4\">(A) an employee, the duties of whose position\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">(i) are primarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">(I) the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-7\">(II) the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-8\">(ii) are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited (through establishment of a maximum entry age and physical qualifications) to young and physically vigorous individuals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8410(17) (1994)</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">\u201cLaw Enforcement Officer\u201d is further defined, by regulation, to exclude employees whose duties involve \u201cmaintaining order, protecting life and property, guarding against or inspecting for violations of law, or investigating persons other than persons who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.902 (2000). \u201cPrimary duties\u201d are those that: a) are paramount in influence or weight, that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position; b) occupy a substantial portion of the individual\u2019s working time over a typical work cycle; and, c) are assigned on a regular and recurring basis. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 842.802 (2001). In general, if an employee spends an average of at least fifty percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his or her primary duties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">LEO retirement credit entitles the employee to retire upon attaining age 50 and completing 20 years of LEO service. <em>Bingaman v. Dept. of the Treasury, </em>127 F.3d 1431, 1433 (Fed.Cir.1997) (establishing the six factors required for LEO). The six factors which point toward LEO coverage are: 1) has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects; 2) is authorized to carry a firearm; 3) interrogates witnesses and suspects, giving Miranda warnings when appropriate; 4) works for long periods without a break; 5) is on call 24 hours a day; and, 6) is required to maintain a level of physical fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">O\u2019Connor seeks LEO retirement credit under FERS. 5 USC \u00a7 8412(d)(2) (1994); 5 USC \u00a7 8401(17)(1994). She argues that her primary duty is the investigation, apprehension and detention of criminals and criminal suspects, allegedly in accordance with 5 USC \u00a7 8412(d)(2). O\u2019Connor also contends that her duties satisfy the six <em>Bingaman </em>factors for determining whether a particular employee is entitled to LEO retirement credit. She submits that the satisfaction of several of the <em>Bingaman </em>factors automatically entitles her to LEO retirement credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">We find O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument to be unpersuasive, because she fails to address the basic reasoning of the lower court. The MSPB held that O\u2019Connor\u2019s position facilitated the work of non-Federal legal and law-enforcement organizations. In other words, she was ineligible for LEO credit because she was not primarily enforcing the criminal laws of the United States pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(17)(A)(i)(I). O\u2019Connor exclusively addressed her compliance with the \u201cinvestigation, apprehension, or detention\u201d portion of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8401(17)(A)(i)(I), but not the controlling section of that statute which requires that such investigation, apprehension and detention be under the laws of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Additionally, O\u2019Connor\u2019s reliance on <em>Bingaman </em>is misplaced. First, O\u2019Connor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>considers the <em>Bingaman </em>factors controlling over the text of the statute. This is an incorrect legal assumption. The <em>Bingaman </em>factors are simply a set of tools to assist the MSPB; they implement but do not supersede the language of the statute itself. <em>Hall v. Department of the Treasury, </em>264 F.3d 1050 (Fed.Cir.2001). Second, <em>Bingaman </em>can be distinguished from this case. In <em>Bingaman, </em>the court formulated the six factors only after deciding that the appellant\u2019s position, helping the Customs Service with drug interdiction, primarily involved the enforcement of federal laws. O\u2019Connor has not made such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Because the Board\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion, is supported by substantial evidence and is otherwise in accordance with the law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
