Section 18, </em>976 F.2d 515, 519 (9th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. $31,697.59 Cash, </em>665 F.2d 908, 904 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Bejar-Matrecios, </em>618 F.2d 81, 83-84 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Ivors v. United States, </em>581 F.2d 1362, 1367 (9th Cir.1978). Granados argues that <em>Haring v. Prosise, </em>462 U.S. 306, 103 S.Ct. 2368, 76 L.Ed.2d 595 (1983), limited the doctrine of collateral estoppel to issues that are \u201cactually litigated,\u201d as opposed to plea-bargained. <em>Id. </em>at 316. <em>Haring, </em>however, merely clarified that the doctrine \u201cprecludes the litigation of only those issues <em>necessary to support </em>the judgment entered in the first action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 103 S.Ct. 2368 (emphasis added). That Granados entered the United States without inspection was a predicate for his conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325. Granados is consequently estopped from relitigating this issue in his deportation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Granados also contends that the fact of his conviction alone is insufficient to establish deportability, because a violation of section 1325 is not among the offenses specified in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2) (1994), for which a showing of a conviction is enough to support deportation. The Board, however, used Granados\u2019s conviction not as the basis for deportation under section 1251(a)(2), but to preclude him from relitigating the issue of whether he entered the country without inspection in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994). Used for this purpose, Granados\u2019s guilty plea and resulting conviction are \u201cwholly adequate to support deportation.\u201d <em>Larios-Mendez v. INS, </em>597 F.2d 144, 146 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We likewise reject Granados\u2019s claim that, because his penalty for the violation of section 1325 was relatively minor, he lacked sufficient incentive to litigate the charge. Although Granados\u2019s sentence was only forty-five days, it may have been reduced as a result of his guilty plea, and is therefore not indicative of his incentive. Because the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by section 1325 is six months, Granados\u2019s \u201cprior conviction [was] for a serious offense so that [he] was motivated to fully litigate the charges.\u201d <em>Section 18, </em>976 F.2d at 518 (quoting <em>Ayers v. City of Richmond, </em>895 F.2d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Judge POLITZ dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
