Singletearry, an African American male, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Transnet, Inc. (\u201cTransnet\u201d), a travel agency, pursuant to Transnet\u2019s motion for summary judgment in Singletearry\u2019s civil action alleging wrongful termination based on race under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In 1999, Transnet terminated Singletearry\u2019s employment. After Singletearry\u2019s termination, he administratively exhausted his claim that he was wrongfully terminated based on his race. Singletearry then brought suit in district court, and Transnet moved for summary judgment. The district court, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Singletearry, held Transnet presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to terminate Singletearry\u2019s employment: Transnet\u2019s inability to profitably employ Singletearry in light of Transnet\u2019s declining revenues. The district court granted Transnet\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding Singletearry could not show a genuine factual dispute over whether Transnet\u2019s stated reason for Singletearry\u2019s termination was pretextual. Singletearry appeals, arguing the district court erred in holding Transnet\u2019s stated reason for his termination was not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">Singletearry\u2019s appeal is without merit; the district court did not err in holding Transnet articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for Singletearry\u2019s termination. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253-54, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
