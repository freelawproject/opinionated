The underlying facts are described in <em>Seaworth v. Pearson, </em>203 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 895, 121 S.Ct. 226, 148 L.Ed.2d 160 (2000), in which we affirmed the dismissal of that action as meritless. Some months after we issued our decision, Seaworth filed a motion for relief from judgment on the basis of fraud, and other circumstances justifying relief, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3) and (6). He also moved for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(g). The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied his motions, and having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Assuming, without deciding, that Seaworth\u2019s request for relief under Rule 60(b)(3) is timely, Seaworth offered nothing to show that Pearson or his attorney did anything to prevent Seaworth from fully and fairly presenting his case, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3); <em>Greiner v. City of Champlin, </em>152 F.3d 787, 789 (8th Cir.1998), nor did he show exceptional circumstances otherwise justifying relief from the final judgment, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6); <em>Brooks v. Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., </em>113 F.3d 903, 904-905 (8th Cir.1997). Also, nothing in Seaworth\u2019s filings indicated any conduct justifying Seaworth\u2019s request for sanctions. <em>See </em>Fed R. Civ. P. 56(g); <em>Fort Hill Builders, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Grange Mut. Ins. Co., </em>866 F.2d 11, 16 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">. The Honorable Michael J.
