This Court neither undertakes a <em>de novo </em>review of the decision, nor does it re-weigh the evidence in the record. <em>Monsour Med. Ctr. v. Heckler, </em>806 F.2d 1185, 1190 (3d Cir.1986). \u201cWe will not set the Commissioner\u2019s decision aside if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d <em>Hartanft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is evidence that is less than a preponderance, but more than a mere scintilla. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). That is, it \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence, but rather \u2018such rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>vant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)); <em>accord Hartranft, </em>181 F.3d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We have carefully considered Thomas\u2019s arguments in this appeal and find that they lack merit. For the reasons substantially stated in the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation adopted by the District Court, we find that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision was supported by substantial evidence. In particular, we agree with the District Court that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination to reject the opinion of Thomas\u2019s treating physician as contradicted by other medical evidence. The record shows that Thomas\u2019s sarcoidosis only results in serious limitations during the relatively rare periods of exacerbation. Further, we find no problems with the hypothetical question the ALJ posed to the vocational expert, and agree with the District Court that the question reflected all factors and limitations actually supported by the record of Thomas\u2019s individual case. We therefore affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
