Kirk BOVIE, Petitioner-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b758-7\">No. 01-1097.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b758-8\">United States Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b758-10\">July 31, 2001.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b758-21\">Before HENRY, BRISCOE, and MURPHY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b758-22\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b758-23\">HENRY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b758-24\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-25\">Kirk A. Bovie, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability regarding the denial of his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>tion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Mr. Bovie was convicted by a jury of nine counts of drug-related charges stemming from his participation in a cocaine distribution organization. He was sentenced to 156 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Mr. Bovie\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">On December 4, 1998, Mr. Bovie filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that raised numerous claims, including ineffective assistance of counsel. On November 8, 2000, the district court rejected the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, determined the remaining claims were procedurally barred, and denied the \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Mr. Bovie next filed a motion to reconsider pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). However, that motion did not request reconsideration of the issue determined in the court\u2019s November 8, 2000, order. Instead, Mr. Bovie\u2019s motion to reconsider raised a new claim pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court ruled that this new claim would require a new \u00a7 2255 motion, which Mr. Bovie could not bring without first obtaining permission from this court to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255. Thus, the district court denied the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Because Mr. Bovie failed to obtain our authorization, the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide his Rule 59(e) motion. We have held that a petitioner may not circumvent the restrictions on filing second or successive petitions by filing a post-judgment motion pursuant to Rule 60(b). <em>See Lopez v. Douglas, </em>141 F.3d 974, 975-76 (10th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (holding that petitioner\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion was an implied application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A) for leave to file a second habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2254 in the district court); <em>United States v. Sternberg, </em>No. 00-3065, 2001 WL 170479, *1-2 (10th Cir. Feb. 21, 2001) (holding Rule 60(b)(6) motion may not circumvent the restrictions on filing second or successive petition in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding). We see no distinction between the Rule 60(b)(6) motions in those cases and the Rule 59(e) motion filed by Mr. Bovie here. <em>See Bisaccia v. United States, </em>Nos. 97 CV 6683, 3659, 2001 WL 1677747, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 18, 2000) (\u201cRule 59 is no more available than Rule 60 as a vehicle for circumventing the statutory bar to successive \u00a7 2255 petitions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">We therefore construe Mr. Bovie\u2019s motion as an implied application to file a second or successive motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In order to obtain authorization from this court to file a second \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, Mr. Bovie must make the requisite showing under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Specifically, he must show: \u201c(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the offense; or (2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Following a review of Mr. Bovie\u2019s implied application, we determine his application does not meet the requirements under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">The requirement that a new rule of constitutional law is made retroactive to cases on collateral review is \u201csatisfied only if [the Supreme Court] has held that the new rule is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2482, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001) (interpreting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A)); <em>see also Browning v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1262, 1266 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cWe thus look to the Supreme Court to see whether it has made the rule retroactive to eases on collateral review....\u201d). The rule announced in <em>Apprendi </em>has not yet been made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, and thus it may not be used as a basis for second or successive habeas applications. <em>See Daniels v. United States, </em>254 F.3d 1180, 1185-86 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cUnder current habeas law, therefore, applications to file second or successive habeas petitions based on <em>Apprendi </em>will be dismissed until such time as the Supreme Court chooses specifically to declare the new rule applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d) (citing <em>Browning, </em>241 F.3d at 1266-67).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s December 27, 2000 order denying Mr. Bovie\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion, and DENY Mr. Bovie\u2019s implied application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court and his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b758-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
