DAVIS (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">This appeal presents the question of whether an injury suffered by appellant at the hands of a third party was \u201cdirected against [him] in the course of\u201d his employment. John Doe, appellant, appeals from the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City that reversed an award of benefits made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. In this workers\u2019 compensation case, appellant raises two issues, which we have combined and rephrased to be whether the circuit court properly ruled that appellant\u2019s injuries were not covered by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> II.Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2007 Supp.), \u00a7 \u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor and Employment Article (LE or Act). For the reasons set forth below, we shall hold that appellant\u2019s injuries are not covered by the Act because the assault that caused them was not \u201cdirected\u201d against him in the course of his employment. Hence, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Background and Procedure I</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">According to an agreed statement of facts, appellant worked as a banquet houseman at the BWI Hilton Hotel in Linthicum. He was responsible for setting up tables in the banquet hall.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The events of this case began with a disagreement with a coworker, Keya Gardner, over work supplies, specifically a supply cart. Appellant had stocked the cart. After appellant took a break, he returned to find the cart missing. He then sought to retrieve the cart from Gardner. Gardner refused to allow appellant to take the cart and, while he was taking the cart, appellant\u2019s hand touched Gardner\u2019s hand. Gardner then became enraged and began to curse. She followed appellant into a banquet room, continuing her rant, and also upset several banquet tables that appellant had prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Gardner, still in a rage, used her cell phone to call a friend, Darryl Newsome. She told him that \u201c[appellant] touched my hand and you should come get your thing and take care of him.\u201d The argument moved to the lobby and came to the attention of the banquet supervisor. Apparently in response to the argument between appellant and Gardner, appellant\u2019s supervisor told appellant that, since his shift was just about over, he should clock out and go home. Appellant changed into street clothes and, at about 9:38 p.m., signed out to go home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>He offered a ride to a Mr. Wees, who lived in Baltimore. As they left the hotel lot, appellant saw Darryl Newsome. Shortly thereafter, Gardner left the hotel lot in a separate vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The stipulated facts portray a chase as Gardner and appellant were traveling at a high rate of speed. Appellant brought his vehicle to a stop in a dark alley behind Wees\u2019s home in Baltimore City, about thirteen miles from the hotel. New-some arrived in his vehicle, pulled behind appellant\u2019s car, emerged and shot appellant, rendering him a paraplegic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">On August 19, 2008, appellant filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A hearing on this claim was conducted on December 4, 2008 before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (Commission). On December 12, 2008, the Commission awarded appellant temporary total dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ability benefits and associated medical expenses. The Commission denied the employer\u2019s motion for rehearing on January 16, 2009 and, on January 26, the employer filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2008 Supp.), \u00a7 9-737 of the Labor and Employment Article (LE).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Initially, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The circuit court denied these motions and set the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>matter for trial. Following a hearing on April 27, 2010, the circuit court reversed the Commission\u2019s decision awarding benefits and this appeal followed. In overturning the Commission\u2019s award, the circuit court determined that appellant\u2019s injuries were not covered by the Act. The trial judge\u2019s ruling from the bench included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">At the proceedings below, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission awarded benefits to the claimant. As I stated, the employer and insurer have appealed that award. The central issue in this case is whether the claimant\u2019s injury is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Here, the appellant employer and insurer maintain that the only category of injury that could make the claimant\u2019s injury compensable falls under the ambit of Section 9-101(b)(2) of the Labor &amp; Employment Article. That section defines an accidental injury as being;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201can injury caused by a willful or negligent act of a third person directed against a covered employee in the course of the employment of the covered employee; ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">It is noteworthy, as the appellant has maintained in this appeal, that the other two subsections of Section 9-101(b) cover actions that; \u201carise out of and in the course of employment\u201d, as opposed to the language in Section 9-101(b)(2) that does not include language that \u201carises out of and in the course of employment\u201d and only includes the language \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d The plain language of the statute restricts compensation to injuries resulting from willful acts to only those injuries that occur in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">[I]t is well settled that in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d refers to the time, place and circumstance in which the injury occurred, and requires that an injury take place while the employee is at the place of employment performing his duties, or engaged in some task incident to [his] duties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Here, there is no dispute that the claimant was not at work and was not performing any task incident to his employment when he was most unfortunately, and regrettably shot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The circuit court surveyed case law from other jurisdictions in which compensation awards were granted in similar factual situations. Citing the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>282 Md. 422, 384 A.2d 748 (1978), the court rejected appellant\u2019s argument that this case presents an exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d\u2014the proximity rule\u2014under which coverage for an injury, while generally excluded, would be allowed under certain circumstances. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Specifically, the claimant highlights this exception [proximity rule] and argues that exposure to a co-worker who would seek to have him killed over a minor workplace dispute, constitutes a special hazard that really should allow this injury to be compensable, even though injury occurred over thirteen miles from the place of employment, after the employee punched out for the day, and while the employee was not engaged in any activity on the employer\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">The proximity rule states that, by virtue of being in close proximity to his place of employment, an employee who is subjected to special risks beyond those to which the general public is exposed, and sustains an injury from that enhanced risk, sustains a compensable injury even though the injury occurs off the property of the workplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">While geographic proximity is not the sole factor at play under the proximity rule it clearly is a factor, and one that, under the facts of this case, regrettably, the claimant can not satisfy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">Clearly, the Court understands the significant and tragic nature of this case. But I am required to apply the law as the Court understands it to be written at this time. And so, based on that, I do find that the employer and insurer has carried their burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of the evidence, that the decision reached by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission was wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Therefore, based on the law as it exists today, this Court has no choice but to reverse the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s award of compensation and deny the claim for benefits that were made on behalf of the claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">This timely appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Appellate scrutiny of a workers\u2019 compensation decision depends upon the manner of the circuit court\u2019s judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision. There are two modalities of judicial review in the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">A party dissatisfied by the action of the Commission may seek review in a circuit court by either proceeding on the record made before the Commission (much like judicial review of the final action of most state administrative agencies) or receive a new evidentiary hearing and decision before a jury [or the court] (much like an original civil complaint brought in a circuit court). Under either process ... the agency\u2019s decision is entitled to a presumption of correctness that must be overcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-11\"><em>Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 67-68, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006). In the case before us, the circuit court conducted a <em>de novo </em>trial based on stipulated facts. Although the Commission\u2019s decision is presumptively correct, <em>see Wal Mart Stores, Inc. v. Holmes, </em>416 Md. 346, 357, 7 A.3d 13 (2010), \u201cthe propriety of the Commission\u2019s original fact finding is a matter of no consequenee[,]\u201d where there is a <em>de novo </em>proceeding in the circuit court. <em>Bd. of Educ. for Montgomery County v. Spradlin, </em>161 Md.App. 155, 173, 867 A.2d 370 (2005). This is so because the circuit court in a trial <em>de novo </em>engages in a fresh consideration of the facts. <em>See Keystone Masonry Corp. v. Hernandez, </em>156 Md.App. 496, 505-06, 847 A.2d 493 (2004). Because there was no testimony at the hearing, the court was presented with an agreed statement of facts and ruled on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>issue of coverage as a matter of law. Accordingly, the review of any factual findings by the court would be for clear error. <em>Granite State Ins. Co. v. Hernandez, </em>191 Md.App. 548, 557-58, 992 A.2d 528 (2010). Our review of the circuit court\u2019s conclusions of law is <em>de novo. See id., </em>191 Md.App. at 558, 992 A.2d 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The \u201cpurpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act ... is to \u2018provide employees with compensation for loss of earning capacity, regardless of fault, resulting from accidental injury ... occurring in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanchez v. Potomac Abatement, Inc., </em>417 Md. 76, 82 n. 4, 8 A.3d 737 (2010) (quoting <em>DeBusk v. Johns Hopkins Hospital, </em>342 Md. 432, 437, 677 A.2d 73 (1996)). The Act\u2019s principle objective of compensating the injured worker \u201cpursuant to the statutory plan for disabilities which are occupationally related\u201d is its \u201ccenterline.\u201d <em>See </em>Richard P. Gilbert &amp; Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, \u00a7 2.02 at 2-2 (3d ed.2007). Worker\u2019s compensation legislation balances the interests of both employees and employers, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4_\">[a]t the same time ... the Act also recognizes the need to protect employers from the unpredictable nature and expense of litigation, and the public from the overwhelming tax burden of \u201ccaring for the helpless human wreckage found [along] the trail of modern industry.\u201d <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Company v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 80, 160 A. 804, 807, (1932); <em>Brenner v. Brenner, </em>127 Md. 189, 192, 96 A. 287, 288 (1915). <em>See </em>Ch. 800 of the Acts of 1914; <em>see also Belcher v. T. Rowe Price, </em>329 Md. 709, 736-37, 621 A.2d 872, 885-86 (1993). In other words, the Act provides employees suffering from work-related accidental injuries, regardless of fault, with a certain, efficient, and dignified form of compensation. In exchange, employees abandon common law remedies, thereby relieving employers from the vagaries of tort liability. <em>Belcher, </em>329 Md. at 736, 621 A.2d at 885 (citing 1 Arthur Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 1.20 at 2 (1992)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Polomski v.

It must be interpreted to effectuate its general purpose and not strictly construed. Where there is a conflict in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law, questions of construction should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard, Inc. v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 425, 45 A.2d 79 (1945) (citations omitted). <em>See Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Cassidy, </em>338 Md. 88, 97, 656 A.2d 757 (1995). \u201cThe doctrine of liberal construction does not mean, however, that coverage may be granted beyond that which is authorized by the provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Barnes v.

Hence, the \u201cmere occurrence of an accident is an insufficient basis upon which to predicate a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. 1, 9, 690 A.2d 990 (1997) (citing Gilbert &amp; Humphreys, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 5.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Elements of Entitlement: LE \u00a7 9-101 (b)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Act defines the term \u201caccidental injury\u201d at LE \u00a7 9-101(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A claim based on the intentional or negligent act of a third person that results in an injury is properly considered in light of the definition of \u201caccidental injury\u201d as set forth in LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(2). Nevertheless, it is instructive to review the two elements that make up the general definition of accidental injury as set forth in LE \u00a7 9\u2014101(b)(1), because appellant also effectively maintains that his injury arose out of his employment because it originated in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>In general, benefits are awardable to a covered employee who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence two elements of entitlement, that the claimant suffered an injury that both \u201carose out of\u2019 and occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his or her employment. <em>See Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Restaurant., </em>374 Md. 566, 574, 823 A.2d 687 (2003). <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 9-501.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To satisfy the \u201carises out of\u2019 element, a claimant must establish that the injury \u201cresults from some obligation, condition, or incident.of employment.\u201d <em>Livering v. Richardson\u2019s, </em>374 Md. at 574, 823 A.2d 687. Judge Raker pointed out in <em>Livering </em>that \u201cMaryland has adopted the positional-risk test to determine whether an injury arose out of employment.\u201d <em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 575, 823 A.2d 687 (citing <em>Mulready v. Univ. Research Corp., </em>360 Md. 51, 66, 756 A.2d 575 (2000)). In his treatise, Professor Larson describes this standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyR\">An important and growing number of courts are accepting the full implications of the positional-risk test: An injury arises out of the employment if it would not have occurred but for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed claimant in the position where he was injured. It is even more common for the test to be approved and used in particular situations. This theory supports compensation, for example, in cases of stray bullets, roving lunatics, and other situations in which the only connection of the employment with the injury is that its obligations placed the employee in the particular place at the particular time when he or she was injured by some neutral force, meaning by \u201cneutral\u201d neither personal to the claimant nor distinctly associated with the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB1\">A. Larson &amp; L. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 3.05 at 3-6 (2011) (footnote omitted). The \u201carising out of\u2019 element thus embraces injuries resulting from employment that is incidental to the work, although \u201cnot specifically required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the employment.\u201d <em>Livering, </em>374 Md. at 576, 823 A.2d 687. A \u201c \u2018reasonably incidental\u2019 relationship between the injury and the claimant\u2019s work is sufficient, in itself, to establish that an injury arose out of employment[.]\u201d <em>Jennifer v.

Servs., </em>176 Md.App. 211, 223, 932 A.2d 1213 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">As to the second element in the definition set forth in LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(1), the \u201c \u2018course of employment\u2019 test directs our attention to the time, place, and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v.

Judge Karwacki continued in <em>Wade:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">An analysis of the occupational correlation of these factors \u201cdemands that the injury be shown to have arisen within the time and space boundaries of the employment, and in the course of an activity whose purpose is related to the employment.\u201d ... Questions pertinent to this inquiry are: 1) when the employment began and ended, 2) whether the continuity of the period was broken, and 3) how far the employee placed himself or herself outside the employment during that period....

When the employer provides the mode of transportation, the predicate for an award of compensation under the Act is even more clear\u2014courts have held that injuries incurred under these circumstances are ordinarily compensable because the employer has broadened the scope of employment by its provision of the transportation____Throughout this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>analysis, however, it must be borne in mind that whether a given injury is in the course of the employment is determined by the facts and circumstances of each particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Montgomery County v. Wade, </em>345 Md. at 11-12, 690 A.2d 990 (citations and internal punctuation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Appellant\u2019s injuries do not qualify as an \u201caccidental injury\u201d as defined in LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(l). Simply put, his injury did not arise out of his employment. Although appellant suffered from his association with Gardner, the \u201ccausative danger\u201d was not \u201cincidental to the nature of his work\u201d and was independent of his employment relationship. <em>See Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Harris, </em>232 Md. 180, 183-84, 192 A.2d 479 (1963). Appellant essentially contends that his injury originated in his employment. He cites the fact that Gardner conspired with Newsome to kill him while she was present at work. We do not agree that appellant\u2019s injury had its origin in his employment for purposes of defining an \u201caccidental injury,\u201d and are unable to conclude that it arose out of his work, notwithstanding that the dispute that ultimately led to his tragic injuries took place at the job. There is nothing incidental to appellant\u2019s duties in a personal dispute that, while being played out on the job, was peculiar to the nature of appellant\u2019s duties as a banquet houseman. Gardner\u2019s criminal behavior was not an incident of appellant\u2019s employment. Indeed, it is this type of aberrant behavior that led the General Assembly to enact LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(2), because third-party actions of this nature are generally not incidental to a claimant\u2019s work and, thus, would not \u201carise out of\u2019 a claimant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\n<em>Single Element in Third-party Assault Cases\u2014LE \u00a7 9-101 (b)(2).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Although appellant would not prevail on a claim for an accidental injury as that term is defined in LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(1), because his injury did not arise out of his employment, we turn to the issue before us, <em>i.e., </em>whether his injury constitutes an \u201caccidental injury\u201d within the definition of LE \u00a7 9\u2014101(b)(2). To satisfy this definition, appellant need only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>demonstrate that he suffered an injury caused by a third party in the course of appellant\u2019s employment. LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(2) reflects the General Assembly\u2019s intent to \u201c \u2018broaden the scope of the compensation statute to include as compensa-ble an injury not attributable to the working environment provided it' was incurred in the course of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>282 Md. 422, 425, 384 A.2d 748 (1978) (quoting <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. 160, 165, 225 A.2d 431 (1967)). The Legislature relieved claimants, who had been injured by an intentional or negligent act of a third party, of the difficult burden of demonstrating the direct causative nexus between a sudden irrational act of a third party and the claimant\u2019s employment. Accordingly, in the case of an injury inflicted by a third party, the Act provides that a claimant need only demonstrate that the willful act of that party was directed at the claimant \u201cin the course of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">This provision, in both its current and preceding statutory form, has been addressed in a number of Maryland decisions. In <em>Giant Food, Inc v. Gooch, </em>the claimant, a parking lot attendant for Giant Food Stores, was shot and wounded in the parking lot of his store shortly before he was to begin work. The employer and carrier asserted that Gooch was not entitled to benefits under the Act, claiming that an injury that was inflicted by a third person did not \u201carise out of\u2019 Gooch\u2019s employment. The Court of Appeals rejected the claim that Gooch was not entitled to an award, and concluded that a claimant who is injured as the result of the wilful or negligent act of a third person need not establish that the injury \u201carose out of\u2019 his employment, but only that it be demonstrated that the injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 the employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">It is only reasonable to infer, therefore, that the legislature when it said that accidental personal injury as defined and made compensable by \u00a7 15 of Art. 101 was also to include \u201can injury caused by the wilful or negligent act of a third person directed against an employee in the course of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>employment\u201d intended to broaden the scope of the compensation statute to include as compensable an injury not attributable to the working environment provided it was incurred in the course of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch, </em>245 Md. at 165, 225 A.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>the employee was shot by her estranged paramour while she was at work. The employer challenged the compensation award made to her dependent on a number of grounds. First, the employer averred that the provision allowing for recovery for an injury inflicted by a third party was unconstitutional because it permitted an award even though the employee\u2019s death \u201cwas not causally connected with her employment, and was in no sense due to inherent conditions of her work.\u201d Reviewing its decision in <em>Gooch </em>and citing to other cases, the Court of Appeals rejected the employer\u2019s challenge and concluded that the injury was compensable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">We think the employer\u2019s obligation under \u00a7 67(6) to pay compensation on behalf of an employee injured in the course of his employment by the wilful or negligent act of a third party does rest upon the employer-employee relationship. The injury is work-related in the sense that even though it arose for personal reasons not attributable to the working environment, it occurred within the course of employment on the employer\u2019s premises at a time when the employee was obliged to be present and at work; in other words, the employee\u2019s presence at the nursing home when the peril struck was a necessary part of her employment and the injury was inflicted in the course of that employment. In view of this nexus, and because the appellants have failed to carry the burden of establishing the invalidity of \u00a7 67(6), we think the strong presumption of constitutionality afforded to the statute has not been overcome. It may be that \u00a7 67(6) will lead to results unjust to employers in some cases, but if a causal connection between the injury and the employment beyond the requirement that the injury occur in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of employment is to be mandated, it can only be done by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>Edgewood Nursing Home, </em>282 Md. at 430, 384 A.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In both <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Gooch </em>and <em>Edgewood Nursing Home v. Maxwell, </em>the Court had no difficulty in concluding that the injuries in each case were suffered \u201cin the course of\u2019 each employee\u2019s employment. Both employees were injured on the premises; one was just preparing for work while the other was killed during working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We conclude that appellant did not suffer an \u201caccidental injury\u201d because the assault was not directed against him in the course of his employment. The injury, tragic as it is, did not occur in the course of appellant\u2019s employment. Primarily, appellant\u2019s claim is precluded by operation of the \u201cgoing and coming rule,\u201d which takes a claimant\u2019s injury out of the course of his or her employment. In general, injuries suffered by an employee traveling on the way to or from his place of employment are not compensable under the Act because they do not arise \u201cout of and in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Frederick County v. Vache, </em>349 Md. 526, 531, 709 A.2d 155 (1998) (citations omitted). The \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d embodies this concept and thus</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">excludes injuries sustained while traveling to or from a place of employment, as falling outside the \u201ccourse of employment.\u201d Authorities reason that the hazards of such travel are ones to which the public at large is exposed while undertaking personal errands and, thus, should not be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Richard P. Gilbert <em>&amp; </em>Robert L. Humphreys, Jr., Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 6.6 (2d ed.1993); <em>see also Director of Finance v.

Moreover, another</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">reason for the rule is that the workmen\u2019s compensation law contemplates an employee engaged in service growing out of his employment. An employee who is merely going to or coming from his work is not rendering any such service. He is therefore exposed to the hazards encountered on such trips, not as an employee, but rather as a member of the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v.

Murphy pointed out for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Onto this general rule, however, the courts have engrafted several exceptions when compensation benefits may properly be granted. Thus, where the employer furnishes the employee free transportation to and from work, the employee is deemed to be on duty, and an injury sustained by the employee during such transportation arises out of and in the course of employment. <em>Tavel v. Bechtel Corporation, </em>242 Md. 299, 304, 219 A.2d 43 (1966); <em>Rumple v. Henry H. Meyer Co., Inc., </em>208 Md. 350, 357, 118 A.2d 486 (1955). Compensation may also be properly awarded where the employee is injured while traveling along or across a public road between two portions of the employer\u2019s premises. <em>Wiley Mfg., supra, </em>280 Md. at 206 [373 A.2d 613]; <em>Proctor-Silex [Corp.] v. DeBrick, </em>253 Md. 477, 482, 252 A.2d 800 (1969). The \u201cproximity\u201d exception allows compensation for an injury sustained off-premises, but while the employee is exposed to a peculiar or abnormal degree to a danger which is annexed as a risk incident to the employment. <em>Pariser Bakery v. Koontz, </em>239 Md. 586, 591, 212 A.2d 324 (1965); <em>see Md. Paper Products Co. v. Judson, </em>215 Md. 577, 584-588, 139 A.2d 219 (1958). Injuries incurred while the employee travels to or from work in performing a special mission or errand for the employer are likewise compensable. <em>Reisinger-Siehler Co. v.

A single exception is relevant in the case before us, viz. the \u201cproximity\u201d or \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception. Upon review of the record, however, we conclude that the \u201cspecial hazard\u201d exception to the going and coming rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Frederick County v. Vache, </em>the Court elaborated on the proximity rule or exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">We have said the proximity rule has two components, both of which must be satisfied in order for the rule to apply. The first component is \u201cthe presence of a special hazard at the particular off-premises point.\u201d ... The second component \u201cis the close association of the access route with the premises.\u201d With regard to the first component, we have described this special hazard as a \u201cpeculiar and abnormal exposure to a common peril beyond that to which the general public was subjected.\u201d ... Furthermore, the \u201cgravamen of the rule\u201d is not that the employee was near [his] workplace, but by virtue of [his] proximity to [his] workplace [he] was exposed to a danger peculiarly or to an abnormal degree greater than the degree to which the general public is exposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\"><em>Frederick County v. Vache, </em>349 Md. at 538-39, 709 A.2d 155 (quoting <em>Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. at 208, 215, 373 A.2d 613). As stated by Judge Levine in <em>Wiley Mfg. Co., </em>\u201cthe proximity rule is identified with those cases involving accidents which occur at a point where the employee is within range of dangers peculiarly associated with the employment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>280 Md. at 208, 373 A.2d 613 (citing 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 15.00 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">In the case before us, we are unable to conclude that appellant, who was en route to his home when he was shot by Newsome, suffered an \u201caccidental injury\u201d in the course of his employment. Notwithstanding appellant\u2019s insistence that his injury need not have \u201coccurred\u201d in the course of employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>we conclude otherwise. Although the term \u201coccur\u201d is not specified in the Act, we think it clear that the injury must \u201coccur\u201d in the course of employment to be compensable. Again, the Act compensates an injured employee for an \u201caccidental injury ... <em>occurring </em>in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. Potomac Abatement, Inc., supra, </em>417 Md. at 82 n. 4. <em>See Livering, </em>374 Md. at 576, 823 A.2d 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\n<em>Delayed Injury &amp; Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Numerous are the cases from various jurisdictions that address \u201cdelayed injury\u201d cases in which the employee is assaulted some distance from the workplace, but the assault originated at the workplace or in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment. One such case, cited by appellant, <em>Matter of Field v. Charmette Knitted Fabric Company, </em>245 N.Y. 139, 156 N.E. 642 (1927), has been \u201cregarded as the grandfather of such cases.\u201d <em>Matter of Malacarne v. City of Yonkers Parking Authority, </em>41 N.Y.2d 189, 391 N.Y.S.2d 402, 359 N.E.2d 992, 996 (1976). In <em>Field, </em>the company general manager and superintendent, Mr. Field, discharged an employee, Magid, for performing unsatisfactory work. When Field ordered Magid off the premises, an argument followed. After intervention by other employees, Magid left. \u201cA few minutes later, Field went downstairs and out of the building.\u201d Magid was waiting and, after challenging Field, struck the latter in the face, causing Field to fall and suffer a fatal head injury. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the award. Justice Cardozo explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">Our decisions make it plain that the injury to Field was one that might fairly be found by the triers of the facts to have arisen \u201cout of\u2019 the employment (Workmen\u2019s Comp. Act; Cons.Laws, ch. 67, \u00a7 2, subd. 7).[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Magid was the aggressor in an assault provoked by the discharge and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ensuing war of words <em>(Matter of Rydeen v. Monarch Furniture Co., </em>240 N.Y. 295 [148 N.E. 527 (1925) ]; <em>Matter of Knocks v. Metal Packing Corp., </em>231 N.Y. 78 [131 N.E. 741 (1921) ]; <em>Matter of Fried v. Quinlan, Inc., </em>242 N.Y. 496 [152 N.E. 899 (1926) ]; <em>Matter of Verschleiser v. Stern &amp; Son, </em>229 N.Y. 192 [128 N.E. 126 (1920) ]; <em>cf. Zygmuntowicz v. Am. Steel &amp; Wire Co., </em>240 Mass. 421, 424 [134 N.E. 385 (1922) ]). The argument is made, however, that the injury did not arise \u201cin the course of employment\u201d (Workmen\u2019s Comp. Act, \u00a7 2, subd. 7), for the reason that Field, after finishing the work of the day, had left the premises or plant (\u00a7 2, subd. 4), and was out upon the public sidewalk. If he had been struck within the threshold, liability would be conceded. Because he was struck without, liability has failed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">We think the line of division is drawn too narrowly and closely when circumstances of place are thus considered to the exclusion of all others. The quarrel outside of the mill was merely a continuation or extension of the quarrel begun within. Magid, pulled away from his enemy indoors, was waiting for his vengeance at the gate, and took it on the instant. The rule is well settled that an employee, even after closing time, is in the course of employment until a suitable opportunity has been given to leave the place of work <em>(Matter of Lynch v. City of New York, </em>242 N.Y. 115, 118 [151 N.E. 149 (1926)]). For that reason, claims have been sustained for injuries on stairs or in elevators though the stairs or the elevators were not controlled by the employer, a tenant of a loft above <em>(Matter of Ross v. Howieson, </em>232 N.Y. 604 [134 N.E. 589 (1922) ], reversing 198 App. Div. 674 [191 N.Y.S. 276 (1921) ], on the dissenting opinion in that court; <em>Martin v. Met. Life Ins. Co., </em>197 App. Div. 382 [189 N.Y.S. 467 (1921) ], 233 N.Y. 653 [135 N.E. 956 (1922)]; <em>Sundine\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 1 [105 N.E. 433 (1914) ]). Here, almost in the very act of putting his foot without the mill, the employee is confronted by a danger engendered by his work within. The situation would be hardly different if a struggle, begun back of the threshold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>had ended in a fatal blow delivered on the walk. No reasonable opportunity had been offered the assaulted man to separate himself from the plant, its animosities and dangers. Continuity of cause has been so combined with contiguity in time and space that the quarrel from origin to ending must be taken to be one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><em>Matter of Field, </em>156 N.E. at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins.

After the employee left the store and started to walk down the street, the assailant shot him. The district court observed that, \u201c[i]n its ultimate analysis the question is whether on one hand the injury arose out of and in the course of the employment, or was caused by the wilful act of a third person directed against the employee because of his employment; or whether, on the other hand, it was sustained in a personal quarrel or conflict independent of the employment.\u201d <em>Britton, </em>187 F.Supp. at 362 (footnote omitted). The court upheld, as supported by substantial evidence, the administrator\u2019s finding that the altercation grew out of the performance of the decedent\u2019s duties. <em>Id., </em>187 F.Supp. at 362.

He suspected a man named Heffner, the representative of the lessor of the mine from which coal was being hauled. Mag-gard reported this to his employer and a warrant was issued for Heffner\u2019s arrest. While on his way to attend Heffner\u2019s trial, Maggard was shot by Heffner. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed an award of compensation benefits to the decedent\u2019s widow. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the claimant failed to sustain the burden of proving that the death <em>arose out of </em>such employment. We think the governing principle in the assaults by a fellow employee is applicable here. The rule is that if the assault is fairly traceable to an incident of the employment and is not the result of personal grievances unconnected therewith, compensation should be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">There was no showing that there was any prior personal animosity between Maggard and Heffner. The evidence establishes that Heffner bore ill will toward Maggard\u2019s employer and a fair inference from the evidence is that this ill will was transferred to Maggard when he swore out the warrant. In prosecuting Heffner, Maggard was acting to protect his employer\u2019s property and the charge against Heffner certainly arose out of an incident of Maggard\u2019s employment. Through a consistent sequence of events, the death of Maggard is clearly traceable to, and likewise arose out of that employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em>Travis Creek Fuel Co. v.

Part of Augelli\u2019s job entailed driving. He used his own vehicle, but the employer was responsible for his expenses. Augelli had a confrontation with another motorist. Four or five weeks later, they encountered each other again when Augelli was calling at another business. An altercation developed and the motorist assaulted Augelli. After Augelli\u2019s claim was administratively denied, he appealed and the court awarded him a new trial. The salient issue was whether the passage of four or five weeks removed the effects of the assault from coverage. The New Jersey court answered this question in the negative. The court observed in passing that, had the assault occurred immediately, there would have been \u201cno doubt that ... the injuries would have been compensable.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[sjuch injuries must be considered to have arisen from \u2018a hazard incident to the use of the highway in the pursuit of the master\u2019s business.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>109 A.2d at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Appellant also cites to <em>Graybeal v.

According to Professor Larson, \u201c[i]f claimant is assaulted by a co-employee who becomes irresponsible because of insanity, the great majority of decisions hold that the injury arose out of the employment, and it is immaterial whether or not the employer had knowledge of the assailant\u2019s condition or propensities.\u201d Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 8.03[2][a] at 8-62 (collecting cases) (footnote omitted). One of the more notable cases was decided by the Connecticut Supreme Court, which observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">It is, of course, immaterial in this proceeding whether or not the defendant was at fault. Under the Act a contract existed between the plaintiff and the defendant whereby it agreed to compensate the plaintiff for any injury \u201carising out of and in the course of his employment,\u201d independent of the question of its fault. <em>Powers v. Hotel Bond Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 145, 93 A. 245 [ (1915) ]. When an employer puts an employee at work on a machine\u2014although the employer may have exercised all reasonable care to provide that it is safe\u2014which, without fault on his part, has a latent defect which causes it to break down and injure the employee, the injury is unquestionably one arising out of a condition of his employment. It is immaterial, under the Act, whether the employer knew or ought to have known of the existence of the dangerous condition. So where a fellow servant by his negligence injures another employee, compensation is due for the injury, since it arose from a condition of the employment, to wit, the possibility of such negligence of a fellow servant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">The knowledge of the employer as to the liability of the fellow servant to be negligent is immaterial. Such liability is a condition attending the employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">The situation here presented of an insane man running amuck, is in no way analogous to a case where a fellow employee assaults another employee solely to gratify his feeling of anger or hatred; in such case \u201cthe injury results from the voluntary act of the assailant and cannot be said to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>arise either directly out of the employment, or as an incident of it.\u201d <em>Jacquemin v. Turner &amp; Seymour Mfg. Co., </em>92 Conn. 382, 384, 103 A. 115 [ (1918) ]. Whenever an employer puts his employees at work with fellow servants, the conditions actually existing\u2014apart from the possibility of wilful assaults by a fellow servant independent of the employment\u2014which result in injury to a fellow employee, are a basis for compensation under the implied contract of that Act. So in this case, although the employer may not have had knowledge actual or constructive that Markus, a fellow servant of the plaintiff, was insane and liable to run amuck, yet such liability of Markus to run amuck was in fact a condition under which the plaintiff was employed on the night in question, and if such condition of Markus caused an injury to the plaintiff, as it did, then the injury to the plaintiff arose out of his employment as truly as if it had arisen from the negligence of Markus in doing his work. \u201cAn injury arises out of an employment when it occurs in the course of the employment and is the result of a risk involved in the employment or incident to it, or to the conditions under which it is required to be performed. The injury is thus a natural or necessary consequence or incident of the employment or of the conditions under which it is carried on.\u201d <em>Marchiatello v.

Dep\u2019t of Public Safety &amp; Corr. Servs., supra, </em>is instructive. This is a case wherein the claimant\u2019s remedy at law was precluded by the application of a statute analogous to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. The claimant, Jennifer, was an inmate who was assaulted by a fellow prisoner, one Taylor, who struck Jennifer with a \u201clarge spatula\u201d while both were working in a Department of Corrections kitchen. He filed a lawsuit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Taylor for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and also included a count against the State of Maryland alleging a violation of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The circuit court entered a default judgment against Taylor, but granted summary judgment in favor of the State. The court reasoned that Jennifer\u2019s exclusive remedy against the State would lay with the Sundry Claims Board. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1999, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-301-310 of the Correctional Services Article. We affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">After reviewing similarities between the Sundry Claims provisions of the Correctional Services Article and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, we concluded that Jennifer\u2019s injury was compensable because it arose out of his employment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Speaking through Chief Judge Krauser, we explained why Jennifer\u2019s injury arose out of his employment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">Certainly, he would not have suffered the injury he did \u201cbut for the fact that the conditions and obligations of the employment placed [him] in the position where he was injured.\u201d ... At the time the assault took place, Jennifer was required by his employer, the Central Laundry Facility, to be in the kitchen. His presence there provided Taylor, who had also been assigned to work in the kitchen that day, with the opportunity to assault him as well as the instrument with which to carry out that attack. Thus, Jennifer\u2019s injury was incidental to his work. Because a \u201creasonably incidental\u201d relationship between the injury and the claimant\u2019s work is sufficient, in itself, to establish that an injury arose out of employment, we conclude that Jennifer\u2019s injury satisfied that requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">Although Jennifer appears to concede this very point, he claims that the assault was motivated by Taylor\u2019s animosity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>toward him and that it therefore \u201ccould have occurred anywhere.\u201d Relying on <em>Gray v. Dept. of Correction, </em>230 Md. 508, 187 A.2d 860 (1963), Jennifer argues that his injury did not arise out of his employment. In <em>Gray, </em>a prisoner was injured under what Jennifer claims were analogous circumstances: that is, as a result of being assaulted while working in the laundry at a Maryland penitentiary. Because the <em>Gray </em>Court found that the prisoner\u2019s injuries did not \u201carise out of\u201d his work, we must, Jennifer claims, reach the same result here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">But, apart from the fact that in both <em>Gray </em>and the instant case the claimant and his assailant were inmates at a Maryland prison when the claimant was injured, the two cases have few material facts in common. Indeed, in rejecting recovery under the Sundry Board Claims Act, the <em>Gray </em>Court stressed that \u201ca clear inference\u201d could be drawn from the evidence \u201cthat [the prisoner] was injured as the result of a fight with another inmate\u201d that had previously occurred outside of work and in \u201cretaliation for a homosexual advance by [the injured prisoner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 187 A.2d 860. In contrast, Jennifer has offered no basis from which an inference may be drawn that his injury was the product of a prior confrontation unrelated to his work activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">Indeed, the only explanation Jennifer offers in his complaint for the assault was that Taylor was \u201cunder care by [the State] for mental health problems,\u201d relating to his \u201cviolent disposition\u201d; that he had exhausted the medication he was taking for that problem; and that the State had failed to provide him with additional medication to keep his \u201cpropensity for violent outbursts\u201d in check. There is no suggestion in the complaint that the attack had anything to do with any prior relationship or confrontation with Taylor. And, although Jennifer suggests in his brief, as he did in his unsuccessful opposition to the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment, that Taylor\u2019s assault was motivated by animus, he offers no explanation or basis for this bald accusation. Hence, <em>Gray </em>has no applicability here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Jennifer, </em>176 Md.App. at 223-24, 932 A.2d 1213 (certain citations omitted). Viewing cases in which the personal animosity between employees precluded a finding that a claimant\u2019s injury arose from employment, we observed that Taylor\u2019s attack was \u201c \u2018generated by friction inseparable from [their] working conditions,\u2019 specifically, the friction caused by the prison official ordering Taylor to serve his co-worker, Jennifer, a hamburger[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The assault had not been triggered by an antecedent quarrel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the final analysis, we believe that these cases and additional authority cited by appellant, are inapposite. In the majority of cases of \u201cdelayed injury,\u201d for example, the nature of the employee\u2019s work prompted the assailants to act. An assailant may have been a former criminal defendant, a person who was discharged, someone who had been ejected from the claimant\u2019s place of business, a lunatic who felt aggrieved by actions taken in the employer\u2019s name and for its purposes, or criminals who sought to rob the claimant of items belonging to the employer. Those cases involving demonstrably insane or delusional coworkers are likewise distinguishable, in that the assaults largely took place near or at the place of the injured worker\u2019s employment. <em>Jennifer </em>is an excellent case in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">We have held that appellant\u2019s injury did not arise out of his employment. That is not required in any event for a claim under LE \u00a7 9\u2014101(b)(2) and, even assuming that the injury arose out of his employment, appellant\u2019s injury did not occur in the course thereof. The time, place and circumstances of the injury in relation to his work indicate that the tragic wounds he suffered were not within the range of dangers associated with his employment, especially because appellant\u2019s claim is subject to the \u201cgoing and coming rule.\u201d On this record, we are unable to conclude that the fact that he had the misfortune to work with Gardner does not, on this record, constitute a hazard at the workplace that would mitigate the effect of that rule and justify defining appellant\u2019s injuries as occurring in the course thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">EACH PARTY TO BEAR ITS OWN COSTS.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Dissenting Opinion by MEREDITH, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-10\">.
