Finding no merit to either contention, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The record, when reviewed in a light most favorable to the State, as the prevailing party, shows that, early on the morning of April 2, 2006, after cutting the victim\u2019s telephone line, appellant gained entry to the victim\u2019s home by chiseling open the basement door. After entering her bedroom, he pressed a pillow against her face and threatened to kill her if she moved. Then, tying a shirt over the victim\u2019s face as a blindfold, he raped her and fled. During the attack, the victim noticed that her attacker had a wedding band on his hand and had a \u201cmetallicky odor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">After appellant left her house, the victim ran to her neighbors\u2019 house and, from there, called the police. When the police arrived, they took swabs of blood stains that were found on a pillow case on .the victim\u2019s bed and on the floor of the back patio of the victim\u2019s home, underneath a broken window. Later that day, swabs were taken of the victim\u2019s vagina and anus.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Appellant did not become a suspect in the investigation of the rape until, more than two years later, the victim sent an email to the lead investigator in the case, Trooper First Class Dana Wenger of the Maryland State Police, stating that she believed that appellant was the man who had raped her. At trial, the victim described the process by which she had come to that conclusion. She explained that, two years after the attack, she had called Bruce Arthur, her former next-door neighbor, for help with a tree on her property. Mr. Arthur owned a tree-trimming business.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Arthur\u2019s failure to return her call prompted the victim to reflect as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>So, July 15 [2008] ... I am driving home once again going over in my head as I did every day thinking okay, Bruce didn\u2019t call me back, why didn\u2019t he call me back. And then I am thinking okay, Bruce is partners with [appellant]. And ... my mind starts going.... [Appellant] used to live in [the house in which the attack took place]. [Appellant] has a body type that closely fits the body type of [the attacker]. Then it\u2019s oh, [appellant] is married [and] has children, I went to school with [appellant], he lived in that house. He is partners with Bruce....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">When she considered the possibility that appellant was her attacker, \u201cit all fit,\u201d exclaimed the victim. Pursuing this lead, Trooper Wenger left a note at appellant\u2019s home asking him to call her. On July 28, 2008, appellant telephoned Trooper Wenger and agreed to go to the police barracks that afternoon. When he arrived, he was taken to a spare office. During the interview that ensued, Trooper Wenger and Sergeant James Decourcey asked appellant for a DNA sample to compare with the DNA recovered from the pillow case, the broken window, and the victim\u2019s body. Appellant agreed to provide a sample on the condition that it would be destroyed after the investigation was concluded. When the officers declined to give such an assurance, appellant refused to provide a DNA sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">At that time, appellant was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and, according to Trooper Wenger, \u201ckept rubbing his arms up and down the armrests of the chair.\u201d The trooper also noticed a \u201cmetallic\u201d odor emanating from appellant and observed that he appeared \u201cnervous\u201d and provided \u201cpeculiar\u201d answers during the interview. After appellant left the police barracks, Sergeant Decourcey swabbed the armrests of the chair on which appellant had been sitting. The swabs were submitted to the Maryland State Police Forensic Lab, where the forensic sciences supervisor, Bruce Heidebrecht, extracted DNA from the swabs and developed a DNA profile for comparison purposes. That DNA profile was found to match the DNA profile developed from the evidence taken from the pillow case and the patio at the scene of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>On the strength of the DNA comparison and circumstantial evidence developed by Trooper Wenger\u2014specifically the victim\u2019s identification, appellant\u2019s familiarity with the victim and her home, Trooper Wenger\u2019s detection of a \u201cmetallic\u201d odor emanating from appellant\u2019s person, and appellant\u2019s nervousness and \u201cpeculiar\u201d conduct during his interview with the police\u2014Trooper Wenger obtained warrants to arrest appellant, search his home, and collect an additional DNA sample. The DNA from the additional sample, gathered by swabbing appellant\u2019s cheek, also matched the DNA on the pillow case and the patio. An independent lab compared the DNA obtained from appellant\u2019s cheek with DNA from swabs of the victim\u2019s anus and vagina, taken during the forensic examination the day of the rape, and concluded that neither appellant nor any of his male paternal relatives could be excluded as a potential contributor to that DNA sample, but that 99.57% of the male population in a country the size of the United States could be.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in failing to suppress the DNA sample gathered from the chair that he sat on at the police barracks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The suppression court denied appellant\u2019s motion, concluding that, because appellant did not have \u201cany reasonable expectation of privacy with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>regard to the sweat he left on the chair,\u201d the police were lawfully in possession of his DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">There is no dispute that the officers had the right to swab their own chair without a warrant. It was the property of the police and not of appellant, and thus he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the chair itself. <em>See Gamble v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 112, 116, 552 A.2d 928 (1989) (\u201cThe police needed no warrant to search [an officer\u2019s] cruiser since it was police property, and no warrant is required to search one\u2019s own property.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">But appellant contends that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the DNA contained in his skin cells, even if the police lawfully acquired the skin cells by swabbing their own chair. In the absence of a warrant, the police were prohibited by the Fourth Amendment, maintains appellant, from analyzing the swab they took from the chair, developing a DNA profile, and comparing it to the DNA recovered from the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing and the inferences fairly drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. Williamson <em>v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 532, 993 A.2d 626 (2010) (citations omitted). We defer, moreover, to the fact-findings of the suppression court, unless those findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>But, with respect to the ultimate question of constitutionality, we \u201cmake our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bailey v. State, </em>412 Md. 349, 362, 987 A.2d 72 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV; <em>McFarlin v. State, </em>409 Md. 391, 403, 975 A.2d 862 (2009). \u201cThe person invoking Fourth Amendment protections bears the burden of demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>strating his or her legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or items seized.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 534, 993 A.2d 626 (citing <em>Smith v. Maryland, </em>442 U.S. 735, 740, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The burden of demonstrating a \u201clegitimate\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> expectation of privacy includes both a subjective and an objective component. <em>Id. </em>First, the individual invoking Fourth Amendment protection must \u201cdemonstrate an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy in the item or place searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>Venner v. State, </em>279 Md. 47, 51-52, 367 A.2d 949 (1977)). A subjective expectation of privacy is demonstrated by a showing that the person \u201csought \u2018to preserve something as private.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 993 A.2d 626 (quoting <em>McFarlin, </em>409 Md. at 404, 975 A.2d 862). Second, the expectation must be \u201cobjectively reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534, 975 A.2d 862 (citing <em>Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 545, 842 A.2d 773 (2004)). That is, \u201c[a]n expectation of privacy does not give rise to Fourth Amendment protection ... unless society is prepared to accept that expectation as objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 975 A.2d 862 (quoting <em>California v. Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 39-40, 108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>413 Md. 521, 993 A.2d 626 (2010), recently addressed the issue of a suspect\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in DNA evidence recovered from an object in the possession of the police. The DNA sample at issue was obtained, as here, by police without the suspect\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The events leading up to the taking of this sample began in 1994. In that year, Kelroy Williamson entered an <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>to a charge of battery stemming from a rape investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 993 A.2d 626. Although swabs were collected from the victim in the investigation of that rape, they were not tested at that time for the presence of DNA. <em>Id. </em>In 2006, to obtain a DNA sample from Williamson, whom police suspected was involved in a rape committed in 2002, investigators arrested him on charges unrelated to the rape, took him to the police station, and provided him with a meal. <em>Id. </em>at 528, 993 A.2d 626. When Williamson, in a holding cell, left the cup from that meal on the cell floor, the cup was tested for DNA. <em>Id. </em>The resultant DNA profile matched the profile of the rapist in the 2002 rape, and Williamson was eventually convicted of that crime. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Appealing that conviction, Williamson challenged, among other things, the warrantless seizure of the cup and the analysis of the DNA removed from it. The Court of Appeals, first, declared that the Fourth Amendment did not apply to the seizure of the cup because Williamson had abandoned it when, after drinking from it, he tossed it to the floor and that he, therefore, retained no reasonable expectation of privacy in it. <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 993 A.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">It next rejected Williamson\u2019s claim that, even if the cup had been lawfully seized, he retained a reasonable expectation of privacy in his DNA and that the police were therefore prohibited from analyzing the DNA without a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 993 A.2d 626. In so ruling, the <em>Williamson </em>Court considered the nature of what had been collected and how it had been used, emphasizing that its collection and use had been in conformity with the strictures of the Maryland DNA Collection Act, which \u201climits the depth of DNA testing and the storage of the results to that data that is directly related to the identification of an individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542, 993 A.2d 626 (citing Md.Code (2003), \u00a7 2-505(b) of the Public Safety Article).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It further pointed out that DNA profiles used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>database \u201cconsist of analyses of 13 \u2018junk\u2019 loci consisting of stretches of DNA, which do not presently recognize traits and were purposely selected because they are not associated with any known physical or medical characteristics.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Davis, </em>657 F.Supp.2d 630, 656 n. 6 (D.Md. 2009)). Thus, \u201cthe only information collected from testing and storage of DNA profiles,\u201d stressed the Court, was \u201cthe identity of the person whose DNA [was] being tested.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 993 A.2d 626. Hence, the purpose of uploading DNA profiles to a DNA database was \u201cakin to that of a fingerprint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Raines, </em>383 Md. 1, 25, 857 A.2d 19 (2004)). The Court of Appeals further observed that Williamson\u2019s arguments \u201cregarding his expectation of privacy in his DNA d[id] not relate to the 13 \u2018junk\u2019 loci used for identification, but on the potential misuse of DNA,\u201d which was not an issue in the case because Williamson\u2019s DNA was tested for identification only. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The <em>Williamson </em>Court also cited with approval the concurring opinion of the Honorable Irma S. Raker in <em>State v. Raines, </em>specifically its discussion regarding the nature of DNA identification evidence. <em>See Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 544, 993 A.2d 626. In <em>Raines, </em>the State collected a DNA sample from an inmate pursuant to the Maryland DNA Collection Act. 383 Md. at 5-6, 857 A.2d 19. Because the seizure of the DNA in that case was compulsory and involved the physical intrusion of a swabbing of the inmate\u2019s cheek, the State conceded that the act constituted a search but asserted that it was both reasonable and constitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 857 A.2d 19. The <em>Raines </em>Court held that both the warrantless search and the statute that authorized it were constitutional, noting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>diminished expectation of privacy of incarcerated individuals, the minimal intrusiveness of the search, and the limited nature of the information actually collected from the DNA sample. <em>Id. </em>at 15,17-18, 25, 857 A.2d 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In her concurring opinion in <em>Raines, </em>Judge Raker stressed that the statute was constitutional because the DNA was used for identification purposes only, explaining that, although a DNA sample <em>could </em>provide more personal information than a fingerprint, it need not necessarily do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cDNA type need be no more informative than an ordinary fingerprint.... The numbers [constituting the DNA profile] have no meaning except as a representation of molecular sequences at DNA loci that are not indicative of an individual\u2019s personal traits or propensities. In this sense, the ... \u2018profile\u2019 is very much like a social security number.... In itself, the series of numbers can tell nothing about a person. But because the sequence of numbers is so likely to be unique (with the exception of identical twins), it can be linked to identifiers such as name, date of birth, or social security number, and used to determine the source of DNA found in the course of criminal investigations.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 45, 857 A.2d 19 (Raker, J., concurring) (quoting D. Kaye &amp; M. Smith, <em>DNA Identification Databases: Legality, Legitimacy, and the Case for Population-Wide Coverage, </em>2003 Wis. L.Rev. 413, 431-32 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Although <em>Williamson </em>involved DNA taken from abandoned property and <em>Raines </em>involved DNA removed from the cheek of an incarcerated individual, the lesson as to the nature of lawfully collected DNA evidence is the same. That is, DNA evidence, when used for identification purposes only, is akin to fingerprint evidence. And, although fingerprint evidence is suppressible if it is obtained in the course of an unlawful detention, <em>see Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S.Ct. 1643, 84 L.Ed.2d 705 (1985); <em>Davis v. Mississippi, </em>394 U.S. 721, 727, 89 S.Ct. 1394, 22 L.Ed.2d 676 (1969), the fingerprinting process itself \u201cinvolves none of the probing into an individual\u2019s private life and thoughts that marks an interrogation or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>search.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dionisio, </em>410 U.S. 1, 15, 93 S.Ct. 764, 35 L.Ed.2d 67 (1973) (quoting <em>Davis, </em>394 U.S. at 727, 89 S.Ct. 1394).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Thus, even if appellant could demonstrate a <em>subjective </em>expectation of privacy in his DNA profile, he nonetheless had no <em>objectively reasonable </em>expectation of privacy in it because it was used for identification purposes only. As in <em>Williamson, </em>the police were in lawful possession of the item from which the DNA was collected. In <em>Williamson, </em>the cup from which the DNA was collected came into police possession when the suspect discarded it in the holding cell; here, the chair in the police barracks was, from the outset, in the possession of the police. Thus, like the analysis of a latent fingerprint, which involves no physical intrusion into the body and is used for identification purposes only, the analysis in the instant case of DNA evidence, which was in the lawful possession of the police, was not a constitutionally protected search.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">And, as in <em>Williamson, </em>there is no suggestion here that the police used the swab for anything other than analyzing the 13 \u201cjunk\u201d loci for identification purposes. Hence, potential privacy concerns, \u201cshould technological advances permit testing of DNA to glean more information from acquired DNA than mere identification,\u201d have no \u201cfeet\u201d here. <em>See Williamson, </em>413 Md. at 544, 993 A.2d 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">We note, however, that at least one federal district court has made a distinction between fingerprint and DNA evidence, stating that the latter involved a \u201cgreater privacy concern\u201d because of the \u201cpotential for the disclosure of a vast amount of intensely personal information.\u201d <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>657 F.Supp.2d 630, 663 n. 9 (D.Md.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">And it appears that there is growing debate among commentators as to the extent of the information that can be gleaned from the \u201cjunk\u201d loci that are analyzed in criminal investigations. In <em>Reclaiming \u201cAbandoned\u201d DNA: The Fourth Amendment and Genetic Privacy, </em>Professor Elizabeth E. Joh argues that \u201c[t]he defense that current DNA sampling techniques target only \u2018junk\u2019 DNA, and thus cannot reveal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>medical information, should not assuage privacy concerns ... as some markers now thought to be meaningless may be (and have been) found to contain predictive medical information as the science progresses.\u201d 100 Nw. U.L.Rev. 857, 870 (2006) (footnote omitted). Professor Joh suggests that the comparison between fingerprints and DNA is inapt because, \u201cunlike DNA, fingerprints have a limited identification value\u201d and \u201ccannot reveal any more information about the person from whom they have been collected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, Professor Simon A. Cole cautions that \u201ccalling forensic STRs[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] \u2018junk,\u2019 \u2018not socially or medically significant,\u2019 or \u2018as meaningless as fingerprints\u2019 does not inform clearly or completely.\u201d <em>See </em>Simon A. Cole, <em>Is the \u201cJunk\u201d DNA Designation Bunk?, </em>102 Nw. U.L.Rev. Colloquy 54, 63 (2007) (footnotes omitted). \u201cIf some forensic STRs are correlated with genes that cause physical traits, though they do not cause the physical traits themselves,\u201d Professor Cole suggests, \u201cthe public can be informed of that fact.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Professor D.H. Kaye, on the other hand, writes that \u201c[j]ust as the argument that nonfunctional DNA cannot be a threat to privacy is superficial, it would be incomplete and misleading simply to inform the public that an STR profile contains information that is correlated to physical traits such as disease and possibly behavioral predispositions and hence could be used to predict whether an individual will develop a disease.\u201d <em>See </em>D.H. Kaye, <em>Please, Let\u2019s Bury the Junk: The Codis Loci and the Revelation of Private Information, </em>102 Nw. U.L.Rev. Colloquy 70, 71 (2007). \u201cNo one can say for certain what the future of genetics holds,\u201d says Professor Kaye, \u201cbut based on current knowledge and practice, the information coded in the databases is and will remain, with ... limited exceptions ... useful only for identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>We also point out that there are safeguards in the Maryland code that protect against the misuse of DNA records in the statewide database. In fact, subsections 2-512(c) and (e) of the Public Safety Article provide criminal penalties for, among other things, the testing of DNA samples for information unrelated to identification. But those protections, of course, are little comfort to those who do not believe that the State should have such information at its disposal in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Still, as we have seen, the Court of Appeals declined to draw a distinction between DNA and fingerprint evidence in <em>Williamson, </em>and we, of course, shall follow suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In an attempt to distinguish fingerprint evidence from DNA evidence and thereby avoid <em>Williamson\u2019s </em>holding that DNA evidence that is used for identification purposes is \u201cakin to that of a fingerprint,\u201d appellant asserts that leaving a fingerprint requires the \u201cvolitional act of placing a hand on the surface,\u201d while \u201cit requires no effort or volitional act to shed DNA.\u201d But neither does it require an effort or a volitional act to leave a fingerprint bn an object while touching that object or to deposit saliva and skin cells on a cup while taking a sip from it. Rather, just like the individual who places his hand on an object, intentionally or otherwise, and, in so doing, inadvertently deposits identifying information on the object, appellant walked into the police barracks, sat down on a chair, and rubbed his bare arms on the armrests of the chair, while sitting there. In so doing, he deposited identifying information on the chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Further undercutting appellant\u2019s proposed distinction is the fact that, as early as 1997, researchers had reported the ability to extract DNA from fingerprints themselves. <em>See </em>Roland A.H. van Oorschot Maxwell K.

In the instant case, it appears that the same process, which makes use of \u201ctouch DNA,\u201d was employed to gather appellant\u2019s DNA from the chair in the police barracks. \u201cTouch DNA\u201d is described by the independent lab that pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>cessed appellant\u2019s sample as \u201cthe DNA that is left behind from skin cells when a person touches or comes into contact with an item.\u201d <em>See </em>Touch DNA Evidence\u2014Overview, Bode Technology, http://www.bodetech.com/technologies/touch-dna/touch-dna-overview (last -visited May 20, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We conclude that appellant had no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the chair in the police barracks and that he retained no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the identifying characteristics that could be gleaned from the normal biological residue he left behind. Consequently, the suppression court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Appellant contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting a mistrial, first, because the State failed to disclose before trial eighty-nine<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> emails between the victim and the police and, second, because the State failed to provide, either before or after trial, additional emails, the existence of which the State denies.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">At trial, the victim testified that, after her rape, she \u201cwas in contact with [Trooper] Wenger and other troopers daily\u201d and that she gave Trooper Wenger \u201cmultiple leads\u201d in the investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">I mean [Trooper Wenger] was asking me questions about what I did and who I knew and I was thinking of every possible person who it could possibly be.... I sent her multiple emails, dozens. No, hundreds of emails I sent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Although appellant\u2019s trial counsel eventually informed the circuit court that he had not received the emails the victim had referred to in her direct testimony, he did not do so until after conducting cross-examination of the victim. In response, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>circuit court ordered the State to determine whether any undisclosed emails existed and, if so, to turn them over to appellant. By the next trial date, which was four days later, the State had provided appellant with copies of previously undisclosed emails between the victim and Trooper Wenger. None pre-dated the victim\u2019s email to Trooper Wenger on July 15, 2008, in which she described how she had come to believe that appellant was her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">At trial, appellant claimed that he was entitled to a mistrial because the emails \u201cshould have been disclosed\u201d before trial and could have been used as impeachment evidence during his cross-examination of the victim, specifically citing an email from the victim to Trooper Wenger on July 16, 2008, in which the victim said of appellant, \u201cI KNOW his name was brought up, but I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think for you to swab him.\u201d Appellant asserted that this email\u2019s reference to an earlier conversation between the victim and Trooper Wenger contradicted the victim\u2019s testimony that appellant\u2019s name first came to her attention right before she sent the email of July 15, 2008, in which she named appellant as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel accused the State of deliberately withholding the emails, alleging that he had made an oral request for emails before trial and that the State did not respond to that request even though the assistant state\u2019s attorney knew about the emails because she had been included in some of the correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In response, the assistant state\u2019s attorney denied having received an oral request from appellant for emails and asserted that she had not willfully violated the discovery rules. She further stated that she had simply forgotten about any emails she had sent or received, and the circuit court found this representation to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">While agreeing with appellant that the emails should have been provid\u00e9d before trial, the circuit court denied his motion for a mistrial, finding\u2019 no deliberate discovery violation by the State. In any event, appellant would have the opportunity, the court pointed out, to question the victim as to when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>appellant\u2019s name first came up. Notwithstanding that judicial invitation, appellant chose not to conduct any further cross-examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellant nonetheless reiterated his complaints at a hearing on his motion for a new trial, claiming that he had suffered \u201csignificant! ] prejudice! ]\u201d from the State\u2019s failure to disclose \u201cinformation regarding the circumstances under which [appellant\u2019s] name came up earlier.\u201d The circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion, stating: \u201cClearly the emails aren\u2019t material to the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Nor are they exculpatory. Nor do they reflect on anything that would mitigate punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Appellant now claims that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying his request for a mistrial, a request which was based on the State\u2019s failure to disclose the victim\u2019s emails before she testified. Assuming, without deciding, that the State violated Maryland Rule 4\u2014263(d)(3), which provides that the state\u2019s attorney shall, without request, provide to the defense, \u201call written statements of [a state\u2019s witness] that relate to the offense charged,\u201d we hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial or in choosing, instead, a less severe remedy for the State\u2019s discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The remedy for a violation of the discovery rules \u201cis, in the first instance, within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Williams v. State, </em>364 Md. 160, 178, 771 A.2d 1082 (2001) (citing <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 500, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985)). Rule 4-263(n) provides a list of potential sanctions, including: ordering discovery of the undisclosed matter, granting a continuance, excluding evidence as to the undisclosed matter, granting a mistrial, or entering any other appropriate order. The rule \u201cdoes not require the court to take any action; it merely authorizes the court to act.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>397 Md. 557, 570, 919 A.2d 49 (2007). Thus, the circuit court \u201chas the discretion to select an appropriate sanction, but also has the discretion to decide whether any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>sanction is at all necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Evans, </em>304 Md. at 500, 499 A.2d 1261).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">But, in exercising its discretion regarding sanctions for discovery violations, \u201ca trial court should consider: (1) the reasons why the disclosure was not made; (2) the existence and amount of any prejudice to the opposing party; (3) the feasibility of curing any prejudice with a continuance; and (4) any other relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570-71, 919 A.2d 49 (citations and footnotes omitted). Although \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s intent alone does not determine the appropriate sanction, bad faith on the part of the State can justify exclusion of evidence or serve as a factor in granting a harsher sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571 n. 8, 919 A.2d 49. And, if the discovery violation irreparably prejudices the defendant, a mistrial may be required even for an unintentional violation. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Evans, </em>304 Md. at 501, 499 A.2d 1261).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The declaration of a mistrial, however, \u201cis an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Barrios v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 384, 396-97, 702 A.2d 961 (1997) (quoting <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 422, 583 A.2d 218 (1990)). \u201cThe most accepted view of discovery sanctions is that in fashioning a sanction, the court should impose the least severe sanction that is consistent with the purpose of the discovery rules.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 571, 919 A.2d 49 (citations omitted). We have said that the purpose of the discovery rules \u201cis to give a defendant the necessary time to prepare a full and adequate defense.\u201d <em>Ross v. State, </em>78 Md.App. 275, 286, 552 A.2d 1345 (1989). And the Court of Appeals has warned that, if a defendant declines a limited remedy that would serve the purpose of the discovery rules and instead seeks the greater windfall of an excessive sanction, \u201cthe \u2018double or nothing\u2019 gamble almost always yields \u2018nothing.\u2019\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 575, 919 A.2d 49 (quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 657, 678, 753 A.2d 587 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Here, in accordance with <em>Thomas, </em>the circuit court considered the reason for the State\u2019s failure to disclose, the evidence as to the State\u2019s intent, and the prejudice to appellant, that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the use to which the emails could have been put. <em>See Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 571, 919 A.2d 49. As for the cause of the violation, the circuit court found that the assistant state\u2019s attorney simply forgot about the emails she had sent and received, and we have no reason to conclude that that finding was clearly erroneous. As for the prejudice to appellant, the circuit court, before fashioning a remedy, heard argument from appellant\u2019s counsel as to the extent to which the emails were actually inconsistent with the victim\u2019s trial testimony and how they could be used for impeachment purposes. Appellant\u2019s arguments were, and remain, unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Although appellant may have been surprised by the victim\u2019s reference to her emails during her direct testimony, the delayed disclosure did not deny him the necessary time to prepare a full and adequate defense. <em>See Ross, </em>78 Md.App. at 286, 552 A.2d 1345. Appellant learned of the emails during the victim\u2019s direct examination but did not inform the circuit court that he did not have copies until after he had completed his cross-examination. Thus, appellant\u2019s decision to delay informing the circuit court of the issue was what ensured that his cross-examination of the victim would be conducted without the evidence he later characterized as \u201ccrucial exculpatory information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Moreover, with the exception of one State\u2019s witness who briefly described the victim\u2019s physical examination, the proceedings were halted after appellant learned of the emails and remained so until the State provided them. When the trial resumed, four days later, appellant neither asked for a continuance nor took advantage of the circuit court\u2019s offer to allow limited additional cross-examination of the victim about the content of the emails.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Thus, appellant\u2019s argument that the only available course of action was to call the victim once again and, in so doing, \u201cgo[ ] back to the victim and go[ ] into everything\u201d is undermined by the record. Appellant could have halted the proceedings and obtained the emails before he cross-examined the victim, or he could have recross-examined the victim in a limited manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>without permitting her to repeat her account of the rape. Appellant took advantage of neither remedial option and, in much the same mariner as the defendants in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Jones, </em>sought the greater windfall of a mistrial, <em>see Thomas, </em>397 Md. at 575, 919 A.2d 49; <em>Jones, </em>132 Md.App. at 678, 753 A.2d 587, which the circuit court understandably declined to grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Appellant further claims that \u201c[t]here is simply no question that ... a multitude of other emails exist that were never disclosed to the defense,\u201d citing the amount of email traffic between July 15, 2008, and May 22, 2009; the victim\u2019s statement that she sent \u201chundreds\u201d of emails to Trooper Wenger; and Trooper Wenger\u2019s reference, on cross-examination, to \u201ca lot of emails back in '06.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">After appellant asserted that there were additional emails that the State had failed to disclose, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, finding that there was no \u201cdeliberate discovery violation ... by the State.\u201d The context of the discussion in the circuit court sheds light on the nature of the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">As noted, after appellant brought the State\u2019s failure to disclose the emails to the court\u2019s attention, the court instructed the assistant state\u2019s attorney that she had a duty to inquire as to the existence of the emails: \u201cSo now what you\u2019re going to have to do ... is get together with Trooper Wenger and find out where these emails are.\u201d Four days later, after having disclosed' eighty-nine emails, the State represented to the circuit court that its prior failure \u201cwasn\u2019t a willful violation.\u201d Finding that representation credible and, consequently, that there had been no deliberate discovery violation, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In that context, the court\u2019s express finding that the State had violated the discovery rules but that its violation was not deliberate included implied findings, first, that the State had rectified the discovery violation by providing, during trial, the emails that existed between the victim and the police and, second, that any prejudice suffered by appellant would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>cured by the opportunity for limited recross-examination of the victim on the issues raised by the emails. We are not convinced that the victim\u2019s reference to sending \u201cmultiple ..., dozens ... [n]o, hundreds\u201d of emails to Trooper Wenger necessarily meant that the final number mentioned, i.e., \u201chundreds,\u201d was an exact figure. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the circuit court to find that the eighty-nine emails that were disclosed constituted the entire set. And, of course, the fact that the victim and Trooper Wenger communicated by email between July 15, 2008, and May 22, 2009, does not necessarily mean that they did so during the preceding thirty-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">We also note that the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were made before Trooper Wenger testified, and therefore, in making its findings, the circuit court could not have considered the portion of her testimony, to which appellant now points, in which she referred to \u201ca lot of emails back in '06.\u201d When reviewing whether the circuit court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, we think it proper to assess the record as it existed at the time of the circuit court\u2019s ruling. <em>Cf. Duncan v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 45, 52, 494 A.2d 235 (1985) (\u201cWhen we determine whether the trial judge committed an error in admitting or rejecting evidence or in striking out or refusing to strike out evidence previously admitted, we do so on the basis of the record as of the time the ruling was made, not on the basis of facts later developed.\u201d). If, as appellant claims, Trooper Wenger\u2019s subsequent testimony confirmed the existence of additional emails, appellant should have reasserted his objection and asked the circuit court to reconsider its finding in light of the new testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, as noted, at trial, appellant did not request a continuance or any remedy other than a mistrial. He did not, for example, seek to subpoena the custodian of the police department\u2019s electronic records to determine whether old emails that might have once existed had been destroyed. Indeed, he did not even seek to determine whether the police department had a policy on maintaining emails. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>appellant simply asserted that the \u201cevidence suggest[ed]\u201d that there were additional undisclosed emails. The circuit court\u2019s finding to the contrary was not clearly erroneous, and the court did not abuse its discretion in declining, on the record before it, to take the \u201cextraordinary act\u201d of declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">But, under the circumstances of the instant case, even if there were additional undisclosed emails, the failure, by the State, to disclose those emails did not, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, violate <em>Brady v. Maryland, 373 </em>U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused ... violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. A <em>Brady </em>violation occurs when the State withholds or suppresses evidence that is (1) favorable to the defense (because it was either exculpatory or impeaching) and (2) material to the guilt or punishment of the defendant. <em>Wilson v. State, </em>363 Md. 333, 346, 768 A.2d 675 (2001). If the alleged <em>Brady </em>violation pertains to the failure to disclose favorable evidence, the evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d if \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347, 768 A.2d 675 (citations omitted). The Court of Appeals has interpreted the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard to mean a \u201csubstantial possibility that ... the result of [the] trial would have been any different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 347 n. 3, 768 A.2d 675 (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accepting appellant\u2019s proffer that the undisclosed emails would have been favorable to the defense because they would have shown that the victim and the police had previously considered and rejected appellant as a suspect, we conclude that there is no substantial possibility that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the trial would have been different. The evidence adduced at trial established that appellant\u2019s DNA matched the DNA found on the back patio of the victim\u2019s home, on a pillow case on her bed, and, with somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>less statistical certainty, on swabs of her vagina and anus. Moreover, the impeachment value of any undisclosed emails would have been slight. Even without the emails, the jury heard the victim\u2019s testimony that she provided Trooper Wen-ger with \u201cmultiple leads\u201d and discussed with Trooper Wenger \u201cevery possible person who it could possibly be.\u201d And, although the victim testified that she believed appellant was her attacker, she also testified that the rapist tied a shirt over her face, preventing her from seeing his face. Thus, even if the undisclosed evidence was favorable to the defense because it demonstrated that appellant, whose DNA matched that of the rapist, had been briefly considered as a suspect by the victim at an earlier point in the investigation, it was not material to his guilt because there is no \u201csubstantial possibility that ... the result of [the] trial would have been any different\u201d had the evidence been disclosed. <em>See Wilson, </em>363 Md. at 347 n. 3, 768 A.2d 675 (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Concurring Opinion by MATRICCIANI, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-13\">.

As a result, appellant argues that he could not have been aware that he had shed skin cells onto the chair in the police barracks. As we shall explain, appellant lacked an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in his DNA profile as used for identification purposes, and we therefore do not concern ourselves with what he knew about the shedding of skin cells.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\">.

Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), wherein Justice Souter, writing for the Court\u2019s majority, held that \u201cthe individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The Brady Report noted that \u201c[bjoth the American Bar Association (\u201cABA\u201d) Standards of Criminal Justice and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct recognize the unique role of the prosecutor and the importance of timely disclosure of favorable evidence to the defense,\u201d citing the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, Standard 3-3.11(a), and the ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct, \u00a7 3.8(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">In June, 2004, the Maryland Conference of Circuit Court Judges forwarded to the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure a proposed revision to Rule 4-263, modeled on the federal proposal contained in the Brady Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Proposed Maryland Rule 4-263(g) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\"><em>Obligations of State\u2019s Attorney. </em>The obligations of the State\u2019s Attorney under this Rule extend to material and information in the possession or control of the State\u2019s Attorney and staff members <em>and any others who have participated in the investigation or evaluation of the action </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>and who either regularly report, or with reference to the particular action have reported, to the office of the State\u2019s Attorney.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The Rules Committee\u2019s Criminal Subcommittee took up the proposed rule revision and referred it to the full committee in September, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proposal was batted back and forth between the subcommittee and the full committee until September, 2005, when the revised rule became part of the 155th Report to the Court of Appeals, but it was deferred by the Court of Appeals. The debate on the proposed rule was heated and continued with particular objection from a number of state\u2019s attorneys to the scope of the required disclosures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the revised Rule 4-263 was attached as a supplement to the 158th Report of the Rules Committee in March, 2008. It was adopted by the Court of Appeals on April 8, 2008, and became effective on July 1, 2008.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">In its present form, Maryland Rule 4-263(c) provides:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (c) Obligations of the parties. (1) Due diligence. The State\u2019s Attorney and defense shall exercise due diligence to identify all of the material and information that must be disclosed under this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">(2) Scope of obligations. The obligations of the State\u2019s Attorney and the defense extend to material and informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tion that must be disclosed under this Rule and that are in the possession or control of the attorney, members of the attorney\u2019s staff, or <em>any other person who either reports regularly to the attorney\u2019s office or has reported to the attorney\u2019s office in regard to the particular case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">The rule cross-references <em>State v. Williams, </em>392 Md. 194, 896 A.2d 973 (2006), a case which predates the revised rule\u2019s adoption. In <em>Williams, </em>the Court of Appeals extended the duty to disclose information favorable to the defense to \u201cany and all members of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office, attorneys and staff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 896 A.2d 973. <em>Williams </em>was an appeal of a denial of post-conviction relief in a case where the assistant state\u2019s attorney at trial was unaware and did not disclose that a state\u2019s witness was a paid informant, although the information was known to others in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. The Court of Appeals based its ruling on the constitutional principles enunciated in <em>Brady </em>and on Rule 4-263(g) (the subpart then applicable to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s obligation under the rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The rape in this case occurred on April 2, 2006. The victim then contacted the state police by e-mail, on and off, up to the date of trial, June 2, 2009. The record indicates that the victim was attempting to provide Trooper Wenger, the investigating officer, with potential suspects. At trial, she testified that she sent her \u201cmultiple emails, dozens. No, hundreds of emails ...\u201d Trooper Wenger testified to \u201ca lot of emails back in 06.\u201d Mid-trial, the State produced eighty nine e-mails, none of which pre-dated July 15, 2008. Most surprising is the fact that the prosecutor was unaware of the existence of this potential evidence until the victim testified at trial. That is <em>not </em>the intent of the criminal discovery rule. The State\u2019s Attorney is responsible for determining whether <em>Brady </em>information has been obtained by his own staff or <em>any others who have participated in the investigation. </em>This means that the State must make appropriate inquiries, within the discovery time-frame, and arrange for the collection and timely disclosure of discoverable material to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>My research has disclosed only two cases addressing the scope of the State\u2019s discovery obligations to the defense after adoption of the revised rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lancaster v. State, </em>410 Md. 352, 370-82, 978 A.2d 717 (2009), dealt with a protective order issued for State\u2019s witnesses allegedly threatened by the defendant. The protective order denied the defendant his right to witness information required to be disclosed by Rule 4-263(b)(1) and \u201cin effect tied [defense] counsel\u2019s hands and foreclosed him front pursuing a valuable source of information,\u201d thus denying Lancaster effective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>It compelled a reversal of his convictions for robbery and assault. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In <em>Yearby v. State, </em>414 Md. 708, 997 A.2d 144 (2010), the appellant claimed a <em>Brady </em>violation because the investigating detective failed to disclose that he \u201chad developed additional suspects at the time he administered a photographic line-up to Ms. Zongo,\u201d the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 715, 997 A.2d 144. Because this information was otherwise available to Yearby, the Court of Appeals held that the State had not suppressed it. <em>Id. </em>at 726, 997 A.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Both cases illustrate the obligation of the State\u2019s Attorney to assess information obtained during criminal investigations for potential <em>Brady </em>information. As <em>Williams, supra, </em>points out, the State\u2019s obligations clearly extend to information and materials not contained in the prosecutor\u2019s file. The trial court in the case <em>sub judice </em>accepted the State\u2019s affirmation that all of the victim\u2019s e-mails had been disclosed to the defense during trial. While we affirm that finding here, appropriate emphasis must be given to the broad scope of the State\u2019s disclosure obligations under Maryland Rule 4-263. It is not difficult to imagine similar situations in which this type of oversight by the State will compel a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\">. <em>Brady </em>established a bright-line constitutional duty on the part of a prosecutor to turn over \"evidence favorable to an accused ... where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">. These standards read as follows. ABA Criminal Justice Standard 3-3.11(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">A prosecutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure to the defense, at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the existence of all evidence or information which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged or which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused. ABA Model Rule 3.8(d) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-12\">A prosecutor in a criminal case shall: ... make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b258-9\">. The minutes of the Rules Committee for September 10, 2004 indicate that a primary purpose in revising the criminal discovery rule was to avoid the surprise of learning about discoverable materials during trial, particularly in situations where the police have not advised the prosecutor of their existence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b258-10\">. Objections were raised, for example, to disclosure of witness information where witnesses may be intimidated and to the requirement to identify in writing the information provided to the defense. The minutes of the November 19, 2004 Rules Committee meeting demonstrate that the scope of the State\u2019s disclosure obligation was much debated as well. This debate continued until the committee recommended adoption of the revised rule on May 11, 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b258-11\">. Rule 4-263 was again amended in 2010, but not with respect to this provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\">. Compare <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727 (2010), wherein the Court of Appeals vacated an enhanced sentence due to the State\u2019s failure to disclose, pursuant to Rule 4-342(d), a fingerprint card used against Dove at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
