Barnhart, appellee. The County sought a ruling as to whether appellee, the former County Attorney, violated the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d) by providing legal representation to David Willis, Jr. (\u201cWillis\u201d), a former County employee, in an administrative appeal of the County\u2019s calculation of his retirement benefits, and sought to have appellee disqualified from representing Willis. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. The County appealed and presented one question, containing multiple parts, which we rephrased into four questions, as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-4\">I. Did the circuit court err in finding that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether appel-lee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11, and thereby in granting summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-5\">II. Did the circuit court err in finding that the County waived its right to request disqualification of appellee from representing Willis in the administrative appeal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">III. Did the circuit court err in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on whether appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">IV. Did the circuit court err in finding that declaratory judgment was an inappropriate vehicle for determining whether appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">We answer the first three questions in the negative, and therefore shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Between May 1995, and 2001, appellee was the County Attorney for Baltimore County. In that capacity, appellee represented the County\u2019s Employee Retirement System (\u201cERS\u201d), an agency of the County government that provides pension benefits to retirees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">\n<em>Rowe Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In March 2007, appellee notified the County that she intended to provide legal representation to a retiring County employee, Brian J. Rowe, in an administrative appeal contesting the calculation of his retirement benefits. Rowe accrued service time as a member of a noncontributory pension benefit system prior to joining the County. The County utilizes a contributory pension benefit system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Md.Code (2002) \u00a7 37-203(f)(2) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cSPP\u201d), effective during Rowe\u2019s appeal, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">[I]f an individual transfers from a noncontributory system to a contributory system, on retirement the individual\u2019s retirement allowance shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the accumulated contributions that would have been deducted if the individual had earned the transferred service credit under the new system, including interest on those contributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The interest rate used to calculate Rowe\u2019s pension reduction was at issue in the appeal. The County used the interest rate of 7.875%, compounded monthly, known as the \u201cvaluation rate,\u201d and Rowe contended that the County should have used the interest rate of 5%, compounded yearly, known as the \u201cregular rate.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Prior to the enactment of SPP \u00a7 37-203, and its predecessors, there was no accepted state-wide policy or procedure governing how to handle the transfer of credit between the systems.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 1990, the County worked with an outside consultant and the County\u2019s Office of Law to \u201cformulate! ] a proposed transfer system policy designed to address the question of how the new State requirements [would] be implemented administratively.\u201d As a result, the ERS adopted the Transfer Policy,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which provided that the County was to calculate pension reductions using the valuation rate. In a memorandum, titled \u201cImplementation of System [Transfer [P]olicy,\u201d dated November 28, 1990, the County\u2019s Office of Law stated: \u201cIt is the formal opinion of the Office of Law that [the] proposed system transfer policy, as amended, parallels the actual language of the new legislative enactments and thus[,] constitutes a legally tenable way of administering these new state mandates.\u201d Notwithstanding the adoption of the Transfer Policy, the County, in practice, used the regular rate of interest to calculate the reduction of transferred benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">In 1998, during appellee\u2019s tenure as County Attorney, Rowe, then the Baltimore County Auditor, undertook an audit of the ERS and issued a report to County officials and the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>public. In a final audit report dated June 9, 1998, Rowe advised the County that continuing to calculate benefit reductions with the regular interest rate, \u201ccould result in significantly lower contribution deficiencies than required by the Board\u2019s policy, resulting in higher benefit payments to the member.\u201d Rowe recommended in the final audit report that the County follow the Transfer Policy as endorsed by the November 28, 1990, memorandum, and calculate transferred benefits using the valuation interest rate. After the June 9, 1998, final audit report was released, Rowe had sought \u201canother calculation of his deficiency to determine whether or not the County was complying with State law as he saw it,\u201d which irrespective of his recommendation in the final audit report, Rowe believed required use of the regular interest rate. The County\u2019s Office of Law responded in a memorandum, dated January 16, 2003, to Rowe\u2019s contention, stating that \u201c[t]he law [as it was then constructed] provides no interest rate or standards for determining the interest rate. Accordingly, the General Assembly can be assumed to have left those decisions to the ERS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Rowe\u2019s retirement was to be effective April 1, 2007. On February 21, 2007, Rowe was provided an estimated calculation of his retirement benefits. Rowe\u2019s retirement benefits were calculated using the valuation rate. On March 23, 2007, Rowe, represented by appellee, noted an appeal of the calculation of his retirement benefits to the Board of Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). The Board held a hearing on Rowe\u2019s appeal on November 28, 2007, and February 12, 2008. At the hearing, Rowe testified that he accepted the position of County Auditor in 1995, upon representations made to him that the value of his unpaid pension contributions would be calculated using the regular interest rate of 5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On June 3, 2008, following Rowe\u2019s hearing, the Board issued an opinion finding in favor of Rowe and ordering the County to recalculate Rowe\u2019s retirement benefits using the regular interest rate. In its opinion and order, the Board reviewed the statutory history of SPP \u00a7 37-203(f)(2) and opinions by the Attorney General and County Attorney\u2019s Office interpret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ing SPP \u00a7 37\u2014203(f)(2). The Board noted that on April 17, 2007, Senate Bill 583, entitled \u201cAlternative Contributory Pension Selection'\u2014Clarifications\u201d passed and that Bill 583 amended SPP \u00a7 37-203(f)(2) to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">Except as provided in \u00a7 87-204 of this subtitle, if an individual transfers from a noncontributory system to a contributory system, on retirement the individual\u2019s retirement allowance shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the member contributions that would have been deducted if the individual had earned the transferred service credit under the new system, including regular interest on those contributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The Board concluded that this \u201cmeans that the legislature was clarifying its intention with respect to each section set forth in the Bill, including SPP \u00a7 37-203(f)(2). The intention has always been to utilize [the] regular interest [rate] in the computation of the reduction.\u201d The County filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by the Board on September 10, 2008. On October 1, 2008, the County petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\n<em>Willis Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">On August 2, 2008, Willis retired from employment with the County. Prior to his employment with the County, Willis worked for the State of Maryland, which utilizes a noncontributory pension benefit plan. Willis disagreed with the County\u2019s use of the valuation rate in calculating his retirement benefits and hired appellee to represent him in contesting the calculation. On August 13, 2008, appellee noted an appeal on behalf of Willis to the Board. Appellee, in the scope of her representation of Rowe and Willis in their appeals, sent letters to the County dated August 18, 2008, and October 22, 2008, in which she demanded correction of the County\u2019s calculation of retirement benefits on behalf of Rowe, Willis, \u201cand all others similarly situated past and future retirees who transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>service credit from a noncontributory system to the County Retirement System.\u201d In the letters, appellee stated an intention to initiate a class-action lawsuit if the County did not comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In a letter dated November 5, 2008, to appellee, the County for the first time raised an issue as to the propriety of appellee\u2019s representation of County retirees. The County claimed the existence of a conflict of interest due to appellee\u2019s prior representation of the ERS during her tenure as the County Attorney. In a letter to the County dated November 14, 2008, appellee responded that the County\u2019s position was factually and legally incorrect. In the letter, appellee stated that she had \u201cnever participated personally and/or substantially in the matter at issue in Mr. Rowe\u2019s or Mr. Willis\u2019 appeals\u201d and accused the County of raising the contention for tactical reasons. On January 20, 2009, appellee sent an e-mail to the County stating: \u201cHaving not received any motion to disqualify me from representing Mr. Willis in his Board of Appeals hearing next week I assume that you have reconsidered and that you will not be seeking my disqualification!;.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">On January 21, 2009, six days before Willis\u2019 scheduled hearing before the Board,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the County filed a Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking that the circuit court find that: (1) appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 by accepting representation of Willis in a matter in which \u201cshe \u2018participated personally and substantially\u2019 during her tenure as County Attorney for Baltimore County, Maryland from 1995-2001,\u201d and (2) appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 when she failed to request and obtain, pursuant to those Rules, informed consent for her representation of Willis from the County. On February 26, 2009, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. On April 30, 2009, a circuit court judge, in a document titled \u201cMemorandum to the File,\u201d stated: \u201cThe Declaratory Judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>ment Complaint is to no purpose because it asks for no relief that this court can or should grant in a specific case. Therefore, it should be dismissed. I would make a Declaration that I cannot grant the relief requested because it is to no purpose discernable to me.\u201d The circuit court judge stated: \u201cIf Baltimore County is asking that [appellee] be disqualified from representing a client in an administrative proceeding that is working itself through the system ... because of a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, then Baltimore County can amend its complaint in this case to ask for that relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">On June 9, 2009, the County filed an Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, which repeated the two requests for relief in the original Complaint, and added a third request for declaratory judgment, seeking that appellee be disqualified from representing Willis in his administrative appeal. In the Amended Complaint, the County alleged that \u201c[i]n her position as County Attorney, [appellee] knew or should have known that the Office of Law participated in the drafting of the Transfer Policy and a formal opinion, which concluded that the policy was in compliance with applicable State and county law.\u201d The County alleged that \u201c[a]s County Attorney, [appellee] was in the position to receive significant attorney-client confidences relating to the ERS and specifically, the issues related to this matter. Such confidences could have been conveyed during casual conversations with various County officials, employees and departments.\u201d The County alleged that \u201c[o]ne of the matters that [appellee] was privy to included\u201d Rowe\u2019s 1998 audit of the ERS. The County alleged that the findings of Rowe\u2019s 1998 audit \u201cform the basis for Mr. Willis\u2019 challenge to the calculation of his retirement benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In the Amended Complaint, the County alleged that prior to the issuance of Rowe\u2019s final audit report, a draft report was provided to Frederick J. Homan, a member of the Board of Trustees for ERS, who was then serving as the Director of the County\u2019s Office of Budget and Finance. The County alleged that on May 28, 1998, Homan authored a memorandum titled \u201cResponse\u2014ERS Compliance Audit.\u201d Numerical reference 4 of the memorandum stated that, \u201cissues related to the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>pretation of State and County provisions will be discussed with the Office of Law.\u201d The County alleged that Homan recalled discussing with appellee the application of the Transfer Policy and that he \u201cspecifically sought the advice and counsel of [appellee] to clarify what, if any, fiduciary duty\u201d the County Executive, as a member of the ERS Board of Trustees, had in regards to intervening in favor of a \u201c \u2018prospective application\u2019 of a Board policy that would benefit Mr. Rowe, Mr. Willis, and others and would cost the ERS thousands of dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">On July 7, 2009, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment, alleging that: (1) the Amended Complaint failed to set forth facts sufficient to demonstrate a violation of the rules of professional conduct; (2) the County waived the right to seek disqualification of appellee from representing Willis by failing to object to appellee\u2019s representation of Rowe on the exact issue for over a year; (3) the circuit court should decline to issue a declaratory judgment on the first two prayers for relief because the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over attorney conduct matters; and (4) alternatively, the circuit court should decline to issue a declaratory judgment on the first two prayers for relief as the requested declaration would not terminate the controversy between the parties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The County filed an Opposition to appellee\u2019s motion, and appellee filed a Reply to the County\u2019s Opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">On September 29, 2009, appellee deposed Homan. At the deposition, Homan testified that he was the only individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>with personal knowledge of the allegations set forth in the Amended Complaint. Homan testified that he recalled having \u201cmaybe two or three\u201d verbal conversations with appellee in 1998, around the time of the audit. Homan testified that these conversations concerned a possible ethical issue involving Rowe\u2019s actions during and after the preparation of the audit report. As to the discussion pertaining to the valuation rate, Homan testified that \u201cthe discussion was about the effect on Rowe and why Rowe was so interested in the one versus the other.\u201d Homan testified that he did not recall appellee providing any legal advice during these conversations and that he had no personal knowledge of whether or not appellee researched the issue. Homan testified that he understood the issue in Rowe\u2019s case to be \u201c[t]he same as Mr. Willis\u2019[ ] case ____generally the valuation rate versus the regular interest rate issue.\u201d Homan testified that he first became aware of appellee representing Rowe, a former County employee, shortly after Rowe resigned but when asked why he did not raise the issue earlier, he answered \u201cI don\u2019t really have an answer for that.\u201d Homan testified that he believed, at that time, that appellee\u2019s representation was a violation of the MLRPC, and that \u201cwe discussed it internally but it wasn\u2019t raised until later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">On September 30, 2009, the County deposed appellee. At the deposition, appellee testified that during her tenure as County Attorney she was not aware of the ERS audit and had no recollection of any conversation with Homan about the audit. Appellee testified that she \u201cremember[ed] having discussions at different times regarding issues [she] now [knew] to be part of that audit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Appellee filed a Supplemental Memorandum in support of the Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, or in the alternative Motion for Summary Judgment, which included excerpts from Homan\u2019s deposition. On November 30, 2009, the County moved to strike the supplemental memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">On May 6, 2010, a hearing was held on appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, or in the alternative Motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>for Summary Judgment<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the County\u2019s Motion to Strike the Supplemental Memorandum. The trial judge denied the County\u2019s Motion to Strike. The trial judge declined to rule on the Motion for Summary Judgment from the bench. Instead, after entertaining argument from both parties, the trial judge instructed the County that it had ten days to supplement its argument before a ruling on appellee\u2019s motion. On May 17, 2010, the County filed a Supplemental Opposition. On May 19, 2010, appellee filed a letter in response to the County\u2019s Opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">On June 21, 2010, the circuit court issued an Opinion and Order, granting summary judgment in favor of appellee. The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">To this court, the thrust of [appelleej\u2019s motion is three fold: (1) Assuming the allegations contained in the verified amended complaint are accepted as true, they do not allege a violation of the Rules of MLRPC. Furthermore, reviewing the verified statements, affidavits, exhibits, attachments, etc. leads to the conclusion that there is no dispute as to any <em>material </em>fact and that the allegations and all supplied documents do not, cannot, and will not sustain a violation of Rule 1.9 and 1.11 of the MLRPC. (2) That given the representation by [appellee] of Mr. Rowe in excess of two years prior to the Willis matter without suggestion of a conflict of interest by the County and given the fact that the matter litigated in Rowe is the precise issue in dispute in the Willis matter, the County has waived its right to move for either a declaration that [appellee] has violated the rules or for her disqualification in the Willis matter. (3) As the County has asked this court for a <em>declaration </em>that [appellee] violated the rules involved, this court has no jurisdiction to do so as the Court of Appeals has the exclusive jurisdiction over such a matter upon a finding by the Attorney Grievance Commission that a violation has occurred. Additional<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>ly, that the request for Declaratory Judgment will not, in effect, terminate the controversy between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-4\">For the reasons set forth below, this court is persuaded that [appellee]\u2019s motion has merit and will grant her summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">As to appellee\u2019s alleged violation of the MLRPC, the circuit court held that \u201cthe allegations do not display a factual basis for a finding that the rules have been violated.\u201d The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">To this court, as indicated, the Amended Complaint represents no more than speculation, conjecture and unfounded conclusions without indicating a true sufficient basis for the relief sought.... The written exhibits also failed to generate issues of material fact vis a vis [appelleej\u2019s role as County Attorney and the precise issue contained in the Willis dispute. The court gave additional opportunity to the County to flesh out/provide facts upon which the court could find the requisite genuine dispute as to a material fact. The court can find none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">As to appellee\u2019s disqualification as counsel, the circuit court found that the County waived its argument that appellee should be disqualified from representing Willis, due to delay in bringing the request. The circuit court found that \u201cthe delay was due and occasioned by the County for tactical reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">As to jurisdiction, the circuit court found that \u201cin seeking relief in this matter, [the County] is attempting to circumvent the entire process established to determine if an attorney has engaged in professional misconduct\u201d and that the Court of Appeals has \u201cprimary jurisdiction\u201d in a matter such as this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a grant of summary judgment. <em>Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, v. Orient Express Delivery Serv., </em>190 Md.App. 438, 451, 988 A.2d 1120 (2010) (citation omitted). We are \u201cobliged to conduct an independent review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>record to determine if there is a dispute of material fact. A material fact is one that will alter the outcome of the case, depending upon how the fact-finder resolves the dispute. Mere general allegations of conclusory assertions will not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 988 A.2d 1120 (citations and internal quotations omitted). We will uphold the grant of summary judgment \u201cwhere there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, 988 A.2d 1120 (internal quotations and citations omitted). We resolve all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 988 A.2d 1120.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">On appeal, the County argues that the trial court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment because a genuine dispute of material fact exists under MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 as to whether: (1) appellee\u2019s representation of Willis is the \u201csame or a substantially related matter\u201d as her former representation of the County during her tenure as County Attorney; and (2) appellee is in possession of confidential government information obtained during her tenure as County Attorney, which could be used to the detriment of the County in her representation of Willis.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">In contrast, appellee responds that the trial court properly granted summary judgment as the case involves no genuine issues of disputed material fact. Appellee contends that Willis\u2019 appeal concerns purely a question of statutory interpretation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and she never conducted any research nor was she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>asked to give a legal opinion with respect to whether the County was required to use the regular rate or the valuation rate of interest in calculating transferred retirement benefits. Appellee argues that she possesses no confidential information which could be used to the detriment of the County in her representation of Willis. Appellee notes that \u201call of the documents in this matter are public records in the public domain,\u201d and, as a result, there is no confidential information to be used to the County\u2019s disadvantage in the Willis appeal. In sum, appellee maintains that she has not violated MLRPC 1.9 or 1.11, and there is no basis on which to grant her disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>1. Same or Substantially Related Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">MLRPC 1.9, titled \u201cDuties to Former Clients,\u201d provides in pertinent part: \u201cA lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person\u2019s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.\u201d (Emphasis added). Comment 2, affixed to MLRPC 1.9, explains that \u201c[t]he scope of a \u2018matter\u2019 for purposes of this Rule depends on the facts of a particular situation or transaction. The lawyer\u2019s involvement in a matter can also be a question of degree.\u201d \u201cMatters are \u2018substantially related\u2019 for purposes of this Rule if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client\u2019s position in the subsequent matter.\u201d MLRPC 1.9, Comment 3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">MLRPC 1.11 is titled \u201cSpecial Conflicts of Interest for Former and Current Government Officers and Employees,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>and largely mirrors MLRPC 1.9. MLRPC 1.11(a)(2) provides that \u201ca lawyer who has formerly served as a public officer or employee of the government ... shall not otherwise represent a client in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee, unless the appropriate government agency gives its informed consent, confirmed in writing, to the representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Interpretation of MLRPC 1.9 in Maryland case law is limited,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and is noticeably absent as to MLRPC 1.11. When evaluating the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe same or a substantially related matter,\u201d as set forth in MLRPC 1.9, for the purpose of determining attorney disqualification, this Court, in <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>158 Md.App. 458, 468, 857 A.2d 590 (2004), <em>aff'd, Gatewood, </em>388 Md. 526, 880 A.2d 322, observed that \u201c[t]he case law in Maryland on this issue is sparse, but this is a point of law that crosses jurisdictional lines, and rulings from courts that have addressed similarly worded professional conduct rules are relevant.\u201d (Citations omitted). We noted that in addressing a similar rule of professional conduct, the Supreme Court of Kansas<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>There is widespread agreement that conflict questions involving former clients should be resolved through application of the substantial relationship test. However, there is no standard definition of what the test should compare in determining whether there is a close connection between the conflicting representations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In this case, the circuit court relied on <em>Franklin v. Clark, </em>454 F.Supp.2d 356 (D.Md.2006), in determining whether a genuine dispute of material fact existed regarding appellee\u2019s alleged violations of MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11. In <em>Franklin, </em>the District Court applied MLRPC 1.11 in ruling on a motion to disqualify an attorney, who represented a terminated Baltimore City police officer, and previously represented the Baltimore City Solicitor\u2019s Office. 454 F.Supp.2d at 363-67. The District Court concluded that the matters of the attorney\u2019s prior and current representation were not the same or substantially related. <em>Id. </em>at 367. The District Court explained that the attorney \u201cdid not, and could not [have], engage[d] in any \u2018investigative or deliberative process\u2019 with regard to [the officer\u2019s] termination[,]\u201d and therefore was not \u201csubstantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>and personally involved\u201d in the termination of the officer, pursuant to MLRPC 1.11(a). <em>Id. </em>at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In deciding whether the scope of the attorney\u2019s former representation met the criteria of MLRPC 1.11, the District Court found it \u201chelpful to review cases where former government attorneys were disqualified pursuant to MLRPC 1.11(a)[,]\u201d such as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">In <em>United States v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>312 F.Supp.2d 27 (D.D.C.2004), the court disqualified a former Justice Department attorney from representing a tobacco company after the government produced time sheets indicating that the attorney had logged more than 382 hours on substantially related litigation. In <em>Dugar v. Board of Educ., </em>1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8650, 1992 WL 142302 (N.D.Ill.1992), the court disqualified an attorney bringing an action by a student who had been expelled because that attorney previously supervised the Chicago Board of Education attorneys who represented the board at student suspension and expulsion hearings. Likewise, in the companion case of <em>Porter v. Board of Educ., </em>1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9617, 1992 WL 166570 (N.D.Ill.1992), the court disqualified an attorney who brought a suit on behalf of teachers contesting the board\u2019s disciplinary procedures because that attorney previously represented the board in teacher disciplinary actions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 366. In contrast to the cases discussed above, the District Court in <em>Franklin </em>held that the attorney\u2019s involvement was \u201cmuch more remote than the cases listed above.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, the attorney \u201cassert[ed] that he has no knowledge whatsoever concerning the reasons for terminating [the officer], the underlying factual incidents leading up to [the officer\u2019s] termination, and the defendants\u2019 response to [the officer\u2019s] allegations that he was wrongfully terminated. Indeed, [the attorney] was fired approximately two months before the events giving rise to [the officer\u2019s] termination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">As to MLRPC 1.11(c), the District Court in <em>Franklin </em>concluded that the attorney possessed no confidential information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>which could be used to the material disadvantage of his former client. <em>Id. </em>at 368. The District Court acknowledged that the attorney had drafted a memorandum while representing the Solicitor\u2019s Office, which addressed the law relevant to his current representation of the terminated police officer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 367. The District Court concluded that even though the memorandum \u201clikely constituted a confidential attorney-client communication when it was created[,] the defendants waived any expectation of confidentiality when they voluntarily produced it through the course of discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Returning to the present case, an examination of the record, in light of the case law discussed above, leads to the conclusion that the circuit court correctly determined that no genuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether appellee, during her tenure as County Attorney, was \u201csubstantially and personally involved\u201d in the same matter being considered in Willis\u2019 administrative appeal. Similarly, the record reveals no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether appellee possessed confidential government information acquired during her tenure as County Attorney, which could have been used to the material disadvantage of the County in Willis\u2019 administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The sole source of information as to appellee\u2019s alleged conflict of interest is Homan. A review of Homan\u2019s deposition testimony reveals no facts from which a reasonable factfinder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>could determine that appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11. Homan testified that he recalled \u201ctwo or three\u201d conversations with appellee regarding the calculation of the interest rate to be applied to transferred benefits. Nevertheless, according to Homan the substance of these conversations specifically involved whether Rowe had committed an ethical violation during and after the preparation of the 1998 audit report by advocating for the use of the regular interest rate, in contrast to the Transfer Policy, without disclosing the personal benefit he would obtain therefrom. As to the conversations, Homan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you have any memory of what was said during these conversations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">[HOMAN]: Yes, I do, and what the conversation\u2014if I may just a little, just to put them in a little perspective so you know how they fit in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">[HOMAN]: The Auditor\u2019s Office began to do an audit of the system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-9\">[HOMAN]: Prior or as the audit was beginning, I was advised that Mr. Rowe had raised an issue, a personal issue for himself of the issue between the valuation rate and the regular interest rate. That was communicated to members of my staff, one of whom was the Deputy Director, but also people inside would, to look at this matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And \u201cthis matter\u201d being the interest rate issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-11\">[HOMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. And what was the second conversation you had with [appellee] after this draft report that was pulled back that was making the recommendation to not follow up the policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-13\">[HOMAN]: Well, that was that, unbelievably enough, they\u2019d actually done it without disclosing that they had a personal interest involved. I mean, they actually\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: When you said they had done it, they had\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-4\">[HOMAN]: They actually made a recommendation that Board policy not be followed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And other than disclosing that to [appellee], do you recall anything else about that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">[HOMAN]: Yeah. We talked about the very fact that Rowe and others in the office\u2014I don\u2019t think I knew about Willis specifically at that time\u2014but Rowe and others in the office were going, would benefit by this recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Homan admitted that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t really any substance to\u201d his second conversation with appellee. As to his third conversation with appellee, Homan testified that the substance of that conversation again involved perceived ethical violations by Rowe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And do you recall the substance of that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">[HOMAN]: It was about this memo and it was about the fact that\u2014it was also about ethics. It was about the [ Valuation rate.... And essentially, the County Auditor had gone to the Council Chairman to write to him, the clear implication being that he wanted the County Executive to use his authority over other members of the Board of Trustees in their day-to-day capacities as department heads to make a change in the policy so they would be applied prospectively so that Mr. Rowe would have the regular interest rate versus the valuation rate utilized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apt\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you recall\u2014you said you talked about the ethics, the valuation rate and the fact that it involved a councilman and the County Executive. Do you recall the substance of what you spoke about with regard to the ethics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">[HOMAN]: Yes. I, frankly, believe that Mr. Rowe had committed ethical violations and I thought that he had also led the councilman inadvertently, unsuspectingly, which turned out to be true later. The auditor, in fact, wrote the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>memo. The chairman did not. And the chairman did not have the issues explained to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\">But essentially, it was about that the auditor had clearly crossed the line. He was asking for a prospective application to benefit himself and he had utilized the councilman to do that in contracting the Executive, knowing full well that Executive was an ex-officio member of the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Homan specifically confirmed that the conversations he recalled with appellee regarding the correct transfer rate were limited in subject matter to a potential ethical issue involving Rowe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: You also indicated that you discussed the valuation rate. I take it to mean you discussed the, which of the two ratings should be applied. Is that what the discussion was about with [appellee]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIf\">[HOMAN]: And the discussion was about the effect on Rowe and why Rowe was so interested in the one versus the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you recall any other conversations about the valuation rate other than why it would be to Mr. Rowe\u2019s benefit to use one rate over the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aaq\">[HOMAN]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Homan was asked several times in the course of his deposition if he recalled appellee providing any legal advice regarding the transfer rate, and each time he responded that he did not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And this was you communicating to [appellee] your views of the situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">[HOMAN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Did she, in response, give you any legal advice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-12\">[HOMAN]: I don\u2019t recall her affirming or objecting. I don\u2019t remember her commenting in that regard at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you recall if she gave you any legal advice regarding the ethics of the situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>[HOMAN]: Well, she believed that Rowe had crossed the line, clearly. I mean, that wasn\u2019t an issue. I just don\u2019t remember whether or not she made a comment as to the other part of the issue, which was the Moxley issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, other than [appellee] agreeing that she thought that Mr. Rowe had acted unethically, do you recall anything else that she advised you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq2\">[HOMAN]: No, I don\u2019t recall anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did [appellee] provide any advice in regards to all of this information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">[HOMAN]: 1 don\u2019t recall that. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did she comment that you can recall in any way on this information you had provided to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">[HOMAN]: I don\u2019t recall any specific comment. I mean, mostly the conversation about, it was incredible that they did that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Did she opine to you that she believed that it did comply with the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">[HOMAN]: No, and she didn\u2019t say that it didn\u2019t. [APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: But as far as you know, she never researched the issue; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">[HOMAN]: I honestly don\u2019t know if she ever researched the issue in that regard....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-12\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you have no personal knowledge whether she did or didn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">[HOMAN]: I do not. I do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">The issue in Willis\u2019 administrative appeal was whether the valuation interest rate or the regular interest rate would be utilized to calculate his retirement benefits. The record reveals that appellee was not personally involved in the calculation of Willis\u2019 retirement benefits during her tenure as County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Attorney. Appellee left her position as County Attorney in 2001, seven years prior to Willis\u2019 retirement, and his subsequent raising of the issue regarding the calculation of his retirement benefits. There are no facts indicating appellee was at all personally or substantially involved in the manner in which the County calculated transferred retirement benefits during her tenure as County Attorney. Appellee, like the attorney whose conduct was at issue in <em>Franklin, </em>\u201cdid not, and could not [have], engage[d] in any \u2018investigative or deliberative process\u2019 with regard\u201d to Willis\u2019 appeal. <em>Franklin, </em>454 F.Supp.2d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The County\u2019s Office of Law set forth a legal opinion on the transfer policy in the November 28, 1990, memorandum, prior to the start of appellee\u2019s tenure as County Attorney. The Office of Law drafted another legal opinion, addressing the transfer rate, in 2003, after the conclusion of appellee\u2019s tenure as County Attorney. Homan did not recall any conversations with appellee regarding what the legally correct transfer rate should be.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Homan specifically testified that appellee never rendered a legal opinion as to what the legally correct transfer rate should be. Homan did not know if appellee ever researched the issue. Based on the record, the circuit court properly determined that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to appellee\u2019s having represented another in the same or a substantially related matter in violation of MLRPC Rules 1.9 and 1.11, and no genuine dispute of material fact as to appellees\u2019 disqualification.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\n<em>2. Confidential Government Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">A review of Homan\u2019s deposition reveals no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether appellee possessed confidential government information which could be used to the detriment of the County in Willis\u2019 administrative appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Homan testified that he could not identify with specificity any confidential information which appellee might possess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And it\u2019s your belief today that [appellee] possesses confidential information of the County\u2019s that she can use to the County\u2019s detriment in the Willis matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">[HOMAN]: I believe, as I said before, that [appellee], going back to the period of this audit, knew exactly what the County\u2019s position was. But was aware or should have been aware that the County Attorney\u2019s office was involved in the adoption of the policy, and if at any point in time had any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>doubts about whether or not the County was doing what was appropriate, should have raised those issues to her client at the time. Having not, having not done that, I have to assume, presume that she believed that what we were doing was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: My question was a little more specific. Do you contend that presently, [appellee] possesses confidential information of the County\u2019s that she can use to the County\u2019s detriment in the Willis matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">[THE COUNTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion. You can answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">[HOMAN]: Without walking through every piece of information that was in there, I guess at. this point in time, through discovery in Rowe, through the whole issue of Rowe that the auditor, the actuary\u2019s discussions, the discussions related to single annuity and the like, although, quite frankly, I\u2019m not sure that access to, that [the outside consultant\u2019s] original report did not play a role in that regard. So I guess it\u2019s very hard for me to answer in that regard as to whether or not there\u2019s any technical information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, let me ask you this. Can you identify for me specifically any confidential information that you believe that [appellee] possesses that she can use to the County\u2019s detriment in the Willis matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANp\">[THE COUNTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">[HOMAN]: Not that I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-9\">[THE COUNTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWl\">[HOMAN]: Not that I can think of specifically beyond what I\u2019ve said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Homan\u2019s testimony failed to demonstrate that appellee had been exposed to any confidential information which could be used to the detriment of the County.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Comment 3 affixed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>MLRPC Rule 1.9 states \u201c[m]atters are \u2018substantially related\u2019 for purposes of this Rule if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client\u2019s position in the subsequent matter.\u201d (Emphasis added). In this case, based on Homan\u2019s testimony, it has not been established that appellee possessed any alleged confidential information that would affect the outcome of Willis\u2019 upcoming appeal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In its Memorandum Opinion, the circuit court concluded that \u201cthe issue of the \u2018discount rate\u2019 is one of statutory interpretation/construction and is not a factual issue at all\u201d and \u201ceven discussions about the transfer rate (not even al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>leged) would not necessarily have generated the conflict suggested.\u201d We agree. The procedure for calculating the discount rate is provided in SPP \u00a7 37\u2014203(f)(2), as amended in 2007, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\">[I]f an individual transfers from a noncontributory system to a contributory system, on retirement the individual\u2019s retirement allowance shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of the member contributions that would have been deducted if the individual had earned the transferred service credit under the new system, including regular interest on those contributions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">(Emphasis added). Rowe\u2019s appeal involved the same matter at issue in Willis\u2019 appeal\u2014whether the County was required to use the regular rate of interest to calculate transferred benefits, or if it was legally permitted to use the valuation rate. In Rowe\u2019s appeal, the Board analyzed the statutory history of SPP \u00a7 37-203(0(2) and concluded that the 2007 amendment clarified that \u201c[t]he intention [of the Legislature] has always been to utilize regular interest in the computation of the reduction.\u201d The Board\u2019s decision that the County must use the regular interest rate in the computation reduction was one of statutory interpretation. As the record fails to substantiate that appellee actually possessed confidential information, and reflects that the Board\u2019s decision was based on an interpretation of the 2007 amendment to SPP \u00a7 37-203(f)(2), no confidential information allegedly possessed by appellee could have materially advanced Willis\u2019 case before the Board. As such, we perceive no error in the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Appellee argues that the circuit court correctly found that the County waived the right to raise the issue of her disqualification as Willis\u2019 attorney in the administrative appeal. Appellee contends that the County could have raised this issue as early as the start of her representation of Rowe in March 2007, but delayed filing the motion for \u201ctactical reasons to discourage the filing of a class action\u201d lawsuit by appellee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Appellee contends that the County \u201cwas long ago aware of all of the now alleged \u2018facts\u2019 and therefore, there is no other rational explanation for why the County never raised the issue in the <em>Rowe </em>case and waited until right before the hearing in the <em>Willis </em>case to raise the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">In contrast, the County argues that it has not waived the right to raise appellee\u2019s disqualification as Willis\u2019 attorney in the administrative appeal. The County contends that the \u201clength of delay is not dispositive on the issue of disqualification and that courts have the duty and power to ensure that the attorneys practicing before it maintain high ethical standards, and such cannot be defeated by laches.\u201d The County contends that any delay in filing the request for disqualification was not motivated by tactical reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">After consideration of the parties\u2019 respective positions and the facts and circumstances of the case, we conclude that the circuit court properly determined the County waived the ability to request appellee\u2019s disqualification. It has been recognized that \u201c[disqualification is a drastic remedy since it deprives litigants of their right to freely choose their own counsel.\u201d <em>Gross v. SES Americom, Inc., </em>307 F.Supp.2d 719, 722 (D.Md.2004) (citations omitted). Discussing the issue of disqualification, in <em>Franklin, </em>454 F.Supp.2d at 365, the District Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">Maryland courts are hesitant to grant disqualification motions, particularly where the opposing party is the sponsor of such a motion, because they can be abused for tactical reasons. Indeed, \u201c[w]hen an opposing party moves for disqualification of the other party\u2019s counsel, the court will take a hard look at such a motion. The concern is that the opposing party will use such a motion to block, harass, or otherwise hinder the other party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Klupt v. Kron-gard, </em>126 Md.App. 179, 728 A.2d 727, 740 (Md.App.1999). To that end, this court must \u201cclosely scrutinize\u201d the disqualification motion. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">\u201c[Disqualification at the urging of opposing counsel is permitted only \u2018where the conflict is such as clearly to call in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>question the fair and efficient administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gross, </em>307 F.Supp.2d at 723. Although \u201c[d]elay is certainly an important factor ... the mere length of delay is not disposi-tive and the Court should not deny a motion to disqualify based on delay alone.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Airshield Corp., </em>908 F.Supp. 299, 307 (D.Md.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Maryland appellate courts have not yet commented on the issue of waiver of the ability to request attorney disqualification. The County relies on the District Court case <em>Buckley, </em>908 F.Supp. at 307, for the proposition that the \u201clength of delay is not dispositive on the issue of waiver of disqualification[.]\u201d The District Court set forth the following standard of review for a request to disqualify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">In evaluating a disqualification motion, a court must first determine whether an attorney-client relationship existed between the challenged law firm and the objecting client, and then resolve whether the matter at issue in the challenged representation is the same or substantially related to the matter involved in the prior representation. <em>Stratagene v. Invitrogen Corp., </em>225 F.Supp.2d 608, 610 (D.Md.2002). However, if the former client \u201cwas concededly aware of [the challenged law firmj\u2019s representation of [the former client] but failed to raise an objection promptly when [it] had the opportunity,\u201d this failure will result in the waiver of the right to raise the disqualification issue. <em>Buckley, </em>908 F.Supp. at 308.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">When determining whether a party has waived its right to move to disqualify counsel, the Court must examine whether the party filed its motion in a timely manner. <em>See Buckley, </em>908 F.Supp. 299 (1995). Timely service of a motion to disqualify helps to curb the potential use of the motion as a litigation tactic or to harass the opposing party. <em>See id. </em>Courts analyze a number of factors when considering whether the motion was timely made, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfD\">when the movant learned of the conflict; whether the movant was represented by counsel during the delay; why the delay occurred, and, in particular, whether the motion was delayed for tactical reasons; and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>disqualification would result in prejudice to the nonmov-ing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\"><em>Buckley, </em>908 F.Supp. at 307, quoting <em>Employers Ins. of Wausau v.

Seeno Construction Co., </em>692 F.Supp. 1150, 1165 (N.D.Cal.1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\"><em>Gross, </em>307 F.Supp.2d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In the absence of Maryland state case law, we will consider the factors outlined by the District Court in <em>Buckley, </em>to determine whether the County has waived the issue of disqualification. As to the first factor, when the movant learned of the conflict, appellee notified the County in March 2007, that she intended to represent Rowe, a retiring County employee, in a challenge to the calculation of his retirement benefits. Rowe\u2019s appeal involved the same issue as Willis\u2019 appeal, and the issues of conflict and disqualification were equally relevant in Rowe\u2019s appeal. The County failed to seek appellee\u2019s disqualification as Rowe\u2019s attorney or to raise any objection whatsoever to appellee\u2019s representation of Rowe. On January 21, 2009, nearly two years after the County became aware of appellee\u2019s representation of Rowe, the County filed the first complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking a ruling that appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 in her representation of Willis, and first sought appellee\u2019s disqualification on June 9, 2009, in its Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">In a letter to the Board, dated August 13, 2008, appellee announced her representation of Willis in contesting the calculation of his retirement benefits. The County waited a period of five months until filing its first complaint for declaratory judgment on January 21, 2009, and nearly a year before filing its first request for disqualification on June 9, 2009. It is fair to say that the County was aware of appellee\u2019s representation of Willis but failed to raise a prompt objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">The second factor concerns whether the County was represented by counsel for the entire period of delay. Indeed, appellee\u2019s correspondence with the County during this period was primarily with the County\u2019s Office of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>As to the third factor, \u201c[w]hy the delay occurred, and, in particular, whether the motion was delayed for tactical reasons,\u201d the County contends its delay was not due to tactical reasons. The County contends that the delay was due to an attempt to resolve the matter of appellee\u2019s representation of Willis informally. The County, however, raised no informal objections to appellee\u2019s representation of Rowe, and provides no explanation for why formal disqualification was not sought during the Rowe appeal. During his deposition, Homan was asked why the County did not move to disqualify appellee from representing Rowe, and Homan could provide no explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-4\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: When\u2019s the first time that you learned [appellee] was representing a Baltimore County employee or former Baltimore County employee with regard to the interest rate issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">[HOMAN]: I don\u2019t remember the date but it was sometime after word spread through the county from the Auditor\u2019s Office that Rowe had resigned and had declared that he was going to file suit against the County. Sometime after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajv\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: At that point, did you contact [appellee] and raise an objection to her representing Mr. Rowe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">[HOMAN]: I did not. I have not. I don\u2019t think, except for saying hello, I\u2019ve had conversation with [appellee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXX\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Do you know if anybody from the County contacted [appellee] and objected to her representing Mr. Rowe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">[HOMAN]: Later but not at that time that I\u2019m aware of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-J\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Is there some reason you didn\u2019t raise that issue at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">[HOMAN]: I believe from the beginning that it\u2019s been a violation. I think what the, the reason that it hadn\u2019t happened and I think the reason that most of the contacts that were made were at first informal and then finally formalized was because there was a belief on our part that she wasn\u2019t ultimately going to go there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: When you say ultimately going to go there, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">[HOMAN]: I think ultimately, we believed that when we pointed out to her that this was an issue, that, you know, she would ultimately agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: But the question is why didn\u2019t you point it out as an issue earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">[HOMAN]: I don\u2019t have an, I don\u2019t really have an answer for that. I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: But you chose not to raise it correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-8\">[HOMAN]: We discussed it internally but it wasn\u2019t raised until later. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-9\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: And you can\u2019t give me a reason for why it wasn\u2019t raised earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-10\">[THE COUNTY\u2019S COUNSEL]: Objection. Asked and answered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-11\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">[HOMAN]: Well, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: Why did you decide to send, or strike that. Why did you decide to raise the issue in the Willis matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-14\">[HOMAN]: It\u2019s no different than what I said a second ago. I continue to believe in both the Rowe and Willis matter it\u2019s inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-15\">[APPELLEE\u2019S COUNSEL]: But is there some reason you did decide to raise it in the Willis matter after not raising it in the Rowe matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-16\">[HOMAN]: Well, we did raise it late in the Rowe matter, I believe. Or later in the Rowe matter, I believe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">In a letter dated November 5, 2008, the County for the first time notified appellee of its opposition to her representation of retiring County employees. The County sent the letter shortly after receiving notice from appellee of her intention to bring a class-action lawsuit representing \u201call similarly situated past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>and future retirees.\u201d In a letter dated October 22, 2008, appellee wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">[Njotice is hereby provided on behalf of Messrs, Willis and Rowe of their intent to pursue claims for underpaid benefits, interest, fees and costs, as well as injunctive, declaratory, mandamus and class action relief against the County, the Retirement System and its Board of Trustees, and the Director of Budget and Finance, under state, county, constitutional and common law, on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated past and future retirees who transferred service credit from a noncontributory system to the County Retirement System.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Based on the timing of the County\u2019s response, a logical inference is that the County sought appellee\u2019s disqualification to avert her representation of a potential class of plaintiffs on the same issue in the future. The timing of the County\u2019s formal request on January 21, 2009, for appellee\u2019s disqualification, six days before Willis\u2019 appeal was scheduled to be heard on January 27, 2009, suggests tactical reasons for the request, as the County had been aware for at least two months that the matter would not be resolved informally, and that appellee would proceed with her representation of Willis.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">As to the fourth factor, whether disqualification would result in prejudice to the nonmoving party, we note that the appeal in Willis\u2019 case has been delayed for more than two years due to litigation of this issue. Forcing Willis to start the appeal anew with new counsel would undeniably result in the prejudice of further delay. All of the factors discussed above lead to the conclusion that the circuit court properly determined that through the County\u2019s inaction, despite ample prior notice of appellee\u2019s representation of Willis, and indeed, Rowe, the County waived the ability to request appellee\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">The County contends that it is within the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to determine via declaratory judgment whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11. The County denies that it sought disciplinary action against appellee under the MLRPC. The County maintains that it \u201cmerely [sought] an interpretation of the ethical rules in a concrete factual setting, which is commonplace in Maryland courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In contrast, appellee argues that the circuit court properly found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the County\u2019s request for a ruling as to whether appellee violated the MLRPC. Relying on <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 220, 892 A.2d 533 (2006), appellee contends that \u201c[i]n Maryland, the Court of Appeals \u2018has original and complete jurisdiction over all attorney disciplinary matters arising from the conduct of a member of the Maryland State Bar.\u2019 \u201d According to appellee, \u201cthe Court of Appeals is the ultimate arbiter of any complaints concerning attorney misconduct in the State of Maryland and whether a Maryland attorney has violated the rules governing attorney conduct.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pak, </em>400 Md. 567, 599-600, 929 A.2d 546 (2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>552 U.S. 1099, 128 S.Ct. 905, 169 L.Ed.2d 729 (2008), the Court of Appeals explained that it has exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings involving an attorney\u2019s alleged violation of ethical rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">The Court of Appeals has original and complete jurisdiction over all attorney disciplinary matters arising from the conduct of a member of the Maryland State Bar. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 220, 892 A.2d 533, 539 (2006) (\u201c[T]his Court has original and complete jurisdiction in attorney discipline matters\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We determine, ultimately, whether an attorney has committed the misconduct charged by the Attorney Grievance Commission.\u201d); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 654, 870 A.2d 229, 239 (2005) (\u201cIn proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction\u201d). This Court is the ultimate arbiter of any claims concerning attorney misconduct in the State of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>land, and the rules and procedures governing an Attorney Grievance action are predicated upon the Court of Appeals having jurisdiction to hear such a case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The section of the MLRPC titled \u201cScope,\u201d confirms that a violation of a professional conduct rule does not give rise to an independent cause of action, nor does an opposing party have standing to seek enforcement of the rule through a collateral proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">Violation of a Rule does not itself give rise to a cause of action against a lawyer nor does it create any presumption that a legal duty has been breached. In addition, violation of a Rule does not necessarily' warrant any other nondisciplinary remedy, such as disqualification of a lawyer in pending litigation. The Rules are designed to provide guidance to lawyers and to provide a structure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not designed to be a basis for civil liability. Furthermore, the purpose of the Rules can be subverted when they are invoked by opposing parties as procedural weapons. The fact that a Rule is a just basis for a lawyer\u2019s self-assessment, or for sanctioning a lawyer under the administration of a disciplinary authority, does not imply that an antagonist in a collateral proceeding or transaction has standing to seek enforcement of the Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Md. Lawyer\u2019s R. Profl Conduct Scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In this case, we conclude that the circuit court correctly determined that it does not have jurisdiction to determine whether appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 in a declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Maryland case law and the MLRPC are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>clear\u2014the Court of Appeals is the sole arbiter of whether a Maryland attorney has violated one of the rules of professional conduct.

Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-731, a complaint alleging that an attorney has engaged in professional misconduct is to be sent in writing to Bar Counsel.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A complaint is subject to investigation by Bar Counsel, and if found to be frivolous, unfounded or not alleging facts which, if true, would demonstrate either professional misconduct or incapacity, may be dismissed without further action. Md. Rule 16-731. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-734, if Bar Counsel concludes that the complaint is not frivolous, Bar Counsel conducts an investigation and makes a recommendation for action. Under Maryland Rule 16-734, Bar Counsel may recommend action resulting in: (1) dismissal of the complaint, (2) approval of a Conditional Diversion Agreement, (3) issuance of a reprimand, (4) preparation of a formal statement of charges\u2014subject to peer review\u2014or (5) an immediate disciplinary or remedial action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Md. Rule 16-734. If Bar Counsel files charges, the attorney subject to investigation is entitled to a hearing in the circuit court, where the \u201cjudge shall prepare and file or dictate into the record a statement of the judge\u2019s findings of fact, including findings as to any evidence regarding remedial action, and conclusions of law.\u201d Md. Rule 16-757. The Court of Appeals reviews the circuit court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>and reviews any exceptions to the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact using a clear and convincing evidence standard. Md. Rule 16-759(b). Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(c), \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals may order: (1) disbarment, (2) suspension, (3) reprimand, (4) inactive status, (5) dismissal of the disciplin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ary or remedial action, or (6) a remand for further proceedings.\u201d All proceedings remain confidential unless and until a petition for disciplinary or remedial relief is filed. Md. Rule 16-723. It is clear that to pursue an alleged violation of the MLRPC, a complaint must be instituted, in writing, to Bar Counsel, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-731, and that the process set forth above confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeals to resolve the complaint. We know of no statute, rule, or Maryland appellate authority conferring jurisdiction on the circuit court to adjudicate an alleged violation of the MLRPC via declaratory judgment, and despite appellant\u2019s contentions, we decline to conclude that such jurisdiction exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">.

In fact, the County\u2019s sole witness, Homan, testified that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>issue was \"the same\u201d as that in Rowe\u2019s administrative appeal, \"generally the valuation rate versus the regular interest rate issue.\u201d Homan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">[APPELLEE'S COUNSEL]: What\u2019s your understanding of the issues that are involved in Mr. Willis\u2019[ ] case against the County?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">[HOMAN]: Mr. Willis believes that rather than the valuation rate being used in accordance with Board policy that dates back, Board of Trustees policy that dates back to 1991, that a regular interest rate should have been used. The result of that would have been to discount at a lower interest rate which would have net increased his pension benefit by some amount. I don\u2019t remember the amount.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b729-10\">. The County contends that appellee provided her legal opinion of the audit in several memoranda, and that these opinions are the equivalent of possessing confidential government information, which could be used 1o the material disadvantage of the County. We disagree. The record reflects that Homan testified that he was unaware of appellee rendering any legal opinion as to the interest rate. To the extent that the County contends appellee possesses confidential information, it is not sufficient to generate a genuine dispute of material fact as to appellee\u2019s involvement in rendering an opinion on the interest rate. Homan testified that he had three conversations with appellee on the interest rate issue, however, these conversations mainly covered Rowe\u2019s involvement in the matter and a public memo from a councilmen to the County Executive. There is nothing in the record that states appellee was personally involved in rendering the interest rate for this case or that the conversations with Homan provided confidential government information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b730-11\">. Additionally, as the County has placed into the public record legal opinions developed before and after appellee\u2019s tenure as County Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ney addressing the transfer policy, and has provided numerous other documents to appellee in discovery for the Rowe appeal relating to the 1998 audit, the County has waived any expectation of confidentiality in these attorney-client communications. <em>See Franklin, </em>454 F.Supp.2d at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The County has provided a number of documents to appellee, through discovery in the Rowe appeal, including: (1) the public written opinions from the County's Office of Law on the legally correct transfer rate from 1990, and 2003; (2) the 1998 audit report; (3) Homan's memorandum response to the audit report; (4) Chairman Moxley's 1998 Memorandum to County Executive Ruppersberger regarding retroactive application of the Transfer Policy; and (5) the memoranda from Buck\u2019s Consultants opining on the County's transfer policy from 1990 and 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. The County relies on <em>Tessier v. Plastic Surgery Specialists, Inc., </em>731 F.Supp. 724, 730 (E.D.Va.1990) and <em>Analytica, Inc. v. NPD Research, Inc., </em>708 F.2d 1263, 1266 (7th Cir.1983) for the proposition that a lawyer may not represent an adversary of his former client \"if the lawyer could have obtained confidential information in the first representation that would have been relevant in the second.\u201d The County has, however, put forward no facts sufficient for a reasonable fact finder to determine that confidential information relevant to any issue in Willis' appeal \u201ccould\u201d have been received by appellee during her tenure as County Attorney. The County\u2019s contention that appellee \"could have\u201d obtained confidential government information from casual conversations or inter-office memoranda is mere speculation. \"Mere speculation as to the possible existence of a factual dispute will not defeat a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>A.J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 262, 634 A.2d 1330 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. At oral argument, the County argued that an appearance of impropriety is an independent basis for appellee's disqualification. This, however, is the first instance in which the County raised the issue of the appearance of impropriety as an independent basis for disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">In the Amended Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, the County sought declaratory judgment on a third ground-appellee's disqualification. In the Amended Complaint within Count 1, the County asked that the circuit court declare that appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 and added the language: \"That this Court declare that [appellee] be disqual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ified from representing David Willis, Jr. in the administrative appeal of the decision of the ERS Board of Trustees, which is currently pending before the Baltimore County Board of Appeals.\u201d Within Count 2, the County asked that the circuit court declare that appellee violated MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11 and added the language: \"That this Court declare that [appellee] be disqualified from representing David Willis, Jr. in the administrative appeal of the decision of the ERS Board of Trustees, which is currently pending before the Baltimore County Board of Appeals.\u201d Nothing in the County's Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory Judgment provides a basis of the County's request that appellee be disqualified, other than appellee's alleged violation of MLRPC 1.9 and 1.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In its brief on appeal, the County contends that \"the rules prohibit the 'appearance of impropriety.' \u201d (Emphasis added). In its Reply Brief, the County argues that \"the [cjircuit [c]ourt should have declared that [appellee] violated Rules 1.9 and 1.11 of the MLRPC and as such, should have been disqualified from representing Mr. Willis.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">At no point prior to oral argument did the County argue the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d to be an independent basis on which the circuit court could have disqualified appellee from representing Willis. As a result, the County failed to raise the issue of the appearance of impropriety as an independent basis for disqualification before the circuit court. Md. Rule 8-131 (\"Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that the issue was raised before the circuit court, the outcome would likely have been the same. The MLRPC does not contain a rule on the appearance of impropriety. The Court of Appeals has stated that although the appearance of impropriety is an \"important consideration that a judge may take into account in the exercise of his or her discretion,\u201d there is no <em>\u201cper se </em>rule requiring disqualification once an appearance of impropriety is believed to exist.\u201d <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>388 Md. 526, 546, 880 A.2d 322 (2005) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The Court is reluctant to \"require disqualification when merely an appearance of impropriety is shown to exist.\u201d <em>Gatewood, </em>388 Md. at 546-47, 880 A.2d 322 (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b742-4\">.
