SALMON (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">At approximately 3:15 a.m. on June 29, 2009, Carrie McGurk and a male companion were on the second floor balcony of a house located at 608 Philadelphia Avenue, Ocean City, Maryland. An Ocean City police officer, who was passing by on his bicycle, saw the couple. He parked his bike, and, uninvited, walked up one flight of stairs and entered onto the balcony. The officer was later joined on the balcony by one of his police colleagues, who was also uninvited. Based upon what the police officers saw on the balcony, Ms. McGurk was arrested and twice searched. As a result of what was found in the searches incident to her arrest, she was charged with possession of marijuana, and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, and various other drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Ms. McGurk filed a motion to suppress the evidence that was taken from her by the police, as a result of the searches. After a hearing was held, the motions judge, without comment, denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Ms. McGurk elected a bench trial and proceeded on a not-guilty agreed statement of facts as to the charge of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine. The trial judge found her guilty of that offense and sentenced her to three-years incarceration but suspended all that sentence in favor of a period of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">In this appeal, Ms. McGurk contends, for various reasons, that the motions judge erred in denying her motion to suppress. The most important issue raised is whether the police officers, who entered onto the second story balcony, physically intruded into a \u201cconstitutionally protected area\u201d i.e., an area in which Ms. McGurk had a reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>See Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The issue is important because if the intrusion was into a \u201cconstitutionally protected area,\u201d all the evidence seized by the police incident to the arrest should have been suppressed based on the \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree doctrine.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. Untied States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Facts Established At The Suppression Hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Philadelphia Avenue is a two-way street in Ocean City, Maryland, that runs north and south. The place where Ms. McGurk was arrested, 608 Philadelphia Avenue, is approximately 13 blocks north of the inlet, which is the southern most part of Ocean City. That address is on the east side of Philadelphia Avenue and has a front porch and a balcony. The floor of the balcony is 10 feet above ground. A waist high wooden railing is on the west and a portion of the north side of the balcony. Both the front porch and the balcony face Philadelphia Avenue. A person on the balcony can gain entrance into the living quarters of the dwelling by accessing a door at the rear (east side) of the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">At the time Ms. McGurk was arrested, the balcony was decorated with flowers and plants. A glass table was positioned towards the south-end of the balcony. Additionally there was \u201ca two-person style rocking chair\u201d and at least one other chair on the balcony. Below the balcony, on the west side of the front porch, there is a very narrow lawn that is adjacent to the sidewalk that borders on Philadelphia Avenue. The first step on the staircase that leads to the balcony is very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>close to the sidewalk. From the stairs, the entrance onto the balcony is on the north side.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On June 29, 2009, Carrie McGurk was on the second-floor balcony of 608 Philadelphia Avenue, as was Roberto Villagra. According to Ms. McGurk\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, on the date of her arrest she was an overnight guest of one Brady Cox, who leased the Philadelphia Avenue premises. She had brought with her an overnight bag and planned to stay for the night at 608 Philadelphia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At approximately 3:15 a.m. on the morning in question, Ocean City police officer Michael Valerio, while in uniform, was riding his patrol bicycle south-bound (i.e., towards the inlet) on Philadelphia Avenue when he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana. He turned his bicycle around and peddled approximately 60 feet north of 608 Philadelphia Avenue in an attempt to locate the source of the odor. He then looked back towards the south and saw two people sitting on a balcony. Officer Valerio approached the staircase that led to the second-floor balcony at 608 Philadelphia Avenue and \u201cradioed for additional officers to help [him] locate the source of the marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Before any of his fellow officers arrived, Officer Valerio, uninvited, walked up the stairway to the second-floor balcony. Once on the balcony, Officer Valerio identified himself as a police officer and asked the porch occupants \u201cwhat are you up to tonight\u201d or \u201cwhat are you doing tonight?\u201d Mr. Villagra replied that they were \u201cjust watching traffic.\u201d Officer Valerio then inquired \u201cwere you doing anything else?\u201d As he asked the last question the officer \u201cgot closer to\u201d Mr. Villagra and smelled \u201cthe odor of burnt marijuana, THC, which [he] knew through [his] training and knowledge and experience\u201d was coming from Villagra. This led Officer Valerio to believe \u201cthat there had been other things going on that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">Officer Valerio asked Villagra \u201cif he had any marijuana on him.\u201d Villagra said that he did not. Officer Valerio next asked \u201cis it a little bit, or did you just have a lot more on you?\u201d That awkwardly phrased inquiry was repeated by the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cone or more times\u201d whereupon Villagra said that he had smoked a \u201croach\u201d but had thrown the \u201croach\u201d off the balcony. By the time Officer Valerio obtained that admission, two \u201cback-up officers\u201d (PFC. Kelley and Officer Perry) had arrived to assist him.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Officer Valerio then went down the stairwell and found, in the front yard, a small marijuana \u201croach\u201d that was still warm. He collected that evidence, brought it back up to the balcony, held it in his hand and asked Villagra if the \u201croach\u201d that he had found was the marijuana cigarette that Villagra had thrown away. Villagra admitted that it was. Officer Valerio then placed Villagra under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Officer Charles Kelley arrived at 608 Philadelphia Avenue approximately 5 minutes after Officer Valerio\u2019s arrival. Officer Kelley climbed the steps to the second-floor balcony to assist Officer Valerio who by that time had already made a \u201ccustodial arrest\u201d of Villagra.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Officer Kelley initiated a conversation with Ms. McGurk. He asked her what her relationship was to Villagra, how she knew him, how long she was staying in Ocean City, and whether she was on vacation. While he made those inquiries, he stood only 2]\u00e9 feet away from Ms. McGurk. His proximity to her allowed Kelley to \u201cimmediately detect an overwhelming odor of burnt marijuana coming from her person.\u201d After smelling marijuana, he asked if he could see Ms. McGurk\u2019s identification. When she opened her purse to get her identification, Officer Kelley observed a \u201cprescription style\u201d orange bottle with a white lid. The bottle was transparent which allowed him to see, \u201cin plain view\u201d that inside the bottle was a \u201cglassine cellophane type baggie\u201d that contained a \u201cgreenish-brownish leafy vegetable like substance.\u201d He recognized through his \u201ctraining, knowledge and experience as a police officer\u201d that the leafy substance was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Officer Kelley ordered Ms. McGurk to give him the prescription bottle. She did not comply with that command but instead tried to conceal the bottle in her hand. She also attempted to remove other objects from her purse and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u201cshove them towards her front pocket.... \u201d He then advised Officer Valerio, who was standing nearby, that Ms. McGurk was under arrest. The arrest occurred at 3:27 a.m., approximately seven minutes after Officer Kelley arrived at 608 Philadelphia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">After Ms. McGurk was handcuffed and placed under arrest, she was removed to a \u201csafer area on the sidewalk\u201d and searched by Officer Valerio, who found $813.00 in the rear pocket of her pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Officer Valerio described how he searched the upper part of Ms. MeGurk\u2019s body, which was covered by both a tank top and a bathing suit top, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">I used my index finger and thumb of my right hand and grabbed the middle area between the swim suit and pulled that away from her body and still underneath the tank top to see if there was any illegal drugs or evidence that was concealed....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">When he pulled the swim suit away from appellant\u2019s body, six \u201ccream colored rocks\u201d of cocaine fell to the ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">Appellant contends that the second-floor balcony where she was seated when the Ocean City police officers arrived, was part of the curtilage of the dwelling house located at 608 Philadelphia Avenue, and was therefore a constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ally protected area that police officers were not entitled to enter without permission. An area is considered to be part of the curtilage of a dwelling house if it \u201cis so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s umbrella of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987). In response, the State makes three arguments: 1) McGurk never had standing to argue that she was in a constitutionally protected area; 2) even assuming that McGurk had standing, the second-floor balcony was not part of the curtilage of 608 Philadelphia Avenue, and 3) even if the second-floor balcony was a part of the curtilage, entry by the Ocean City police officers was still lawful based on \u201cextigent circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">A. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Immediately prior to the hearing on McGurk\u2019s motion to suppress, defense counsel filed a lengthy memorandum contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the entry by the police upon the second-floor balcony violated Ms. McGurk\u2019s Fourth Amendment Rights. During the suppression hearing, Ms. McGurk testified that on the evening in question she was an overnight guest of the lessor of 608 Philadelphia Avenue, and that when she arrived she carried her belongings in an overnight bag. The prosecutor did not cross-examine appellant in regards to this testimony, nor did the prosecutor introduce evidence to contradict that testimony. Moreover, at no time during the hearing did the prosecutor indicate that she contested Ms. McGurk\u2019s standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">After hearing the testimony of appellant, along with that of several Ocean City police officers, defense counsel presented oral argument in support of the suppression motion but the prosecutor made no oral reply. Instead, the prosecutor accepted the motions judge\u2019s offer to allow her to reply in a written memorandum. The State subsequently filed a lengthy reply memorandum. Significantly, however, the State never contended in its memorandum that McGurk lacked standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>On appeal the State contends that McGurk lacks standing to raise the contention that the police officer\u2019s entry onto the balcony was illegal. Nevertheless, it admits that in <em>Minnesota v. Olson, 495 </em>U.S. 91, 98-99, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990), the Supreme Court held \u201cthat an overnight guest in a house had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the host\u2019s home\u201d and therefore\u2014such a guest has a right to contest the entry of police into that home. The State also admits that Ms. McGurk testified that on the evening she was arrested she was an overnight guest of the lessor of the premises known as 608 Philadelphia Avenue. The State nevertheless argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">Because the suppressing court denied McGurk\u2019s motion to suppress without making factual findings on the record, her self-serving testimony as to her relationship to the property deserves no credit. Thus the record is devoid of any credible evidence that McGurk had a reasonable expectation of privacy in any area of 608 Philadelphia Avenue, and thus, she was in no position to raise a Fourth Amendment challenge to the alleged unlawful entry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">We hold that by failing to raise the standing issue in the circuit court, the State waived that issue for appellate purposes. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a) (except for jurisdictional issues, an appellate court will ordinarily not decide any other issue neither raised nor decided in the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In <em>McCain v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 252, 4 A.3d 53 (2010), the State contended on appeal that the appellant, Sheldon McCain, did not have standing to contest a search, by police officers, of his Wife\u2019s purse, because appellant had no \u201cexpectation of privacy in the purse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278, 4 A.3d 53. But at the suppression hearing, the State did not contend that appellant lacked standing. <em>Id. </em>What we said in <em>McCain </em>is here apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Because the search at issue was without a warrant, the State had the burden of production and persuasion at the , suppression hearing. <em>See, e.g., Epps v. State, </em>193 Md.App. 687 [1 A.3d 488] (2010). As appellant correctly notes in his reply brief, the State did not contend at the suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>hearing that appellant lacked a legitimate expectation of privacy in Ms. McCain\u2019s purse. As the issue was neither raised before, nor decided by, the circuit court, we can consider the State\u2019s contention only through the exercise of the discretion conferred upon us by Maryland Rule 8-131(a). <em>Epps, </em>[193 Md.App. at 708-10, 1 A.3d 488] (citing, among other cases, <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 713-14 [843 A.2d 778] (2004), and <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 187-88 [638 A.2d 107] (1994)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">We decline to do so in this case. Whether a party has a legitimate expectation of privacy in another\u2019s property depends in part upon a consideration of the facts supporting the assertion of the expectation. <em>See Laney v. State, </em>379 Md. 522, 545-46 [842 A.2d 773] (2004). Because the State did not raise the issue at the suppression hearing, there was no reason for appellant to present such evidence and he did not. Under these circumstances, consideration of the standing issue for the first time on appeal would be unfair to appellant. <em>Jones, </em>379 Md. at 714 [843 A.2d 778] (the discretion to review an unpreserved issue \u201cshould not be exercised when it will work an unfair prejudice to the parties.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 278-79, 4 A.3d 53. <em>See also, State v. Mason, </em>173 Md.App. 414, 428-29, 919 A.2d 752 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">As pointed out in <em>McCain, </em>under Md. Rule 84.31(a), we have discretion to decide non-jurisdictional issues not raised or decided below, but we should not exercise that discretion and consider such issues if to do so would prejudice one or more of the parties. Here Ms. McGurk would clearly be prejudiced if we were to entertain the standing issue. First, in the circuit court Ms. McGurk\u2019s counsel never had a chance to convince the judge that the State\u2019s argument that his client was lying should be rejected. Second, it would be unfair to <em>infer </em>from a silent record that the trial judge disbelieved Ms. McGurk\u2019s uncontested and uncontroverted testimony as to standing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">B. Is the Second Story Balcony a Constitutionally Protected Area?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967) (citations omitted). A two-part test is to be used to determine whether the government has invaded an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy: \u201c[fjirst, an individual must demonstrate that he had an actual subjective expectation of privacy. Second, society must be willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u201d <em>Kitzmiller v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 686, 690, 548 A.2d 140 (1988) (citation omitted). As explained by a concurring opinion in <em>Katz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">As the Court\u2019s opinion states, \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.\u201d The question, however, is what protection it affords to those people. Generally, as here, the answer to that question requires reference to a \u201cplace.\u201d My understanding of the rule that has emerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement, first that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as \u201creasonable.\u201d Thus a man\u2019s home is, for most purposes, a place where he expects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he exposes to the \u201cplain view\u201d of outsiders are not \u201cprotected\u201d because no intention to keep them to himself has been exhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the open would not be protected against being overheard, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>expectation of privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Katz, </em>389 U.S. at 361, 88 S.Ct. 507 (Harlan, J., concurring); <em>accord State v. Sampson, </em>362 Md. 438, 444, 765 A.2d 629, <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1056, 121 S.Ct. 2202, 149 L.Ed.2d 1032 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In considering the first part of this test, this Court has stated that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment applies only to \u2018constitutionally protected areas\u2019 such as a person\u2019s house or curtilage.\u201d <em>Sproates v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 547, 557, 473 A.2d 1289 (1984). Thus, the first question we must determine is whether the second story balcony in question was part of the curtilage of 608 Philadelphia Avenue. The curtilage is the area immediately surrounding the home \u201cto which extends the intimate activity associated with the \u2018sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life,\u2019 and therefore has been considered part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.\u201d . <em>Oliver v. United States, </em>466 U.S. 170, 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735, 80 L.Ed.2d 214 (1984) (citations omitted); <em>see also Cal. v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 212-13, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986) (\u201cThe protection afforded the curtilage is essentially a protection of families and personal privacy in an area intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically, where privacy expectations are most heightened\u201d); <em>Walls v. State, </em>179 Md. App. 234, 249, 944 A.2d 1222 (2008) (\u201cThe Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of a person\u2019s home from unreasonable searches and seizures extends to the home\u2019s curtilage, that is, to the land immediately surrounding and associated with the residence.\u201d). As Professor LaFave has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">The home \u201cis accorded the full range of Fourth Amendment protections,\u201d for it is quite clearly a place as to which there exists a justified expectation of privacy against unreasonable intrusion. It is beyond question, therefore, that an uncontested entry into a residential unit, be it a house or an apartment or a hotel or motel room, constitutes a search within the meaning of <em>Katz v. United States. </em>Moreover, this Fourth Amendment protection (and thus this search characterization of an entry) extends even to \u201coccupants of flimsily constructed dwellings with unobstructed windows or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>other openings directly on public lands, streets, or sidewalks, who failed to lock their doors to bar entrance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\">1 LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, </em>\u00a7 2.3(b) at 565 (4th ed.2004) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe extent of the curti-lage is determined by factors that bear upon whether an individual reasonably may expect that the area in question should be treated as the home itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. 294, 300, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987); <em>accord Oliver, </em>466 U.S. at 180, 104 S.Ct. 1735. In <em>Dunn, </em>the court held that the central component of this inquiry, \u201cwhether the area harbors the intimate activity associated with the sanctity of a man\u2019s home and the privacies of life,\u201d is resolved with reference to four factors, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-6\"><em>United States v. Dunn, </em>480 U.S. at 301, 107 S.Ct. 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Applying these factors, the second story balcony at issue is a part of the home itself. It is located ten feet above street level, and includes a waist high wooden railing on the west and north sides of the building, which means that passersby on the sidewalk or on Philadelphia Avenue would not have a clear view of what is taking place on the balcony. Located on the balcony are some flowers and plants as well as a glass table. There was at least one chair along with \u201ca two-person style rocking chair\u201d on the balcony, which suggests that the balcony is used for purposes akin to uses served by a room inside a house. All of these factors suggest that the balcony was within the curtilage of the home located at 608 Philadelphia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">In regard to the last factor, the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation, we note that on the one hand, the wooden railing prevents persons on the highway or sidewalk from seeing most, but not all, of what is taking place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>on the balcony. On the other hand, the external staircase leading up to the balcony is very close to the sidewalk and there is no evidence that there is a gate or other device preventing access from the stairway to the balcony. This last factor, while significant, does not outweigh the other factors supporting appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy. Certainly an occupant of the balcony at issue would not expect an uninvited stranger to climb the steps and enter onto the balcony in the middle of the night. The balcony was in no sense a \u201cpublic place.\u201d Thus, we hold that the balcony leading to the second story at 608 Philadelphia Avenue, was part of the curtilage of the home, and that appellant, while on that balcony, had a subjective expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The next part of the <em>Katz </em>test is whether that subjective expectation was objectively reasonable. Here, the parties have not cited, nor have we been able to find, a case dealing with a warrantless entry by police onto a balcony of a residence accessible by an external staircase that begins at a sidewalk bordering on a public street. Instead, the State analogizes this case to those where the police entry was at the front door or front porch of a residence. With respect to the front door to a residence, this Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">People commonly have different expectations, whether considered or not, for the access areas of their premises than they do for more secluded areas. Thus, we do not place things of a private nature on our front porches that we may very well entrust to the seclusion of a backyard, patio or deck. In the course of urban life, we have come to expect various members of the public to enter upon such a driveway, e.g., brush salesmen, newspaper boys, postmen, Girl Scout cookie sellers, distressed motorists, neighbors, friends.

Suspecting that appellant was engaged in drug distribution, a police officer went to the front of 19 North Glover, and seized the bag that was in between the screen door and the front door of the residence. <em>Id. </em>The bag contained 119 gel caps of heroin. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">While not expressly saying whether the screen door was within the curtilage of the home, we agreed with the suppression court\u2019s ruling that the screen door in question was of the variety that would be accessible to strangers approaching the residence. <em>Id. </em>at 220, 914 A.2d 151.

Commonwealth, </em>police responded to a home after receiving reports that an underage drinking party was underway. 625 S.E.2d at 654. A police officer drove upon Robinson\u2019s property and parked his vehicle in the parking area near the garage. From that vantage point the officer observed persons who appeared to be underage holding beer bottles and then fleeing once police presence was observed. The Court held that \u201con the night in question, Robinson impliedly consented to have members of the public\u2014including police officers\u2014enter the premises in an attempt to contact the residents of that property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. The Court stated, that \u201c[i]t is generally recognized that, absent any affirmative attempts to discourage trespassers, owners or possessors of private property impliedly consent to have members of the general public intrude upon certain, limited areas of their property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Robinson </em>Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\"><em>This invitation, where it exists, extends only to those areas of the property that would be used when approaching the residence in an ordinary attempt to speak with the occupants. Thus, areas of the curtilage that a visitor could reasonably be expected to cross when approaching the front door\u2014for example, the driveway, front sidewalk, and front porch\u2014are generally exempted from Fourth Amendment protection. </em>As a result, if the property owner has impliedly consented to have members of the public use a particular \u201cpath\u201d when attempting to access his home, he has waived any reasonable expectation of privacy in areas of the curti-lage associated with that \u201cpath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">By extension, the same implied consent is extended to police officers who enter the curtilage and, while on the premises, restrict their conduct to those activities reasonably contemplated by the homeowner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The <em>Robinson </em>court listed a number of factors to determine whether the landowner intended to exclude the public from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the premises, including: \u201c(1) whether the homeowner has erected any physical barriers, such as gates or fences, across the entrance to the property, and (2) whether the homeowner has posted signs, such as \u2018no trespassing\u2019 or \u2018private property\u2019 signs, indicating a desire to exclude the public from the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658. The <em>Robinson </em>Court concluded that the officer had implied consent from the landowners to enter the premises and park. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">In <em>Robinson, </em>the Court then went on to consider whether the officer exceeded the scope of that consent when he discovered underage drinking on the premises. Resolution of this question was said to depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>Id. </em>at 659. Relevant factors under that test included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">[WJhether the officer (1) spied into the house; (2) acted secretly; (3) approached the house in daylight; (4) used the normal, most direct route to the house; (5) attempted to talk with the resident; (6) created an artificial vantage point; and (7) made the discovery accidentally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 659 n. 7 (quoting <em>State v. Ross, </em>91 Wash.App. 814, 959 P.2d 1188, 1190 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The <em>Robinson </em>Court noted that uninvited visitors to a home are normally \u201cexpected to come to the residence\u2019s most direct, obvious, and prominent entryway,\u201d and are generally \u201cexpected to leave by the same route,\u201d unless the circumstances \u201cindicate that the visitor \u2018could reasonably be expected to seek out residents through areas other than the front door.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. (citations' omitted). Further, the Court observed that entering the residence late at night, especially if accompanied by some subterfuge, may be outside the scope of implied consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">Furtive intrusion late at night or in the predawn hours is not conduct that is expected from ordinary visitors. Indeed, if observed by a resident of the premises, it could be a cause for great alarm. As compared to open daytime approaches, surreptitious searches under the cover of darkness create a greater risk of armed response\u2014with potentially tragic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>results\u2014from fearful residents who may mistake the police officers for criminal intruders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The <em>Robinson </em>Court ultimately concluded that the police officers did not exceed the scope of the implied consent extended to visitors on the night of the party. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that, on the night in question, the implied invitation to enter Robinson\u2019s premises was still open even at this late hour, and Officer Cox did not exceed the scope of this implied consent when he drove up Robinson\u2019s driveway and parked his car in the parking area by the garage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In this case, by contrast, there was no implied invitation because there is no indication that entry into 608 Philadelphia Avenue is normally accomplished by walking up the steps to the second story balcony as opposed to entering the house by ground level front door.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">The case that we have found that is factually most analogous is <em>State v. Neanover, </em>812 N.E.2d 127 (Ind.Ct.App.2004). In <em>Neanover, </em>the evidence established that Alicia Neanover lived with her husband in one of two apartments located at the top of a three-story apartment building. <em>Neanover, </em>812 N.E.2d at 128. Outside the door to their apartment was an open landing area where Neanover kept a patio table and chairs; she used the landing area for recreation and storage. <em>Id. </em>Sometimes, as on the night in question, the Neanovers would temporarily place garbage on the landing prior to taking that garbage downstairs to an area enclosed by a fence across from the building\u2019s parking lot. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">The police received a citizen complaint that marijuana was growing inside Neanover\u2019s apartment. <em>Id. </em>Responding to the apartment and receiving no answer after knocking on the Neanover\u2019s door, the police seized bags of garbage that had been left outside the apartment door on the open landing area. <em>Id. </em>Police found evidence of marijuana use in that garbage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>subsequently charged Neanover with possession of marijuana. <em>Id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On appeal, the Indiana intermediate appellate court ruled that the Neanovers had both a subjective expectation of privacy with respect to the landing area, and that this expectation was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 130. Looking to the evidence, the Court determined that \u201cNeanover had a subjective expectation of privacy insofar as she treated the landing area outside her apartment door as a combination patio/storage space, a zone of privacy akin to curtilage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, this expectation of privacy was objectively reasonable because, \u201c[although the third-floor landing was open and accessible to the general public, the landing was not <em>readily </em>accessible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Based on our research and the record developed at the suppression hearing, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in the second story balcony area was objectively reasonable. Besides what has already been said, we find support for this conclusion by the fact that the officers walked up the external staircase at 3:15 a.m. It is not unreasonable to assume that, at this hour, a person in appellant\u2019s position would not expect uninvited visitors to ascend the staircase to gain access to the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Exigent Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The State argues, in the alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that McGurk had some minimal expectation of privacy in the balcony of the 608 Philadelphia Road, the police encounter was still lawful based on exigent circumstances. Officer Valerio was on routine patrol on Philadelphia Avenue when he detected the odor of burning marijuana. The officer had no reason to suspect that there was marijuana being smoked at 608 Philadelphia Avenue until he could smell it. Furthermore, the record supports the inference that Valagra became aware of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>presence because Valagra testified that he and McGurk were watching traffic from the balcony and something Vala-gra observed caused him to discard the roach he and McGurk were smoking. The circumstances establish that Valerio did not create the exigency, and it was reasonable for him to believe both that Valagra and McGurk were aware of his presence and that the marijuana would be destroyed before a warrant could be obtained. Thus, Valer-io\u2019s entrance onto the balcony of 608 Philadelphia Road was justified by exigent circumstances. <em>Gorman v.

It is undisputed that the police officer never discovered that a roach had been thrown away or that either of the balcony occupants had smoked marijuana until after he entered onto the balcony.

In <em>Gorman, </em>Sergeant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Steven Nalewajkl was called to investigate a shooting and found that Gorman had sustained a gunshot wound. 168 Md.App. at 416, <em>897 </em>A.2d 242. Gorman\u2019s girlfriend, Leslie Harmon, was with Gorman at the scene of the shooting. Because Harmon was pregnant and not wearing shoes, Sergeant Nalewajkl escorted Harmon to her apartment, which was about five blocks from the scene of the shooting. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">When they arrived, the officer accompanied Harmon to the front door of the second floor apartment. He was concerned that Harmon might be difficult to find later during the investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 417, 897 A.2d 242. Harmon knocked, and Curtis Painter opened the door to the apartment. <em>Id. </em>When the apartment door was opened, Sergeant Nalewajkl \u201csmelled the odor of burnt marijuana emanating from the apartment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Seeing that Painter was \u201cextremely nervous,\u201d Sergeant Nalewajkl asked him what he was so nervous about, and Painter replied that \u201che had two bags of weed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 897 A.2d 242. Painter was then placed under arrest. <em>Id. </em>Police later searched the entire apartment and, found cocaine, and various firearms. Gorman was later indicted for narcotics and firearms-related offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 419, 897 A.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Gorman contended that the entry into his apartment was not justified under exigent circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 420, 897 A.2d 242. This Court disagreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Sgt. Nalewajkl accompanied Harmon to the apartment only to ensure that she, a potential witness to an apparently unrelated shooting, would not wander off. The trip to the apartment was prompted by Harmon\u2019s need to pick up her shoes. Nalewejkl\u2019s apprehension of an exigency arose only after he perceived, from the threshold of the apartment through the open door, Painter\u2019s nervousness and the odor of marijuana. Nalewajkl was also suspicious of Painter\u2019s delay in opening the door.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-8\"><em>Gorman, </em>168 Md.App. at 424-25, 897 A.2d 242 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">In reaching this conclusion, the <em>Gorman </em>Court distinguished <em>Dunnuck v. State, </em>367 Md. 198, 786 A.2d 695 (2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>In <em>Dunnuck, </em>the police were conducting an ongoing investigation of Dunnuck based on an anonymous tip that marijuana plants could be seen through the window of Dunnuck\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 209, 786 A.2d 695. An officer went to Dunnuck\u2019s house where he observed marijuana growing in a birdcage that could be seen through the window. <em>Id. </em>Rather than applying for a search warrant, the officer called for backup units to keep surveillance on the house to see if anyone returned, with the plan to secure a warrant after someone else arrived at the home. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 786 A.2d 695. At least an hour after the officer\u2019s first arrival at the house, Dunnuck arrived home. <em>Id. </em>The officers knocked on the door and announced: \u201cQueen Anne\u2019s County Drag Task Force. We need to come in.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210-11, 786 A.2d 695. Shortly thereafter, another officer observed through a window that the marijuana plant was being moved, at which time the officers began kicking in the front door. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Court of Appeals found that the warrantless intrusion was unreasonable given that the police officers had created the exigency. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">Whether intended consciously or not, the necessary result of the police conduct in this case was to create an exigency that would justify a warrantless entry. Having seen the contraband as they were told they would and knocked on the petitioner\u2019s door and found no one at home, rather than going immediately to obtain a warrant, for the issuance of which it is undisputed they had probable cause, the police gathered a short distance from the house and watched the house, after calling for back-up. Considering that no one was at home and, presumably, was aware of the police investigation, and that there was clear probable cause for believing that a crime was being committed, it is difficult to understand what securing the house meant, or was intended to accomplish.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 215-16, 786 A.2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In <em>Goman, </em>we distinguished <em>Dunnuck </em>because in <em>Gorman </em>the officer did not have \u201cprobable cause to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>crime of marijuana possession was occurring within the residences until <em>after- </em>their arrival.\u201d <em>Gorman, </em>168 Md.App. at 429, 897 A.2d 242 (emphasis in original). The officers did not create the exigency. Furthermore, the residents in <em>Gorman </em>\u201chad knowledge of the police presence and, presumably, detection of the odor of marijuana.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, police did not have time to obtain a search warrant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In the case <em>sub judiee, </em>Officer Valerio admitted that he did not know that the marijuana odor was coming from the balcony until <em>after </em>he walked up the steps of 608 Philadelphia Avenue. He therefore did not have probable cause to believe that the occupants of the balcony had committed a crime at the time he entered onto the balcony. Unlike <em>Gorman, </em>where the officer had a legitimate reason for being on the premises <em>before </em>he smelled marijuana, the officer in this case did not have, or even claim to have, knowledge that the occupants of the balcony were connected to the odor of marijuana until the officer had unlawfully entered onto the balcony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">While the odor of marijuana provides probable cause to believe that marijuana is present, the presence of marijuana does not of itself authorize the police either to search any place or to arrest any person in the vicinity. <em>Additional factors must be present to localize the presence of marijuana such that its placement will justify either the search or the arrest. </em>In the case of a search, when the odor emanates from a confined location such as an automobile or an apartment, we have held that officers may draw the conclusion that marijuana is present in the automobile or the apartment.... Thus, if an officer smells the odor of marijuana in circumstances <em>where the officer can localize its source </em>to a person, the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed or is committing the crime of possession of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-6\"><em>United States v. Humphries, </em>372 F.3d 653, 659 (4th Cir.2004) (citations omitted, and emphasis added) (ultimately concluding there was probable cause to arrest appellant because the odor of marijuana was particularized to appellant\u2019s person).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Here, according to the facts established at the suppression hearing, after the officer smelled the odor of marijuana in the air, he turned around and peddled approximately 60 feet north in an attempt to locate the source of that odor. He turned back to the south and then saw two people sitting on the balcony of 608 Philadelphia Avenue. At that point, he approached the staircase and radioed for assistance. He asked for assistance of other officers to help him\u201d \u201clocate the source of the marijuana.\u201d Officer Valerio explicitly admitted that he did not smell the odor of burnt marijuana <em>on the balcony </em>until after he asked several questions and \u201cgot closer to\u201d Mr. Villagra.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">There is no fact present indicating that either Villagra or appellant were engaged in any conduct that suggested that they intended to destroy evidence prior to the officers entry onto the balcony. In fact, there is not even evidence that either appellant or her companion knew that the police intended to come onto the balcony until Officer Valerio did so. Accordingly, there was no exigency permitting the police officer to violate appellant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy by entering onto the second story balcony of 608 Philadelphia Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">We hold that the motion to suppress should have been granted as to all evidence seized from appellant\u2019s purse or person because: 1) the officer\u2019s warrantless entry was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment, and 2) all evidence seized from appellant\u2019s purse or person were taken as a result of the warrantless entry onto the balcony.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> COSTS TO BE PAID BY WORCHESTER COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\">.

In part I of the opinion, we recount the facts developed at the suppression hearing, in the light most favorable to the State-the party that prevailed below. <em>See Morris v. State, </em>153 Md.App. 480, 489, 837 A.2d 248 (2003) (when reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept that version of the evidence most favorable to the State and in doing so resolve all ambiguities and inferences in favor of the State and against the losing party).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b53-10\">. Officer Amy Hoelscher arrived at 608 Philadelphia Avenue at about 3:30 a.m. on June 29, 2009. She was needed so that a female police officer could search the more intimate parts of appellant\u2019s body. Officer Hoelscher testified that she retrieved an \"orange prescription pill bottle out of the left side of MeGurk\u2019s pants.\u201d She also retrieved an \"altered smoking pipe\u201d used for \u201csmoking crack-cocaine\u201d when she folded down the back-side of MeGurk\u2019s blue jeans. As she folded down the blue jeans, Officer Valerio illuminated the area with his flashlight. McGurk was not wearing anything under the jeans except a \"bathing suit bottom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Appellant, for various reasons, contends that Officer Hoelscher\u2019s search was an illegal strip search. We need not decide that issue because we agree with appellant that the search was the \"fruit\u201d of the illegal entry by the police officer onto the balcony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\">. We note that there was nothing unlikely about Ms. McGurk\u2019s testimony that she was an overnight guest. In all likelihood she probably was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>staying overnight somewhere, and, at a minimum, it was likely that she was staying overnight at 608 Philadelphia Avenue because, by 3:15 a.m. more than one-half of the night had elapsed, and she was still on the premises when Officer Valerio first saw her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">. The Court also concluded that the police could arrest Santana under the exigent circumstances concept of \"hot pursuit,\u201d stating, \"[o]nce Santana saw the police, there was likewise a realistic expectation that any delay would result in destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42-43, 96 S.Ct. 2406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">. The evidence contained in the agreed statement of facts was sufficient to convict. Therefore, a remand for new trial is necessary.
