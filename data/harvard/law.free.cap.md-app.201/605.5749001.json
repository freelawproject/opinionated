For a referendum question to secure a place on the ballot, petitions containing the signatures of at least 5,000 of the County\u2019s registered voters must be filed within sixty days of the passage of the ordinance in question. The filing deadline may be extended for an additional thirty days if the sponsor of the referendum effort submits petitions containing at least 50% of the required signatures within the initial deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">Howard County Citizens for Open Government (\u201cHCCOG\u201d) sought to take a newly-enacted ordinance of the Howard County Council to referendum. The Howard County Board of Elections (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decided that HCCOG failed to submit petitions containing a sufficient number of valid signatures to extend the filing deadline. HCCOG, and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. The Circuit Court for Howard County affirmed the Board. HCCOG has appealed the court\u2019s judgment and presents the following questions, which we have reworded slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>I. Whether the decision of the Board to invalidate previously approved registered voters on a referendum petition impermissibly burdened the citizens of Howard County in the exercise of rights secured by the Howard County Charter, State law and the Maryland Constitution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">II. Whether the Board\u2019s retroactive application of the <em>Doe v. Montgomery County, </em>406 Md. 697 [962 A.2d 342] (2008), voter verification standards was unreasonable; or, in the alternative, whether the <em>Doe </em>standards themselves, as applied by the Board, and in light of <em>Montgomery County Volunteer Fire-Rescue Assoc. v. Montgomery County Board of Elections, </em>418 Md. 463 [15 A.3d 798] (2011), impermissibly burdened the citizens of Howard County in the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Maryland Constitution and the Howard County Charter?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">III. Whether the decision of the Board to invalidate previously qualified registered voters on a referendum petition was unreasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We affirm the judgment of the circuit court and, accordingly, the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">On November 3, 2008, the Howard County Council passed Council Bill 58-2008, amending the Howard County Zoning Regulations to increase the maximum permitted size of a grocery store to be built in the Turf Valley community. HCCOG sponsored a petition drive to submit the bill to referendum, pursuant to Howard County, Md. Charter \u00a7 211 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>(2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of the current number of registered voters in the County, \u00a7 211 requires a sponsor to submit petitions containing the valid signatures of at least 5,000 voters registered in Howard County within sixty days of the enactment date of the ordinance in question. Section 211 also provides that, if the sponsor obtains at least 2,500 valid signatures before the end of the sixty days, the sponsor will have an additional thirty days to obtain the remaining required signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On November 17, 2008, and November 19, 2008, HCCOG filed a request with the Board seeking a determination that the form and content of its proposed referendum petition and signature sheet complied with State law. The Board responded in the affirmative on December 1, 2008. HCCOG then began the process of circulating copies of the petitions and obtaining signatures. While there were several exchanges of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>correspondence between the Board\u2019s staff and HCCOG about matters related to the referendum drive, the topic of the legal requirements for valid signatures does not appear to have been addressed before HCCOG submitted petitions bearing 3,301 signatures to the Board on December 30, 2008, five days before the end of the initial sixty-day petition submission period.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">On the following day, Betty L. Nordaas, the Howard County Election Director<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> notified HCCOG that, because \u201cmore than one-half but less than the full number of signatures required\u201d by the Charter had been filed within sixty days, HCCOG had an additional thirty days, or until February 4, 2009, to file the remaining signatures. How the Board staff came to this conclusion is unclear, but the Board now asserts that its staff failed to consider the provisions of EL \u00a7 6-203(a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (which sets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>out the information that must accompany a petition signature) in this process. On January 22, 2009, Ms. Nordaas wrote to HCCOG informing it that the Board staff had completed the verification process<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the signatures contained in the initial submission and that 2,603 signatures were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On January 26, 2009, Gerald M. Richman, Esquire, the Board\u2019s counsel in this appeal, was appointed as special counsel to the Board regarding the referendum effort. Mr. Rich-man alerted the Board\u2019s staff to <em>Doe v. Montgomery County, </em>406 Md. 697, 962 A.2d 342 (2008), which had been filed on December 19, 2008. As we will discuss later in our analysis, the Court in <em>Doe </em>held that the provisions of EL \u00a7 6-203(a) were mandatory. The Board\u2019s staff then re-examined the signatures submitted by HCCOG to determine how many of them satisfied \u00a7 6-203(a)\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">While all of this was going on, HCCOG continued its efforts to obtain signatures to the petition. It submitted an additional 6,079 signatures on February 3, 2009. On March 11, 2009, the Board received advice from the Attorney General\u2019s office regarding the appropriate protocol for the verification and validation of petition signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Board held a meeting with representatives of HCCOG on March 12, 2009. In the meeting, Ann M. Balcerzak, the president of the Board, stated that the Board was reversing its previous decision that HCCOG had submitted at least one-half of the required signatures before the expiration of the initial, sixty-day deadline. She delivered to the representatives a letter of the same date from Ms. Nordaas, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>constitutes the decision of the Board for this proceeding. It reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">On December 30, 2008, the HCCOG submitted Local Referendum Petitions, modified in accordance with Howard County Law containing 3,301 signatures. On January 22, a determination was issued to HCCOG ... advising that 2,603 valid signatures were ... submitted and that it thereby became entitled to an additional period of 30 days or until February 4, 2009 to obtain the remainder of valid signatures necessary....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">As I am certain you are now aware, the Court of Appeals of Maryland, on December 19, 2008 issued a published opinion titled: <em>Doe v. Montgomery County Board of Elections, </em>406 Md. 697, 962 A.2d 342 (2008). Counsel to the Howard County Board of Elections studied this opinion and advised the Board of Elections that a reassessment of the initial submission was necessary and appropriate based upon the clear principles and guidelines as outlined by Judge Battaglia in the <em>Doe </em>Opinion. The <em>Doe </em>court spent considerable time in setting forth the rationale related to the process of signing a referendum petition and in thereafter validating signatures on each petition. Succinctly put, the Board of Elections found, after review of each signature on submitted local referendum petitions, that it did not validate each signature in accordance with the mandate set forth in <em>Doe </em>which requires an individual <em>to sign his/her name as it appears on the statewide voter registration or place his/her surname of registration and at least one fall given name and the initials of any other names. </em>The Opinion goes on to state that the requirements of subsection (a) <em>must </em>be satisfied in order to validate the signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">The Board of Elections has requested revised guidelines from the State Board of Elections, reference COMAR Title 33.06.05.02(A), in order to complete an additional detailed review of each signature on the Local Referendum Petitions. The State Board of Elections has contacted the Attorney General\u2019s office in order to ensure the guidelines will be in agreement with the December 19, 2008 [Doe] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>opinion and is in the process of preparing the revised guidelines for Local Boards to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">Based upon March 11, 2009 advice from the Attorney General\u2019s office, the Board of Elections re-verified and validated the signatures on the petitions submitted on December 80, 2008. The Board found that the total number of valid signatures fell below the 2,500 signatures [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] necessary to permit an additional thirty day period in which HCCOG may obtain the remainder of signatures necessary to complete the petition requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">On March 16, 2009, Mr. Richman wrote to HCCOG\u2019s representatives confirming that the March 12 letter was \u201cthe final determination of the Board of Elections that the validated signatures contained in the Petition ... are insufficient to satisfy all requirements established by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">HCCOG filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties submitted memoranda to the circuit court and the court held a hearing on the matter on November 13, 2009. The parties presented substantially the same arguments to the circuit court as they present to us, which we discuss later in our analysis. The circuit court entered an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>order affirming the Board\u2019s decision on April 27, 2010. In affirming the Board, the circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">The State may constitutionally limit, in a non-discriminatory and content neutral manner, the ability to initiate legislation---- Section 6-203 of the Election Law Article imposes nondiscriminatory content neutral restrictions. Therefore [HCCOG] has failed to demonstrate a violation of the right to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-7\">Because [the Board] properly applied the <em>Doe </em>standard in evaluating the signatures on the subject petition, a fact supported by substantial evidence, and because the total number of signatures fell below the 2,500 signatures required by Section 211 of the Howard County Charter, the decision of [the Board] that such threshold had not been met, and that any extension of time for the submission of additional signatures would not be allowed, is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"av6-dedup-0\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In reviewing a circuit court\u2019s decision in a judicial review proceeding, an appellate court \u201clook[s] \u2018through the circuit court\u2019s ... decision! ], although applying the same standards of review, and evaluates the decision of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Loyola College in Maryland, </em>406 Md. 54, 66, 956 A.2d 166 (2008) (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Surina,, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899 (2007)). HCCOG\u2019s contentions are limited to whether the Board committed an error of law in applying EL \u00a7 6-203 to the petition effort. Therefore, the deference that reviewing courts pay to factual findings made by administrative agencies, <em>see, e.g., Surina, </em>400 Md. at 681, 929 A.2d 899, is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Courts typically do not defer to legal conclusions reached by agencies. <em>Loyola, </em>406 Md. at 67, 956 A.2d 166; <em>Surina, </em>400 Md. at 682, 929 A.2d 899. We do afford a limited degree of deference, however, to an agency\u2019s interpretations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>laws or regulations that the agency itself has either promulgated or administers. <em>Loyola, </em>406 Md. at 67, 956 A.2d 166 (citing <em>Marzullo v. Kohl, </em>366 Md. 158, 172, 783 A.2d 169 (2001)). However, the appropriate deference is finite. <em>See Volunteer Fire, </em>418 Md. at 469, 15 A.3d 798 (Court will not defer to agency\u2019s interpretation of an unambiguous statute.); <em>Christopher v. Dept. of Health, </em>381 Md. 188, 198, 849 A.2d 46 (2004) (While a court ordinarily gives weight to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it administers, \u2018\u2018[djetermining whether an agency\u2019s \u2018conclusions of law' are correct is always, on judicial review, the court\u2019s prerogative.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">II. Maryland Law</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In order to place HCCOG\u2019s contentions in their proper context, we will briefly review the provisions of the Maryland Constitution that establish the right of referendum in this State, and the pertinent provisions of Title 6 of the Election Law Article, which sets out requirements for referendum petitions and petition signatures, and also prescribes the review process of both by the appropriate election board.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\n<em>A. Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJk\">Ratified by the voters in 1915,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Article XVI reserves to the people of Maryland the power to petition to referendum most laws passed by the General Assembly. <em>See </em>Article XVI \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Article XVI \u00a7 3 grants the right to refer local public laws to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>referendum to voters in counties that do not exercise home rule powers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By its terms, Article XVI does not apply to other units of local government. However, Article XI-F \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> reserves the referendum to voters in code counties. The right of referendum is also conferred by implication to voters in charter counties by Article XI-A \u00a7 1. <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board, </em>283 Md. 48, 61, 388 A.2d 523 (1978) (The reservation of the right of referendum \u201cdirectly affects the distribution of political power between the people of Anne Arundel County and their elected representative body ... and is thus a fundamental feature of the overall structure of county government.\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Article XVI \u00a7 4 authorizes the General Assembly to enact legislation, not inconsistent with Article XVI, to \u201cfacilitate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>petition process,\u201d including procedures for verifying the authenticity of petitions and signatures.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The General Assembly first enacted such a statute in 1941. <em>See </em>1941 Md. Laws 539. The statute, codified as Md. Code Ann. Art. 33 \u00a7 169 (1957, 1964 Supp.), required a petition to show a signer\u2019s residence, the precinct or district in which the signer is registered as a voter and, in addition to the signer\u2019s signature, his or her printed or typed name. <em>See Barnes v. State ex rel. Pinkney, </em>236 Md. 564, 569, 204 A.2d 787 (1964). Article 33 \u00a7 169 is the direct ancestor of EL 6-203. <em>See Doe, </em>406 Md. at 729, 962 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">\n<em>B. Current Statutory Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Subtitle 6 of the Election Law Article governs the referendum process, including requirements for petition signatures, \u00a7 6-203(a); signature validation, \u00a7 6\u2014203(b); and signature verification, \u00a7 6-207. \u201cPlainly, the overarching goal of the entire Petition Subtitle is to ensure that only eligible voters sign petitions.... \u201d <em>Volunteer Fire, </em>418 Md. at 473, 15 A.3d 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Section 6-203 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u00a7 6-203. Signers; information provided by signers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-4\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014To sign a petition, an individual shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">(1) sign the individual\u2019s name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or the individual\u2019s surname of registration and at least one full given name and the initials of any other names; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">(2) include the following information, printed or typed, in the spaces provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">(i) the signer\u2019s name as it was signed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">(ii) the signer\u2019s address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">(iii) the date of signing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-10\">(iv) other information required by regulations adopted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-11\">by the State Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-12\">(b) <em>Validation and, </em>counting.\u2014The signature of an individual shall be validated and counted if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-13\">(1) the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have been satisfied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-14\">(2) the individual is a registered voter assigned to the county specified on the signature page and, if applicable, in a particular geographic area of the county;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-15\">(3) the individual has not previously signed the same petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-16\">(4) the signature is attested by an affidavit appearing on the page on which the signature appears;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-17\">(5) the date accompanying the signature is not later than the date of the affidavit on the page; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-18\">(6) if applicable, the signature was affixed within the requisite period of time, as specified by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">In <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 732-33, 962 A.2d 342, the Court of Appeals held that the requirements of \u00a7 6-203(a) are mandatory, rather than suggestive. Writing for the Court, Judge Battaglia explained that the process for the validation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>signatures pursuant to \u00a7 6-203(b) was distinct from the verification procedure authorized by \u00a7 6-207<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">The purpose of validation, relating to whether the signature is sufficient, is to \u201cprovide additional means by which fraudulent or otherwise improper signatures upon a referendum petition may be detected,\u201d <em>see Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72 [204 A.2d 787], while the purpose of signature verification, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>relating to the existence of registration of the voter and the signature count, is to \u201censure that the name of the individual who signed the petition is listed as a registered voter.\u201d Section 6-207.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">406 Md. at 732, 962 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Finally, the Court held that the right to judicial relief did not accrue until a party became aggrieved by an election board\u2019s final decision. The Court declared that, where, as in <em>Doe, </em>a petition drive is successful at the board level, the final decision of the board is its determination that the referendum petition satisfied <em>all </em>legal requirements, including the requisite number of signatures, pursuant to EL \u00a7 6-208(b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 718, 962 A.2d 342.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\"><em>Doe </em>was filed on December 19, 2008, a few days prior to HCCOG\u2019s submission of the petitions bearing 3,301 signatures. The Board\u2019s staff was unaware of the <em>Doe </em>opinion when it conducted its initial validation and verification reviews of those signatures. After its initial reviews, the Board concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>HCCOG had submitted more than the 2,500 validated and verified signatures required for a thirty-day extension of the submission period. When informed of Doe, the Board staff retraced its steps, and concluded that there were fewer than 2,500 validated and verified signatures and that HCCOG had therefore failed to meet the threshold. We now turn to HCCOG\u2019s objections to the process and the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">III. The Board\u2019s Application of EL \u00a7 6-203 to HCCOG\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">HCCOG\u2019s principal contention is that the Board erred in applying the requirements of EL \u00a7 6-203 to HCCOG\u2019s petitions. In essence, HCCOG\u2019s argument runs as follows: the right to referendum is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Maryland Constitution, Maryland law and the Howard County Charter. Because a voter\u2019s right to take a legislative enactment to referendum is fundamental, any regulation of the referendum process is subject to strict scrutiny review. Under strict scrutiny, such regulations are invalid unless the court finds that it furthers a compelling government interest and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest, so as to minimize interference with the exercise of the protected right. HCCOG asserts that there is no compelling government interest at issue in this case, because there is no evidence of voter fraud or other impropriety. HCCOG claims that the Board\u2019s application of EL \u00a7 6-203, as construed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Doe, </em>unreasonably burdened the rights of Howard County\u2019s voters to participate in the referendum process by changing the standards for signatures in the middle of its referendum drive.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>We find HCCOG\u2019s arguments to be unpersuasive, for the following reasons. Section 6-203(a) does not conflict with Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution. While the referendum process enjoys a considerable degree of constitutional protection, the State may regulate the referendum process in a reasonable, content neutral, nondiscriminatory manner. The Howard County Charter does not restrict the State\u2019s authority to set standards for referendum petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Second, \u00a7 6-203 is a reasonable and content neutral regulation of the referendum process. The Board\u2019s action in undertaking a second review process to assure that the petition signatures complied with the requirements of the statute did not unduly burden the supporters of the referendum effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We begin by noting that, while <em>Doe </em>cited <em>Barnes </em>with approval, 406 Md. at 729-30, 962 A.2d 342, and stated in passing that \u201cthe mandatory signature requirements of \u00a7 2-603(a)(1) are not unduly burdensome ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 732 n. 28, 962 A.2d 342, <em>Doe </em>did not involve a direct constitutional challenge to the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 704, 962 A.2d 342 (setting out the issues for which a writ of <em>certiorari </em>had been granted). Therefore, we will consider whether \u00a7 6-203 passes constitutional muster in two contexts, first, the right of referendum established in Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution and second, the right of free speech guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>\n<em>A. Is 6-203(a) Consistent with Article XVI?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Our analysis of this issue starts with <em>Barnes. </em>The <em>Barnes </em>case grew out of a challenge to the State\u2019s Public Accommodations Law<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> on the basis that the Secretary of State illegally refused to accept a petition to submit the statute to referendum. The Secretary rejected a number of signatures that complied with the then-existing requirements of Article XVI, \u00a7 4, but did not meet then Article 38 \u00a7 169\u2019s requirement that a petition\u2019s signature sheet show the signer\u2019s residence, contain a typed or printed version of the signer\u2019s name and identify the precinct or voting district in which the signer resided. 236 Md. at 570, 204 A.2d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Barnes contended that \u00a7 169 was inconsistent with Article XVI \u00a7 4 of the Constitution and was thus invalid. <em>Id. </em>at 567, 204 A.2d 787. In analyzing the argument, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">These statutory requirements pertain only to the identification of the signer. They do not affect the Constitutional provision with respect to the affidavit of the person who procured the signatures, except insofar as they may provide means of checking the truth of the affidavit.... Clearly, the provisions of the Article will be furthered if, by proper and reasonable means, a referendum petition is to be put upon the ballot only if it has the requisite number of genuine signatures of registered voters.

Section 6-203(a) requires a signer of a petition to \u201csign the individual\u2019s name as it appears on the statewide voter registration list or the individual\u2019s surname of registration and at least one full given name and the initials of any other names\u201d and to include the following information, whether typed or printed: \u201c(i) the signer\u2019s name as it was signed; (ii) the signer\u2019s address; (iii) the date of signing; and (iv) other information required by regulations adopted by the State Board.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A significant change between \u00a7 6-208 and the statute at issue in <em>Barms </em>is that \u00a7 6-203 requires the signature to either match the name on the voter registration list or, at a minimum, to contain the same surname and \u201cat least one full given name and the initials of any other names.\u201d In addition, \u00a7 6-203 omits the requirement that a signer identify his voting precinct. These requirements are not inconsistent with Article XVI \u00a7 4 because the constitutional provision addresses only the form and contents of the affidavit to be signed by the person procuring the signatures on the petition sheet. Taken as a whole, \u00a7 6-203(a)\u2019s requirements do nothing more than \u201c \u2018provide additional means by which fraudulent or otherwise improper signatures ... may be detected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 733, 962 A.2d 342 (quoting <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d 787). Based upon <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d 787, we hold that \u00a7 6-203(a) is consistent with the provisions of Article XVI \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\n<em>B.

HCCOG\u2019s arguments are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The referendum process is a \u201c \u2018basic instrument of democratic government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ritchmount, </em>283 Md. at 61, 388 A.2d 523 (quoting <em>Eastlake v.

Thus, as we have recognized when those rights are subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance. But when a state election law provision imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of voters, the State\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\"><em>Burdick v.

Reed, </em>the Supreme Court applied the <em>Burdick </em>analysis in a referendum petition case. The specific issue before the Court was whether the First Amendment rights of petition signers would be violated by the State of Washington\u2019s disclosure of petition signature pages in response to a request through Washington\u2019s Public Records Act. 130 S.Ct. at 2817. The Court began its analysis by noting that, while signing a petition communicates, at the very least, the signer\u2019s \u201cpolitical view that the question should be considered by the whole electorate,\u201d signing a petition also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">has legal effect in the electoral process. But that is not to say that the electoral context is irrelevant to the nature of our First Amendment review. We allow States significant flexibility in implementing their own voting systems.

We now return to \u00a7 6-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Initially, we recognize that the First Amendment interest asserted by HCCOG is different from that at issue in <em>Doe v. Reed. </em>In the latter case, the plaintiffs challenged the state\u2019s authority to disclose signature information. HCCOG, in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>trast, takes issue with the scope of the State\u2019s ability to obtain identifying information in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Section 6-203(a) requires that \u201ca signer ... provide ... a surname, one full given name, the initials of any other names, the signer\u2019s address and date of signing.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 732 n. 28, 962 A.2d 342. The requirement to have a match, or something reasonably resembling a match, between the signature on the petition and the signer\u2019s name as it appears on the voter registration list is designed to enable election officials to determine whether a signature is valid. <em>Doe, </em>406 Md. at 697, 962 A.2d 342; <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d 787. The same is true for \u00a7 6-203(aj\u2019s requirement that a signer disclose his or her ad&lt;3ress\\ The statute\u2019s requirements are reasonably related to the State\u2019s \u201cundoubtedly important\u201d interest in \u201cin protecting the integrity and reliability of the initiative process.\u201d The State\u2019s interest, in turn, outweighs any burden on the signer or HCCOG. <em>Doe v. Reed, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2821.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 6-203(a) imposes \u201creasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u201d upon the right to sign a referendum petition and that the State\u2019s \u201cimportant regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.\u201d <em>Burdick, </em>504 U.S. at 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\n<em>C. The Howard County Charter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">HCCOG contends that, because the Howard County Charter reserves the right of referendum to its residents, the General Assembly does not have the authority to unreasonably burden the exercise of this right. Among the problems with this argument is the language of the Charter itself, which specifically provides that the \u201cBoard of Supervisors of Elections shall verify the registration of said petitioners.\u201d Howard County Md. Charter \u00a7 211(b). The verification process, which is mandated by the Charter, begins with \u00a7 6-203(a) because that statute requires that a signer provide the information which makes the process of verification possible. <em>Doe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>406 Md. at 697, 962 A.2d 342; <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 571-72, 204 A.2d 787.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Section 6-203 survives the constitutional challenges mounted by HCCOG. We turn now to HCCOG\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">IV. Did the Board Retroactively Apply \u00a7 6-203?</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Without elaboration, HCCOG argues that the Board\u2019s application of the signature validation requirements in \u00a7 6-203(a) to the petition signatures was retroactive and impermissibly burdened the right to referendum. HCCOG is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">As a general rule, \u201c[i]n the overwhelming majority of cases, a judicial decision sets forth and applies the rule of law that existed both before and after the date of the decision.... [I]n the ordinary case, no issue of a \u2018prospective only\u2019[] application arises.\u201d <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 77, 18 A.3d 60 (2011) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. Goldstein, </em>312 Md. 583, 591, 541 A.2d 955 (1988) and citing <em>James B.

Georgia, </em>501 U.S. 529, 535, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991) (Retroactivity \u201cis overwhelmingly the norm, and is in keeping with the traditional function of the courts to decide cases before them based upon their best current understanding of the law.\u201d) (internal citations omitted)). However, when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ0\">a decision of [the Court of Appeals] with regard to a constitutional provision, a statute, or a common law principle,[ ] is overruled on the ground that the decision represented an erroneous interpretation or application of the constitutional provision, statute, or common law principle, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>question of whether the new ruling should be applied prospectively only is governed by the principles set forth in <em>Owens-Illinois [ Inc.] v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 470-72 [601 A.2d 633] (1992)....[]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-5\"><em>Daughtry, </em>419 Md. at 77-78, 18 A.3d 60 (footnotes omitted) (quoting <em>Walker v. State, </em>343 Md. 629, 637, 684 A.2d 429 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">It is not necessary for us to further explore the issue of retroactivity because <em>Doe </em>represented no change in the law. The signature validation requirement set forth in EL \u00a7 6-203 has been the law, albeit in different forms, since 1941. <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 569, 204 A.2d 787. Section 6-203(a) has been in its current form since 2005, three years before the events occurring in this case. <em>See </em>2005 Md. Laws 3262. In <em>Doe, </em>the Court construed the language of the statute as mandatory, a construction which, as it noted, was completely consistent with the holding in <em>Barnes, </em>236 Md. at 569, 204 A.2d 787.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">V. Procedural Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">HCCOG\u2019s final contention is that the Board\u2019s decision was made \u201cwithout prior notice or procedural due process. There was no opportunity for HCCOG to be heard or explore meaningful alternatives.\u201d As we understand its argument, HCCOG claims that, had it been given an opportunity to do so, it would have argued to the Board that the \u201cthen existing Maryland State Board of Elections\u2019 \u2018Guidelines\u2019 did not require the action taken by the Board.\u201d It is certainly correct that HCCOG was unable to present this position to the Board before the Board made its decision. On the other hand, it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>every opportunity to make the argument to us and failed to do so. Thus, it is impossible for us to conceive how HCCOG was prejudiced when the Board applied \u00a7 6-208 to the petitions, and came to a decision regarding those petitions, without first informing HCCOG.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">In addition, as the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit noted in <em>Kendall, </em>\u201c \u2018what is required in the name of due process depends ... on the costs as well as the benefits of the process.\u2019 \u201d 650 F.3d at 529 (quoting <em>Protect Marriage Illinois v. Orr, </em>463 F.3d 604, 608 (7th Cir.2006)). Subtitle 6 of the Election Law Article requires an election board to complete the counting and Verification process within twenty days of the filing of the petition. \u00c9L \u00a7 6-210(c). If an election board determines that a petition effort is deficient, because of a lack of valid signatures or otherwise, it is required to notify the sponsor within two business days of the date of its decision. EL \u00a7 6-210(b). Finally, EL \u00a7 6-209 provides that a petition sponsor has the right to seek judicial review of, and declaratory relief regarding, an adverse decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Subtitle 6 clearly reflects the legislature\u2019s intention that, in the context of a referendum effort, an election board\u2019s limited resources should be focused on the \u201clarge and difficult\u201d task, <em>Doe v. Reed, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2820, that only it can perform\u2014 validating and verifying thousands of petition signatures in an abbreviated time-frame. Because of the expansive post-decision rights to judicial redress available to a petition sponsor, we see no reason to impose upon an election board the additional burden of providing notice and hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">We conclude that constitutionally adequate due process was afforded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-13\">.

In its brief, HCCOG also states that the Board's decision was over-broad, disenfranchised HCCOG and Howard County residents, violated their substantiative rights to due process and equal protection and hindered HCCOG\u2019s right to petition one\u2019s government for the redress of grievances, to associate freely and to engage in politically protected speech. However, HCCOG does not present any argument or cite any authority to support these assertions. Because HCCOG failed to present these arguments with particularity, we will not consider them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>further. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-504(a)(5); <em>Mathis v. Hargrove, </em>166 Md.App. 286, 318, 888 A.2d 377 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">We should also make it clear what HCCOG is <em>not </em>contending. HCCOG does not assert that the Board misapplied \u00a7 6-203's requirements with regard to individual signatures or categories of signatures. Nor does HCCOG argue that the Board\u2019s actions implicated its members\u2019 right to vote as guaranteed by Article I \u00a7 \u00a7 1-4 of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See Nader v. Board of Elections, </em>399 Md. 681, 708, 926 A.2d 199 (2007); <em>Green Party v. Board of Elections, </em>377 Md. 127, 165, 832 A.2d 214 (2003). (This argument was raised in <em>Kendall, </em>and rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. See <em>Kendall, </em>650 F.3d at 522-23.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b645-9\">. Article 40 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides that \"every citizen of the State ought to be allowed to speak, write and publish his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that privilege.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Maryland courts have traditionally treated Article 40 as <em>in pari materia </em>with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>State v. Brookins, </em>380 Md. 345, 350 n. 2, 844 A.2d 1162 (2004); <em>The Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>377 Md. 55, 64, 832 A.2d 170 (2003). However, \"simply because a Maryland constitutional provision is <em>in pari materia </em>with a federal one or has a federal counterpart, does not mean that the provision will always be interpreted or applied in the same manner as its federal counterpart.\" <em>Dua v. Comcast Cable, </em>370 Md. 604, 621, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002). HCCOG does not present an argument based upon Article 40, and we will restrict our analysis to HCCOG\u2019s First Amendment arguments. <em>See Brookins, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\">. Now codified as \u00a7 20-301 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b647-9\">. HCCOG does not argue that any requirement imposed by the State Board of Elections is pertinent to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">.

Moreover, the voters of the County cannot adopt a charter provision that is inconsistent with a general public law of the State such as \u00a7 6-203. <em>See, e.g., Bd. of Supervisors of Elections v. Smallwood, </em>327 Md. 220, 242, 608 A.2d 1222 (1992) (\u201cWhen a provision in a county charter conflicts with a public general law, the public general law prevails under. Art. XI-A, \u00a7 1.\u201d); <em>Montgomery County v. Board of Supervisors of Elections, </em>311 Md. 512, 536 A.2d 641 (1988) (same). While the United States and Maryland Constitutions limit the State\u2019s authority to regulate the referendum process, the Howard County Charter does not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\">. While the Board\u2019s application of EL \u00a7 6-203 to HCCOG\u2019s petition does not give rise to an issue of retroactivity, appellants\u2019 frustration is quite understandable. The Board's initial review of the petition signatures misled HCCOG into thinking that it had an additional thirty days to satisfy the petition requirements. However, the Board had the obligation to correct its error. Therefore, while we sympathize with appellants, the Board\u2019s initial error is not a basis to reverse its ultimate decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
