Baker; Thomas J. Wheatley; Aristone L. Pereira, Jr.; Johnny R. Garza; Kenneth K. Sleeman; David A.

The lawsuit in this matter was initiated by appellants, all of whom received speeding citations resulting from photographs taken by speed monitoring systems located in appellees\u2019 respective jurisdictions. Appellants claim that appellees violated Md.

Therefore, this Court finds that each of the [appel-lees] operates the speed monitoring systems in their respective jurisdictions, \u00a7 21\u2014809(j) of the Transportation Article therefore is not implicated, and the various contracts between [appellees] and [ACS] do not violate \u00a7 21-809(j) of the Transportation Article. This finding entitles [appellees] to judgment on all counts of [appellants\u2019] Third Amended Class Action Complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">(3) Even if this Court were to accept the expanded definitions of \u201cspeed monitoring system,\u201d \u201cspeed monitoring system operator,\u201d and \u201crecorded image\u201d as argued by [appellants], this Court finds and declares that none of the [appellees] have delegated final authority over when a citation alleging that an individual has violated \u00a7 21-809 of the Transportation Article is to be issued, and therefore, [appel-lees] operate the speed monitoring systems in their respective jurisdictions. Thus, this Court finds that each of the [appellees] operates the speed monitoring systems in their respective jurisdictions, \u00a7 21\u2014809(j) of the Transportation Article therefore is not implicated, and the various contracts between [appellees] and [ACS] do not violate \u00a7 21\u2014809(j) of the Transportation Article.

Therefore, \u00a7 21-809 of the Transportation Article does not create a private right of action.

Private Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Appellants contend that a private cause of action exists as a remedy for citizens to enforce T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(j), which provides in pertinent part, that a \u201ccontractor\u2019s fee may not be contingent on the number of citations issued or paid.\u201d Appellants argue that they have a \u201cright to pursue tort claims against the State government to remedy illegal acts,\u201d and to petition for \u201cequitable relief to prevent a defendant from continuing illegal or improper actions.\u201d Appellants maintain that the General Assembly has the ability to prohibit a private cause of action, but, in this case, there is no such restriction in the statute. Appellants argue that the \u201cimposition and collection of $40 fines pursuant to the contract with ACS is State action\u201d and violates their right to due process. Appellants contend that the fines result in economic loss, a deprivation of their property interests, and constitute a \u201ctaking of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Appellants argue that three factors set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> are utilized by courts to determine whether to recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>nize a private cause of action. The factors include: (1) \u201cthe presence or absence of an indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff.\u201d Appellants contend that the <em>Cort </em>factors for establishment of a private cause of action are satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">In contrast, appellees<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> argue that no private cause of action exists under T.A. \u00a7 21-809(j). Appellees contend that \u201c[i]n the absence of a statutory directive, [ ] Maryland courts have uniformly held that it is not appropriate to expand a statute to include remedies that were not specified.\u201d Appellees point out that when the General Assembly \u201cexpressly provides a remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.\u201d Appellees agree with appellants that the <em>Cort </em>factors are applicable in determining whether a private cause of action exists; however, appellees contend that the factors are not satisfied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Appellees argue that T.A. \u00a7 21-809 was enacted to benefit drivers on the highways whose safety is endangered by speeding, and was not enacted for the special benefit of individuals who exceeded the speed limits and admitted liability.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>lees point out that the statute\u2019s legislative history is silent as to providing for or prohibiting a private right of action, and this silence \u201cweighs heavily\u201d against an intent to create a private cause of action. Appellees point out that T.A. \u00a7 21-809 provides a \u201cdetailed and comprehensive remedy to contest liability for a speed camera citation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Appellees argue that the General Assembly has demonstrated that it is fully able to explicitly include a private cause of action in those statutes in which it intends a private cause of action will lie. Under the public duty doctrine, appellees maintain that \u201cwhen a statute or common law \u2018imposes upon a public entity a duty to the public at large, and not a duty to a particular class of individuals, the duty is not one enforceable in tort.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The determination of whether a private cause of action is implicit in a statute which does not expressly provide for such an action, involves an analysis of three factors. <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 78, <em>95 S.Ct. 2080. The </em>Supreme Court explained these factors in <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080. The first factor involves determining whether the plaintiff is \u201c \u2018one of the class for whose [ ]special benefit the statute was enacted!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The second factor involves examining whether there is \u201cany indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The third factor involves determining whether it is \u201cconsistent with the under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>lying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff[.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In <em>Erie Ins. Co. v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 82-83, 91, 585 A.2d 232 (1991), the Court of Appeals applied the three-factor analysis in determining whether a private cause of action existed where a plaintiff sued an insurance company for negligence, alleging that the insurance company breached a duty imposed upon it by T.A. \u00a7 17-106(b) (1977 &amp; Supp. 1987).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Pursuant to T.A. \u00a7 17-106(b), insurance companies are to immediately notify the Motor Vehicle Administration of the cancellation of a driver\u2019s automobile insurance policy. <em>Erie, </em>322 Md. at 83, 585 A.2d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>Erie, </em>the Court reiterated the factors described in <em>Cort </em>stating that in order to determine whether a private cause of action exists, Maryland courts have analyzed three factors: (1) \u201cthe presence or absence of an indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy\u201d; (2) \u201cwhether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted\u201d; and (3) \u201cwhether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of .the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 585 A.2d 232. The Court acknowledged that \u201cmore recent decisions of the Supreme Court have indicated that implication of a private right of action \u2018is limited solely to determining whether Congress intended to create the private right of action.\u2019 \u201d The Court nevertheless noted that earlier cases involved an analysis of all three of the factors described in <em>Cort. Id. </em>The Court explained that Maryland applies a \u201cmore flexible approach\u201d than the approach suggested in <em>Cort, </em>stating that the Court \u201chas not hesitated to change the common law to permit new actions or remedies where that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>course was appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 585 A.2d 232. In <em>Erie, </em>however, the Court found that no private cause of action existed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">Although the [plaintiffs] may properly be said to be within the class of persons in whose favor the statute was intended, it seems equally apparent that the principal focus of the uninsured motorist laws is for the general protection of the public. Additionally, while permitting recovery by the plaintiffs would not be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the legislative scheme, we do not believe such a broad extension of existing law is necessary to properly implement the legislation. We note that the legislature has provided other remedies for those who are involved in accidents with uninsured motorists, including the requirement of uninsured motorist coverage in every automobile liability policy issued, sold, or delivered in this State, Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c)(2), and the establishment of a fund for payment of claims arising out of accidents with uninsured motorists occurring in this State. Article 48A, \u00a7 243H(a)(3). Finally, as we have noted, the legislature did not expressly or impliedly establish the sanction sought by the plaintiffs, even though the legislature has done so in other related matters involving insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 585 A.2d 232 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

We stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">In determining legislative intent, various factors are examined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-5\">including the legislative history and purposes of the statute, the identity of the class for whose particular benefit the statute was passed, the existence of express statutory remedies to serve the legislative purpose!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 557, 554 A.2d 434 (citation and footnote omitted). With Judge Paul E. Alpert speaking for this Court, we explained that: \u201cWhere the legislative history does not indicate any discussion whatsoever as to whether a statute gives rise to such a right, the fact that the ordinance is silent would weigh heavily against an intent by the council to create a private cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We qualified this by stating that the \u201cvast differences in legislative record-keeping between Congress and a municipal or local government,\u201d made us \u201chesitate to place such great weight on the fact that the legislative history available to us is silent as to whether the Montgomery County Council intended to create an implied private right of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558, 554 A.2d 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">We, therefore, analyzed the purpose of the statute and the express statutory remedies within the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 558-62, 554 A.2d 434.

Med. Mut. Liab. Ins.

The Court held that: \u201cGiven the choice of finding that the legislature intended to grant limited restitutory powers consistent with relief it has granted in similar cases of improper refusal or termination of coverage, or that it intended to give the Insurance Commissioner virtually unlimited power to award general and special compensatory damages, we are strongly inclined to believe that the legislature intended the former.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546, 629 A.2d 626 (footnote omitted). In support of this holding, the Court cited <em>Erie, </em>stating: \u201cWe have been reluctant to find an implied grant of a private cause of action, even when the further complication of delegation of authority to an administrative agency was not involved.\u201d <em>Magan, </em>331 Md. at 546, n. 4, 629 A.2d 626 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Returning to the instant matter, based on a plain reading of the statute, we conclude that T.A. \u00a7 21-809 does not expressly provide for a private cause of action. We must, therefore, determine whether a private cause of action is implicit in T.A. \u00a7 21-809. As such, we will address the three factors discussed in <em>Cort </em>and applied in <em>Erie: </em>(1) The presence or absence of an indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy; (2) whether the plaintiff is one of the class for whose special benefit the statute was enacted; and (3) whether it is consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff. <em>Cort, </em>422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080; <em>Erie, </em>322 Md. at 90-91, 585 A.2d 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">(1) Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">As this Court explained in <em>Sugarbaf, </em>in determining whether a private cause of action exists, \u201c[t]he primary focus in resolving such a question is the legislative intent.\u201d 78 Md.App. at 556, 554 A.2d 434 (citations omitted). As such, our \u201cprimary focus\u201d is to determine the legislative intent as to a private cause of action under T.A. \u00a7 21-809. In <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 274-77, 987 A.2d 18 (2010), the Court of Appeals set out the \u201c[p]ertinent [p]rinciples of [s]ound [statutory\u201d interpretation that are applicable in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real and actual intent of the Legislature. A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting statutory language is to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by the statutory provision under scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">To ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, we begin with the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute. If the language of the statute is unambiguous and clearly consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, our inquiry as to legislative intent ends ordinarily and we apply the statute as written, without resort to other rules of construction. We neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>language of the statute, and we do not construe a statute with \u201cforced or subtle interpretations\u201d that limit or extend its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">(Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Nowhere in the plain language of T.A. \u00a7 21-809 did the General Assembly evidence an intent to create a private cause of action. The statute, by its plain language, demonstrates a clear intent on the part of the legislature to enforce the speed limits in residential areas and school zones, and expressly provides for a specific remedy\u2014people who receive speed citations pursuant to T.A. \u00a7 21-809(c) may challenge the citation by following the process outlined in T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(d)(5). T.A. \u00a7 21-809(d)(1)(x) provides that every citation issued must include information about the manner and time in which liability as alleged in the citation may be contested in the district court. If a person elects to stand trial in the district court for the alleged violation, the burden is on the County or municipality to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the person was speeding. T.A. \u00a7 21-809(e). The person may request the presence of the speed monitoring operator to testify at trial. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(f), the district court may consider defenses such as: (1) whether the motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>vehicle or the registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation; or (2) evidence that the person named in the citation was not operating the vehicle at the time of the violation.

H.B. 443 contained the legislative purpose of T.A. \u00a7 21-809 and made clear the legislature\u2019s intent to create a specific process by which a person may challenge a speed citation. The purpose of T.A. \u00a7 21-809 as stated in pertinent part, in H.B. 443 was for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">[Establishing certain maximum fine[s] for a violation of law enforced by means of a speed monitoring system under this Act; ... establishing the standard of proof in a trial for a violation of law enforced by means of a speed monitoring system under this Act; requiring the Chief Judge of the District Court, in consultation with certain county agencies, to adopt certain procedures; authorizing persons receiving citations to have the speed monitoring system operator be present and testify at trial; providing that certain persons are responsible for paying the civil penalty indicated on the citation under certain circumstances; providing that persons receiving citations may elect to stand trial in the District Court; establishing defenses that the District Court may consider; authorizing vehicle owners to submit a certain letter to the District Court to establish a certain defense; authorizing the Motor Vehicle Administration to impose certain penalties if the person cited under this Act fails to pay the civil penalty or contest liability; ... providing for the admissibility and use of certain evidence; modifying the jurisdiction of the District Court to include certain proceedings; providing for the handling of certain court costs and penalties[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In discerning legislative intent a court may search \u201cindicia, including the history of the legislation or other relevant sources intrinsic and extrinsic to the legislative process.\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 276, 987 A.2d 18 (2010). In this case, as part of the legislative process, the Montgomery County Delegation of the Maryland General Assembly Transportation Committee submitted a report on January 21, 2005, recommending the enactment of H.B. 443, stating that \u201ca significant number of speeding related deaths occur on highways where the speed limit is under 35 miles per hour, the highways on which speed monitoring systems are authorized to be placed under the bill, and that speed monitoring systems are an effective and cost effective way of trying to alleviate the situation.\u201d In support of enacting the speed camera program, Delegate Bronrott and Senator Forehand of the Montgomery County Delegation wrote a memorandum in support, stating: \u201cThis bill would provide a means to enhance enforcement of speed limits in the face of limited police resources in Montgomery County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">After H.B. 443 was introduced, numerous members of the County government and the public sent reports, letters, and gave testimony at public hearings in support of the Bill. On November 15, 2004, James W. Clarke, Vice President of the Action Committee for Transit, wrote a statement in support of H.B. 443: \u201cThe bill before you is designed to slow down speeders. Where [they have] been used in other places[,] photo radars [have] been shown to [do] just this, slow down speeders.\u201d The City of Takoma Park provided testimony at a Montgomery County Delegation Public Hearing held on November 14, 2005, supporting H.B. 443 and stated: \u201cThe safety of our pedestrians, bicyclists, bus riders and drivers is a top priority for the Takoma Park City Council. We have had too many transportation-related deaths in our community.... Speeding is a factor in many accidents and often occurs in the same locations.\u201d The Manager of Chevy Chase Village also testified on November 14, 2005, and stated: \u201cThe potential this technology represents would be a significant enhancement to pedestrian safety and could establish a consistent, round-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the-clock, level of enforcement and traffic calming.\u201d Jacqueline Gilan, Vice President of the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, testified at the November 15, 2004, hearing that \u201c[allowing the Montgomery County Police to enforce Montgomery County speed limits using photo enforcement will save taxpayer dollars, save police resources and, most importantly, save lives.\u201d On behalf of the Rockville City Council and the Mayor, Bo Ferguson testified at the November 15, 2004, hearing in support of H.B. 443, stating that \u201c[w]e want drivers to obey our speed limits. Speed limits exist in order to protect our residents.\u201d As such, the public expressed support for T.A. \u00a7 21-809 on the basis that the statute would help reduce the amount of speed-related accidents and deaths in the County. As Gaithersburg and Chevy Chase point out, and we concur, the legislature clearly intended to promote safety by enforcing speed limits on certain highways, namely residential areas and school zones when enacting T.A. \u00a7 21-809.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">As the Court explained in <em>Sugarloaf,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>when a statute provides a particular remedy, \u201ca court must be chary of reading others into it\u201d and \u201cwhen legislation expressly provides a remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.\u201d 78 Md.App. at 559-60, 554 A.2d 434 (citations omitted). As such, this Court should not read into T.A. \u00a7 21-809 a private cause of action when a particular remedy is already specifically expressed within the statute. \u201cWhere the legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>provided a remedy, the litigant must pursue that designated form of remedy, rather than to seek some alternative form to circumvent the procedures promulgated by the legislature.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>179 Md.App. at 630, 947 A.2d 149 (citation omitted). As a result, appellants are entitled only to pursue the process set forth in T.A. \u00a7 21-809 as the designated form of remedy in challenging the lawfulness of the citations received\u2014a private cause of action is not permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Appellants claim that the process provided in T.A. \u00a7 21-809 to challenge a citation is merely procedural, and does not afford appellants an opportunity to \u201cchallenge the constitutional due process defects of the system, or its violation of the fundamental prohibition against contingent fees[.]\u201d T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(f)(1)(iii) specifically provides, however, that the district court may consider \u201c[a]ny other issues and evidence that the District Court deems pertinent.\u201d (Emphasis added). Although appellants argue that it is impractical to bring an action challenging the propriety of a contingency fee in the district court, we see no other way to interpret the plain language of this provision\u2014appellants are permitted to raise any defense in the district court regarding the legality of the citation. Appellants, therefore, had the opportunity\u2014which they failed to exercise\u2014to challenge in the district court the speed citations they received, presenting the argument that the contracts between appellees and ACS were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">(2) Class For Whose Special Benefit T.A. \u00a7 21-809 Was Enacted</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Appellants\u2014individuals cited for speeding\u2014are not within the class of people for whose special benefit T.A. \u00a7 21-809 was enacted. As discussed above, when H.B. 443 was first introduced it was described as a bill that would promote highway safety and help reduce the amount of speed related accidents and deaths. T.A. \u00a7 21-809 was clearly enacted for the benefit of drivers, bus riders, pedestrians, and bicyclists on those highways whose safety is endangered by drivers who speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Appellants argue that they are part of a class for whom T.A. \u00a7 21-809(j) was enacted as the purpose of section (j) was to \u201cprevent the operation of the speed monitoring systems by persons with a financial incentive to increase the number of citations issued.\u201d Appellants contend that they are part of a subgroup protected by T.A. \u00a7 21-809Q), which includes those who were given citations but were not violating the speed limit. We disagree. The second <em>Ene </em>factor requires an analysis of the statute as a whole and not an analysis of one specific provision or subsection. Appellants conceded at oral argument that no Maryland case has ever interpreted this factor to be applied in terms of specific provisions within a statute. Rather, Maryland case law instructs that in determining for whose special benefit a statute is enacted, a court must look at the entire statute and not specific or individual sections within the statute. Viewing the statute as a whole, it is abundantly clear that T.A. \u00a7 21-809 was enacted for the benefit of the public, and individuals who obey the speed limit, and to enforce speed limits in residential areas and in school zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Were we to adopt appellants\u2019 logic and find that T.A. \u00a7 21-809(j) was enacted for the benefit of those who did not speed but received citations, we would, nonetheless, conclude that appellants have removed themselves from this class by admitting liability and paying the $40 fine associated with the speed citations. We are mindful that appellants contend that they paid the fines only to avoid the extra time and cost to dispute the citation in court, and not because they were admitting liability. The plain language of T.A. \u00a7 21-809, however, is clear. T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(d)(1)(xi) provides, in pertinent part that: All citations must contain \u201c[information advising the person alleged to be liable under this section that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in a timely manner: 1. Is an admission of liability[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). T.A. \u00a7 21-809(d)(5) provides that: \u201cA person who receives a citation under paragraph (1) of this subsection may: (i) Pay the civil penalty, in accordance with instructions on the citation, directly to the Montgomery County Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Finance; or (ii) Elect to stand trial in the District Court for the alleged violation.\u201d Appellants admitted liability by paying the fines associated with the citations and by failing to contest the speed citations. As a result, appellants are not members of the class that they argue for whose special benefit T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(j) was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Maryland courts have consistently declined to find that a private cause of action exists where the person bringing the action is not in the class of people for whose special benefit the statute was enacted. In <em>Hayes v. State, </em>183 Md.App. 742, 745, 963 A.2d 271 (2009), Hayes was accused by his ex-wife of abusing their minor daughter, and the Department of Social Services found that he was an \u201cindicated child abuser.\u201d This finding was overturned and Hayes brought a negligence action against the Department based on its failure to conduct a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d as required by Md.Code, Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d) \u00a7 5-706(a) (1984, 2006 Repl.Vol.). <em>Hayes, </em>183 Md.App. at 745, 963 A.2d 271. The circuit court dismissed Hayes\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim, finding that F.L. \u00a7 5-706(a) \u201cdoes not create a legally cognizable duty\u201d to the alleged abuser. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the circuit court holding that: \u201cThe Court of Appeals has recognized a limited statutory duty on the part of DSS to investigate reports of child abuse. However, that duty runs to the children who are the subject of the reports and not to their parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 963 A.2d 271 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">In <em>Willow Tree Learning Ctr., Inc. v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>85 Md.App. 508, 510, 584 A.2d 157 (1991), a child was injured on a frayed rope that was part of playground equipment at a private day-care center. The parents of the child argued \u201cthat the frayed rope was a violation of applicable safety regulations, and that under Md. Regs.Code title 10, \u00a7 .05.01.16 (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) and the Prince George\u2019s County Code, a duty was created on the part of the [County] to discover and report it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-14, 584 A.2d 157 (footnote omitted). We held that \u201cthe State [n]or the County ... owe[s] any individual duty of care merely by the enactment of a general ordinance requiring safety inspections, nor by the fact that it undertook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>inspections for safety violations. The duty created by the statute and ordinance was one owed to the public generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 584 A.2d 157; see also, <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 486, 805 A.2d 372 (2002) (\u201c[A]b-sent a special relationship between a 911 employee and an individual in need of emergency services, an employee does not owe such an individual a private duty in tort.\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In this case, the plain language as well as the legislative history of T.A. \u00a7 21-809, and applicable case law support the conclusion that appellants are not within the class of people for whose special benefit T.A. \u00a7 21-809 was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">(3) Consistency with the Underlying Purposes of the Legislative Scheme to Imply a Private Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">It is inconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply a private cause of action for appellants under T.A. \u00a7 21-809. Simply put, a finding by this Court of the existence of a private cause of action would be inconsistent with the provision in T.A. \u00a7 21-809, which details the manner in which to oppose a citation under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">In sum, we conclude that none of the factors identified in <em>Cort </em>are satisfied under the circumstances of this case. As a result, we hold that no private cause of action exists for appellants to seek redress for an alleged violation of T.A. \u00a7 21\u2014809(j).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Although we review this issue <em>de novo, </em>we agree with the circuit court that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Section 21-809 of the Transportation Article affords every individual who receives a citation alleging a violation of \u00a7 21-809 the opportunity to contest the citation in the District Court of Maryland. Further, pursuant to \u00a7 21-809(f)(1)(iii) of the Transportation Article, every individual who receives a citation alleging a violation of \u00a7 21-809 may raise any issue, and present any evidence, in defense of the citation, including the issues raised in [appellants\u2019] Third Amended Class Action Complaint. Therefore, \u00a7 21-809 of the Transportation Article does not create a private right of action. This finding entitles [appellees] to judgment on Counts 1-7 of [appellants\u2019] Third Amended Class Action Complaint[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">As such, we conclude that the circuit court properly granted summary judgment as to all appellees on Counts 1 through 7<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> of appellants\u2019 Third Amended Class Action Complaint.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>As to the appeal of the circuit court\u2019s denial of injunctive and declaratory relief, we find those issues to be moot. \u201cA moot question has been defined as one where \u2018there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf, </em>78 Md.App. at 554, 554 A.2d 434 (citations omitted); <em>Carroll County Ethics Comm\u2019n v.

On September 4, 2008, the contract between ACS and the County was amended to include the following language: \u201cContractor provides vehicles and equipment, but does not operate the speed monitoring system\u201d and \u201c[t]he County has the sole responsibility to operate the speed monitoring system.\u201d On November 17, 2008, the contract between ACS and Rockville was amended to include the same language: \u201cContractor provides vehicles and equipment, but does not operate the speed monitoring system\u201d and \u201c[Rockville] has the sole responsibility to operate the speed monitoring system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">On February 9, 2009, the contract between ACS and Chevy Chase was amended. Pursuant to this amendment the method of compensation was changed and ACS was now to be compensated as follows: (1) $37,000 per month per fixed pole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>unit utilizing radar detection; (2) $16,280 per month for each can cam utilizing radar detection; (3) $37,000 per month per fixed pole unit utilizing laser detection; (4) $37,000 per month for each can cam utilizing laser detection; and (5) $37,000 per month per fixed pole and no additional charge per can cam for 4 fixed pole units utilizing laser detection and 2 laser can cams. The amendment also added the following language to the Special Terms and Conditions, Contractor\u2019s Responsibilities, Vehicles and Equipment section: \u201cContractor provides vehicles and equipment, but does not operate the speed monitoring system\u201d and \u201c[Chevy Chase] has the sole responsibility to operate the speed monitoring system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">On June 4, 2009, the contract between ACS and Gaithers-burg was amended to include language that the \u201c[c]ontractor provides vehicles and equipment, but does not operate the speed monitoring system\u201d and \u201c[Gaithersburg] has the sole responsibility to operate the speed monitoring system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We are aware of appellants\u2019 insistence that the amendments to the contracts between appellees and ACS do not resolve the contention that ACS is an operator of the speed cameras. We discern, however, no basis to look beyond the plain, unambiguous language of the contracts, which specifically provides that appellees and not ACS are operators of the speed cameras in Montgomery County. <em>Ocean Petroleum, Co. v. Yanek, </em>416 Md. 74, 86, 5 A.3d 683 (2010) (\u201cWe employ in Maryland an objective approach to contract interpretation, according to which, unless a contract\u2019s language is ambiguous, we give effect to that language as \"written without concern for the subjective intent of the parties at the time of formation.\u201d Finding no ambiguity in the contract language, \u201c[t]his undertaking requires us to restrict our inquiry to \u2018the four corners of the agreement,\u2019 and ascribe to the contract\u2019s language its \u2018customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).
