Among the hot-button issues in this highly-charged case are: 1) whether a removal and a transfer were justified on the basis of pervasive community prejudice, including widespread prejudicial publicity; 2) whether due process required appellants to be heard in the transferor court on the designation of a new venue; and 3) whether equal protection required the case to be transferred to a jurisdiction with racial demographics similar to those of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Baltimore City.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For reasons set forth below, we answer these questions in appellees\u2019 favor and uphold the decisions below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Not particularly helpful in resolving this appeal are the facts supporting non-liability as found by a jury in Howard County. Rather, more critical are appellants\u2019 pre-trial allegations and the public reaction before and at the time the transfer decisions were made. These allegations focused on police encounters on March 13, 2007 and March 24, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">I. The Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">On the afternoon of March 13, 2007, 7-year-old Gerard Mungo, Jr. (\u201cGerard\u201d) was sitting on a Yamaha TT-R50 Mini Bike (\u201cdirt bike\u201d) outside his home on the 2100 block of East Federal Street in Baltimore City. Although the vehicle was turned off, it was not \u201csecurely locked or otherwise immobilized\u201d as required by the Baltimore City Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After observ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>ing Gerard, Baltimore City Police Officer Charles Grimes and Officer-Trainee Brian Chris approached the child and confiscated the dirt bike. Officer Donald Hayes arrived at the scene and the dirt bike was placed in the back of his police truck. According to the complaint filed in this case, these officers (among others) \u201cmaliciously and unreasonably grabbed Gerard by his shirt collar and dragged him off the bike.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">At this time, Lakisa Dinkins, Gerard\u2019s mother, confronted the officers and informed them that she planned to make a complaint to their supervisor. Officer Grimes called his supervisor, Sergeant William Colburn, IV, to inform Colburn of Dinkins\u2019 intentions. Subsequently, Dinkins called 311 to make a formal complaint about the conduct of Officer Grimes, Officer Hayes, and Officer-Trainee Chris. Before responding to the scene, Sgt. Colburn called the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office regarding the legality of arresting Gerard. Later, Sgt. Col-burn, along with Officer Grimes and Officer Hayes, returned to Dinkins\u2019 home. According to the complaint, the officers yelled at, taunted and bullied Gerard and followed the frightened child into his house. The officers then arrested Gerard handcuffed him, and placed him in the back of a police car. The child was then transported to the Eastern District Police Station for processing and fingerprinting. According to the complaint, he was chained to a bench for hours, interrogated and detained without his parents\u2019 consent. In addition, one officer was alleged to have said to Gerard: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for your mother calling my boss, you wouldn\u2019t have went to jail.\u201d The child was later released and never formally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The dust had barely settled on the dirt bike arrest when the City police again encountered Dinkins and her family. Eleven days later, Officer Jermaine Cook, Detective Gene Bennett and Officer Calvin Moss were in an unmarked vehicle investigating illegal drug activity. Believing they had observed an unlawful drug transaction involving one Ernest Thompson, they confronted Thompson, who allegedly ran into a dwelling on the 2200 block of Prentiss Place. The house was owned by Dinkins\u2019 sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">According to appellants\u2019 complaint, Officers Moss, Cook and Bennett \u201cbarged\u201d into the house. The complaint continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiy\">After barging into the house, Defendants Cook, Moss and/or Bennett maliciously and unreasonably held a gun to the head of Ms. Dinkins\u2019 fourteen (14) year-old-son, Devon Johnson, telling him to get off of the telephone____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Aware that Ms. Dinkins was the mother of the seven-year-old who was arrested for sitting on a dirt bike, an individual who had publicly criticized officers of the BCPD for their treatment of Gerard, Defendant Cook, Bennett and/or Moss unreasonably and maliciously grabbed Ms. Dinkins by the back of her jacket, shoved her into a chair and arrested her for allegedly hindering an arrest even though no other person at the scene was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">Thereafter, Ms. Dinkins was unreasonably and maliciously taken against her will by Defendants Cook, Bennett and/or Moss to the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Facility where she was forced to be imprisoned and detained in deplorable conditions for several hours before being released. When Ms. Dinkins was ultimately released from the Central Booking Facility, she was released without being advised as to what she had been charged with, she was never presented with any charging documents and she was never required to stand criminal charges for the incident of March 24, 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>II. Public / Media Reaction</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">By March 15, 2007, the story reached the media that police had pulled Gerard by the collar and dragged him off the dirt bike, yelled at the frightened child, handcuffed him and placed him under arrest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The next day the newspaper and television stations reported that Mayor Sheila Dixon criticized the officers\u2019 actions. She was quoted as saying: \u201cIt is clear to me that the arrest was wrong, that the officers on the scene should not have arrested the child, and on behalf of the City of Baltimore, I apologize to the boy and his parents.\u201d Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm promised an internal investigation. Local politicians echoed their dismay and the President of the Baltimore Chapter of the NAACP said his membership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>was angered by the arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dinkins was reported as saying that the arrest had \u201cchanged [Gerard\u2019s] life ... he\u2019ll never be the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">On March 19, 2007, a demonstration took place outside City Hall in a \u201ccall for justice\u201d for Gerard. According to the <em>Examiner </em>newspaper, the leader of the protest sought a personal apology by the Mayor and Police Chief and the firing of the officer who arrested the boy because the arrest was \u201ca violation of the boy\u2019s civil rights.\u201d He added that \u201c[t]he officer is back in the community, which is an intimidation factor toward the young man and his family.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> News coverage of the protest continued the next day, reporting a church leader as saying: \u201cGerard is a symbol for broader problems, and the situation is an indication of an ongoing problem in the black community.\u201d A story in the <em>Examiner </em>on the City crime rate made a reference to Gerard and letters to the editor in the same publication said that the correspondents were \u201cdisgust[ed]\u201d and \u201cincense[d]\u201d at the police actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On March 21, <em>Baltimore Sun </em>columnist, Gregg Kane wrote: \u201cIf there were a Richter scale that measured outrage, this incident would have blown the needle off the thing.\u201d Kane said: \u201cThe arrest was reserved for the 7-year-old black kid from a poor East Baltimore neighborhood. As Dixon and Hamm have said, there\u2019s really no way to justify that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Four days later, news media reported Dinkins\u2019 March 24 arrest and recounted her claim that the police retaliated against her for protesting the arrest of her son. In one account, the local NAACP reiterated that Dinkins\u2019 arrest \u201cwas retaliation for Dinkins taking her objections to her son\u2019s arrest public.\u201d In an <em>Examiner </em>story, the organization\u2019s head reportedly said: \u201cIf they want war, they\u2019ll have war.\u201d A March 26, 2007 <em>Baltimore </em>Sun article noted that Gerard\u2019s arrest had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cattracted national attention\u201d and reported the details of the March 24 encounter, including allegations that an officer held a gun to Devon\u2019s head. The next day, the Baltimore branch president of the NAACP called for an emergency meeting with the Mayor on the arrest of Dinkins and Gerard. He called the arrest of Gerard \u201cour Rosa Parker incident.\u201d On March 27, Rev. Anthony Evans, the head of the <em>National Black Church Initiative, </em>an African-American religious organization, called for a \u201cboycott of Baltimore\u201d by all religious conventions to protest the child\u2019s arrest. The following day, the <em>Examiner </em>reported that at a NAACP meeting, a community activist said to Commissioner Hamm: \u201cHow can these officers still have badges after arresting a child? They are thugs in uniforms.\u201d WJZ-TV reported without attribution that the City State\u2019s Attorney \u201cpersonally reviewed the case [against Dinkins] and called it legally insufficient, fueling claims by the family that the arrest was retaliation [for] the embarrassing arrest of a seven year old.\u201d The arrest also became an issue in Annapolis, where State legislators slowed progress on a police arbitration bill because of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">News coverage continued in April. An April 4, 2007 <em>Examiner </em>story reported on dueling protests outside Eastern District police headquarters: one group supporting Gerard; the other supporting the police. One community leader is reported to have said: \u201cUntil Commissioner Hamm has the badges of the officers that arrested Gerard, he has no credibility.\u201d An April 12 \u201ccommentary\u201d in the <em>Examiner </em>on Commissioner Hamm said of Gerard\u2019s arrest: \u201cOn the surface, police behavior seems totally unacceptable, with leadership to blame. Media picked up the story, broken by <em>The Examiner, </em>spreading it like wildfire around the state, county and world.\u201d On April 21, news media reported the release of a police report on Gerard. It recommended a comprehensive review of police policies and procedures on the arrest of young juveniles, but was met with angry criticism by Dinkins and community leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Coverage of the incidents appeared to diminish with Gerard\u2019s arrest mentioned only in a number of stories primarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>concerned with other topics (such as the resignation of the Police Commissioner). However, the filing of the lawsuit against the officers in November of 2007 stirred up a new round of media attention.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As the litigation progressed in relative quietude, time did not erase the controversy in the eyes of the media. A March 17, 2008 <em>Examiner </em>story recounted the history of the case under the headline: \u201cA year later, child bears scars of arrest for sitting on dirt bike,\u201d and quoted Dinkins as saying: \u201c[P]eo-ple said, \u2018I saw you on TV.\u2019 It happens all the time.\u201d A <em>Wikipedia </em>entry on the Baltimore City Police Department recounted the circumstances surrounding the arrests of Gerard and Dinkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">III. Appellees\u2019 Removal Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In June of 2008, appellees filed a motion for removal, arguing that \u201c[g]iven the pervasive, protracted and totally one-sided portrayal of the \u2018facts,\u2019 as well as the hostile public reaction and protests, it is not possible for the police officers to receive a fair trial in Baltimore.\u201d Attached to this motion were exhibits of media coverage of the events in the case<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and an affidavit of Officer Hayes,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which stated that based on news accounts, \u201cI believe that neither I, nor any of the defendants in this case, can receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>In opposition to the motion, Dinkins argued that the defendants had not satisfied the \u201cheavy burden\u201d required to justify removal and asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">If this Court were to grant Defendants\u2019 Motion for Removal, the Court would be setting a gross precedent to allow for the removal of each and every high-profile case in Baltimore City where the media coverage was asserted to be more favorable to the prosecution, defendant or plaintiff notwithstanding the absence of any proof that the <em>voir dire </em>process can not function to secure a fair and impartial trial.... [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">On June 28, 2008, Judge M. Brooke Murdock heard argument on the motion and announced her ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">Well, I must admit that this is a tough one, because while I agree generally with Mr. Trager that ... there are adequate measures in place to safeguard Voir Dire being [one], I\u2019m very troubled by the fact that the Chief Executive of this jurisdiction, made\u2014makes a public statement in a case which clearly was headed towards litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">My problem is, is that if I say\u2014if I grant the Motion for Removal, it appears\u2014it seems to me that what I\u2019m saying is that the Baltimore City jury can\u2019t be fair in this case, that there\u2019s reasonable grounds to believe that they can\u2019t\u2014that the police officers won\u2019t receive a fair trial from a Baltimore City jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">And I just don\u2019t believe that. I believe we\u2019re strongly in the jury system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">Like Mr. Trager, I\u2019ve seen juries sort through all kinds of complicated high publicity cases and come to the\u2014what this Court viewed was the correct decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">So, for those reasons, I am going to deny the Motion for Removal. I believe that there are adequate measures that exist to guard against the exposure to the pretrial\u2014this really serious pretrial publicity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>And if it turns out during voir dire\u2014because I\u2019m hoping this case comes back to me, because it looks like it\u2019ll be an interesting case\u2014if it turns out that during Voir Dire there are many, many people who say they know about the case, and that they can\u2019t be fair, I may be proven \"wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">But I suspect that most citizens in Baltimore City, in these days of computers haven\u2019t read, or if they have read, they have forgotten whatever they\u2019ve read sufficiently, so that they can be a fair juror.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">So I will deny the Motion for Removal, and I\u2019ll issue a written order to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Judge Murdock\u2019s June 28 ruling did not put out the fire on either the transfer issue or publicity about the case. The transcripts attached to appellees\u2019 response found their way into the hands of local television stations and other media. On July 30 and 31, stories appeared asserting that one of the appellees and a dispatcher joked about arresting Gerard.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Some of the reports recounted earlier unflattering accounts of the police encounters and the retaliation charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The publicity spurred appellees, on August 7, 2008, to file a Motion for Reconsideration of the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Removal. The motion said of the new burst of media attention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-9\">The article was highly prejudicial and demonstrates the kind of publicity that any Baltimore City Jury \"will be exposed to during the prolonged trial of this case. Based upon the extensive publicity this case has received and Plaintiffs continuous and successful efforts to garner emotional and prejudicial publicity adverse to the defendants, a fair trial can not be obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Appellees requested reconsideration of its prior motion and transfer of the case to \u201canother county.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellants opposed the motion primarily on the basis of their earlier arguments on the initial motion for removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">On September 23, 2008, another hearing was held before Judge Murdock, where the officers\u2019 counsel emphasized the \u201ccommunity resentment\u201d present in the case, while appellants\u2019 lawyer noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">[T]his case got a lot of publicity. It got national publicity. It got international publicity ... There\u2019s probably no place in the State of Maryland where this case could be removed to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the court decided that removal was appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">Due process requires that all parties receive a trial by an impartial trier of fact free from outside influences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">In the current matter, there [has] been expensive, negative publicity alleged [to] have occurred, including but not limited to the 46 examples attached as exhibits to Defendant\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">Most of the publicity was critical to the Defendants, including statements alleged to have been made by high-ranking public officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-11\">There were demonstrations held in the city, demanding that the Defendants be terminated and prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-12\">For these reasons, this Court believes that the moving parties have met the requirements of Maryland Rule 2[-]505, and it is reasonable to believe that Voir Dire will not provide adequate measures to permit an impartial trial in Baltimore City. And, therefore, it will grant the Motion for removal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Pursuant to the Rule, this Court will refer this matter to the Circuit Administrative Judge, to decide which County Circuit Court this matter should be sent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The same day, Judge Murdock signed an order implementing her ruling and Administrative Judge Marcella A. Holland ordered the case transferred to the Circuit Court for Howard County.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">IV. Appellants\u2019 Removal Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">One of the first orders of business in the Howard County Circuit Court was the filing by appellants of a Motion for Removal, or in the Alternative, Motion for Transfer of Case Back to Baltimore City. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit signed by Dinkins stating her belief that \u201cneither I, nor any of the Plaintiffs in this case, can receive a fair and impartial trial in Howard County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The appellants\u2019 motion and memorandum argued that: 1) the transfer to Howard County did little to cure the alleged prejudicial publicity because that subdivision was served by the same media outlets as Baltimore City; 2) the jury pool in Howard County would not be representative of the jurisdiction from which the case was removed because Baltimore City\u2019s population was 65% African-American, while Howard County was 18% African-American;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 3) the true purpose of appel-lees\u2019 transfer was to find \u201ca more racially favorable venue\u201d in violation of federal- and state constitutional requirements; 4) transfer of the case out of Baltimore pursuant to Md. Rule 2-505(b) violated due process because the rule does not \u201crequire a hearing nor does it require that the Administrative Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>give a reason for the selection of the county to which the case is to be removed.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Appellees opposed the transfer motion\u2014contending that: 1) appellants\u2019 claim of racial discrimination was \u201cpure conjecture and wholly unsupported by any fact\u201d;<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 2) they have not indicated that pre-trial publicity would impair their ability to obtain a fair trial; 3) the Maryland Rules did not permit a transferee court \u201cto act as a quasi-appellate court and review the decision of the transferor court\u201d; and 4) appellants should have requested that Administrative Judge Holland reconsider her decision to select the Howard County forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">After an August 6, 2009 hearing, Judge Diane Leasure denied the appellant\u2019s motion. Specifically, she noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">Well, obviously, what needs to be shown is that the parties in this case, the Plaintiffs are making the request, cannot receive a fair and impartial jury verdict in Howard County. And I just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s been shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">The publicity issue can certainly be addressed as a more\u2014 we have high profile cases here too that get a lot of publicity, and more often than not, that\u2019s addressed adequately during the voir dire process where those kind of questions are asked, jurors are then, you know, questioned further as to their ability to be fair and impartial. I mean, that is part of the voir dire process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">So, on the basis of publicity alone, I don\u2019t believe the case should be removed further. As far as reviewing the decision of the judges in Baltimore City, both the, I guess the trial judge, Judge Murdoch, and the administrative judge\u2014 Circuit Administrative Judge, Judge Holland, clearly those decisions were made based upon what was presented to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>And, the Circuit Administrative Judge\u2014because I\u2019m the counterpart in our jurisdiction, clearly the rules provide that the obligation of that person once a judge determines the case, should be removed for a pretrial publicity or other reasons, then determines to which jurisdiction it should go. And there is nothing in the rules, that requires [a] hearing, and you\u2019ve acknowledged that from the Plaintiff[s\u2019] standpoint, but that process is an administrative function. But now that the case is here, and I don\u2019t think the <em>Batson </em>argument should be extended to this situation. Clearly, that can be brought up at voir dire, either challenging the, you know, the array itself, or certainly, any strikes that the Defendants make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">So, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any evidence presented that a fair and impartial jury cannot be found in Howard County, so I\u2019m going to deny the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On January 11, 2010, just before voir dire of potential jurors began, appellants\u2019 counsel renewed the motion to transfer the case back to Baltimore City.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Jury Commissioner, Steve Merson, was called as a witness and testified that as to racial composition, the array was \u201ca typical Howard County jury panel.\u201d After argument, the court denied the renewed challenge to the removal from the City. After the jury, which included one African American, was seated, appellants\u2019 counsel again objected to the racial composition of the jury and the motion was again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">After a seven-day trial, Judge Leasure granted appellants\u2019 motion for judgment against appellees Colburn and Hayes with respect to the false imprisonment and false arrest of Gerard.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court also granted Detective Bennett\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>for judgment as to all counts and dismissed two counts against Officer Grimes. The remainder of the case went to the jury along with the damage claim with respect to Officers Colburn and Hayes. The jury found in favor of the City and its officers and awarded no damages against Officers Colburn and Hayes. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">I. Was there a reasonable ground to believe appellees could not receive a fair and impartial trial in Baltimore City?</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">At the outset, we are called upon to determine whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City correctly determined that appellants\u2019 case should have been <em>removed </em>from the City.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is the relatively rare civil case where defendants successfully obtained removal, in large part, on the basis of prejudicial publicity. <em>Cf. Hirschkop v. Snead, </em>594 F.2d 356, 373 (4th Cir.1979) (\u201cNo decision reversing the judgment in a civil action because of prejudicial publicity has been called to our attention.\u201d) Nevertheless, the right to a fair and impartial trial is no less deserving of protection in a civil setting as it is in the criminal courts. <em>See In re San Juan Star Co., </em>662 F.2d 108 (1st Cir.1981), a federal civil rights action alleging a police conspiracy to kill two suspected terrorists, where a federal appellate court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">We recognize that criminal trials might be thought to present even more compelling fair trial rights than do civil trials, but think that the importance and potential effects of this case sufficient to justify scrupulous care for those rights here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 118. <em>See also </em>Robert Trager, Sandra Moriarty &amp; Tom Duncan, <em>Selling Influence: Using Advertising to Prejudice the Jury Pool, </em>83 Neb. L.Rev. 685, 711 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">A. Legal Framework / Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Removal of a civil case for local prejudice is governed by two provisions: Article IV, \u00a7 8(c) of the Maryland Constitution and Md. Rule 2-505(a)(1) and (b). Section 8(c) of Article IV of the Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">In all other cases of presentment and indictment, and in all suits or actions at law or issues from the Orphans\u2019 Court pending in any of the courts of law in this State which have jurisdiction over the cause or case, in addition to the suggestion in writing of either of the parties to the cause or case that the <em>party cannot have a fair and impartial trial </em>in the court in which the cause or case may be pending, it shall be necessary for the party making the suggestion to make it satisfactorily appear to the court that the suggestion is true, or that <em>there is reasonable ground for </em>the same; and thereupon the court shall order and direct the record of the proceedings in the cause or case to be transmitted to some other court, having jurisdiction in the cause or case, for trial. The right of removal also shall exist on suggestion in a cause or case in which all the judges of the court may be disqualified under the provisions of this Constitution to sit. The court to which the record of proceedings in such suit or action, issue, presentment or indictment is transmitted, shall hear and determine that cause or case in the same manner as if it had been originally instituted in that Court. The General Assembly shall modify the existing law as may be necessary to regulate and give force to this provision,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agl-dedup-0\">(emphasis added). Md. Rule 2-505(a)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">In any action that is subject to removal, and on issues from the Orphans\u2019 Court, any party may file a motion for removal accompanied by an affidavit alleging that the party cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in the county in which the action is pending. If the court <em>finds that there is reasonable ground to believe that the allegation is correct, it shall order that the action be removed for trial to a court of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>another county. </em>Any party, including a party who has obtained removal, may obtain further removal pursuant to this Rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">(emphasis added). In addition, subsection (b) of this rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\"><em>The Circuit Administrative Judge of the court ordering removal shall designate the county to which the case is to be removed. </em>When the court orders that the action be removed for trial to a court of another county, the clerk shall transmit the record to that court within five days from entry of the order, unless the court ordering the removal extends the time. The record shall consist of all the original papers filed in the action and copy of the docket entries.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATg\">(emphasis added). In <em>Hoffman v. Stamper, </em>155 Md.App. 247, 284, 843 A.2d 153 (2004), <em>aff'd. in part and rev\u2019d. in part, </em>385 Md. 1, 867 A.2d 276 (2005), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">The threshold question for the circuit court on a motion for removal\u2014whether there is reasonable ground to believe the allegation that the moving party cannot receive a fair and impartial trial in the county in which the action is pending\u2014 is a mixed question of law and fact concerning a constitutional right. Accordingly, on appeal, we review that threshold determination <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The party seeking removal bears the burden to show that he or she \u201chas been prejudiced by adverse publicity and that the <em>voir dire </em>examination ... will not be adequate to assure ... a fair and impartial trial by jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284-85, 843 A.2d 153.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In addition, the defendant \u201cmust show not only that there has been publicity about this case but also that there is reason to believe that the publicity about him will prejudice his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 843 A.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Whether we gauge the removal decision under an abuse of discretion standard or <em>de novo </em>as a mixed question of fact and law, we believe that Judge Murdock correctly determined that removal from Baltimore City was justified under Article IV, \u00a7 8 and Md. Rule 2-505. The publicity about this case, recounted on pp. 5-12, <em>supra, </em>was pervasive, negative, continuing and prejudicial. News stories themselves described the extent of media saturation and the public outrage stirred up by the police arrests of Gerard and Dinkins. <em>See </em>pp. 7 &amp; 8, <em>supra. </em>Even appellants\u2019 counsel, at the September 23, 2008 removal hearing, noted that the case had gotten such national and international publicity that there was probably \u201cno place in the State of Maryland where this case could be removed to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Although appellees were rarely, if ever, mentioned by name, the accounts and commentary were specific to the officers involved. Their actions spurred demonstrations, denunciations and demands for a City boycott, all duly reported in the media. High-ranking public officials, including their ultimate employer, the Mayor, criticized the officers\u2019 conduct; and community activists called for their ouster, sometimes in the most fiery of terms (\u201cthugs in uniforms\u201d and \u201cIf they want war, they\u2019ll have war\u201d). In various accounts, the arrests were portrayed as a symbol of deteriorating pohce/community relations and Gerard was described as traumatized and a victim of a civil rights violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Appellants contend that there was no reason for Judge Murdock to change her prior ruling on the removal motion or alter her earlier conclusion that <em>voir dire </em>was the proper remedy to deal with the issue of prejudicial publicity. However, the media reaction to the \u201claughing police dispatcher\u201d transcript, <em>see </em>pp. 11-12, <em>supra, </em>undoubtedly made it clear to the court that prejudicial publicity would continue to occur.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Moreover, the court\u2019s initial ruling was hardly a stinging rejection of the removal request, as the judge noted that \u201cthis is a tough one\u201d and that she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the Mayor\u2019s public statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The court\u2019s September 23, 2008 decision to order removal of the ease from Baltimore City relied on more than \u201cextensive negative publicity.\u201d It also explained that waiting for <em>voir dire </em>would not be appropriate in light of statements made by high-ranking city officials<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and because \u201c[tjhere were demonstrations held in the City demanding that the Defendants be terminated and prosecuted.\u201d This finding of a Cityunique source of continuing local resentment is a reasonable ground to believe that appellants could not receive a fair trial in Baltimore City even with the assistance of <em>voir </em>dire. It is also a response to appellants\u2019 argument before Judge Leasure that any prejudice would not be cured by a transfer from the City because the same media outlets served both Howard County and Baltimore City. Clearly, a Howard County jury would not have been as affected by statements of public officials from another jurisdiction or the community reaction in the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">For these reasons, we conclude there was no error in Judge Murdock\u2019s decision to remove the case from Baltimore City or in Judge Leasure\u2019s decision not to return the case to its original venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">II. Did equal protection require the case to be transferred to a jurisdiction with the city\u2019s racial demographics?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Under the banner of due process, appellants argued to Judge Leasure<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that the true purpose of appellees\u2019 attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>to remove the ease from Baltimore City was to unconstitutionally obtain \u201ca more racially favorable venue.\u201d They also contended that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson </em>applied to racially discriminatory venue transfers and that if a removal out of the City was to be ordered, appellants were entitled to venue in a jurisdiction comparable to the City\u2019s racial demographics. <em>See </em>n. 16, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Although no Maryland case addresses these issues, out-of-state authorities and commentaries are plentiful, typically in the criminal arena.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>See e.g., House v. Hatch, </em>527 F.3d 1010 (10th Cir.2008); <em>Mallett v. Bowersox, </em>160 F.3d 456 (8th Cir. 1998); <em>Maryland v. Brown, </em>426 F.2d 809 (4th Cir.1970); <em>U.S. v.

L.Rev. 131 (1973-74).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Supreme Court cases are not conclusive. <em>See Mallett v. Missouri, </em>494 U.S. 1009, 110 S.Ct. 1308, 108 L.Ed.2d 484 (1990) (opinion of Justices Marshall and Brennan dissenting from the denial of certiorari) (\u201cJust as state prosecutors may not use preemptory challenges to exclude members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury ... state trial courts may not treat removal of the trial to accomplish the same result by another means\u201d); <em>Mobile v. Bolden, </em>446 U.S. 55, 77, n. 28, 100 S.Ct. 1490, 64 L.Ed.2d 47 (1980) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he fact that there is a constitutional right to a system of jury selection that is not purposefully exclusionary does not extend a right to a jury of any particular racial composition\u201d). <em>See also House v. Hatch, </em>527 F.3d at 1021 (\u201cNo Supreme Court case holds that venue transfers are subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Those federal and state courts that have addressed the issue appear divided, although more decline to apply <em>Batson </em>to venue transfer decisions. <em>Compare, House v. Hatch, </em>527 F.3d at 1022 <em>(Batson\u2019s </em>application to venue transfer is \u201cnot clearly established law\u201d); <em>Mallett v.

Becze, </em>638 N.E.2d 828, 833-35 (Ind.App. 1994). <em>But see, James v. State, </em>613 N.E.2d 15, 29 (Ind.1993) (In a change of venue case, \u201cwe need not decide ... whether [the <em>Batson </em>] analogy could ever be appropriate.... \u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">We need not decide whether <em>Batson </em>should be applied to allegations of a racially discriminatory venue transfer, because even under the <em>Batson </em>methodology, appellants\u2019 two-pronged discrimination attack would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">If <em>Batson </em>were applicable here, once a prima facie case has been made by showing that members of the party\u2019s race were substantially under-represented on a venire selected under a practice providing the opportunity for discrimination, <em>Douglas, </em>837 F.Supp. at 822, then:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Y\">the burden shifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion.... The State cannot meet this burden on mere general assertions that its officials did not discriminate or that they properly performed their official duties.... Rather, the State must demonstrate that permissible racially neutral selection criteria and procedures have produced the monochromatic result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\"><em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 94, 106 S.Ct. 1712 (quotations omitted). Appellants alleged both an intentionally discriminatory act in appellees\u2019 attempt to escape an African-American jury in Baltimore City and a racially discriminatory effect in the transfer of the case to a majority white jurisdiction with an African-American population of only 18%.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Applying essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tial components<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> of the <em>Batson </em>formula to the charge of purposeful discrimination, we note that a race-neutral reason for the transfer clearly existed, <em>viz., </em>the presence of highly prejudicial publicity and local prejudice that jeopardized ap-pellees\u2019 right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>See State v. House, </em>978 P.2d at 993-94; <em>Martin, </em>679 N.E.2d at 146. Moreover, appellees\u2014who are not \u201cthe State\u201d for <em>Batson </em>purposes\u2014 could not have guaranteed that the case would be transferred to a majority white jurisdiction. That decision was not within their control. The choice of Howard County was made by the Circuit Administrative Judge for Baltimore City, presumably based on racially neutral administrative concerns. <em>See </em>pp. 28-29 and n. 37, <em>infra. </em>Thus, appellants could not have made a case for purposeful discrimination by either appellees or the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The discriminatory effect claim, which was made only in Howard County, fares no better. Appellants have failed to show that selection of the transferee forum by the administrative judge provided an \u201copportunity for discrimination\u201d or that it was not based on \u201cpermissible racially neutral selection criteria.\u201d Ultimately, appellants\u2019 discriminatory effect contention is reduced to an asserted right to a transferee court jury with a demographic or racial composition comparable to that of the transferor jurisdiction. Even courts that apply <em>Batson </em>to venue transfers have not recognized such a right. <em>See State v. House, </em>978 P.2d at 995. See also p. 25, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that there was no equal protection violation in the transfer of appellants\u2019 case from Baltimore City or the trial of the case in Howard County.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>III. Did Due Process require appellants to be heard in the transferor court on the designation of a new venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In the Howard County Circuit Court, appellants argued that they had a due process right to a hearing in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the designation of the transferee jurisdiction and an attendant right to have the Administrative Judge give a reason for the selection of the new venue.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Judge Leasure ruled that the Maryland Rules did not require a hearing and that designation of the new venue was \u201can administrative function.\u201d Without a doubt, this is a correct reading of Md. Rule 2-505(b), which states that in ordering removal, the Circuit Administrative Judge \u201cshall designate\u201d the county to which the case is to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Until July 1, 2001, the trial judge designated the circuit court where the case was to be removed with the approval of the Circuit Administrative Judge. <em>See </em>former Md. Rule 16-101, 27 <em>Md. Reg. </em>1908, 1951 (Oct. 20, 2000). If a case was to be removed to a jurisdiction outside the circuit, the administrative judge of the transferor circuit was obliged to make inquiry of his or her transferee counterpart \u201cconcerning the trial calendar and judicial work loads of any Court to which it is contemplated the action may be removed and give consideration to the recommendations of such Circuit Administrative Judge.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Prior to the 2001 rule change, Maryland caselaw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>described the transferor\u2019s court\u2019s discretion in broad terms. <em>See, e.g., Middleton v. Morgan, </em>263 Md. 154, 158, 282 A.2d 94 (1971) (\u201cIt is established that the trial court must and does exercise discretion in selecting the court to which a case will be removed....\u201d); <em>Smith v. Pearre, </em>96 Md.App. 376, 385, n. 4,625 A.2d 349 (1993) (\u201cWhere to move a case is within the exercise of judicial discretion.... \u201d). However, merely because the Circuit Administrative Judge exercised some degree of discretion under both the old rule (and does so under the new rule), does not mean that a hearing is required on the selection of the jurisdiction where the case was to be removed. <em>See Smith v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>169 Md.App. 286, 302, 900 A.2d 301 (2006) (concluding that Md. Rule 2-311(f) did not require a court to hold a requested hearing on the transfer of a case to another jurisdiction because <em>oifoj-um non </em>conveniens).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Just because Rule 2-505(b) does not contemplate or require a hearing on the designation of the transferee forum does not answer the due process question appellants have raised. At least one court has said in a criminal case that its rules \u201cimpliedly [require] the court in which the action is pending to conduct an evidentiary hearing before deciding where the cause should be transferred,\u201d because \u201c[i]f <em>rule 812 </em>is construed to authorize a determination of new venue ex parte a grave doubt of its constitutionality upon due process attack would arise.\u201d <em>McGown v. Superior Court of Fresno County, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 648, 142 Cal.Rptr. 262, 264 (1977).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>decisions that have considered the issue of the right to a hearing on the selection of the transferee jurisdiction have dealt with procedures and fact patterns different than what we find here. <em>See Gotbaum v. City of Phoenix, </em>617 F.Supp.2d 878, 880 (D.Ariz.2008) (denying request for oral argument on transfer motion); <em>Mallett v. State, </em>769 S.W.2d at 80 (rejecting contention that defendant was denied the lack of opportunity to be heard when he \u201cwas able to, and did express, his venue preferences as well as his concern that there be potential black jurors\u201d); <em>Aranda v. State, </em>736 S.W.2d 702 (Tex.Crim. App.1987) (trial court decision to order a change of venue <em>sua sponte </em>was not improper where the defendant was given notice that the court would hear evidence on the proposed transfer).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">We find these authorities of little help in deciding appellants\u2019 due process question. First, this is not a criminal case where the stakes are higher for the defendant, whose life or liberty may be at stake. Rather, this is a civil case and the U.S. Supreme Court has noted: \u201cDue process does not, of course, require that the defendant in every civil case actually have a hearing on the merits.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 378, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Second, while under certain circumstances a plaintiff in a civil case may have a \u201cvested property right in a cause of action,\u201d <em>Dua v. Comcast, </em>370 Md. 604, 633, 805 A.2d 1061 (2002), he or she cannot be said to have a property right deserving of due process protection in the composition of the jury in a transferee jurisdiction. <em>See Mobile v. Bolden, </em>446 U.S. at 77, n. 24, 100 S.Ct. 1490. Third, appellants\u2019 primary purpose in seeking a hearing on the proposed venue would have been to argue their entitlement to transfer to a majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>African-American jurisdiction, a right which has repeatedly been rejected by the courts. <em>See </em>p. 25, <em>supra. </em>Fourth, given this lack of entitlement and the decidedly administrative nature of the factors at play in the Circuit Administrative Judge\u2019s selection, it is not clear what purpose would have been served by the hearing. <em>See </em>pp. 28-29, and n. 37, <em>supra. </em>Finally, in this case, appellants did have a hearing before Judge Leasure on the allegedly erroneous transfer and the inappropriateness of the Howard County venue. Moreover, as long as the transferee court has the power to hear and act on a contention, such as that made by appellants in the trial court, that they could not have obtained a fair trial in Howard County, this sufficiently protects the parties\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that appellants were not denied procedural due process by the lack of a hearing before the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the selection of Howard County as the transferee venue.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

At that time, Ms. Dinkins pulled from my grasp in a violent manner and sat down on a chair while stating, \u201cYou ain't touching me you white mother f[\u00ae *]ker.\u201d Not wishing for a physical confrontation with Ms. Dinkins, I allowed her to stay seated until our investigation was completed. At that time, I again informed her that she was under arrest. Ms. Dinkins was handcuffed and transported for processing.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\">. Television stations carried images of the dirt bike.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">. Some of the officers involved in the arrests were white and others, like Dinkins and her family, were African-American.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">. The <em>Examiner </em>ran a critical editorial the same day. Its website collected earlier news stories on the arrest under the caption: \"Read all about Gerard's ordeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">. The Complaint and Demand for a Jury Trial, among other things, asserted two counts of violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, two counts of false arrest, two counts of false imprisonment, two counts of battery, and two counts of assault. Each count sought $3 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Appellees filed an answer essentially denying the allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b376-8\">. Appellees\u2019 counsel later said at argument in the circuit court that there were \"1340 hits\u201d on the Internet discussing the case, \"all of it negative, all of it prejudicial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b376-9\">. Later, in support of the officers\u2019 motion, appellees\u2019 counsel argued that a \"different jurisdiction\u201d would satisfy the officers\u2014\"Baltimore County, hypothetically, would even be sufficient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b376-10\">. None of the other officers filed a separate affidavit, an omission not challenged by appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\">. Attached to appellants\u2019 response were various exhibits, including transcripts of Dinkins' 311 call to City Police and of police radio communications about Gerard\u2019s arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b378-10\">. A July 31 <em>Examiner </em>article contained the following exchanges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-11\">\"He\u2019s getting locked up,\u201d Colburn said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-12\">\"Good,\u201d the dispatcher responded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-13\">Colburn then told the dispatcher he will go the scene to \"handcuff the kid.\u201d The dispatcher then started to laugh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-14\">Documents produced by the defense also indicate that Sgt. Colburn and Officer Hayes made \"some type of a bet as to whether or not they could lock up a 7-year-old,\u201d according to court records.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b379-13\">. Appellees\u2019 memorandum accused appellants of placing \"clearly irrelevant\u201d transcripts \"in furtherance of the persistent scheme to use the press to taint the jury pool.\u201d In their memorandum, appellants said that they \"take issue with the Defendants' offensive accusations\u201d and that \"[t]he facts in this case ... speak for themselves.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">. The latter order was not docketed until October 6, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b380-10\">. Appellants later argued that their discrimination argument was supported by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), which held that equal protection was violated by the prosecution\u2019s use of race-based preemp-toiy strikes of jurors. Their counsel also observed: \"We would submit that there is only one other county that approaches on a statistical basis in African-American population comparable to Baltimore City, and that would be Prince George's County.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b381-10\">. At a hearing on their motion, appellants argued that this rule itself \"does not comport with due process.\u201d This contention led Judge Leasure to observe: \"Well, it may be an issue for the rules committee. I don't know.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b381-11\">. They pointed to the 2008 vote totals in Howard County for the presidential candidacy of Barack Obama.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b382-8\">. Appellants\u2019counsel observed: \"I\u2019m not an expert, but it appears as if there were five African Americans out of a jury panel of fifty individuals.

Specifically, the court found that Gerard\u2019s warrantless arrest by these two officers, who were not present during the alleged misdemean- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>or, was not authorized by statute, <em>viz. </em>Md.Code (2001 and 2008, 2008 Repl.Vol.), Criminal Procedure Article, \u00a7 2-202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b383-10\">. Appellees noted a protective cross-appeal, which they later withdrew.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">. Issues raised by the <em>transfer </em>of the case to the Circuit Court for Howard County will be considered in Parts II and III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. The history of subsection (b) of Md. Rule 2-505 is discussed in Part III of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b385-10\">. In <em>Simms v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 515, 518, 433 A.2d 1199 (1981), this Court said that a party moving for a change of venue carries \u201ca heavy burden\u201d of satisfying the court that there is so great a prejudice against him that he or she cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. There were other instances in the record of negative publicity about the officers that appeared even without a stimulus. For example, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>story about the City crime rate discussed Gerard's arrest and an \u201canniversary\" account of the arrest contained an extremely unfavorable portrayal of the events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b387-10\">. Undoubtedly, appellants, as they attempted in Howard County, would have tried to call Mayor Dixon as a witness in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">. Prior to removal, these constitutional claims were not presented to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Thus, appellees argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>transferee court could not have entertained them or reviewed the actions of the transferor court. Because of our disposition of the issues in this case, we need not decide this question. <em>But cf. Nace v. Miller, </em>201 Md.App. 54, 28 A.3d 737 (2011) (In a <em>fomm non conveniens </em>setting, .a transferee court is not prevented from reviewing a motion to re-transfer to the transferor court.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\">. By invoking <em>Batson, </em>appellants were essentially making an equal protection claim, not one premised on a violation of substantive due process. Their broad assertion of a violation of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, <em>see </em>n. 1, <em>supra, </em>and the tenor of their arguments, necessarily reflected an equal protection claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. While many of the authorities discuss <em>Batson </em>and equal protection, they also wrestle with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s requirement that a jury in a criminal case reflect a fair cross section of the community. Obviously, this latter issue is not presented in this civil case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b389-5\">. Our research discloses that only the courts in Indiana have considered this issue in a civil case. <em>See Martin v. Amoco Oil Co., </em>679 N.E.2d 139 (Ind.App.1997), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>698 N.E.2d 1191, <em>aff'd. </em>696 N.E.2d 383 (Ind.1998); and <em>Osmulski v. Becze, </em>638 N.E.2d 828 (Ind.App.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">. Some legal commentators have read <em>Batson </em>as authorizing if not requiring courts to take racial demographics into account in ordering venue transfers. <em>See e.g., </em>Kougasian, <em>supra, </em>at 550 and Duffy, <em>supra </em>at 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. Appellant's discriminatory effect argument is premised on gross population numbers. <em>Douglas, </em>837 F.Supp. at 817, n. 7 notes the argument that an equal protection claim with respect to a discriminato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ry venue should be based on statistics of the eligible population for jury service, not gross population statistics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">. We need not address all of the factors under the <em>Batson </em>test, because it is clear that appellants cannot show the decisive elements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\">. Other than a legally insufficient \"numbers\u201d argument, appellees do not appear to contend that they could not have obtained (or did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>obtain) a fair and impartial trial in Howard County. Even if asserted, we find that the record would not support such a charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\">. This contention was not made to either Administrative Judge Holland or Judge Murdock.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\">. Some 140 years ago, the Court of Appeals identified the following factors as governing the discretion of the transferor court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">[lit is eminently proper that there should be a large discretion reposed in the Judges as to the Courts to which the record should be transmitted. Expedition of trial, convenience to the parties concerned, and witnesses, economy, as well as various other matters, often, and most generally do, enter into the considerations that influence the discretion of the Judges in selecting the Court to which to transmit the record for trial; and no construction would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>beneficial to the public that would restrict or preclude such considerations in a large proportion of the removals that occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>Kimball v. Harman, </em>34 Md. 401, 406 (1871). <em>Jones v. State, </em>185 Md. 481, 486, 45 A.2d 350 (1946) added another important consideration: \"[I]t is the duty of the court to order a removal of the record to some jurisdiction where the jury will not be prejudiced.\u201d Although these factors are not set forth in Md. Rule 2-505(b), they are clearly still controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. <em>But see, People v. Stanley, </em>10 Cal.4th 764, 42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481, 496 (1995) (An evidentiary hearing is not required where there were no factual issues to be resolved before determining the place to which the case would be transferred).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\">. One author has said that \"a motion for change of venue is not effective unless the defendant has knowledge of the transferee county in advance of deciding whether to move for a change of venue.\u201d <em>Change of Venue in Criminal Cases, supra, </em>at 154.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">. The same is obviously true of a plaintiff or a party opposing a motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b395-13\">. For the same reasons discussed above, there was no due process right offended when the Circuit Administrative Judge in Baltimore City did not specify the reasons for the selection of Howard County. Quite obviously those reasons were grounded in the neutral criteria associated with judicial administration, such as workload, convenience, etc. <em>See </em>pp. 28-29 and n. 37, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
