On July 3, 2001, the court entered judgment in favor of Friolo in the amount of $11,778.85 and awarded her attorney\u2019s fees of $4,711.00 and $1,552.00 in costs. The Court of Appeals vacated the judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees and costs and remanded the case, and on March 18, 2005, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>circuit court entered a second judgment awarding Friolo attorney\u2019s fees of $65,348.00. After both parties filed appeals, this Court issued an opinion vacating the judgment and remanding the case for further proceedings in circuit court, and the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision on March 5, 2008. On September 1, 2010, the circuit court entered judgment awarding Friolo attorney\u2019s fees of $5,000.00 and $2,277.00 in costs, and in a separate judgment ordered her to pay $7,575.00 for one-half of the special master\u2019s fee. Friolo now appeals these last two judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Questions Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Appellant presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Whether the circuit court erred as a matter of law or abused its discretion in awarding statutory attorney\u2019s fees and costs? [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">For the reasons set forth below, we enter modified judgment in favor of appellant as authorized by the Maryland Rules of appellate procedure. Md. Rule 8-604(e) (\u201cIn reversing or modifying a judgment in whole or in part, the Court may enter an appropriate judgment directly or may order the lower court to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">On February 4, 2000, appellant, Joy Friolo, joined by her husband, Victor Salazar, filed suit against appellees, Douglas Frankel and the Maryland/Virginia Med Trauma Group, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Court of Appeals described their allegations most succinctly in this case\u2019s first appeal, <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 505-06, 819 A.2d 354 (2003) <em>(\u201cFriolo I </em>\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Friolo and Salazar alleged that, in February, 1998, Dr. Frankel, a physician, hired Friolo as a medical biller, responsible for billing and collections, at a base salary of approximately $30,000. She averred that the practice, at the time, was a \u201cfailing venture,\u201d that, at some point, Frankel offered all of his employees a percentage interest \u201cin the practice,\u201d that she accepted his offer, and that, as a result, she and Frankel agreed that she would get a 5% ownership interest in the medical practice in exchange for her participation in \u201cevaluating and developing the practice.\u201d The goal, she said, was to make the practice worth $1 million by the end of 1999, to open four satellite offices within five years, and then to sell the entire practice in 2004. She was to get 5% of the sales price.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">Friolo claimed that she worked more than 40 hours a week to maximize the recovery of receivables but that she never received any overtime pay, that she often worked at home on monthly, quarterly, and annual reports but was not paid for that time, and that she and Salazar attended strategic planning meetings and made various recommendations with respect to the practice. Salazar, though not formally employed by Frankel, asserted that he frequently worked on Frankel\u2019s behalf by attending marketing meetings, assisting in the preparation of reports, and doing clerical work. Friolo claimed that, as part of her 5% ownership interest, she was to receive, on a monthly basis, 5% of all medical insurance reimbursements and collections received, but that she did not receive full payment of those amounts. Frankel, she said, had agreed to put this arrangement in writing by December 15,1998, but failed to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">Friolo went on bereavement leave from March 9 to March 25, 1999, but worked from March 26 to April 2. On Sunday, April 4, Frankel called her at home, complained that she had been rude to two patients and had not been doing her job properly, and discharged her....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Friolo and Salazar\u2019s complaint consisted of ten counts, including breach of express contract, breach of implied con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tract, unjust enrichment, fraudulent inducement, and violations of the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law (\u201cPayment Law\u201d), Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 <em>et seq. </em>of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article (\u201cLE\u201d), and the Maryland Wage and Hour Law (\u2018Wage and Hour Law\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-401 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The complaint requested monetary judgment including $50,000.00 for Friolo\u2019s lost interest in the practice, $9,441.00 of unpaid monthly receivable incentives,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and $9,070.00 of overtime, as well as $1,030.00 for Salazar\u2019s overtime pay, and statutory treble damages for all of these claims. In addition to those $128,164.00 in economic and statutory damages, Friolo and Salazar sought punitive and non-economic damages for the \u201cembarrassment and humiliation\u201d of appellees\u2019 alleged fraud. Finally, Friolo and Salazar\u2019s complaint sought reasonable statutory attorney\u2019s fees. (To that request we shall return, with much to say.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">As their case proceeded in circuit court, Friolo and Salazar whittled down their claims. Approximately five months prior to trial, the parties submitted a joint pretrial statement in which Friolo abandoned her claim to an interest in the practice, and Friolo consented at trial to dismissal of her counts alleging breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent inducement. Salazar conceded that he failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>prove his implied contract and unjust enrichment claims and consented to their dismissal, and the court dismissed his remaining claims for breach of contract and violations of the Wage and Hour Law and the Payment Law. Thus, the only issues submitted to the jury were Friolo\u2019s claims for breach of express contract, violation of the Payment Law, and violation of the Wage and Hour Law. The jury found that appellees had failed to pay $6,841.00 in bonuses and $4,987.85 in overtime pay. When asked how much Friolo should be awarded in additional damages that could be \u201cup to three times the amount\u201d of each claim, the jury answered \u201c$0.\u201d Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of Friolo on July 8, 2001, in the amount of $11,778.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">After the court entered judgment in her favor, Friolo filed a petition seeking attorney\u2019s fees and costs of $69,637.50. At that time, the Wage and Hour Law provided for attorney\u2019s fees as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u00a7 3-427. Action against employer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">(d) Costs.\u2014If a court determines that an employee is entitled to recovery in an action under this section, the court may allow against the employer reasonable counsel fees and other costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The Payment Law included a similar provision authorizing both attorney\u2019s fees and enhanced damages in the same circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">\u00a7 3-507.1. Recovery of unpaid wages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">(b) <em>Award and </em>costs.\u2014If, in an action under subsection (a) of this section, a court finds that an employer withheld the wage of an employee in violation of this subtitle and not as a result of a bona fide dispute, the court may award the employee an amount not exceeding 3 times the wage, and reasonable counsel fees and other costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">In her petition, Friolo argued that \u201c[i]n <em>Admiral </em>Mortgage[, <em>Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000) ], the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>of Appeals strongly suggested that Maryland courts generally follow the law and procedure developed under federal fee-shifting statutes,\u201d now well-known as the \u201clodestar method,\u201d which we explore at great length in our discussion, below. Friolo began her proffered lodestar calculation with hourly rates taken not from her contractual fee arrangement, but instead from a matrix used by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <em>Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>572 F.Supp. 354, 371 (D.D.C.1983), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>740 F.2d 1071, 238 U.S.App. D.C. 400 (D.C.Cir.1984). Friolo thus claimed that her lead counsel Leizer Goldsmith\u2019s time should be compensated at the rate of $305.00 per hour, time for his associates Karen Bower and Julie Martin at $250.00 per hour, and law clerk Regina Schowalter at $90.00 per hour. Friolo\u2019s petition then addressed the quantity of work performed and referred the court to its attached exhibits of \u201cdetailed time records documenting all the work of each attorney in this case based upon the contemporaneous computerized entries of each timekeeper.\u201d These time record documents are a ledger in which each line contains an attorney\u2019s name, a brief description of his or her task, and an amount of time devoted to that task. Out of several hundred time entries, only a handful are assigned to one or more discrete claims; the remainder do not differentiate among the particular facts or theories to which the work corresponded.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Friolo then explained the general quality and necessity of the work and fees she claimed, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">The work performed in this case, was necessary to obtain the excellent end result. This civil case included the usual, court appearances, depositions, written discovery and pretrial. Plaintiffs counsel developed their theory of the case, and were able to prevail ultimately at trial even while streamlining their presentation.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] Ms. Friolo had no choice but to pursue his [sic] claims all the way through a two-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>jury trial. Defendant never made any settlement offer even remotely close to the amount of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Friolo\u2019s petition acknowledged that not all of her claims were successful but maintained that her claims for breach of contract\u2014express and implied\u2014and unjust enrichment were factually and legally identical to her claim under the Payment Law, which went to the jury. Friolo conceded that the fraudulent inducement count \u201cwas the only count which she can really have been said to have lost,\u201d but she asserted that the time spent on that claim was \u201cnegligible, as is illustrated by Plaintiffs decision not to attempt to prove it at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Friolo also conceded \u201cthat some reduction may be appropriate, to account for her husband\u2019s lack of success\u201d because his claims were not related to the others by a \u201ccommon core of facts.\u201d Accordingly, Friolo proffered that \u201csince the unsuccessful claims figured at most in a few hours of preparation and trial, a reduction of no more than ten percent (10%) of the lodestar would amply protect defendants against paying fees for those claims,\u201d basing this assertion on her attorney\u2019s affidavit testimony to that effect. With that downward adjustment, Friolo maintained that she was entitled to 90% of the lodestar amount and so requested $69,637.50 in fees, plus all costs in the amount of $1,552.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Appellees opposed Friolo\u2019s petition and argued, first, that the Payment Law only sanctions fees if the court finds that wages were withheld in the absence of a <em>bona fide </em>dispute. Second, appellees argued that even if fees and costs were merited, they should be reduced by more than Friolo\u2019s ten percent concession because she and Salazar \u201cprevailed on 11.1% of their claims, and were awarded 33.3% of available damages,\u201d and because there is no support in Maryland for using the <em>\u201cLajfey </em>matrix\u201d to arrive at reasonable compensation rates. Finally, appellees noted that they offered Friolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>and Salazar $3,000.00 before trial to settle their claims and proffered that, \u201c[h]ad plaintiffs been willing to negotiate further, perhaps a settlement figure agreeable to both sides could have-been reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Friolo\u2019s reply argued that a <em>bona fide </em>dispute removes the possibility of fees under the Payment Law, but its presence could not affect her fee claim under the <em>Wage and Hour Law </em>because it is not an element of the latter\u2019s text. Friolo also argued that because a <em>bona fide </em>dispute was a necessary but insufficient statutory condition of treble damages, the jury verdict denying treble damages did not imply that a <em>bona fide </em>dispute existed as a matter of fact. Friolo further argued that the existence of a <em>bona fide </em>dispute is a defense that was foreclosed in this case -by estoppel and waiver. Finally, Friolo\u2019s reply rejected appellees\u2019 \u201cstatistical analysis\u201d of her success and argued, to the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">Defendants\u2019 contention that Plaintiffs result here is less than excellent is simply without merit. Admittedly, Plaintiff Salazar\u2019s claim for a little over $1,000.00 of minimum wage payments was unsuccessful. However, Ms. Friolo asked the jury to return a verdict on bonuses, and she was awarded all the bonuses earned while she was still employed with Defendants. With respect to overtime, she was awarded all the overtime pay she earned that was documented on Defendants\u2019 time sheets and authorized directly by Dr. Frankel. Thus, Ms. Friolo proved and won virtually her entire case, and the jury found Defendants liable on all claims submitted to it. This was an excellent victory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The circuit court convened a hearing on the matter and at its conclusion stated that the court must consider the case\u2019s novelty and difficulty and that the award must be \u201cappropriate and fair even when punitive.\u201d Without further analysis or elaboration, the court announced its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">What the Court is going to do by way of award is considering the Load Star [sic] language and the record in this matter, I deem it appropriate to\u2014this case is interesting in looking at the computations awarding 40 percent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the judgment plus the $1,500.00 in court costs so that comes out to $4,712.00 plus $1,500.00\u2014$6,212.00 is the counsel fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The circuit court entered a written order granting Friolo\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs that directed appellees to pay to Friolo $4,711.00, for attorney\u2019s fees, plus $1,552.00 in costs. Friolo appealed that judgment of fees and costs, and the Court of Appeals granted <em>certiorari </em>before proceedings in this Court had commenced. Friolo\u2019s brief in her first appeal presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">1. Whether the lodestar method for calculation of attorneys\u2019 fees should be applied in cases under Md.Code \u00a7 3-427 and Md.Code \u00a7 3-507.1? [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">2. Whether the trial court\u2019s decision not to calculate Friolo\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fee award by calculating the lodestar and making any necessary adjustments, and to instead award just 40% of the verdict, was clear legal error that must be reviewed by this Court <em>de novo, </em>and/or an abuse of discretion, compelling revision of the judgment and/or remand?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The facts set forth in Friolo\u2019s brief maintained her position that counsel achieved an \u201cexcellent\u201d result for her because, \u201cout of approximately $17,000 in unpaid wages and overtime ever even mentioned by Friolo or her counsel, the jury awarded $11,778.85.\u201d Friolo also posited\u2014curiously\u2014that \u201c[ajlthough the relevant statutes permit the jury to award up to three times the actual damages in addition to those actual damages, and Friolo sought and obtained instructions to that effect, <em>Friolo never claimed any entitlement to such additional damages.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Turning to her legal arguments, Friolo maintained that in <em>Admiral Mortgage, </em>\u201cthe Court of Appeals <em>strongly suggested </em>that Maryland courts follow the law and procedure developed under federal fee-shifting statutes when interpreting the attorneys\u2019 fees provisions included in the state wage and hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>laws.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Friolo further argued that \u201cin addition to the ubiquitous federal court precedent, the Court of Appeals had previously applied the lodestar methodology explicitly for cases adjudicated in the Maryland Courts under 42 USC \u00a7 1988,\u201d citing <em>Md. Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. Comm\u2019n v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 511 A.2d 1079 (1986). Friolo thus concluded that the circuit court had erred by failing to consider or discuss the lodestar factors set forth in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 430 n. 3, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), and by relying instead on \u201can entirely <em>irrelevant </em>factor, awarding fees based on a percentage of the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Concluding this point, Friolo argued that \u201csettled law holds that fees exceeding the amount of the judgment may nevertheless be reasonable,\u201d citing <em>Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986). Friolo then argued that the trial court had implicitly ruled that there was not a <em>bona fide </em>dispute over her wages. She contended that the court had \u201cawarded attorneys\u2019 fees of forty percent of the verdict under the Wage Payment Law ... (in addition to forty percent of the overtime verdict),\u201d which implied that recovery was proper under either\u2014or both\u2014statutes, and that the court therefore <em>must </em>have found that no <em>bona fide </em>dispute existed. Relying on these arguments, Friolo requested \u201cthat the decision of the Circuit Court be revised and amended, that a lodestar calculation be completed, and that she receive the award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $69,637.50, as incurred before and requested from the Circuit Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Friolo was joined in her appeal by four <em>amici curiae, </em>the D.C. Employment Justice Center, CASA of Maryland, Inc., and the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, collectively represented by counsel for the Public Justice Center, itself the fourth <em>amicus </em>curiae.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The Court of Appeals reported its opinion, cited above, as <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 819 A.2d 354 (2003). First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the Court rejected Friolo\u2019s primary argument, stating that \u201c[njowhere in <em>Admiral Mortgage </em>did we \u2018strongly suggest\u2019 that Maryland courts use the lodestar approach, and we certainly did not endorse, or even mention, any \u2018matrix\u2019 adopted by the U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia, or by anyone else, in applying a lodestar method.\u201d 373 Md. at 520, 819 A.2d 354. Nor, the Court continued, did it \u201cadopt a lodestar approach in <em>Crawford </em>as a matter of Maryland law and certainly not with respect to the statutes under consideration here.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Having established that the lodestar method was not, at that time, a positive matter of Maryland law, the <em>Friolo I </em>Court extolled its virtues and noted that, \u201c[Hollowing the Federal lead, a number of States have also employed the lodestar approach, with its accompanying adjustments, in setting attorneys\u2019 fees under fee-shifting statutes.\u201d 373 Md. at 527, 819 A.2d 354. The Court concluded that while Friolo was mistaken as to the force of its prior holdings, \u201cthe lodestar approach, with its adjustments, is the presumptively appropriate methodology to be used under the Wage and Hour Law and the Payment Law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354. At the conclusion of its opinion, the Court explained its decision to remand and provided guidance for further proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">We cannot conclude from this record that the trial court used [the lodestar method]; its remarks were far too ambiguous in that regard. Even if it intended to apply that approach, it gave no real indication of how and why it concluded that a fee equivalent to a 40% share of the recovery was appropriate\u2014why the $57,000 claimed should be reduced to that amount. One of the benefits of the lodestar approach is that it allows the court to make appropriate findings, so that the parties and any reviewing appellate court can follow the reasoning and test the validity of the findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">We shall remand the case for the court to engage in that analysis. Parroting what we said in <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc., </em>however, in directing that remand, \u201cwe do not suggest that the amount of the fee awarded ... in this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>inappropriate.\u201d <em>Admiral Mortgage, Inc., </em>357 Md. at 553, 745 A.2d at 1036.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] In addition to the other considerations that are part of the overall lodestar analysis, the court will need to consider that, with respect to the bonuses, awardable for fee-shifting purposes only under \u00a7 3-507.1, the jury made no predicate finding of a lack of a bona fide dispute. It will also need to determine whether the unsuccessful claims\u2014for fraud, for a 5% interest in the practice, Salazar\u2019s claims\u2014were truly related to the successful ones and, if not, to disallow all time expended on those claims. In considering the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged by counsel, the court is not bound to any \u201cmatrix\u201d adopted by out-of-State courts or agencies but must be guided by the nature of this case and the relevant issues it presented and by the rates or other fee arrangements common in the community for similar kinds of cases. Because the statutes allow only reasonable \u201ccounsel fees,\u201d the court must exclude any fees of non-lawyers. Charges for paralegals and legal interns are subsumed within the attorney\u2019s fees. Finally, the court should consider and give appropriate weight to any fee agreement that may have been made between Friolo and counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 819 A.2d 354 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The mandate in <em>Friolo I </em>remanding the case to circuit court marked only\u2014to borrow a phrase\u2014the end of the beginning. Upon returning to circuit court, Friolo supplemented her petition to demand an additional $58,172.50 in fees and $1,804.60 in costs for the <em>Friolo I </em>appeal and remand. Appel-lees opposed this supplemental petition, repeating their argument that\u2014as the Court of Appeals had now intimated\u2014 Friolo was largely unsuccessful at trial, adding that her appeal was only a <em>potential </em>success that depended on the outcome of proceedings on remand. Appellees further argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>fee-shifting statutes in question should not compensate plaintiffs for appeals that address only attorney\u2019s fees and costs, rather than enforcing or protecting their predicate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The circuit court convened another hearing to address both the original fee petition and its post-appellate supplements. However, the circuit court did not heed the Court of Appeals\u2019 admonitions and, on October 21, 2003, it issued an order that gave short shrift to the lodestar method. The circuit court\u2019s order included a \u201cdiscussion\u201d section that consisted only of the following paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">Using the lodestar system, this court determined a judgment of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. The lodestar system calculates a fee by determining the number of hours expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an \u201cinitial estimate\u201d of the value of the attorney\u2019s services. Hours that are excessive, unnecessary and redundant are excluded from calculation. The trial court may, in its discretion, eliminate specific hours or simply reduce the award to account for the limited success of particular parts of litigation as there is no precise rule or formula for making those determinations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">Without further elaboration, the court stated in its order: [Appellees] shall forthwith pay to [Friolo] and her counsel attorneys\u2019 fees in the lodestar amount of $65,348, which was calculated by multiplying [Friolo\u2019s] counsel\u2019s reasonable hourly rate of ($295 per hour and $200 per hour) by the reasonable number of hours [Friolo\u2019s] counsel expended in connection with this matter (194.4 hours at an hourly rate of $295; 35 hours at an hourly rate of $200).[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] This calculation takes into consideration the reasonable hours expended, the complexity of the litigation, the success rate of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>different parts of the litigation and the uniqueness of the issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Neither side was satisfied with this order, and both filed motions to alter or amend that the court denied in late 2008. In January, 2005, Friolo moved to have the court\u2019s order reduced to a judgment. On March 18, 2005, a new judge granted Friolo\u2019s motion and entered judgment against appel-lees in the amount of the order, $65,348.00, plus ten percent annual interest from the date of entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The circuit court\u2019s judgment of March 18, 2005, marked the beginning of another round of appeals, but this time it was <em>appellees </em>who initiated proceedings in this Court. Appellees argued that the award was \u201cexcessive on its face,\u201d that it violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d) 1.5, and that the court\u2019s ruling was impermissibly vague for failure to apply the lodestar factors mandated by <em>Friolo I. </em>Friolo responded to the direct appeal by arguing that the court was not presumptively limited by MRPC 1.5, that the court properly applied the lodestar analysis to the trial stage fee petition, and that the ruling and award were not impermis-sibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Friolo filed a limited cross-appeal in which she argued that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s denial of fees for counsel\u2019s successful appellate and post-remand work, and failure to provide any explanation whatsoever for that denial, constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d Furthermore, she argued that because of her \u201cexcellent result\u201d in <em>Friolo I, </em>she should be fully compensated for her appellate fees. Appellees responded that the circuit court did not need to explain its decision because \u201cFriolo [was] not entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees for appellate advocacy and advocacy on remand that did not result in any tangible benefit to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We reported our opinion of these matters as <em>Frankel v. Friolo, </em>170 Md.App. 441, 907 A.2d 363 (2006) <em>(\u201cFriolo II\u201d). </em>First, we held that appellees were correct in that the court erred as a matter of law, and we therefore vacated the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remanded the case so that the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>court could \u201capply the lodestar analysis and provide a clear explanation of the factors employed in arriving at its award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 907 A.2d 363. Turning to Friolo\u2019s cross-appeal, we held that \u201centitlement to \u2018reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u2019 under the remedial fee-shifting statutes at issue, LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1, does not extend to compensation for appellate and post-remand services where the plaintiffs judgment has been satisfied and the sole issue on appeal is counsel\u2019s dissatisfaction with the trial court\u2019s fee award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 907 A.2d 363. Concluding the opinion, we expressed our mounting frustration with the course of this litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">In summary, what is before us\u2014and what was before the circuit court\u2014is a garden variety wage and hour claim for unpaid overtime dressed up to appear to be something that it is not. It is a case that might well have fallen within the jurisdiction of the District Court and been prosecuted to success in substantially less time and at substantially less cost. The quality of Friolo\u2019s (and Salazar\u2019s) claims of fraud, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment were, upon presentation of their evidence, seen to be what they were\u2014 efforts to gild the lily and to elevate an overtime wage claim to something more substantial. The suggestion that counsel is entitled to fees in excess of $125,000 in obtaining a judgment of less than $12,000, where the client has been made whole, and where the additional fees have been generated only by counsel\u2019s continued litigation of its dissatisfaction with the fee awarded by the circuit court, is untenable. It is, in a word, outrageous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 456-57, 907 A.2d 363 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Friolo petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review our decision on the issue of appellate fees. The Court of Appeals granted the petition and issued its decision in <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 942 A.2d 1242 (2008) <em>(\u201cFriolo III </em>\u201d). In that appeal, Friolo argued that this Court erred because fees should be shifted for appellate work \u201cthat resulted in a significant clarification of Maryland law.\u201d Second, she repeated the same substantive points that she raised in her original fee petition to argue that her attorneys did not \u201cgild <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the lily\u201d and instead achieved an excellent result for her, again dismissing her abandoned claims as \u201cnot a major part of the litigation\u201d because they were not included in pretrial statements and were \u201clong since forgotten by five months before the time of trial.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, Friolo argued that it was <em>appellees </em>who had \u201cbaselessly prolonged this litigation at every turn by raising frivolous argument.\u201d Finally, Friolo maintained that our ruling \u201cimproperly encourages fee awards based on ratios of fees to damages, rather than the lodestar method advocated by [the Court of Appeals] in <em>Friolo I.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">After reviewing this case\u2019s lengthy procedural history, the <em>Friolo III </em>Court agreed with us that the trial court \u201cfailed to provide an explanation of how [the lodestar] factors affected the amount of the award, thereby erring as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Friolo III, </em>403 Md. at 454-55, 942 A.2d 1242. The Court therefore affirmed our decision to vacate the judgment rendered as part of appellees\u2019 direct appeal, but in doing so rejected the restrictions on appellate fees proposed in our disposition of Friolo\u2019s cross-appeal. The Court explained that appellate fee awards are justified by the same logic justifying trial fee awards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">It is as important to compensate counsel for ensuring that the trial court gets it right, even if to do so requires counsel to appeal, as it is to ensure that counsel is compensated for services rendered at trial. Indeed, it is a disincentive to the retention of competent counsel in these kinds of cases to deny recovery for successful appellate advocacy, including advocacy that demonstrates trial court error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 458, 942 A.2d 1242. The Court therefore held that a fee award should not depend on the appeal\u2019s particular relation to the underlying judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">Instead, the degree of success on appeal is a standard more congruent with the purpose of the Wage and Payment Law. Where a plaintiff obtains relief under either of these laws, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>obtains an award for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred while obtaining that relief, and later, on appeal, is successful in procuring an increase in those fees or is successful in correcting a trial court\u2019s error, the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred during the appeal should be considered as a part of the lodestar analysis required to be conducted on remand and, in that way, be capable of being couped by the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 460, 942 A.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The <em>Friolo III </em>Court concluded its opinion by surveying the case and providing general guidance to the circuit court upon remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">In the instant case, Friolo succeeded in obtaining the initial attorneys\u2019 fee award of $4,711, in vacating the judgment in <em>Friolo I </em>because this Court agreed with Friolo and held that the lodestar method is the proper analysis by which to determine attorneys\u2019 fees under the Wage and Payment Laws, and in obtaining a new, significantly higher fee award, in the amount of $65,348, on remand. While it is in the Circuit Court\u2019s discretion ultimately to determine Friolo\u2019s degree of success, which will be reflected in the lodestar calculus to determine the appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to award, one of the factors it must consider is the attorneys\u2019 fees that contributed to any success that the court determines the plaintiff had. Therefore, on remand, the Circuit Court must include in the lodestar analysis, appellate fees Friolo incurred in successfully challenging, based on the flawed methodology the Circuit Court used, the attorneys\u2019 fee awarded in this case. Only in that way will the fee award be consistent with the purpose behind both the Wage and Payment Laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">403 Md. at 461-62, 942 A.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Having concluded their second round of appeals, the parties returned yet again to circuit court, where a special master<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>heard the matter of fees and costs on October 13, 2009, issuing a report and recommendation on January 25, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The master\u2019s report began its lodestar analysis by noting that appellees had stipulated to the rates of $351.00 per hour for Leizer Goldsmith and $238.00 per hour for his associates Karen Bower and Julie Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Turning to the number of compensable hours, the master first recommended that Friolo not recover fees for her Payment Law claim because \u201cthere was no necessary condition precedent finding by the jury under [LE] \u00a7 3-507.1, that payment of the $6,841.00 was withheld without a bona fide dispute.\u201d The master thus recommended that \u201croughly 58% of the attorneys\u2019 hours expended at the trial court level to recover the total judgment should be discounted in any award of fees at the trial court level.\u201d However, the master also recommended that \u201cthe same discount should not apply at the appellate level because the appellate hours expended were reasonably the same whether it was a judgment of $4,937.00 or $11,778.00[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The master then undertook a detailed review of each stage of litigation and revised many of Friolo\u2019s claimed hours downward. At the trial level, the master found that the trial issues were simple and that two weeks of preparation, including nine hours of mock trial and fifty-one hours to prepare the fee petition, were excessive. The master therefore recommended reducing the trial lodestar for excessive work from $77,608.00 to $45,703.00, and again by fifty-eight percent to $19,195.26 \u201cbecause Friolo was not entitled to have the attorneys\u2019 time considered in the award of the $6,841.00 portion of the judgment.\u201d The master then applied each of the factors required by <em>Friolo I </em>and found that the award should be further reduced for two related reasons. First, the master noted that \u201c[t]he various Friolo and Salazar cumulative claims suing for $56,000.00 plus punitive damages, are balanced against the recovery of $11,778.00[.]\u201d Then, \u201ckeeping in mind the tension between the public policy behind fee-shifting and the limits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>[MRPC] 1.5,\u201d the master concluded that the trial fee award should be further reduced to $16,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Next, the master recommended reducing the appellate lodestar from $309,951.00 to $211,736.00 for \u201cexcessive\u201d work,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> noting that two factors merited further discussion. First, the master found that the case \u201craised some difficult and unsettled questions of law\u201d and that \u201c[w]hat started out as a \u2018routine wage case\u2019 resulted in complex appellate issues that Friolo\u2019s counsel addressed with a high degree of success\u201d that would normally merit an upward adjustment, but that the appellate lodestar amount in this case sufficed. Second, the master found that \u201c[wjhile no client would ever pay $200,000.00 to recover almost $5,000.00, ... [t]his simply is not a situation that produces a fee reasonable under both the [MRPC 1.5] and the statute,\u201d and therefore declined to make any further adjustments to the appellate lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The master then considered Friolo\u2019s demand for $2,277.00 in costs. While the master acknowledged that costs were essentially undisputed, he recommended that the court award Friolo all costs but deduct an equal amount from her fee award because the latter was \u201cvery substantial.\u201d Finally, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>master found that Friolo deposited a $3,500.00 retainer \u201cwith no delineation between costs and fees\u201d and thus assumed that the deposited funds were for fees. He therefore recommended a further reduction of the lodestar amount to account for that credit. In sum, the master recommended an award of $16,000.00 for trial fees, $205,959.00 in appellate fees, and $2,277.00 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Friolo and appellees filed a set of exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations, which the circuit court heard and decided on May 20, 2010. The court issued an oral ruling that reviewed the master\u2019s report in detail. First, the court held that because there was no indication that Friolo\u2019s agreement with her attorneys anticipated rate increases, the applicable hourly rate would be set by their initial retainer agreement at $295.00 per hour for Leizer Goldsmith and $200.00 per hour for his associates Karen Bower and Julie Martin. Second, the court further reduced the recommended amount of compensable hours, adopting the master\u2019s reasoning but disagreeing as to what was necessary for the relief granted, thereby arriving at a trial lodestar of $13,580.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Having computed a lodestar amount for trial work, the circuit court discussed a variety of factors that it believed justified deviation from that number. First, the court noted that Friolo\u2019s success at trial was severely limited relative to the amounts that she and Salazar originally demanded and that \u201cthe Court would feel much differently if Ms. Friolo had come in in the first place with her claim set out as it went to the jury, and that Dr. Frankel refused to pay.\u201d Second, the court contrasted the present case with one in which \u201cthe decision corrects across-the-board discrimination affecting a large class of employees.\u201d Third, the court cited to the indications in <em>Friolo I, II, </em>and <em>III, </em>that the amount of fees Friolo demanded for trial work appeared unreasonably large. Fourth, the court explained its concern that appellees did not possess the financial resources that the fee statute\u2019s drafters envisaged. For these reasons, the court recommended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the lodestar amount be reduced by fifty-eight percent to $5,704.00.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The circuit court next took up the issue of appellate fees, and it again reduced the master\u2019s recommended basis. In particular, the court found that significant amounts of time spent on Friolo\u2019s fee petitions were excessive because their accounting should have been done in the ordinary course of business, and that her counsel devoted excessive time to its appellate briefs and preparation where the legal issues were largely unchanged from the fee petitions to the appeals, and between <em>Friolo II </em>and <em>Friolo III. </em>Before announcing its appellate lodestar, the circuit court addressed whether the appeals were successful and noted that the public interest was well-protected by a number of <em>amici curiae. </em>The court further found that appellate fees could not be collected from Friolo because there was no agreement to that effect, and that any such agreement would have violated MKPC 1.5 as excessive and would have lacked a notice of liability suggested by <em>Friolo III, </em>403 Md. at 462 n. 14, 942 A.2d 1242,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> again stressing that no client would agree to such a fee to recover the amount adjudged. To that end, the court stated that it did not \u201csee any way that [Friolo\u2019s] retainer agreement reflects anything close to what counsel is asking for in this case or that anybody could agree to do that[,]\u201d and insisted that a litigant \u201cshould not be awarded a fee greater than he is contractually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>bound to pay[.]\u201d Finally, the court acknowledged that <em>Friolo II </em>vindicated a novel claim, but found that Friolo had all the while pursued an \u201cunreasonable\u201d fee award for trial work and that \u201c[her] success on this limited issue pales in comparison with the defendant\u2019s overall success in this case after the trial court\u2019s exhaustive], reconsideration of lodestar and the other issues.\u201d The circuit court then summarized and explained its ruling on appellate fees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">Having said all that, and recognizing that the issue regarding appellate fees was indeed one of first impression and one the plaintiff did win in the Court of Appeals, although with plenty of help from his amicus friends, the Court, if it had to make an award of appellate fees, would find counsel could have done what was required to prepare and argue Friolo 3 in 25 hours. At 295 an hour that\u2019s $7,375. However, over one half of the court\u2019s opinion was devoted to this Court\u2019s insufficient application of lodestar, an issue overwhelmingly won by the defendant in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">Therefore, if the Court would have to make an award in this case, I would reduce it by 50 percent and I would award $3,687.50. But in my discretion, and within my analysis of this case, I have determined not to make such an award. I would hope that without going through each of the 12 [lodestar] factors at each billing stage of [MRPC] 1.5, the appellate courts will recognize the analysis is subsumed in the Court\u2019s reasoning as set forth in this opinion. I believe that they plug in pretty clearly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">I decline to award even these modified appellate fees, because I\u2019m extremely distressed by what has been at the very least an over-gilding by the plaintiff of their lily. All the while the defendant has had to pay counsel to audit the plaintiffs inflated and unreasonable fees. This is true despite the defendant\u2019s far greater success at trial regarding the claims made by the plaintiff that the defendant was forced to defend and win\u2014the reasonable fee imposed by Judge Beard, although not pursuant to lodestar, with which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the plaintiff was dissatisfied, which this Court has increased only slightly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">This Court is confident that had Ms. Friolo\u2019s attorney made a demand at the outset in line with what the jury returned in this case\u2014that is, under $12,000\u2014counsel for the defendant would have been forced to recommend it to his client, and Ms. Friolo could have walked away with her money, probably without the need to even litigate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The circuit court therefore overruled Friolo\u2019s exceptions, sustained appellees\u2019 exceptions, and entered judgment against appellees and in favor of Friolo in the amount of $5,000.00 for attorney\u2019s fees and $2,277.00 in costs, plus ten percent annual interest. The court also entered separate judgments against Friolo and appellees, ordering each to pay $7,575.00 to the special master for his fees. Friolo noted a timely appeal of these judgments on June 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AU\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Ordinarily, we might be tempted to begin our discussion of this case with some comparison to a Dickensian plot, but as we near a decade of litigation in it, we will forego such witticisms and proceed directly to the heart of the matter, which is to determine whether the circuit court erred in adjudicating Friolo\u2019s petition for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Thanks to the three prior appellate decisions in this case, we know that where an award is warranted under LE \u00a7 3-427(d) or \u00a7 3-507.1(b), \u201cthe lodestar approach, with its adjustments, is the presumptively appropriate methodology to be used,\u201d <em>Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 529, 819 A.2d 354, and that the method entails the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">Under the lodestar approach ... the trial court will arrive at a useful starting point by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate. As a result, at that starting point, excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours should be ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>eluded, as well as hours that are not properly billed to one\u2019s client. An increase or decrease in fee adjustments can then be made, based on consideration of a host of factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Friolo II, </em>403 Md. at 453-54, 942 A.2d 1242 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted). The \u201chost of factors\u201d to be applied include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented; (3) the skill requisite to properly perform the legal service; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount of damages or back pay involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the \u201cundesirability\u201d of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\"><em>Friolo II, </em>403 Md. at 454 n. 8, 942 A.2d 1242 (citing <em>Johnson v.

While there are undoubtedly more factors that could be considered in deciding what is a reasonable fee, this case proceeded under that \u201cstandard\u201d set known as the <em>\u201cJohnson </em>factors.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Importantly, courts have stressed over and again the \u201cdegree of success,\u201d describing it variously as the \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201ccrucial\u201d factor in any lodestar analysis. <em>Friolo III, </em>403 Md. at 460, 942 A.2d 1242 (citing <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 440, 103 S.Ct. 1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">We note only one additional item in prelude to our analysis. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Friolo III:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"af-dedup-0\">[T]he goal of fee-shifting statutes in general is to ensure that individuals, when injured by violations, or threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>violations, of certain laws, have access to legal counsel by a \u201cstatutory assurance that [his or her counsel] will be paid a \u2018reasonable fee[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>[Friolo </em>I,] 373 Md. at 526, 819 A.2d at 369, quoting <em>Pennsylvania v.

Critical to the achievement of this goal is providing a mechanism, here, the fee shifting statute, and an incentive, based on a realistic expectation of reasonable compensation, for attorneys to agree to take on wage dispute cases, even where the dollar amount of the potential recovery may be relatively small. \u201cHence, if plaintiffs, such as [Friolo], find it possible to engage a lawyer based on [a fee-shifting statute], the purpose behind the fee-shifting statute has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Delaware Valley, </em>478 U.S. at 546, 106 S.Ct. at 3098.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Friolo II, </em>403 Md. at 457-58, 942 A.2d 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The statutes in question are designed to incentivize small claims by providing monetary compensation. Thus, the statutes implicitly adopt some standard economic tenets, including the assumption that plaintiffs will maximize their own wealth\u2014in all its tangible and intangible forms\u2014by choosing actions with the largest expected personal benefits, net of costs,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and that information about these costs and benefits is transmitted through prices. As such, these statutes are well-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>suited to economic analysis, which we employ in the discussion that follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Friolo argues that the circuit court erred in four ways when it ruled on her petition for attorney\u2019s fees under LE \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 427(d) and 3-507.1(b). First, Friolo argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in setting the rates of compensation for its lodestar analysis. Second, Friolo argues the circuit court improperly considered what a hypothetical plaintiff would pay for representation in the absence of fee-shifting statutes and, in doing so, erroneously subordinated those statutes to the limitations of MRPC 1.5. Relatedly, and third, Friolo argues that the court erroneously considered her liability to her attorney in determining a reasonable fee award. Fourth, Friolo argues that she was successful at trial and on appeal and that the court erred when it held, instead, that she persisted in bad faith by demanding an unreasonable fee award. Finally, Friolo urges us to decide these matters as ones of law and to enter judgment in her favor rather than prolong this litigation on remand. Our discussion addresses the issues in this same order\u2014that of increasing importance\u2014 and concludes that the circuit court erred as a matter of law as to each. Further, because this case resolves to a question of law and our analysis results in a certain proper amount, we shall vacate the existing judgments and enter modified judgment in favor of Friolo.

Rule 8-604(e) (\u201cIn reversing or modifying a judgment in whole or in part, the Court may enter an appropriate judgment directly or may order the lower court to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">A. The Hourly Rate</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">First, Friolo correctly argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in setting the rates for use in the lodestar calculation. Several courts have noted that the lodestar process is complicated by the fact that while it permits various adjustments to the lodestar amount, the mainstay factors \u201care subsumed within the initial calculation of hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 434 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <em>Friolo III, </em>403 Md. at 454 n. 8, 942 A.2d 1242. In this case, however, that serves to clarify our discussion because the two parts of the \u201cinitial calculation\u201d\u2014rate and hours\u2014subsume almost all of the traditional lodestar factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The very concept of hourly compensation inherently accounts for preclusion of other employment because it represents the attorney\u2019s \u201copportunity cost\u201d of time and labor.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Barrow v. Falck, 977 </em>F.2d 1100, 1105 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cJudges must stick to the market rate for the attorneys\u2019 time-that is to say, the opportunity costs of their time, the rate they could receive in other engagements.\u201d); Modern Dictionary for the Legal Profession (3d ed.2001) (defining \u201cOpportunity Cost\u201d as \u201cEconomic value of a benefit that is foregone when one alternative is selected rather than another\u201d). A reasonable rate fundamentally reflects the attorney\u2019s requisite skill, experience, and ability, which the court uses to ascertain comparable and customary fees in the relevant location for similar services.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Blum v. Stenson, </em>465 U.S. 886, 896 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984) (\u201c[T]he burden is on the fee applicant to produce satisfactory evidence ... that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\u201d). Naturally, this evaluation will include the awardee\u2019s existing fee agreement and the attorney\u2019s agreements with other clients, taking into account the length and nature of those professional relationships. <em>See Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 522 n. 2, 819 A.2d 354 (under <em>Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the \u201cfee agreed to by client is helpful in demonstrating attorney\u2019s fee expectations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Two factors are not inherently bound up in the fundamental existence of the rate, namely the time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, as well as the undesirability of the case. In <em>ex ante </em>fee negotiations, they would be incorporated into the rate as a premium, but a <em>ex post </em>lodestar analysis could equivalently apply that premium to the total amount of trial fees. <em>See Guam Soc\u2019y of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists v. Ada, </em>113 F.3d 1089, 1090 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cA district judge ... may not enhance the lodestar due to undesirability after he inflates the hourly rate to reflect undesirability.\u201d). In this case, we need not concern ourselves with that distinction because neither of these two factors, nor any others listed thus far, were in dispute. Rather, the parties in this case <em>stipulated </em>to a fee schedule that represented Friolo\u2019s attorneys\u2019 opportunity cost of time based on their experience and abilities, and neither the record nor the parties arguments provide a reason to depart from those rates. Any adjustments to account for other factors should have been made to the total lodestar amount rather than the stipulated rates, which captured all of the foregoing factors by asking how much Friolo\u2019s attorneys could have expected to earn by devoting their time to other matters. For these reasons, the circuit court erred when it strayed from the parties\u2019 stipulated rate schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">With the parties having stipulated as to rates, there remain five <em>Johnson </em>factors for consideration: the time and labor required; the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented; whether the fee was fixed or contingent; awards in similar cases; and the party\u2019s degree of success. And again, nearly all of these factors are subsumed by the court\u2019s basic lodestar calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">A court concludes its lodestar calculation by applying the reasonable hourly rate to \u201cthe time and labor required,\u201d which is the first remaining factor. Second, the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented sets the attorney\u2019s requisite level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of skill and determines the amount of work necessary to prevail, so that it is fully accounted for by the basic lodestar calculation of the reasonable rate and time required. <em>See Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 898-99, 104 S.Ct. 1541.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Third, contingency demands a theoretical premium that\u2014like those for time limitations and undesirability\u2014can be applied either to the rate or to the total award; but as we explain below, that factor was not disputed, and regardless of that, the circuit court drew an erroneous inference from the evidence of that factor. Fourth, both before and after the circuit court had calculated a lodestar amount, it failed to appreciate that the unique circumstances of this litigation render comparisons to similar cases practically impossible. Finally, we show that the court\u2019s counterfactual reconstruction led it to ignore the presiding judge\u2019s determination of the work required and conflate that factor with Friolo\u2019s \u201cdegree of success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">This case thus resolves to a single question: what was Friolo\u2019s \u201cdegree of success\u201d in light of the fee-shifting statutes\u2019 provisions for \u201creasonable\u201d attorney\u2019s fees and costs? While \u201c[t]he reasonableness of attorneys\u2019 fees is generally a factual determination within the sound discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>Atl. Contr. &amp; Material Co. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 316, 844 A.2d 460 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), that is the \u201cgeneral\u201d case and is not <em>always </em>so. The central question in this case depends on our interpretation of LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427 and 3-507.1; therefore, we give due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>weight to the trial court\u2019s particularized findings but answer the ultimate question as one of law. <em>See Ocean City v. Purnell-Jarvis, Ltd., </em>86 Md.App. 390, 413, 586 A.2d 816 (1991) (\u201cThe proper interpretation of a statute is solely a question of law.\u201d (citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments v. Asbury Methodist Home, Inc., </em>313 Md. 614, 626, 547 A.2d 190 (1988))); <em>see also Willard Packaging Co. v. Javier, </em>169 Md.App. 109, 126 n. 12, 899 A.2d 940 (2006).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">B. MRPC 1.5</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Second, Friolo argues that MRPC 1.5 must be subordinated to the Labor and Employment Article\u2019s fee-shifting provisions. One problem with a \u201cholistic\u201d and multi-factor test such as the lodestar method is that it allows conflicting principles to coexist. This, naturally, lends itself to some confusion, as here, where the circuit court misinterpreted the <em>Friolo I </em>Court\u2019s direction to be \u201cmindful\u201d of the implicit limits of MRPC 1.5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">The Rule is important to note because it puts a limit on what a lawyer may charge his or her own client. In <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Korotki, </em>318 Md. 646, 665, 569 A.2d 1224, 1233 (1990), while reserving on whether \u201cthere can ever be circumstances justifying a contingent fee in excess of fifty percent,\u201d we concluded that \u201cit is generally a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>violation of the rule for the attorney\u2019s stake in the result to exceed the client\u2019s stake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">373 Md. at 527, 528, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The circuit court, however, overlooked the more important guidance from <em>Friolo I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">The kind of limit imposed by the Rule, whether expressed as a percentage of recovery or through a lodestar approach, may well clash with the public policy behind statutory fee-shifting provisions, however, because it would likely preclude individuals seeking to recover relatively small amounts from procuring the assistance of private counsel, other than on a <em>pro bono publico </em>basis, and thus would frustrate the very purpose of the statute. The courts that have either allowed or mandated a lodestar approach have at least tacitly recognized that limits implicit from rules of this kind <em>cannot be rigorously applied </em>when determining what is reasonable under a statutory fee-shifting provision, the predominant purpose of which is to permit the favored suitor to obtain counsel that, because of legal or practical fee limitations, might otherwise be unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The jury award in this case is larger than those noted in <em>Friolo I </em>and <em>Friolo III </em>as the most common,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> but there is no reason to believe that fees for larger claims could not also exceed their underlying judgments by large margins. In those cases, it would be contrary to legislative intent\u2014as exhaustively set forth in <em>Friolo I </em>and <em>Friolo </em>III\u2014to deny recovery of fees that are reasonably necessary to prosecute successful claims under the Labor and Employment Article. As we discussed in <em>Weichert Co. of Md. v. Faust, </em>191 Md.App. 1, 17-20, 989 A.2d 1227 (2010), <em>aff'd on other grounds, Weic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>hert Co. of Md. v. Faust, </em>419 Md. 306, 323, 19 A.3d 393 (2011), the touchstone of fee-shifting statutes is necessity.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A fee-shifting clause or statute permits the court, with the benefit of hindsight, to compensate a plaintiff for all expenditures without which he or she would not have succeeded. Thus, if a plaintiff could have recovered only a one-thousand dollar verdict by virtue of one-hundred-thousand dollars worth of legal work, full compensation requires that those fees be shifted, regardless of their magnitude relative to the verdict.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>We emphasize\u2014for reasons that we make clear below\u2014that this logic and legislative intent extends only to <em>reasonably necessary </em>fees and costs of <em>successful </em>claims. And while the circuit court considered both necessity and success in this case, its ruling was dominated by considerations of what a hypothetical plaintiff would willingly pay to recover the judgment in this case, which was antithetical to legislative intent and an error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">C. Contingency</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Third, Friolo argues that the circuit court erred when it considered whether she agreed to conditional or unconditional liability to counsel for fees, and we agree. In <em>Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 526, 819 A.2d 354, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>City of Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 U.S. 557, 561, 567, 112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992), held that a contingency lodestar \u201cenhancement\u201d is not permitted under a \u201ctypical\u201d federal fee-shifting statute. While there is Maryland authority dealing with \u201cpure\u201d contingency agreements, <em>see Holzman v. Fiola Blum, Inc., </em>125 Md.App. 602, 636-642, 726 A.2d 818 (1999) (agreement to pay one-third of judgment fee must be considered within general reasonableness analysis), there is no case law dealing with the issue in the lodestar context.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">While this case does not call for us either to adopt or to reject the reasoning and holding in <em>Burlington, </em>it does require of us a related holding that unconditional liability to counsel should not be a prerequisite to a fee award for two reasons. First, counsel is often in a better position than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>litigant to both judge and to bear the risk of loss and so may arrange for a contingent fee. <em>See </em>Rowe, <em>The Legal Theory of Attorney Fee Shifting: A Critical Overview, </em>1982 Duke L.J. 651, 676 (\u201cIf we want to encourage private attorney general suits, risky plaintiffs\u2019 test litigation, or claims for nonmonetary relief, forbidding the shifting of compensation for risk could deter the bringing of such cases.\u201d), <em>cited in Pa. v. Del. Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>483 U.S. 711, 721 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3078, 97 L.Ed.2d 585 (1987) (plurality opinion). This sort of arrangement is particularly valuable in a suit such as this wage dispute, where fees are shifted because the plaintiff presumably lacks capital to fund a risky lawsuit. Second, and more importantly, the Court of Appeals expressed its concern in <em>Friolo III </em>that \u201c[w]hen an appeal is noted on behalf of the party seeking attorneys\u2019 fees but the only significant issue raised in the appeal is the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees awarded (or not awarded) by the trial court, there could arise a conflict of interest between the attorney and the client, especially if the appeal is not successful.\u201d 403 Md. at 462 n. 14, 942 A.2d 1242. Specifically, the conflict in that situation stems from the fact that the attorney will be compensated regardless of the appellate outcome (either by the opposition, if successful, or by the client, if unsuccessful). A contingent fee agreement removes that conflict by tying compensation to success. Thus, while it may appear that a contingent agreement sets the client adrift while the attorney prosecutes the case without consequence, in truth it lashes the attorney to the proverbial mast and provides a \u201cnegative incentive\u201d for failure, thus helping to ensure that counsel will act in the client\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">If a complainant could only recover fees where he or she has accepted unqualified liability to counsel, it would deprive the plaintiff of both of these benefits and deter precisely the type of suits that our fee-shifting statutes are designed to encourage. If contingency was to be considered at all, it should have been used to determine whether the rate included an appropriate premium. <em>See City of Burlington v. Dague, </em>505 U.S. 557, 567, 112 S.Ct. 2638, 120 L.Ed.2d 449 (1992) (Blackmun, J, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>dissenting) (\u201c[I]t is a fact of the market that an attorney who is paid only when his client prevails will tend to charge a higher fee than one who is paid regardless of outcome[.]\u201d (citing R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law \u00a7 21.9, pp. 534-535 (3d ed.1986))). For these reasons, limits on a client\u2019s liability, whether fixed or contingent, do not make fee award demands exceeding that limit \u201cunreasonable\u201d under the fee-shifting statutes in question, and the court erred as a matter of law when it held otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">D. Degree of Success</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The fee-shifting statutes in this case, like most, award fees only to a prevailing party. <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 3-427(d) (court may award fees only if employee is \u201centitled to recovery\u201d of wages under that section); LE \u00a7 3-507.1(b) (court may award fees only if the \u201cemployer withheld the wage of an employee\u201d in violation of the subtitle). And while the opposite result\u2014 abject failure\u2014is easily identified by a judgment in favor of the defendant, it takes a considerable effort to determine whether a plaintiff has \u201cprevailed\u201d in two common scenarios. First, a plaintiff may be successful on only a subset of his or her claims asserted, in which case the court will award fees for work if, and only if, it was reasonably necessary to prosecute those claims that resulted in an award, denying recovery only for work that did not contribute in any way to the plaintiffs success. <em>See Reisterstown Plaza </em>Assoc. <em>v. General Nutrition Center, Inc., </em>89 Md.App. 232, 245, 597 A.2d 1049 (1991) (a party may recover attorney fees rendered in connection with all claims if they arise out of the same transaction and are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of essentially the same facts); <em>see also Weichert, </em>191 Md.App. at 15-20, 989 A.2d 1227 (discussing practical and theoretical limitations of the \u201ccommon core of facts\u201d doctrine). Second, the judgment may not encapsulate the litigation\u2019s true value to society, such as injunctive relief affecting a broad category of potential plaintiffs, or resolution by extra-judicial settlement. <em>See Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 718 (\u201cIf the decision corrects across-the-board discrimination affecting a large class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of an employer\u2019s employees, the attorney\u2019s fee award should reflect the relief granted.\u201d), <em>accord, Blum, </em>465 U.S. at 900, 104 S.Ct. 1541; <em>Friolo I, </em>373 Md. at 522 n. 2, 819 A.2d 354 (same); <em>Blaylock v. Johns Hopkins Fed. Credit Union, </em>152 Md.App. 338, 355, 831 A.2d 1120 (2003) (\u201c[Ujnder the Consumer Protection Act, a consumer who achieves victory by means of an agreement approved by the court is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, even though no consent decree or judgment is entered in favor of the prevailing party.\u201d). <em>See also Hensley, </em>461 U.S. at 446 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 1933 (\u201c[I]n enacting [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988, Congress determined that the public as a whole has an interest in the vindication of the rights conferred by the statutes enumerated in \u00a7 1988, over and above the value of a civil rights remedy to a particular plaintiff.\u201d). This case presents neither of these two difficulties. The trial merely resolved a minor dispute between a physician and his former employees and did not affect a broad base of potential litigants<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and Friolo stipulated to an appropriate reduction for her unsuccessful claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Instead, this case requires that we define the plaintiffs \u201cdegree of success\u201d where an otherwise inconsequential suit resulted in a judgment awarding only a fraction of the damages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>The circuit court dealt with the discrepancy between Friolo\u2019s claims and the jury\u2019s award by estimating the amount of time it believed was appropriate to obtain a judgment of $11,778.85, but that was not the correct approach under these circumstances. While the court may have correctly assumed that a certain amount of work <em>generally </em>correlates with the size of the judgment, we have already established that there is no necessary or constant relation between the size of a judgment and the size of a proper fee award. This is particularly true in cases such as this employment dispute where one side generally has a greater precedential interest than the other or can bring more resources to bear in litigation. <em>See Mirabal v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>576 F.2d 729, 781 (7th Cir.1978) (opposition\u2019s fees not informative in lodestar analysis due to disparate precedential interests), <em>accord Migis v. Pearle Vision, </em>135 F.3d 1041 (5th Cir.1998), <em>Henson v. Columbus Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>770 F.2d 1566, 1574-75 (11th Cir.1985). Thus, the court could not simply reduce the fees claimed to align with those in other cases that are identical <em>only in the amount of their judgments, </em>and the circuit court erred when it ignored the presiding judge\u2019s findings and instead estimated what quantity of work was commensurate with the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Although we have identified the locus of the court\u2019s error, there remains an important and insidious problem in determining Friolo\u2019s \u201cdegree of success.\u201d Even if <em>we </em>adopt the presiding trial judge\u2019s conclusion that all the work for which Friolo sought compensation was <em>related </em>to her successful claims in law or in fact, we can only deem that labor \u201cnecessary\u201d under the circumstances. Crucially, those circumstances include the fact that Friolo demanded some $60,000.00 more than the jury determined she was entitled to recover. Hence, the presiding judge initially\u2014and in some sense correctly\u2014deemed the labor \u201cnecessary,\u201d but only in the narrow context of the trial. In the broader context that the fee-shifting statutes address, \u201cnecessity\u201d must account for the fact that excessive demands cause unnecessary litigation. <em>See Brooms v. Regal Tube Co., </em>881 F.2d 412, 425 (7th Cir.1989) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(remanding for district court to consider whether plaintiff \u201cunduly prolonged\u201d the litigation \u201cwith no hope of greater recovery\u201d by refusing settlement offer \u201cfor an amount nearly equalling what she eventually received at trial\u201d); <em>Vocca v. Playboy Hotel of Chicago, Inc., </em>686 F.2d 605, 608 (7th Cir. 1982) (\u201cCounsel\u2019s refusal to settle the case earlier for an amount only slightly less than the amount ultimately agreed upon, accompanied by his statement that Playboy could afford to pay more, provide sufficient support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that he had unreasonably prolonged the litigation.\u201d); <em>EEOC v. Nutri/System, Inc., </em>685 F.Supp. 568, 577-78 (E.D.Va.1988) (\u201cEven where questionable claims are not involved, it is a salutary principle that a prevailing party should not be permitted to inflate a fee award by using unreasonable settlement demands to extend a case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Our aim, then, is to determine what would have been necessary in order for Friolo to extract her rightful damages from appellees had she not demanded several times that amount in her complaint, and both the fee-shifting statutes and eighth <em>Johnson </em>factor provide us with a target\u2014the fact-finder\u2019s award. If a fact-finder awards only <em>part </em>of a <em>single </em>claim, then the verdict effectively severs a plaintiffs claims into two portions, one with merit and one without. Thus, legislative intent to incentivize only meritorious claims implies that our definition of \u201csuccess\u201d should be limited to the successful part, and we must consider the size of the judgment <em>relative to the size of the plaintiff\u2019s demands. </em>This is, in essence, a concentrated application of the eighth <em>Johnson </em>factor, \u201cthe <em>amount involved </em>and the <em>results </em>obtained.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Nigh v. Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 183, 190 (4th Cir.2007) (the requirement \u201cto weigh the amount in controversy and the results obtained before deciding upon a reasonable fee ... rests on the idea that a prevailing plaintiff is less worthy of a fee award when one or more of his claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>lack merit\u2014that is, <em>when he cannot demonstrate that he deserves the compensation he demanded in his com,plaint.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Importantly, this logic of incentives extends beyond the simple case of a \u201cstone-walling\u201d defendant who refuses to pay any damages at all. Litigation cannot be considered a \u201csuccess\u201d if it results in no recovery beyond what the defendant was willing to admit, which compels us to consider the defendant who tenders <em>settlement. </em>If a plaintiff demands $100,000.00 while the defendant offers to settle for $50,000.00, only to have the jury award the settlement of $50,000.00, the value of that litigation is the same as if the plaintiff had demanded $50,000.00, only to be offered and awarded $0.00. In either case, the value of the litigation is zero because the proper \u201cbaseline\u201d to measure success is the defendant\u2019s willingness to pay, which is the approach taken by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68. Federal Rule 54(d) awards of costs\u2014 and where designated by statute, attorney\u2019s fees\u2014to the prevailing party by default, but Rule 68 allows a defendant to \u201cserve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 68(a), (c); <em>Marek v. Chesny, </em>473 U.S. 1, 9, 105 S.Ct. 3012, 87 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985) (\u201c[Ajbsent congressional expressions to the contrary, where the underlying statute defines \u2018costs\u2019 to include attorney\u2019s fees, we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of Rule 68.\u201d). The defendant\u2019s settlement offer then sets the measure of success, so that \u201c[i]f the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 68(d). As noted, above, the plain texts of LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427(d) and 3-507.1(b) condition fee awards on recovery. Those statutes do not, however, <em>require </em>a fee award wherever the plaintiff recovers, and it would be unreasonable to award fees where the defendant tenders the plaintiffs entitlement but the plaintiff refuses to accept that offer and seeks an unjustified amount. <em>See Sands v. Runyon, </em>28 F.3d 1323, 1334 (2d Cir.1994) (in determining attorney\u2019s fee award, court may consider that defendant\u2019s \u201coffer was strikingly similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>court\u2019s eventual judgment\u201d); <em>Cormier v. Manke, </em>108 Nev. 316, 317-18, 830 P.2d 1327 (1992) (\u201c[W]hen considering a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to NRS 18.010(2)(a) in a case in which a non-statutory offer of settlement has been rejected, the district court must consider the reasonableness of the rejection.\u201d); <em>Brooms, </em>881 F.2d at 425; <em>Vocca, </em>686 F.2d at 608; <em>EEOC v. Nutri/System, Inc., </em>685 F.Supp. at 577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We recognize, however, that it takes two parties to litigate, and a defendant might just as easily offer $0.00 as $50,000.00 to settle a claim that ultimately produces a $50,000.00 verdict. Thus, we also must account for the fact that a defendant\u2019s settlement offer can fall <em>below </em>the jury\u2019s verdict, thereby justifying litigation. But as with the plaintiffs overreaching, a defendant\u2019s failure to offer settlement can be in full <em>or in part. </em>In the simple case, a defendant may offer $0.00 only to have a verdict entered in favor of the plaintiff for the entirety of the claims. If, however, a plaintiff demands $100,000.00 and obtains a judgment of $50,000.00 against a defendant who never offered any settlement\u2014which is to say the defendant \u201coffered\u201d $0.00\u2014both parties will have contributed equally to litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">For these reasons, legislative intent demands that the lodestar amount in this case be reduced by Friolo\u2019s <em>relative </em>contribution to causing unnecessary litigation, taking into account both her <em>overstatement </em>of damages <em>and appellees\u2019 understatement </em>of damages, as measured by the verdict.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Where, as here, the plaintiff sought only monetary damages, the relative contribution of each party to \u201ccausing\u201d litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>can be expressed with straightforward arithmetic by multiplying the lodestar amount by a fraction that is the difference between the judgment and the settlement offer, divided by the difference between the claims and the settlement offer.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Under this relative approach, Friolo would have recovered all of the fees she incurred had her claims been fully vindicated, whereas if had she recovered nothing beyond the defendant\u2019s settlement offer, she would have received no fee award. Additionally, like Federal Rule 68, our interpretation of the prevailing party\u2019s \u201cdegree of success\u201d offers the benefit of encouraging settlement by discouraging either side from causing unnecessary litigation. <em>See Delta Air Lines v. August, </em>450 U.S. 346, 352, 101 S.Ct. 1146, 67 L.Ed.2d 287 (1981) (\u201cRule 68 provides an additional inducement to settle in those cases in which there is a strong probability that the plaintiff will obtain a judgment but the amount of recovery is uncertain.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">As it happened, Friolo demanded $78,164.00 in damages at trial,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> while appellees offered $3,000.00,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the jury awarded $11,778.85. Using our formula, Friolo\u2019s demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>exceeded the judgment by $66,385.15, while appellees\u2019 offer to settle fell short by $8,778.85. Thus, out of the $75,164.00 disagreement between the two parties, Friolo was responsible for eighty-eight percent of the difference.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Had Friolo been completely successful, she would have been entitled to the entire $69,637.50 lodestar amount. Under the circumstances, however, Friolo\u2019s degree of success relative to her claims and appellees\u2019 parallel\u2014but lesser\u2014contribution to litigation reduced her entitlement to statutory attorney\u2019s fees by eighty-eight percent, for a legally proper statutory award of $8,356.50 in fees for the trial stage of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The question of <em>appellate </em>fees is complicated by the fact that much of the benefit\u2014and hence the success\u2014obtained on appeal is public rather than specific to the litigant. Upon closer examination, however, the situation at hand is not as complex as it might appear, and we can continue to apply the same reasoning. In her appeals, Friolo successfully established two points of law, namely that Maryland courts should employ the lodestar method and that the fee-shifting statutes allow what courts have called \u201cfees-on-fees\u201d for appellate work. Where, as here, unclear law impeded the plaintiff, the public naturally benefits from the judicial opinion clarifying that point of law. More importantly, because that benefit is purely a product of litigation, its cost will be <em>jfully compensated </em>by shifting the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>We recognize the potential argument that a plaintiff should be rewarded for public benefit independent of private reward, and that Friolo\u2019s success should not be discounted simply because her personal claims failed. That could be the correct result in another case, but here it would foist a gross public burden on a private defendant in a manner antithetical to both the fee-shifting statutes and\u2014as this case demonstrates\u2014to the realities of the litigation undergirding them. We have already established that a <em>fully successful </em>plaintiff will <em>he fully compensated </em>for his or her costs and thus will incur no loss for pursuing the public benefit in the course of obtaining relief. On the other hand, it is erroneous to assume that where public and private benefits diverge we can properly incentivize a private plaintiff who would bear the risk of loss without the possibility of private gain. For confirmation of this, we need look no farther than the facts of this case. <em>Friolo I </em>established that the public interest demands the lodestar methodology. On remand, the circuit court awarded Friolo the full amount of trial fees she demanded without employing a proper lodestar analysis, but Friolo lodged no complaint. Instead, it was <em>appellees </em>who successfully reversed that award for failure to employ lodestar, Friolo having abandoned the public interest once she stood to gain nothing from pursuing it in court and leaving the matter for the next plaintiff.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We therefore have no reason to depart from the overarching legislative intent to deny attorney\u2019s fee awards to an unsuccessful plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tiff, and we treat Friolo\u2019s appeal simply as a new action with its own \u201cclaims\u201d that are subject to the foregoing analysis to determine their degrees of success.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In <em>Friolo I, </em>appellant claimed she was entitled to $69,637.50 in fees, while appellees maintained that she should not be awarded any fees at all. Neither of these figures reflected the proper award, which we determined above, of $8,356.50. Thus, the <em>appeal itself was </em>another partial success, and while Friolo demanded $85,745.58 in her petitions for appellate fees,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> her relative contribution to prolonging these proceedings only entitles her to a portion of that amount. Thus, we again apply our formula to Friolo\u2019s appellate fee petitions and arrive at a proper award of $10,289.47 for fees incurred in connection with <em>Friolo If</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, we can iterate our analysis and apply it again to both <em>Friolo II </em>and <em>Friolo III. </em>In those proceedings, Friolo sought a total of $163,353.83 in fees for prior work,<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> whereas the results of that work justified only $18,645.97 in attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Friolo now seeks $219,963.34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>for her counsel\u2019s work in <em>Friolo II, Friolo III </em>(and the most recent remand), but her relative contribution to\u2014and limited success in\u2014those proceedings justifies only twelve percent of that amount, $26,395.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The unusual circumstances of this case isolated Friolo\u2019s degree of success as <em>the </em>deciding factor. The parties did not dispute the reasonable rate of compensation, and the presiding judge determined that her counsel\u2019s work was commensurate with the breadth and size of appellant\u2019s claims, but not her success relative to those claims. The circuit court\u2019s attempts to reconcile her fees and success were improper in light of the legislative intent underlying LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427(d) and 3-507.1(b). Instead, those statutes require us to balance the parties\u2019 incentives and account for each side\u2019s relative contribution to causing unnecessary litigation. Had Friolo sought only what she deserved, there may have been no need for litigation at all, and had she recovered all she claimed, she would have been entitled to whatever amount of fees that required. As it was, while the work claimed was necessary under the limited circumstances of trial, Friolo\u2019s overreaching contributed considerably to the costs of this litigation, and her degree of success merited only $8,356.50 in trial fees, $10,289.47 for fees in <em>Friolo I, </em>and $26,395.60 for <em>Friolo II </em>and <em>Friolo II, </em>for a total of $45,041.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Before we conclude our discussion of Friolo\u2019s degree of success, we should specifically address the scope of our holding. In <em>Hensley, </em>the Supreme Court opined that \u201c[tjhere is no precise rule or formula\u201d for determining a party\u2019s \u201cdegree of success,\u201d 461 U.S. at 436-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933. We do not disagree, and we do not intend for our formulaic approach in this particular case to stand as a universal and exclusive rule that determines a plaintiff\u2019s \u201cdegree of success\u201d to the exclusion of all other considerations. Our mandate rests on a formulaic approach because a decade of litigation has distilled the issue to an unusually pure form, that being economic damages divorced from any dispute over the other <em>Johnson </em>factors and from other considerations on the narrow issue of success, such as failed but unrelated claims or a broad societal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>benefit. We hope that, in the same way the lodestar calculation serves as a starting point to determine \u201creasonable\u201d fees, our formula might prove to be a useful <em>starting point </em>where individual claims are partially successful, providing some guidance beyond the <em>Hensley </em>Court\u2019s broad suggestion to \u201csimply reduce the award to account for the limited success.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">E. Other Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\n<em>1. Bona Fide Dispute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Appellant argues that the existence of a <em>bona fide </em>dispute is an affirmative defense to the Payment Law\u2019s enhanced damages and attorney\u2019s fees provisions, and that appellees waived that defense by failing to include it in their answer.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 2-323(a) requires that, with the exception of certain preliminary defenses,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201c[e]very defense of law or fact to a claim for relief in a complaint, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim shall be asserted in an answer[.]\u201d Ordinarily, a defense is a specific denial that must be disclosed under Rule 2-323(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Except as permitted by section (d) of this Rule, a party shall admit or deny the averments upon which the adverse party relies. A party without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an averment shall so state and this has the effect of a denial.

A party may deny designated averments or paragraphs or may generally deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>all the averments except averments or paragraphs that are specifically admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Other defenses do not take the form of a denial, and chief among those is the \u201caffirmative defense.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">An affirmative defense is one which directly or implicitly concedes the basic position of the opposing party, but which asserts that notwithstanding that concession the opponent is not entitled to prevail because he is precluded for some other reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Armstrong v. Johnson Motor Lines, Inc., </em>12 Md.App. 492, 500, 280 A.2d 24 (1971). Professors Lynch and Bourne succinctly stated the reason to compel explicit pleading of affirmative defenses, thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">If the defensive matter the defendant ultimately wishes to establish does not entail facts that would be logically inconsistent with the factual allegations of the plaintiffs complaint, then a denial of plaintiffs allegations cannot be regarded as putting the plaintiff on notice of such matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKq\">Modern Maryland Civil Procedure \u00a7 6.7(c)(4), 6-77 (2d ed.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">In addition to providing notice and due process to the defendant, <em>see Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.

To a much greater degree than under prior practice, pleading requirements for defending parties are now intended to define the issues at an early stage in the litigation.

Discovery can be time-consuming and expensive and, in the federal courts, it has frequently been abused. To the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that requirements of detail or specificity in the pleadings can give a court a true picture of whether a claim or defense involves meritorious factual issues, they contribute significantly to judicial economy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Modern Maryland Civil Procedure \u00a7 6.7(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In this case, Friolo complained that appellees withheld her wages in violation of the Payment Law. This allegation would ordinarily leave the <em>bona fide </em>dispute as an affirmative defense, but because \u00a7 3-507.1(b) includes the <em>absence </em>of a <em>bona fide </em>dispute as a statutory element, Friolo (wisely) <em>affirmatively plead </em>that appellees withheld her pay <em>\u201cnot </em>as a result of a bona fide dispute\u201d (emphasis added). Not all allegations, however, are put at issue, for that requires a denial. As such, the issue would have stood in dispute if appellees denied that allegation, but the record indicates that they did not. Appel-lees never pled\u2014presumably in the alternative\u2014that even if the agreement was as Friolo alleged, they harbored a good faith belief to the contrary or a good faith belief that the Payment Law did not apply for some other reason. <em>See Admiral Mortgage, </em>357 Md. at 541-42, 745 A.2d 1026.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tion 3-507.1(b) conditions enhanced liability on a withholding that is both \u201cin violation of [the Payment Law] <em>and </em>not as a result of a bona fide dispute,\u201d thus establishing them as independent conditions. The fact that appellees\u2019 answer asserted some grounds for exclusion from the Payment law does not necessarily imply that they held those grounds as a good-faith basis for withholding payment. Instead, their answer merely recited a standard set of defenses and alleged that appellees were not liable under the statute because Friolo\u2019s complaint \u201cmiseharacterize[d] and misrepresent[ed] the terms of any agreements between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Appellees invoked the Wage and Hour Law\u2019s statutory exceptions of LE \u00a7 3-403(a)(1) and (a)(5) as \u201caffirmative defenses,\u201d but they did not assert the existence or nature of their good faith basis for withholding $11,778.85 from appellant in violation of the Payment Law. As such, they failed to deny Friolo\u2019s allegation and, under Rule 2-323(a), the issue was admitted as a matter of law.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\n<em>2. Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Finally, we must address the costs of these proceedings, which is a relatively simple matter in comparison to those above. Under LE \u00a7\u00a7 3^427(d) and 3-507.1(b), fees and costs differ only in name. Both are expenses that might deter a meritorious plaintiff from bringing suit and, as such, both are subject to the reasoning we employed in dealing with fees, above. The record does not contain a summary of costs at each stage of the prior proceedings, but their undisputed total was $17,597.57, and our analysis established that, at each stage, Friolo was responsible for eighty-eight percent of the litigation expenses she incurred. Thus, Friolo should recover twelve percent of the $2,447.57 in costs demanded in her sixth and final petition, and she is separately liable for eighty-eight percent of the $15,150.00 special master\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Our analysis of the undisputed factual record established that the court erred as a matter of law when it entered its last judgment in favor of Friolo. The circuit court erroneously ignored the undisputed evidence of reasonable hourly rates, considered what a hypothetical plaintiff would pay <em>ex-ante, </em>demanded proof of Friolo\u2019s liability to counsel, and subordinated LE \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014427(d) and 3-507.1(b) to MRPC 1.5. For these reasons, the court erred when it entered judgment against appellees in the amount of $5,000.00 for attorney\u2019s fees and $2,277.00 for costs, and when it entered judgment against Friolo and appellees and in favor of the special master, each in the amount of $7,575.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The unique and undisputed facts of this case left it posed upon a single question of law, which was how to define appellant\u2019s \u201cdegree of success\u201d when she contributed to litigation by claiming damages far in excess of the jury\u2019s eventual award. Our analysis has established that, in keeping with the legislative intent behind LE \u00a7\u00a7 3-427(d) and 3\u2014507.1(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Friolo\u2019s fee award must reflect her relative fault in contributing to unnecessary litigation expenses. Having settled that question, and because there were no other disputes of law or fact, we vacate the judgments of the circuit court and enter the following modified judgments in their stead.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">JUDGMENTS VACATED.

Appellant's brief phrased the question thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">Whether the Circuit Court, Hon. Judge Joseph A.

There is one noteworthy distinction between trial and appellate work. A trial will often involve a variety of possibly unrelated claims, whereas an appeal will most often present a unified front of related legal theories.

In determining whether there is a \u201cbona fide dispute\u201d regarding a claim sufficient to preclude a creditor from filing or joining in a petition for involuntary bankruptcy, some Federal courts have looked to whether \u201cthere is an objective basis for either a factual or a legal dispute as to the validity of the debt.\u201d <em>See In Re Rimell, </em>946 F.2d 1363, 1365 (8th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, Rimell v.
