The property at 123-129 West 27th Street, Baltimore, Maryland (the \u201cW. 27th Street property\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>operated as a nonconforming use through May 2008. The owner of the W. 27th Street property, YIM, LLC (\u2018TIM\u201d), one of the appellees, sought a new permit for restaurant use in May 2009. In October 2009, the Baltimore City Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d), the other appel-lee, permitted the continued nonconforming use of the W. 27th Street property as a restaurant. Mr. Hasip Tuzeer and other neighbors of the W. 27th Street property (\u201cappellants\u201d), appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which affirmed the Board\u2019s decision to allow the use of the property as a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Appellants present several questions for our review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">1. Has there been a substantive change in the applicable law requiring reversal of the Board\u2019s decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">2. Did the Board violate the Open Meetings Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">3. Did the Board err in its finding that the nonconforming use at issue had not been discontinued?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">4. Did the Board improperly modify the nonconforming use permit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The W. 27th Street property consists of four row houses in Baltimore, Maryland that have been combined to form a single unit. The property was built in the 1940s, and YIM has owned it since November 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">When YIM purchased the property in November 2006, a bar named 1.7th Generation was operating there. It ultimately sold the business interest to Two Sisters Grille, LLC (\u201cTwo Sisters\u201d), which operated as a restaurant and bar. A small bakery that prepares gluten free food used a separate area of the property, as well as a portion of the restaurant\u2019s kitchen space.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Two Sisters closed at the end of May 2008. YIM then sought a new tenant to operate a restaurant. In December 2008, YIM leased the property to David Weishaus, and they began the process of procuring the proper permits to operate a restaurant with a liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">That same month, December 2008, Two Sisters filed a Petition for Hardship Extension with the Baltimore City Board of Liquor Commissioners, requesting an extension of its liquor license to permit the transfer of the liquor license to the new restaurant operator for the W. 27th Street property. The Board of Liquor Commissioners granted the request, approving an extension for 180 days from December 11, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On May 11, 2009, YIM filed a Use and Occupancy Permit Application with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, requesting a permit for the W. 27th Street property to be used as a \u201clounge <em>&amp; </em>restaurant open 7 days [each week], food and beer, wine, &amp; liquor, first and second floors.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The record reflects that the permit application was initially given zoning approval that day and a draft permit was filed on May 21, 2009, but the permit subsequently was voided on June 4, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On June 11, 2009, YIM filed an appeal to the Board. It requested that the Board approve the application for an extension/use of a non-conforming restaurant with a liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">On June 15, 2009, after the initial permit application was voided, YIM filed a Use and Occupancy Permit Application with the Department of Housing and Community Development, seeking to \u201ccontinue use and extend time limit for discontinuation for portion of 1st floor (restaurant with liquor license).\u201d YIM\u2019s application was denied on June 15, 2009, and YIM filed an appeal to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">On August 18, 2009, after several postponements, the Board held a hearing regarding YIM\u2019s request to use a portion of the first floor of the W. 27th Street property as a restaurant with a liquor license. Counsel for YIM noted that, according to City permit records, the W. 27th Street property has been used as a restaurant since at least 1961.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Mr. Paul Goldberg, the principal of YIM, testified that a restaurant and/or bar had operated on the property since he purchased it in 2006. Two Sisters closed at the end of May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>2008 after falling into arrears in its rent and tax payments. YIM immediately began to market the W. 27th Street property, eventually leasing the first floor space to David Weishaus in December 2008. Mr. Weishaus began making improvements, with the ultimate goal of operating a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In May 2009, Mr. Goldberg learned that \u201cthere was a great rift between [Mr.] Weishaus and the community civic association.\u201d After determining that Mr. Weishaus would \u201cnot necessarily suit the interest of the community civic association,\u201d he and Mr. Weishaus agreed to break the lease. YIM approached Richard D\u2019Souza, who had talked about \u201can expansion ... of his bakery or as a sit down area.\u201d They entered into a lease, contingent on the ability to get a liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">In April or May of 2009, Mr. Weishaus filed an application to transfer to Mr. D\u2019Souza the liquor license he had procured. YIM advised the Charles Village Association that the restaurant would not play live music or host professional parties, and it would maintain the sidewalks and operate a clean facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Mr. Goldberg testified that the only economically feasible use for the W. 27th Street property is a restaurant. He explained that rental payments from a residence would not cover the amount it would cost to convert the first floor of the property to an apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Mr. D\u2019Souza, who operated a gluten-free bakery on one side of the W. 27th Street property, testified that he hoped to take over the space used as a restaurant. He wanted to establish a restaurant that would cater to gluten-free clients, although it would not be totally gluten-free.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">A number of neighborhood residents were either present at the hearing or submitted letters to the Board regarding YIM\u2019s permit request. Residents stated that, for more than a year, the use of the property had been a bakery, and they expressed concern regarding the impact that a restaurant with a liquor license would have on the neighborhood and its residents, specifically concerns about crime, disorderly conduct, noise, and parking. Neighborhood representatives also testified, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>echoing concerns related to the consumption of alcohol, crime, trash, and noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Michelle Wirzberger, on behalf of the Charles Village Association and the greater Remington Improvement Association, further argued that the W. 27th Street property falls within the boundaries of the Charles/25th Urban Renewal Plan, which prohibits a nonconforming use from being re-established when it has \u201cbeen inactive and not in continuous operation for 12 months.\u201d She asserted that, if the Board did not agree with that argument, the Board needed to \u201censure that in terms of allowing a continuation that the continuation is not contrary to the public interest,\u201d and she argued that permitting a restaurant with a liquor license to operate out of the W. 27th Street property was \u201ccontrary to the public interest\u201d because it would cause parking problems and attract \u201cbad actors and dangerous activity,\u201d including urination and defecation on neighboring properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Counsel for appellants argued that YIM\u2019s request constituted a request for a modification because, when the Board authorized \u201cthe kitchen in the tavern [to be used] for preparation of baked goods\u201d in May 2007, it did not \u201cgrant a second separate principal use [of] the property\u201d; the Board merely granted \u201can accessory use of the kitchen.\u201d Counsel argued that the current permit request sought a separate, distinct use, namely a restaurant with a liquor license. Authorizing the permit, he maintained, would result in two side-by-side commercial uses instead of a single non-conforming use, representing a modification of the non-conforming use. Counsel argued further that the non-conforming use as a restaurant had been abandoned, and that a restaurant with a liquor license was \u201cnot compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">David Tanner, the Executive Director of the Board, then discussed the historical use of the W. 27th Street property. He stated that the property \u201cstarted as single family homes in four separate lots,\u201d and \u201cthey were allowed to extend the first floor at 125 and 127 in conjunction with the tavern at 129 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>1946.\u201d He believed that the fourth unit was expanded into a bakery in 1961, but \u201cit was all done prior to '71,\u201d when zoning restrictions were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Counsel for YIM then gave his closing argument. He maintained that operation of a restaurant/tavern on the property constituted a long-standing nonconforming use. Counsel noted that the property had operated as a restaurant with a liquor license until May 2008, when Two Sisters closed, and that a new use permit would have been issued in May 2009 if there had not been a mistake in the zoning office, which voided YIM\u2019s application instead of tagging it.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">With respect to the argument that there had been a discontinuation of use as a restaurant, counsel made two points. First, he argued that the provisions of discontinuation and abandonment did not apply to the R-8 district. Second, he argued that, even if they did apply, there was no abandonment in this case because \u201cthe discontinuation of use was beyond the control of the owner.\u201d Counsel noted that YIM applied for a new Use and Occupancy Permit, \u201cwhich, according to Mr. Veale, would have been issued but for a mistake in the zoning office which made the item\u2014instead of flagging it for looking into it more, they voided the application,\u201d which Mr. Veale said was a mistake. He asserted that YIM \u201cmade all reasonable efforts to rent, lease or sell the ... property,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe enforcement of [a] time limit would impose exceptional practical difficulties that are not created by or as a result of any action or lack of action by the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The Board subsequently issued a written Resolution, which stated that it had been adopted on September 15, 2009, permitting \u201cthe use of the property as a restaurant, subject to conditions!,] to continue.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Resolution stated that \u201c[Restaurants, with or without liquor licenses, are not listed as permitted or conditional uses in the R-8 Residence District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>under Subsections 4-1101 and 4-1103.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It noted, however, that \u201c[u]nder the provisions of Subsections 13-103(a) and 13-101, any lawfully existing non-conforming use or structure may be continued.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Resolution summarized the testimony. It noted the documentation demonstrating that the first floor of the W. 27th Street property had been used as a restaurant/bar since prior to 1961, and that the use had continued unabated until the end of May 2008, when Two Sisters closed. It stated that, in March 2009, a permit was issued to a new tenant to allow interior improvements, and in- May 2009, a permit was issued to use the W. 27th Street property as a lounge/restaurant selling beer, wine, liquor and food on the first and second floors. The Zoning Administration Office voided the permit, however, because a community representative informed it that the nonconforming use had been discontinued for more than 12 months and that operations could not be expanded to the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The Resolution stated that the owner was seeking authorization to reestablish the use of the first floor as a restaurant, with Richard and Renee D\u2019Souza as the proposed operators of the restaurant. It noted that YIM had submitted an affidavit from Teearam Raghubar, \u201cconfirming that he had managed the restaurant from January 2009\u201d through June 2009.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>The Board proceeded to make the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The Board finds that this property has been a facility serving food to the public, primarily for on premises consumption by seated patrons for many years. For example[,] in 1956 the Board authorized the use of the second floor of 123-129 W[.] 27th Street for a dining room for the restaurant. The Board also notes that the second floor was last authorized as two dwelling units and is not included in this appeal. There have been a number of permits issued over the years where the use of the first floor has been described as a restaurant or as a tavern. The appellant testified that the facility has always served food. The Board finds that since 1971 until 2004 taverns and restaurants with liquor licenses were considered the same under the Zoning Code. Both were allowed to serve food and were undefined in the code and were permitted in the same zoning districts. The bulk regulations, off-street parking and sign regulations were and continue to be applied equally. In 2004[,] the Mayor and City Council amended the Zoning Code by enacting Ordinance 04-831 LIVE ENTERTAINMENT-NIGHTLIFE for the purpose of defining certain terms relating to restaurants, taverns, halls, after hour establishments, and certain other establishments that serve food or beverages, that offer live entertainment. This amendment became effective December 29, 2004.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>The Board finds that based on the evidence presented at the hearing the first floor was operating as a restaurant until at least May 31, 2008[,] when the prior tenant, Two Sisters Grille, LLC closed. On March 6, 2009[,] a permit was issued to the owner for interior improvements. On May 11, 2009[,] a permit application was approved in the Office of the Zoning Administrator to use the premises as a \u201cLounge/restaurant selling beer, wine, liquor and food on [the] 1st and 2nd floor[s]\u201d. This application was voided by the Zoning Administration because it authorize[d] the second floor as part of the establishment in error and the community was expressing concern about the continued use of the first floor. The owner then filed this appeal to the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">After setting forth the evidence that had been presented, the Resolution then set forth the Board\u2019s conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">The Board finds that the use of this property as a restaurant, subject to conditions can continue. The use had not been discontinued or abandoned as required under Section 13-407 o[f] the [C]ode and even if the evidence confirmed that it had been discontinued subsection 13-407(c) would apply which excepts Class III nonconforming uses in [the R-8-] District[ ]. The Board finds that while this application states that the request is to continue the use for a restaurant with a liquor license the Board decision relates to the restaurant use only. Questions or procedures concerning any liquor license should be addressed to the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The Board imposed restrictions on the hours of operation, ordering that the restaurant be closed no later than 10:00 p.m. on week nights and no later than midnight on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">On November 17, 2009, YIM filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, asserting that the Board \u201cerred in applying time restrictions to a nonconforming use.\u201d Mr. Tuzeer subsequently filed a Petition for Judicial Review, arguing that the Board\u2019s approval of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>nonconforming restaurant use should not be affirmed because: (1) it constituted an impermissible modification of a nonconforming use; (2) the Board\u2019s Resolution was not adequately supported by the record and referred to evidence that was not part of the proceeding; and (3) the Board did not comply with Md.Code (2003 Repl.Vol.) Art. 66B and the Open Meetings Act in approving the resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">On January 19, 2010, YIM field a Motion to Consolidate Appeals. The circuit court granted the motion on February 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On April 13 and 14, 2010, the circuit court heard arguments regarding the parties\u2019 appeals. On May 13, 2010, the court issued its order affirming \u201cthe Board\u2019s finding of continued nonconforming restaurant use for the first floor of the property at 123-129 West 27th Street,\u201d but modifying \u201cthe Board\u2019s decision by striking the restrictions placed on [YIM\u2019s] operation of a nonconforming use restaurant.\u201d The court found that the Board\u2019s decision was not a modification of a nonconforming use property, nor was it an approval of a \u201cside-by-side\u201d nonconforming use. Regarding the Board\u2019s decision that the existing nonconforming use as a restaurant had not been discontinued or abandoned, the court stated that \u201cthe Board found that the \u2018property has been a facility serving food to the public, primarily for on premises consumption by seated patrons for many years,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthere is no significant difference between serving patrons bread or other food products on the premises.\u201d The court further found no violation of the Open Meetings Act or Article 66B. The court found, however, that the Board erred in placing limitations on the restaurant\u2019s operating hours.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">On June 14, 2010, appellants filed this timely appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">In reviewing a circuit court decision on appeal from an administrative agency decision, \u201cour role \u2018is precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tabassi v.

A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\"><em>Assateague Coastkeeper v.

First, they contend that the Resolution must be reversed because the provision of the Baltimore City Zoning Code (\u201cBCZC\u201d) that the Board relied upon in approving YIM\u2019s nonconforming use permit was subsequently repealed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, appellants argue that the Board\u2019s Resolution must be vacated because the Board did not comply with Article 66B and the Open Meetings Act. Third, appellants contend that the Board\u2019s finding \u201cthat the nonconforming use at issue had not been \u2018discontinued\u2019 contradicted the undisputed testimony and was unsupported by competent evidence.\u201d Fourth, they maintain that the Board\u2019s Resolution \u201cunlawfully modified the prior nonconforming use of the first floor or a portion thereof, and created ambiguity as to the portion of the first floor to be authorized for \u2018continued\u2019 use as a \u2018restaurant.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Before addressing the merits of these contentions, we will review the zoning laws applicable to the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Baltimore Zoning Regulations</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">In 1971, the Baltimore City Council adopted the Zoning Commission\u2019s recommendations related to zoning boundaries and established comprehensive zoning laws for the City. Baltimore City Ordinance No. 1051 (April 20, 1971). Pursuant to these laws, the W. 27th Street property is part of the R-8 District, which, as discussed <em>supra, </em>allows property to be used as a dwelling and for other limited purposes, not including a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The use of the property here involves a nonconforming use, which is defined as a \u201clawfully existing use of a structure or of land that does not conform to the applicable use regulations of the district in which it is located.\u201d <em>Trip </em>Assocs. <em>Inc. v.

A nonconforming use may be eliminated by \u201c \u2018[discontinuance or abandonment,\u2019 the failure actively and continuously to operate the nonconforming use.\u201d <em>Trip </em>Assocs., 392 Md. at 576, 898 A.2d 449 (quoting BCZC \u00a7 13-407).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">At the time of the hearing in this case, BCZC \u00a7 13^107 provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">(a) <em>Discontinuance of use.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">(1) Except as specified in this section, whenever the active and continuous operation of any Class III nonconforming use, or any part of that use, has been discontinued for 12 consecutive months:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">(i) the discontinuance constitutes an abandonment of the discontinued nonconforming use, or discontinued part of that use, regardless of any reservation of an intent to resume active operations or otherwise not abandon the use; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">(ii) the discontinued nonconforming use, or discontinued part of that use:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>(A) may not be reestablished; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">(B) any subsequent use of any part of the land or structure previously used for the discontinued use, or discontinued part of that use, must conform to the regulations of the district in which the land or structure is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">(2) In accordance with Subtitle 7 {\u201cModifications and Continuances by Board\u201d} of this title, the Board may extend the time limit for discontinuance for 1 or more additional periods.

This ordinance repealed BCZC \u00a7 13-407(c), which provided that the provision relating to abandonment of use did not apply in the R-8 district. Accordingly, a nonconforming use in the R-8 distinct now is subject to elimination by abandonment of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">Subsequent Change in the Law</p>\n<p id=\"b483-16\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is based on the June 14, 2010, enactment of Ordinance 10-289. They maintain that \u201cthe Board and Circuit Court must be reversed [because] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>there has been a substantive change in the applicable law during the pendency of this matter.\u201d Appellants argue that \u201cthe repeal of the abandonment exception is a substantive change in the law\u201d that should be applied retroactively, and that the repeal \u201chas nullified the Board\u2019s decision and effectively removed the Board\u2019s authority over this matter.\u201d According to appellants, because the new rule considers a nonconforming use to be abandoned when use has ceased for a period of 24 months, and the W. 27th Street property has not been used as a restaurant in more than 24 months, this Court should vacate the Board\u2019s resolution, without remanding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Appellees, YIM and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d), disagree. They argue that the Board\u2019s resolution was not based solely on \u00a7 13-407(c). Rather, they assert, the Board found that the nonconforming use had not been discontinued or abandoned under BCZC \u00a7 13-407(b), and its finding that the \u00a7 13-407(c) exception would apply was solely an alternative finding. Accordingly, they argue that the elimination of the \u00a7 13-407(c) abandonment exception in the R-8 district does not negate the Board\u2019s approval of the continuation of the nonconforming use. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As set forth, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 13-407(c) provided an exception to the rule that the right to a nonconforming use could be lost if the use was discontinued for 12 consecutive months. It provided that the discontinuance or abandonment provision did not apply in certain districts, including the R-8 District in which the W. 27th Street property was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The subsequent repeal of this provision does not require reversal of the Board\u2019s decision. To be sure, the Board referenced the exception; it stated that if the evidence confirmed that the nonconforming use had been discontinued, the exception would apply. The Board, however, found that the \u201cuse had not been discontinued or abandoned.\u201d Thus, the change in the law did not impact the primary finding of the Board, and it does not require reversal of the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>III. Open Meetings</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Appellants next contend that the Board\u2019s resolution must be reversed because its \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the October 20, 2009[,] Resolution were not adopted in accordance with Article 66B and the Open Meetings Act.\u201d They assert the following violations of the Open Meetings Act: (1) \u201c[tjhere was never a public open meeting at which the Board adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of law contained in the Resolution\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Resolution is not signed by the Board Members and contains material that was not presented to or discussed in public by the Board\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe Board\u2019s only public deliberation and vote on the application, which took place five weeks before the Resolution was issued, was minimal at best and was conducted with one member absent but participating via conference telephone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">YIM and the City contend that the Board did not violate the provisions of the Open Meetings Act or Article 66B. They note that the Board held a public meeting regarding the permit on September 15, 2009. They argue that appellants\u2019 challenges to the propriety of the Board\u2019s deliberations and the lack of an \u201capproval signature\u201d have no basis in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A. Statutory Requirements for Open Meetings</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The Open Meetings Act is codified in S.G. \u00a7 10-501 et seq. and is applicable to meetings of \u201cpublic bodies.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> According to S.G. \u00a7 10\u2014502(g), the term \u201cmeet\u201d \u201cmeans to convene a quorum of a public body for the consideration or transaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>public business.\u201d The requirements of the Act apply when a public body meets to consider \u201cgranting a license or permit\u201d or \u201ca special exception, variance, conditional use, zoning classification, the enforcement of any zoning law or regulation, or any other zoning matter.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-503(b)(1)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Open Meetings Act is based on the philosophy that public business should be performed in a public manner, which is accessible to interested citizens, and that this type of open government is \u201c \u2018essential to the maintenance of a democratic society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Handley v. Ocean Downs, LLC, </em>151 Md.App. 615, 633, 827 A.2d 961 (2003) (quoting S.G. \u00a7 10-501(a)). \u201cSuch open government \u2018ensures the accountability of government to the citizens of the State[,] ... increases the faith of the public in government and enhances the effectiveness of the public in fulfilling its role in a democratic society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting S.G. \u00a7 10-501(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">S.G. \u00a7 10-505 provides that, with certain exceptions, \u201ca public body shall meet in open session,\u201d and S.G. \u00a7 10-506 provides for advance notice of such a meeting. The Court of Appeals has explained the scope of the Open Meetings Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cWhile the Act does not afford the public any right to participate in the meetings, it does assure the public right to observe the deliberative process and the making of decisions by the public body at open meetings. In this regard, it is clear that the Act applies, not only to final decisions made by the public body exercising legislative functions at a public meeting, but as well to all deliberations which precede the actual legislative act or decision, unless authorized by [\u00a7 10-508] to be closed to the public. * * * It is ... the deliberative and decision-making process in its entirety which must be conducted in meetings open to the public since every step of the process, including the final decision itself, constitutes the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\"><em>Cmty. &amp; Labor United for Balt. Charter Comm. v. Balt. City Bd. of Elections, </em>377 Md. 183, 193, 832 A.2d 804 (2003) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(quoting <em>New Carrollton v. Rogers, </em>287 Md. 56, 72, 410 A.2d 1070 (1980)). Pursuant to \u00a7 10-510(c), \u201cit is presumed that the public body did not violate any provision of this subtitle, and the complainant has the burden of proving the violation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIk\">Article 66B \u00a7 2.08(b) sets forth the specific requirements for meetings conducted by the Board. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\">(b) <em>Rules; meetings; administering oaths; summoning witnesses; </em>records.\u2014(1) The Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall adopt rules in accordance with any ordinance adopted under this article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">(2) Meetings of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall be held at the call of the chairman and at other times determined by the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(3) (i) The chairman of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals or, in the chairman\u2019s absence, the acting chairman may administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(ii) All meetings of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall be open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">(iii) 1. The Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall keep minutes of its proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">2. The minutes shall include the vote of each member on each question, or the member\u2019s absence or failure to vote.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">3. The Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately filed in the office of the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">4. The records of the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals shall be open to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">There is no dispute here that the public was permitted to observe the Board as it discussed whether to approve YIM\u2019s nonconforming use permit. Appellants nevertheless assert two reasons why there was a violation of the Open Meetings Act and Article 66B: (1) the Resolution was not signed by all the Board members; and (2) one Board member was not present during deliberations and participated via speakerphone.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>B. Resolution Signed by the Executive Director</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Appellants argue that the Resolution is not a finding of the Board. In particular, they argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">[TJhere was no approval by signature, as the Board members <em>never signed </em>the Resolution issued on their behalf on October 20, 2009. This fact, together with the brevity and limited subject matter of the Board\u2019s deliberation on September 15, 2009, make it impossible to verify that the Board ever \u201cadopted\u201d the Resolution. Despite the statement in the Resolution that the Board had \u201cadopted\u201d the eight (8)-page Resolution on September 15, 2009, to be sure the Resolution was not \u201cadopted\u201d on that day and was never subsequently adopted in any public open meeting. Stated another way, the contents of the October 20, 2009[,J Resolution were never the subject of <em>any </em>motion adopted in public by the Board. The Resolution of October 20, 2009[,J is verifiably the act of [Mr.] Tanner, not the zoning body charged with considering nonconforming uses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Appellants cite two cases in support of their contention: (1) <em>Wesley Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n v. Baltimore County, </em>347 Md. 125, 699 A.2d 434 (1997); and (2) <em>Armstrong v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>409 Md. 648, 976 A.2d 349 (2009). Neither case supports appellants\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In <em>Wesley Chapel, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the Baltimore County Board of Appeals violated the Open Meetings Article in affirming the approval of a development plan without conducting its deliberations in public. 347 Md. at 134, 149, 699 A.2d 434. In that case, however, the Board of Appeals specifically denied a request to conduct its deliberations in public based on its determination that appeals of development plans did not involve \u201cother zoning matters\u201d subject to the Open Meetings Act. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 699 A.2d 434. The Court of Appeals disagreed, but there is no indication in the opinion that where, as here, the Board does deliberate in an open meeting, a subsequent written Resolution signed by less than all of the Board members violates the Open Meetings Act or Article 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Similarly, appellants\u2019 reliance on <em>Armstrong </em>is misplaced. The Court of Appeals\u2019 holding in that case did not address the Open Meetings claim on the merits, finding it moot in light of the subsequent enactment of a retroactively applied ordinance. <em>Armstrong, </em>409 Md. at 670, 976 A.2d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In this case, the Board heard testimony at a public meeting, and it subsequently conducted its deliberations in a public meeting, during which the Board voted. Appellants have cited no authority for the proposition that a Resolution subsequently signed by the Executive Director is not valid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, appellants have failed to meet their burden of showing a violation of the Open Meetings Act or Article 66B based on the fact that the Resolution was not signed by all the Board members.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">C. Participation by Speaker Phone</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Appellants next argue that a Board member\u2019s participation in the hearing by speaker phone is not authorized by the Open Meetings Act or Article 66B. They argue that both statutes refer to the \u201cpresence\u201d of the members of a public body, and that \u201cpresence\u201d is commonly understood to mean physical presence. They assert that allowing \u201cpresence\u201d at a meeting to be \u201climited to a disembodied voice, is to allow the public to observe only a part of the meeting, and not the meeting in its entirety as promised by the Open Meetings Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">YIM and the City argue that \u201cthere is no provision in the Open Meetings Act that prohibits a member of the Board from participating in the deliberations and votfing]\u201d when not physically present. They assert that \u201cthe Act merely requires that citizens be allowed to observe the performance of public officials and the deliberations and decisions of the public body,\u201d a requirement the Board complied with when it broad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>cast the Board Member\u2019s participation via speaker phone. They further argue that, even if the vote of the person voting by phone was not counted, \u201cthe result in this matter would have been the same because three of the remaining four members voted for the continuation of the nonconforming use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Some states have specifically addressed whether participation in a meeting by speakerphone or other technology is permissible under their Open Meetings laws. <em>See </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 44.62.312 (2010) (Open Meetings Act permits teleconferencing for \u201cthe convenience of the .parties, the public, and the governmental units conducting the meetings.\u201d); Cal. Gov\u2019t Code \u00a7 11123 (2010) (Open Meetings Act permits public meetings via teleconference \u201cfor the benefit of the public and state body,\u201d provided \u201c[a]t least one member of the state body shall be physically present at the location specified in the notice of the meeting\u201d); D.C.Code \u00a7 2-576 (2011) (a \u201cmeeting may be held by video conference, telephone conference, or other electronic means\u201d); GaGode Ann. \u00a7 50-14-1(f) (2011) (permitting meetings by telecommunications conference); Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 61.826 (2011) (meetings via teleconference permitted under Open Meetings Act); N.Y. Pub. Off. Law \u00a7 103 (2011) (meetings via videoconferencing permitted, provided the \u201cpublic body that uses videoconferencing to conduct its meetings shall provide an opportunity to attend, listen and observe at any site at which a member participates\u201d); Tex. Gov\u2019t.Code Ann. \u00a7 551.127 (2010) (meeting by videoconference call permitted if, among other requirements, \u201ca quorum of the governmental body is physically present at one location of the meeting,\u201d and each location had \u201ctwo-way communication with each other location during the entire meeting\u201d). <em>See also </em>2011 Ala. Pub. Act 159 (establishing a Joint Interim Legislative Committee on Open Meetings Legislation to study \u201cthe drafting of a new or revised Act that will allow for meetings of public boards and agencies by teleconference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act and Article 66B, by contrast, do not expressly address the use of telephone conference or other technology to conduct meetings. The lack of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>authorization to engage in this procedure, however, does not mean that it is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act defines \u201cmeet\u201d as \u201cto convene a quorum of a public body for the consideration or transaction of public business.\u201d S.G. \u00a7 10-502(g).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cConvene\u201d is defined as follows: (1) \u201cTo call together; to cause to assemble.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 355 (8th ed. 2004); and (2) \u201cto come together in a body,\u201d \u201cto summon before a tribunal,\u201d or \u201cto cause to assemble.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 286 (1987). \u201cAssemble\u201d means \u201cto bring together (as in a particular place or for a particular purpose).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Article 66B refers to the Board members being \u201cpresent\u201d to vote to reverse a decision of an administrative officer. Art. 66B \u00a7 2.08(i)(1) and (2). The term \u201cpresent\u201d is defined as: \u201cIn attendance; not elsewhere.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, <em>supra </em>at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Although the language of these statutes suggests physical presence, we believe the term \u201cpresent\u201d and \u201cconvene\u201d can encompass participation through the use of technology. We find the analysis discussed in <em>Freedom Oil Co. v. Illinois Pollution Control Board, </em>275 Ill.App.3d 508, 211 Ill.Dec. 801, 655 N.E.2d 1184, 1191 (1995) instructive in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In <em>Freedom Oil, </em>the Illinois Appellate Court addressed whether the use of telephone conferences fell within the definition of a meeting under the Open Meetings Act. <em>Id., </em>211 Ill.Dec. 801, 655 N.E.2d at 1189. The Illinois Open Meetings Act defined \u201cmeeting\u201d as \u201ca gathering of a quorum.\u201d <em>Id., </em>211 Ill.Dec. 801, 655 N.E.2d at 1190. The court found persuasive an opinion by the Attorney General, which found: (1) although a \u201cgathering\u201d suggests \u201cphysical coming together of persons,\u201d with the existing technology, \u201ca group of persons may come together by \u2018non-corporal\u2019 means as well\u201d; (2) where \u201ca tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>phone conference call is broadcast over a speakerphone so the broadcast is open to members of the public ... accessibility of the public is satisfied\u201d; and (3) \u201ca meeting held by telephone conference ... complies with the Open Meetings Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The court noted that specific statutory authority to conduct some meetings by telephone conference was not required. <em>Id. </em>The court emphasized that the Illinois Pollution Control Board complied with the applicable rules necessary to hold a hearing, including posting public notice of the hearing and keeping minutes, and it noted that there was no evidence that the complaining party was unable to hear the telephone conference. <em>Id., 211 </em>Ill.Dec. 801, 655 N.E.2d at 1191. Accordingly, it rejected the argument that the Board had no authority to conduct a meeting by telephone conference. <em>Id., 211 </em>Ill.Dec. 801, 655 N.E.2d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The Michigan Court of Appeals similarly found no violation of the state\u2019s Open Meetings Act by administrative hearings via telephone conference calls. <em>Goode v. Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>143 Mich.App. 756, 373 N.W.2d 210, 212 (1985). The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\u201cWe find no problem with the holding of hearings via teleconference calls. Such calls are heard through speaker phones and are audible to all in the room. Persons who wish to attend the hearing are allowed to do so and may attend at either location. The conference call set-up actually increases the accessibility of the public to attend, as now more than one location is open to the public. While we recognize that to actually see and observe all the witnesses and the hearing officer is desirable, we do not find it necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\"><em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted), <em>leave to appeal denied, </em>424 Mich. 874, 380 N.W.2d 42 (1986). <em>See also Clausing v. State, </em>90 Wash. App. 863, 955 P.2d 394, 400 n. 6 (although the Open Meetings Act did not apply, the court observed that, \u201c[i]n this modern technological era,\u201d \u201cvideo conferencing, internet conferencing, and telephone conference calls\u201d are methods that \u201callow persons to be \u2018present\u2019 to one another without the demands often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>required to achieve physical presence.\u201d), <em>review denied, </em>136 Wash.2d 1020, 969 P.2d 1063 (1998). <em>See also </em>Office of the Attorney General, <em>Open Meetings Act Manual </em>7-8 (4th ed. 2000) (\u201ca telephone conference call in which a quorum of members is conducting business simultaneously ... is a \u2018meeting,\u2019 \u201d but the public must have access to the discussion via speakerphone).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">We agree with this reasoning. There is nothing in Maryland\u2019s Open Meetings Act or Article 66B that prohibits a meeting with one or more members participating by telephone conference, as long as the conference call is broadcast over a speakerphone so it can be heard by members of the public. Such a meeting satisfies the requirement of accessibility to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In this case, the Board member who was not physically present participated via speakerphone, and there is no indication that anyone was unable to hear her comments. To the contrary, appellants\u2019 self-transcribed transcript indicates that the Board member was audible to those who attended the hearing. Accordingly, we hold that the Board did not violate the Open Meetings Act or Article 66B in approving YIM\u2019s nonconforming use permit where one voting member was present by speaker phone.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellants contend that \u201cthe Board and Circuit Court may not be affirmed, when the finding of the Resolution that the nonconforming use at issue had not been \u2018discontinued\u2019 contradicted the undisputed testimony and was unsupported by competent evidence.\u201d They argue that the property owner\u2019s undisputed testimony at the hearing was that operations of the restaurant had ceased at the end of May 2008, and the only evidence of a restaurant operating after that date was an affidavit submitted by Mr. Raghubar, which stated that Mr. Raghubar had managed events at the restaurant in April, May, and June 2009. Appellants assert that the Board\u2019s reliance on the affidavit was inappropriate because: (1) it contradicted the testimony of Mr. Goldberg stating that restaurant operations had ceased in June 2008; (2) it was submitted after the hearing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">YIM contends that the Board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence. Initially, it notes that \u201cthe tenant filed a use permit application on May 11, 2009, within 12 months of the date that Appellants[ ] claim the nonconforming use ceased.\u201d It argues that, \u201c[b]ased on this fact alone, the Court should uphold the finding of fact that this property contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>long-standing nonconforming restaurant use that was not discontinued or abandoned.\u201d YIM further points to the affidavit of Mr. Raghubar, \u201cwho stated that he was the manager of the restaurant from January 2009 through June of 2009.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The City similarly contends that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. It emphasizes that city records established that the W. 27th Street property was used as a restaurant beginning \u201cseveral years before the enactment of the 1971 comprehensive zoning ordinance\u201d and that the use was a lawful nonconforming use. The City further states that none of the people opposing the use permit \u201cpresented <em>any </em>evidence showing that the nonconforming use had been either discontinued or abandoned.\u201d Finally, the City argues that the testimony of Mr. Goldberg established that, \u201cbut for the error committed by an employee in the zoning office in May[ ] 2009, a permit would have been issued earlier in accordance with the lease entered into soon after the Two Sisters Bar and Grille had vacated the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">As indicated, the BCZC provides that, where \u201cthe active and continuous operation\u201d of the \u201cnonconforming use ... has been discontinued for 12 consecutive months,\u201d the discontinuance constitutes an abandonment of the use, and the discontinued nonconforming use may not be reestablished. BCZC \u00a7 13-407(a). A determination whether a use has been discontinued is a \u201c \u2018question of fact not of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peck v. Balt. County, </em>286 Md. 368, 374, 410 A.2d 7 (1979) (quoting G. Thompson, Real Property \u00a7 443 (J. Grimes ed. 1961)). We must affirm the Board\u2019s conclusion if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Critical Area Comm\u2019n v. Moreland, LLC, </em>418 Md. 111, 122, 12 A.3d 1223 (2011) (\u201cOur role in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, such as the Board of Appeals, is \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 571, 873 A.2d 1145).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Here, Mr. Goldberg testified that the property had not been used as a restaurant since Two Sisters left at the end of May 2008. YIM contends, however, that its application for a use permit in May 2009, within 12 months of the date appellants claim the nonconforming use ceased, supports the Board\u2019s finding that the restaurant use was not discontinued or abandoned. It cites no law, however, in support of its assertion that a permit application would constitute \u201cactive and continuous operation\u201d of restaurant use.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">To be sure, the application for a use permit, as well as obtaining the permit for interior painting and the efforts to obtain a tenant, is relevant to the determination of discontinuance of the nonconforming use of the property as a restaurant if a finding of discontinuance requires an intent by the owner to abandon the use. Intent, however, is not dispositive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Generally, a finding of abandonment requires the \u201cconcurrence of two factors, (a) an intention to abandon and (b) some overt act, or some failure to act, which carries the implication that the owner does not claim or retain any interest in the subject matter.\u201d <em>Dorman v. Mayor and City Council of Balt., </em>187 Md. 678, 684, 51 A.2d 658 (1947). In this case, however, BCZC \u00a7 13-407 specifically provides that the cessation of \u201cactive and continuous operations of any ... non conforming use ... for 12 months\u201d constitutes an abandonment of the use \u201cregardless of any reservation of an intent to resume active operations or otherwise not abandon the use.\u201d Thus, even if the application for the permit and the efforts to get a new tenant are inconsistent with an intent to abandon the restaurant use, the intent to abandon is not an issue for us to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>As indicated, however, a finding of abandonment requires \u201csome overt act, or some failure to act, which carries the implication that the owner does not claim or retain any interest in the subject matter.\u201d <em>Dorman, </em>187 Md. at 684, 51 A.2d 658. If there is a \u201cfailure of action for a sufficient period of time, then the owner has lost his right to the non-conforming use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Abandonment in this context \u201cfocuses not on the owner\u2019s intent, but rather, on whether the owner failed to use the property as a nonconforming use in the time period specified in the zoning ordinance.\u201d <em>Trip </em>Assocs., 392 Md. at 577, 898 A.2d 449. The abandonment or discontinuance, however, \u201cmust be active and actual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, there was not a failure to act for 12 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">YIM introduced evidence demonstrating its efforts to obtain alternate tenants, including signing a lease with Mr. Weishaus in December 2008, and, after the community had an acrimonious meeting with Mr. Weishaus, signing a new lease with Mr. D\u2019Souza. YIM filed two permit applications, one in March 2009 for interior and exterior painting and repair of drop ceiling tile, and one on May 11, 2009, for a continuation of a restaurant use permit. All of these efforts were made within twelve months of the prior restaurant closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Under these circumstances, the Board properly could find there was not an \u201cactive and actual\u201d abandonment or discontinuation after Two Sisters closed at the end of May 2008. There was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s Resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Modification</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Appellants\u2019 final contention is that the \u201cBoard and Circuit Court may not be affirmed[ ] when the October 20, 2009[,] Resolution unlawfully modified the prior nonconforming use of the first floor or a portion thereof, and created ambiguity as to the portion of the first floor to be authorized for \u2018continued\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>use as a \u2018restaurant.\u2019 \u201d They maintain that the Resolution could not constitute an approval of a continued nonconforming use of the W. 27th Street property because the Resolution divided the space into two distinct commercial uses\u2014a restaurant and a bakery\u2014whereas the property previously had been approved to operate as a single commercial entity\u2014a kitchen to make baked goods as an \u201caccessory to the existing tavern.\u201d Accordingly, they maintain that the Board\u2019s Resolution was an unlawful modification of a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We agree with YIM and the City that this contention is without merit. The Board\u2019s finding was that \u201cthe use of this property as a restaurant ... can continue.\u201d YIM did not request, and the Board did not grant, any modification to the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

The questions presented by appellants in their brief, although not phrased as questions, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-12\">1.

The Board and Circuit Court may not be affirmed, when the finding of the Resolution that the nonconforming use at issue had not been \u201cdiscontinued'' contradicted the undisputed testimony and was unsupported by competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">4. The Board and the Circuit Court may not be affirmed, when the October 20, 2009 Resolution unlawfully modified the prior nonconforming use of the first floor or a portion thereof, and created ambiguity as to the portion of the first floor to be authorized for \u201ccontinued\u201d use as a \"restaurant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\">. On February 20, 2007, the Board adopted a Resolution approving the use of the kitchen in the existing tavern at the W. 27th Street property for the preparation of baked goods, stating that the use of the kitchen was \"accessory to the existing tavern.\u201d On February 20, 2008, referencing the 2007 action, the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development approved the Use and Occupancy Permit application for a retail bakery. A Certificate of Occupancy was issued on May 21, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b472-9\">. In a letter dated July 30, 2009, in response to a request by YIM\u2019s attorney, Mr. Geoffrey Veale, the Acting Zoning Administrator, explained the process related to the May 11, 2009, permit application. Because the application requested that the second floor of the W. 27th Street property be used as a tavern, and because the second floor had never been approved to operate a tavern, the application was determined to be a request for an expansion of a nonconforming use that would have to be approved by the Board. The letter further explained that the zoning office received a call from a community representative on June 4, 2009, advising that the tavern had lost its liquor license and that the use of the property as a tavern has been discontinued for more than 12 months. A staff member was advised to \"tag\u201d YIM's application \"until the issue of the discontinuance of the nonconforming use was resolved,\u201d but the application \"was inadvertently voided instead.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\">.
