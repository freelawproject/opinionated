During the commission of those crimes, an employee of McDonald\u2019s was pistol whipped and a customer shot at by the robbers. Fleeing in a stolen minivan, the three men were arrested when their vehicle collided with two other vehicles and then crashed into a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>The State\u2019s Attorney for Anne Arundel County filed a twenty-three count criminal information charging appellant, as an adult, with numerous violent offenses, including armed robbery, first-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and attempted murder. Appellant, in response, requested what is known as a \u201creverse waiver.\u201d That is, he asked that his case be transferred to juvenile court. That request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Thereafter, the circuit court, at the conclusion of a bench trial, convicted appellant of thirteen offenses, including armed robbery, first- and second-degree assault, theft, and use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence and sentenced him to a total term of forty years\u2019 imprisonment, granting him credit for time served and suspending all but thirteen years of that sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Appellant claims that the circuit court both erred and abused its discretion in denying his motion for reverse waiver. We disagree and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The court below requested a waiver report from the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services (\u201cDJS\u201d), to assist it in deciding appellant\u2019s motion for reverse waiver. That report and the evidence adduced at the reverse waiver hearing alleged that, on October 10, 2008, at about 8:30 a.m., appellant \u00e1nd two others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> robbed a McDonald\u2019s restaurant and several of its customers in Glen Burnie, Maryland. All three assailants wore masks and wielded handguns, although at least one of the weapons may have been an air pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Upon entering the McDonald\u2019s, the robbers ordered the customers to the floor. Jumping over the counter, appellant \u00e1nd one of the two other males demanded that the store manager, Rebecca Maxson, take them to the safe. Then, seizing Ms. Maxson\u2019s cell phone, appellant struck her in the face with his weapon, knocking her into a wall and onto the floor. One of the robbers took a purse from a customer, Yewande Akinrodoye, and a second robber fired a shot at another customer, Teodora Contreras, as she tried to flee the restaurant. The bullet did not wound Contreras, although it left a bullet-hole in her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">The robbers then fled in a stolen minivan and were apprehended when it struck two other vehicles and ultimately crashed into a tree. Police recovered, from the getaway vehicle, a loaded .22 caliber revolver, with two spent rounds, and ah unloaded Smith &amp; Wesson pistol, with its serial number scratched off. They also found an air pistol on the ground, behind the left front tire. Appellant was then only nine months short of his eighteenth birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The Reverse Waiver Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Prior to trial, appellant filed a motion for \u201creverse waiver\u201d pursuant to Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-202 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d), and Maryland Rule 4-252(c). At the hearing on that motion, appellant called two witnesses: Ms. Kenya Johnson, a Case Management Specialist with the DJS, who had prepared the waiver report, recommending against reverse waiver, and his mother, Nicole Allen.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The waiver report listed, under the heading \u201cLegal Incidents,\u201d an alleged car jacking and armed robbery involving appellant that took place on April 26, 2007. A subheading entitled \u201cAdjudicated Offense\u201d was blank. During her investigation, Ms. Johnson learned that appellant had been acquitted of those charges. Appellant\u2019s counsel questioned Ms. Johnson about an \u201cadjustment\u201d that had been made to the report, reflecting this acquittal. The revised DJS report, which is not in the record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> apparently indicated that the charges arising from the April 26, 2007 incident had been dismissed. In any event, under questioning by appellant\u2019s counsel, Ms. Johnson conceded that appellant had been acquitted of the earlier charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The \u201cLegal Incidents\u201d section of the report further showed that appellant had been previously charged, as a juvenile, with trespass, malicious burning, CDS possession, CDS distribution, second-degree assault, and \u201cDeadly Weapon Misdemean- or.\u201d The trespass charge was resolved at intake; the other charges were dismissed. He was, however, adjudicated delinquent for a second-degree assault that occurred on December 11, 2007 and was placed on probation for six months. The conditions of that probation required that he have no contact with the victim and that he re-enroll in school, as by that time, he had been expelled from school for truancy. Under the heading \u201cYouth\u2019s Amenability to Treatment! ],\u201d the report stated that appellant\u2019s \u201cprobation was successfully terminated in 08/2008.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">In preparing the waiver report, Ms. Johnson met with appellant, who then was incarcerated and awaiting trial. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\u201casked him what occurred on [October 10, 2008.]\u201d When, at that meeting, the question arose whether he had wielded a BB gun during the robbery on that date, Ms. Johnson advised appellant to consult his attorney. On the stand, she initially stated that her report relied only on the police report for information, regarding the robbery, but later conceded that she also considered the conversation she had had with appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The DJS report, as noted, recommended against reverse waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Appellant\u2019s mother, Nicole Allen, took the stand next. During her examination, she opined that appellant was extremely immature for his age and indicated that he was failing in school. Appellant\u2019s school records disclosed that he had been expelled from school, that the highest grade he had completed was the 8th grade, that in standardized testing he performed at or below the 20th percentile, and that he had never achieved a grade higher than C.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s reverse waiver motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Waiver and Reverse Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Waiver is the transfer of jurisdiction from juvenile court to circuit court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The purposes of juvenile court contrast sharply with those of the circuit court. The focus of adjudication in juvenile court is \u201cto provide for a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation consistent with the child\u2019s best interests and the protection of the public interest.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-8A-02(a)(4). Although one of the purposes of sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>in the criminal justice system is rehabilitation, it also has, as purposes, punishment and deterrence, neither of which is a stated purpose of the juvenile act. <em>See, e.g., State v. Dopkowski, </em>325 Md. 671, 679, 602 A.2d 1185 (1992) (listing objectives of sentencing in criminal proceeding as \u201cpunishment, deterrence and rehabilitation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Generally, when a minor is accused of conduct which, if committed by an adult, constitutes a crime, original jurisdiction over the child lies in juvenile court. Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-8A-03(a)(1) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d). Under limited circumstances, a juvenile court may, either <em>sua sponte </em>or on the State\u2019s motion, waive its jurisdiction over a delinquency petition. CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(a); Md. Rule 11-113 a. If a juvenile court waives jurisdiction, \u201cthe court shall order the child held for trial under the regular procedures of the court which would have jurisdiction over the offense if committed by an adult,\u201d and the delinquency petition would then \u201cbe considered a charging document.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Before deciding whether to waive jurisdiction, a juvenile court must hold a hearing, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3-8A-06(b), during which it is to weigh five statutory criteria \u201cindividually and in relation to each other on the record\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">(1) Age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">(2) Mental and physical condition of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">(3) The child\u2019s amenability to treatment in any institution, facility, or program available to delinquents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">(4) The nature of the offense and the child\u2019s alleged participation in it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">(5) The public safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-12\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-8A-06(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-13\">The juvenile court may not waive jurisdiction \u201cunless it determines, from a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing, that the child is an unfit subject for juvenile rehabilitative measures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-8A-06(d)(1). The burdens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>of production and persuasion fall on the State. <em>Whaley v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 429, 443 n. 10, 974 A.2d 951 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">If, however, the child is at least fourteen years old and is charged with an offense \u201cwhich, if committed by an adult, would be a crime punishable by death or life imprisonment,\u201d the juvenile court lacks original jurisdiction; instead, such an offense, and \u201call other charges against the child arising out of the same incident,\u201d must be filed in the circuit court. C J \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(1). If the child is at least sixteen years old, and the crimes alleged fall within a somewhat broader category of serious offenses, including attempted second-degree murder, robbery, first-degree assault, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, the same jurisdictional rule applies. CJ \u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In all such cases in which original jurisdiction lies in the circuit court, the juvenile may request the circuit court to waive its jurisdiction (\u201creverse waiver\u201d) and send the matter to juvenile court. In such a proceeding, the juvenile bears the burden of persuasion. CP \u00a7 4-202; <em>Whaley, </em>186 Md.App. at 444, 974 A.2d 951. Because appellant was accused of crimes that fall within CJ \u00a7\u00a7 3-8A-03(d)(1) and (4), and, at the time of the offenses, was older than sixteen, he was charged in the circuit court, precipitating his request for a reverse waiver under CP \u00a7 4-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Like motions for waiver, motions for reverse waiver require a hearing before any decision to grant or deny the motion is made. CP \u00a7 4-202(f);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Md. Rule 4-252(g)(2)(B) (\u201cA motion to transfer jurisdiction of an action to the juvenile court shall be determined within 10 days after the hearing on the motion.\u201d). And, as in waiver proceedings, a court, considering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>reverse waiver motion, must weigh five factors, which are nearly identical to the five factors to be weighed in the context of a waiver proceeding. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">(1) the age of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">(2) the mental and physical condition of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">(3) the amenability of the child to treatment in an institution, facility, or program available to delinquent children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">(4) the nature of the alleged crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">(5) the public safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">CP \u00a7 4-202(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The five factors to be weighed in both proceedings differ only in one respect: while the waiver statute requires a juvenile court to weigh not only \u201cthe nature of the offense,\u201d but also \u201cthe child\u2019s alleged participation in it,\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(e)(4), the reverse waiver statute requires a circuit court merely to weigh \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime,\u201d CP \u00a7 4-202(d)(4), omitting \u201cthe child\u2019s alleged participation in it\u201d as a part of that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">In addition to this one factoral distinction, waivers and reverse waivers differ in one more way: while the waiver statute carries a presumption \u201cthat the child committed the delinquent act alleged,\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(d)(2), the reverse waiver statute is silent as to that point. In <em>Whaley, </em>186 Md.App. at 444-49, 974 A.2d 951, we examined the legislative history surrounding this omission in the reverse waiver statute and determined that, as a result of this legislative omission, in a reverse waiver hearing, it was legal error for a court to presume the child\u2019s guilt of the alleged offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 974 A.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-12\">The Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b33-13\">Appellant contends that the circuit court impermissibly considered non-statutory criteria in denying his motion for reverse waiver. The court, he maintains, \u201cimproperly considered [his] alleged participation in the crimes charged and [his] inculpatory custodial statement\u201d to the DJS Case Management Specialist, Kenya Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Relying on <em>Whaley, swpra, </em>he argues that the circuit court erroneously conflated the legal standards for waiver and reverse waiver and impermissibly presumed his guilt of the offenses charged in denying his reverse waiver request. He maintains, furthermore, that his statement to Ms. Johnson should have been preceded by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, because Ms. Johnson was, in effect, an agent of the State when she spoke with him, and he was, at that time, incarcerated. That the court impermissibly relied on that statement in denying his reverse waiver motion is a conclusion he reaches by extrapolating from the fact that it was incorporated into Ms. Johnson\u2019s report, a report that recommended denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Appellant also contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in weighing the statutory factors governing the motion for reverse waiver. Specifically, he claims that the court impermissibly gave undue weight to the \u201cnature of the alleged crime\u201d factor, citing <em>In re: Johnson, </em>17 Md.App. 705, 304 A.2d 859 (1973), a case in which this Court reversed a juvenile court\u2019s grant of the State\u2019s waiver motion on this ground; that the circuit court relied on \u201can incomplete and confused recommendation\u201d in the DJS report, which tainted the court\u2019s weighing of appellant\u2019s mental condition; and that it impermissibly considered appellant\u2019s domicile. As to this latter contention, appellant notes that the circuit court, in announcing its ruling on his reverse waiver motion, expressed \u201cdisappoint[ment]\u201d because appellant\u2019s file included \u201ca boat load of dismissals,\u201d and speculated that a possible reason was the \u201chuge volume of cases\u201d from Baltimore City, where appellant lives and where the dismissals occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The State counters that \u201c[n]owhere in its ruling ... did the circuit court indicate that it was assuming [appellant] to be guilty of the alleged charges, [but] [r]ather, under [CP \u00a7] 4-202(d)(4), the court looked to the nature of the alleged offenses, taking into account the level of [appellant\u2019s] alleged participation in the charges.\u201d As for appellant\u2019s claim that the circuit court impermissibly relied on his statement to Ms. Johnson, the State responds that \u201cthere is no indication that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>[the] circuit court relied upon any statements by [appellant], ... or that the opportunity that Ms. Johnson gave [him] to provide his version of the events resulted in information included in the waiver report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">As for appellant\u2019s claim that the court below abused its discretion in weighing the statutory factors, the State counters that \u201cthe circuit court identified and addressed seriatim the [\u00a7] 4-202(d) evaluation factors,\u201d as mandated by the statute. And, as for appellant\u2019s claim that the circuit court\u2019s mention of his numerous prior contacts with the juvenile system, resulting in dismissals, amounted to an improper \u201cbias against persons domiciled in Baltimore City,\u201d the State responds that the court merely \u201cindicated disappointment that there had been no earlier interaction with Gaines on a juvenile level,\u201d noting that the court \u201cstated that it was not finding fault based on the \u2018huge volume of cases\u2019 handled in Baltimore [C]ity, where Gaines resided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We begin our analysis with appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court considered non-statutory criteria in its weighing of the factors. As noted previously, the reverse waiver statute includes, among the factors to be weighed, \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime,\u201d CP \u00a7 4-202(d)(4), whereas the waiver statute includes as a factor \u201c[t]he nature of the offense and the child\u2019s alleged participation in it.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-8A-06(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">As to the \u201cnature of the alleged crime\u201d factor, <em>In re: Waters, </em>13 Md.App. 95, 281 A.2d 560 (1971), <em>disapproved on other grounds by In re: Anderson, </em>20 Md.App. 31, 40, 315 A.2d 540 (1974), is instructive. Although <em>Waters </em>was a waiver case, we recognized in <em>Whaley, supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 448 &amp; n. 15, 974 A.2d 951, that <em>Waters </em>explicates the proper standard to be used in weighing \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime\u201d in both waiver and reverse waiver cases. There, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">One of the factors to be considered is the nature of the offense, ... and we think this may encompass not only the type of crime but the circumstances surrounding its commission. That a victim was beaten or shot during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>course of a robbery in addition to having his property stolen is certainly of probative value on the question of waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">13 Md.App. at 104, 281 A.2d 560 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">As we shall explain in greater detail later, the circuit court\u2019s remarks in the instant case show that it was making every effort to avoid any consideration of the level of appellant\u2019s participation. But, even if the circuit court had weighed the level of appellant\u2019s alleged participation, it would not have erred in doing so. It is difficult, if not impossible, to consider \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime,\u201d which the court must do, without considering the actions taken by the alleged perpetrators to commit that crime. Thus, we do not interpret that factor in the reverse waiver statute as being completely divorced from consideration of the actions taken by the alleged perpetrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">It would be absurd to conclude that, in considering the nature of the offense, a juvenile court, in a waiver hearing, could consider the accused\u2019s level of participation in determining that he should be tried as an adult, but that a circuit court, in a reverse waiver hearing, cannot take into account the accused\u2019s level of participation in deciding that he should be transferred to juvenile court. Indeed, if appellant\u2019s strained interpretation of the \u201cnature of the alleged crime\u201d factor were to prevail, it would lead to unpalatable results. For example, in a case where a fourteen-year-old child has been induced by those older than he into acting as a lookout in an armed robbery that results in a felony murder, the court would be unable to consider his minor and limited role in the crime in deciding whether to grant a reverse waiver. That is a result that would serve neither the interests of the public, the juvenile, nor our system of justice. We do not believe the General Assembly intended such a rigid, inflexible interpretation of \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime\u201d and thus reject appellant\u2019s interpretation, since we \u201c \u2018avoid construing a statute in a way which would lead to absurd results.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. State, </em>187 Md.App. 1, 13, 975 A.2d 298 (2009) (quoting <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>We next address the \u201cpresumption of guilt\u201d issue. In <em>Whaley, supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 444-49, 974 A.2d 951, the case upon which appellant relies for the proposition that the court below improperly presumed his guilt, we analyzed the waiver and reverse waiver statutes and determined that, in a reverse waiver hearing, it was legal error for a court to presume the child\u2019s guilt of the alleged offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 974 A.2d 951. Because the circuit court, in that case, among other things, presumed the child\u2019s guilt in a reverse waiver hearing, we reversed and remanded for a new reverse waiver hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 450, 453, 974 A.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">But, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Whaley </em>is misplaced. There, during a reverse waiver hearing, the circuit court addressed the nature of the juvenile\u2019s offense, stating: \u201cSo for today\u2019s proceeding, I believe that Mr. State\u2019s Attorney is right, I am to assume that the charges as brought against the individual are true and that the allegations filed form the basis thereof are true, that\u2019s my role today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 439, 974 A.2d 951 (emphasis added). Then, explaining its denial of the defendant\u2019s reverse waiver motion, the court further remarked that \u201cthe facts that I have to accept is they apparently armed themselves in anticipation with BB guns, by mutual agreement approached a victim and [ ] when they attempted to rob the victim[,] the robbery failed and [they shot him in the face and head].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Although, in the instant case, the circuit court did preliminarily state: \u201cI take into account, not just the nature of the offense but the level of this person\u2019s participation[,] [m]eaning, Jamal Gaines\u2019 participation, I certainly take that into account,\u201d it ultimately recounted the facts of the robbery without attributing any of the acts specifically to appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">Now, in balancing the factors, I guess I have to say that I am basically overwhelmed by the brazen and callous nature of the crime. It[\u2019]s\u2014not that there is ever a good armed robbery, but this is about as bad as they get. It is a[n] armed robbery at 8:30 broad daylight at a McDonald\u2019s. Three young guys come in with guns and masks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Instead of just getting the money, they hop the counter, they\u2014one of them fires off a weapon, one of them strikes the manager or whoever the person was with knocking that person to the floor. Then there is this car chase out of the movies where without them ramming\u2014and it is a stolen vehicle too, I should point out, ramming into police cars and other cars and then taking off on foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">It is a very, very serious crime. Also, what weighs heavily on me is the threat to public safety. If someone was willing to do this at 8:30 in the morning in broad daylight and not only risk the lives of people in McDonald\u2019s but then risk the lives of the police officers and citizens on the road when they are trying to get away, they are just simply a threat to the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The circuit court did not state that it was presuming appellant\u2019s guilt in considering the nature of the alleged offense; rather, it objectively recounted the acts of the robbers, without expressing a presumption that appellant committed any particular act. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a description of the nature of the crime which took greater pains to avoid a presumption of appellant\u2019s guilt. Hence, we hold that the circuit court did not improperly presume appellant\u2019s guilt of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We turn next to appellant\u2019s assertion that the circuit court erred in relying on his conversation with the DJS Case Management Specialist, Ms. Johnson. Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that appellant\u2019s conversation with Ms. Johnson was an interrogation, we reject his assertion that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the circuit court\u2019s indirect reliance on his <em>un-Mirandized </em>statement to Ms. Johnson. Appellant misapprehends the function and purpose of the reverse waiver hearing. As we noted in <em>Waters, supra, </em>13 Md.App. at 103, 281 A.2d 560, \u201cthe sole function of the [waiver] hearing is to resolve the question of waiver vel non.\u201d The same is true of a reverse waiver hearing, which, like a waiver hearing, does not render \u00e1n adjudication but merely determines the forum where that is to be done.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>constitutional limitations on admissibility of evidence that govern criminal trials and adjudicatory hearings do not automatically apply to reverse waiver hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Moreover, although a court may, in its discretion, decline to require strict application of the Maryland Rules of Evidence in a waiver hearing, Md. Rule 5-101(c)(5),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, although the rules are silent as to reverse waiver hearings, because of the similarity in purpose shared by waiver and reverse waiver hearings, that is, both hearings are for the purpose of determining the appropriate adjudicatory forum, we conclude that the same rule applies to a circuit court holding a reverse waiver hearing. In short, the court may, in its discretion, decline to strictly apply the rules of evidence during a reverse waiver hearing, as it may during a waiver hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Applying this rule to the case at bar, the court below was not required, either on constitutional or other grounds, to strictly apply the rules of evidence at the reverse waiver hearing. At the hearing, the court had the discretion to consider all relevant information presented to it, including the entire waiver report. And, as appellant concedes, his remarks to Ms. Johnson were not introduced as evidence at his trial. In any event, the hearing judge\u2019s explanation for the denial of appellant\u2019s reverse waiver motion does not indicate any reliance on facts outside the police report<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the charging documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Next we consider appellant\u2019s claim that the circuit court abused its discretion in weighing the statutory factors. The circuit court addressed all of the relevant factors and carefully considered each one, stating at the outset: \u201cThese decisions are certainly not ones that I take lightly when I have a 17 year old, I guess he is probably 17 and 7 months at this point.\u201d At the time of the armed robbery, appellant was seventeen years and three months old, a factor that weighed against reverse waiver. Indeed, the court noted that he was \u201cgoing on 18,\u201d the age beyond which appellant would have been categorically ineligible for reverse waiver.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Brown v. State, </em>169 Md.App. 442, 450, 901 A.2d 846 (2006) (observing that age seventeen-and-a-half years \u201cwas a strong factor against transfer because the defendant was \u2018so close to being an adult\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">On the other hand, appellant\u2019s physical condition did not weigh strongly in either direction; the court stated: \u201cPhysical condition, he is not the biggest guy but he is not the smallest guy in the world, either, 5'10\", 135[lbs].\u201d Commenting that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201creally [didn\u2019t] have much on\u201d appellant\u2019s mental condition other than his mother\u2019s testimony that she had difficulty explaining things to him, the court noted that appellant struggled in reading, but \u201cdid well\u201d in math. As for amenability to treatment, the court was ambivalent, stating that it weighed \u201csort of\u2019 in appellant\u2019s favor, because he had done \u201cwell the one time he was on probation,\u201d although the court was troubled by his expulsion from school and subsequent idleness.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In weighing the nature of the offense and public safety, and, in balancing all the factors, the court declared that it was \u201coverwhelmed by the brazen and callous nature of the crime.\u201d As stated earlier, appellant participated in an armed holdup of a McDonald\u2019s at 8:80 in the morning. He and two others entered the restaurant wearing masks and brandishing what appeared to be handguns, although one of the weapons was an air pistol. One of the robbers discharged a handgun at one of the customers, nearly wounding her, while appellant pistol whipped the store manager, knocking her into a wall, when she apparently did not open the safe quickly enough. After fleeing the store on foot, the trio endangered police, bystanders, and other motorists by engaging in a car chase that concluded when their stolen getaway vehicle crashed into several cars and, finally, a tree. The court understandably felt that these facts established a substantial threat to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Claiming that the court gave too much weight to the \u201cnature of the alleged crime\u201d factor, appellant cites <em>Johnson, supra, </em>17 Md.App. 705, 304 A.2d 859. In that case, we reversed a juvenile court\u2019s waiver of jurisdiction on the ground that it gave undue weight to the seriousness of the alleged crime. Johnson, a sixteen-year-old who did not have a driver\u2019s license, had sought and been given permission by her twenty-one-year-old boyfriend to drive his car. Subsequently, she lost control of the vehicle, jumped a curb, and struck three children, killing one of them, a two-year-old child. Afterward, she and her boyfriend concocted an alibi claiming that he had been driving at the time of the fatal accident. Investigating police officers suspected that the story was false and confronted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>boyfriend with their suspicions and the contrary statements of witnesses, inducing him to recant and confess, thereby implicating Johnson. <em>Id. </em>at 709-10, 304 A.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Johnson was charged in a delinquency petition with manslaughter by automobile. The State moved for waiver, and the lower court granted the motion. We held that the lower court abused its discretion because it had based its decision \u201c <em>\u2018essentially on the very grievous nature of the </em>offense,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 711, 304 A.2d 859, and had afforded little or no weight to the juvenile\u2019s amenability to rehabilitation. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 304 A.2d 859. We also thought it anomalous that, after the court had waived its juvenile jurisdiction, the State, having just argued, successfully, that the juvenile posed a danger to the public, then recommended to the court that she be released on her own recognizance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The instant case, however, is factually much different from <em>Johnson. </em>In <em>Johnson, </em>we thought it \u201capparent,\u201d from the waiver report and the testimony of her pastor at the waiver hearing, that the child was \u201can ideal subject for the rehabilitative measures available from the Department of Juvenile Services,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 713, 304 A.2d 859, because, among other things, she was an above-average student who was \u201c \u2018very responsible and reliable,\u2019 \u201d was well-behaved, and was actively involved in school extra-curricular activities. <em>Id. </em>at 711, 304 A.2d 859. Here, in contrast, appellant has exhibited a pattern of increasingly serious brushes with the law, has performed poorly in school, and has been expelled for truancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Moreover, the crime charged in <em>Johnson, </em>manslaughter by automobile, albeit a very serious offense, pales in comparison to the crimes charged here, when we consider the conduct of the accused and not just the results of that conduct. Indeed, although the consequences of manslaughter are greater than those of the crimes charged in the instant case, manslaughter may, as in <em>Johnson, </em>involve less culpability than the crimes with which appellant was charged, as the mental state required for manslaughter is recklessness or gross negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>whereas the crimes alleged in the instant case involve intentional wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Not only is the degree of culpability alleged in the instant case far greater than that alleged in <em>Johnson, </em>the threat to public safety posed by appellant exceeds that posed by the juvenile in <em>Johnson. </em>The court, in weighing the threat to public safety, here, could properly weigh the possibility that a person who participates in a brazen daytime armed holdup is likely to engage in such activity in the future, if given the opportunity, whereas someone who commits manslaughter by automobile may be deemed less likely to repeat such behavior, at least under the circumstances in <em>Johnson, </em>where drugs and alcohol were not factors in what appeared to be a simple, but tragic, accident, resulting from a momentary loss of control over a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We discern no abuse of discretion in the circuit court\u2019s weighing of the statutory factors, and its ruling on appellant\u2019s reverse waiver motion was certainly not \u201cwell removed from any center mark imagined by [us],\u201d nor was it \u201cbeyond the fringe of what [we] deem[ ] minimally acceptable.\u201d <em>North v. North, </em>102 Md.App. 1, 14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994) (defining abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the circuit court abused its discretion in relying on \u201can incomplete and confused recommendation\u201d in the DJS report is wholly without merit. His counsel spent much of her time at the reverse waiver hearing attacking Ms. Johnson\u2019s report, claiming that her evaluation of his education was based largely on her interview with him, that she did not inquire into whether he was literate, that she \u201cdid not even attempt to obtain his medical records to ascertain whether or not he had a history of mental or emotional conditions,\u201d and that her testimony demonstrated a lack of understanding of the statutory factors regarding reverse waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The evidence that appellant introduced at the hearing consisted of his school records and his mother\u2019s testimony. The court carefully considered that evidence. Moreover, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>lant\u2019s counsel was given wide latitude in challenging the reliability of the DJS Report. The court repeatedly overruled the State\u2019s objections to the scope of appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s questioning of Ms. Johnson and permitted an extensive and wide ranging examination of Ms. Johnson by her. Moreover, as the <em>Whaley </em>Court observed, \u201c[without a favorable report from DJS, a reverse waiver request faces almost certain denial.\u201d 186 Md.App. at 449, 974 A.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Finally, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court abused its discretion by considering the fact that his domicile was in Baltimore City. In support of that claim, appellant cites the following portion of the hearing judge\u2019s remarks in announcing his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">I am always disappointed when I get cases where I see a boat load of dismissals. Now maybe there wasn\u2019t proof in all of them, I don\u2019t know. And this just seems to come from Baltimore City for some reason. And I am not faulting anyone there but they have a huge volume of cases. Maybe had someone interacted on a juvenile level with the young man earlier on, maybe he wouldn\u2019t find himself here right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">So, as far as the request for the reverse waiver, I am going to deny that request based on my review of all the factors. Okay, I am sorry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The judge merely remarked that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d because appellant\u2019s file included \u201ca boat load of dismissals\u201d and speculated that a possible reason was the \u201chuge volume of cases\u201d from Baltimore City,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> where appellant lives and where the dismissals occurred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The judge was merely expressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>his frustration over the lost opportunities to intervene earlier in appellant\u2019s life, possibly preventing what occurred in the present case: \u201cMaybe had someone interacted on a juvenile level with the young man earlier on, maybe he wouldn\u2019t find himself here right now.\u201d In expressing his dismay as to what effect an early intervention might have had in changing the course of appellant\u2019s life, the hearing judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\">. For Count 3, first-degree assault of Teodora Contreras, the court imposed a sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, suspending all but thirteen years of that sentence. A conviction of second-degree assault involving the same victim was merged for sentencing purposes. For Count 6, armed robbery of Rebecca Maxson, the court imposed a suspended sentence of twenty years, to be served consecutively to Count 3. Count 7, robbery of Ms. Maxson, was merged into Count 6. For Count 9, second-degree assault of Ms. Maxson, the court imposed a sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to be served concurrently with the other sentences. Count 11, theft from Ms. Maxson, was merged into Counts 6 and 7. For Count 12, armed robbery of Yewande Akinrodoye, the court imposed a suspended sentence of twenty years, to be served concurrently with all other sentences. Counts 13 (robbery of Ms. Akinrodoye), 15 (second-degree assault of Ms. Akinrodoye), and 17 (theft from Ms. Akinrodoye) were merged into Count 12. For Count 19, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, the court imposed a sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, suspending all but five (reflecting the mandatory minimum sentence), both portions of that sentence to be served concurrently with all other sentences. For Count 20, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, the court imposed a sentence identical to that for Count 19. Finally, for Count 23, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, the court imposed a suspended sentence of twenty years, to be served concurrently with all other sentences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b28-10\">.

In this regard, waiver proceedings are governed by a statute that addresses admissibility of reports such as the DJS report at issue in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>present case. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 3-8A--17(c) (\"The report of a study under this section is admissible as evidence at a waiver hearing and at a disposition hearing, but not at an adjudicatory hearing.

Although there is no corresponding section in the reverse waiver statute, it appears likely that on constitutional grounds a similar limitation applies. <em>See, e.g., Fare v.
