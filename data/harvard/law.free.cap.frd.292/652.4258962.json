VRATIL, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AP8\">Plaintiffs in <em>Rushing v. Ambest, Inc., </em>No. 06-7621-PJH (N.D.Cal.), <em>Lerner v. Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>No. 07-1216-GHK-FMO (C.D.Cal.), and <em>Wyatt v. B.P. America Corp., </em>No. 07-1754-BTM-JMA (S.D.Cal.), bring class action claims for damages and injunctive relief against defendants which own, operate or control gas stations in California. Plaintiffs claim that because defendants sell motor fuel for a specified price per gallon without disclosing or adjusting for temperature and its effects on motor fuel, they are liable under California law for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing <em>(Lerner), </em>unjust enrichment <em>(Lerner </em>and <em>Wyatt), </em>violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d), Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq. (Lerner, Rushing </em>and <em>Wyatt), </em>and violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedy Act (\u201cCLRA\u201d), Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1750 <em>et seq. (Rushing).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Under Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., plaintiffs ask the Court to certify a class of \u201cconsumers\u201d for their CLRA claims and a class of \u201cindividuals and entities\u201d for their other claims. Plaintiffs also ask the Court to model these classes after the dual class certification in similar Kansas cases. <em>See In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>279 F.R.D. 598 (D.Kan.2012); <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>271 F.R.D. 221 (D.Kan. 2010). That is, plaintiffs ask the Court to certify classes for injunctive relief under Rule 23(b)(2) and classes for liability issues under Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4). Plaintiffs propose that the Court bifurcate questions of liability (to be determined in Phase I) and relief (to be determined in Phase II if necessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Chevron is a defendant in each of the three California eases. It insists that it is unique among codefendants and would be prejudiced by a joint tidal. The Court therefore ordered the parties to show cause why it should not \u201csever all claims against Chevron in these cases, remand the claims to their respective transferor courts with a view to transferring claims in two of the cases to one district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), consolidate the three cases against Chevron for all future proceedings and temporarily stay all proceedings as to the other non-settling California defendants.\u201d <em>Order To Show Cause </em>(Doc. # 4520) filed March 12, 2013. No party objected to severing plaintiffs\u2019 claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>against Chevron for consolidation and trial. <em>See Defendant Chevron U.S.A. Inc.\u2019s Response To Order To Show Cause </em>(Doc. # 4524) filed March 15, 2013.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 27, 2013, the Court severed plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Chevron in these three California cases and stayed proceedings as to the other non-settling defendants. <em>Order </em>(Doc. # 4535)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, though its reasoning applies equally to other defendants in the California cases, this class certification order is limited to plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">This matter is before the Court on plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification in <em>Rushing, Lerner </em>and <em>Wyatt, </em>including supplemental briefing which the Court recently ordered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For reasons stated below, the Court sustains plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification as to Chevron.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\n<em>Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">The class action is an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of individual named parties only. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2541, 2550, 180 L.Ed.2d 374 (2011) (quoting <em>Califano v. Yamasaki </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S.Ct. 2545, 61 L.Ed.2d 176 (1979)). The Court has considerable discretion in making class certification decisions. <em>See Tabor v. Hilti, Inc., </em>703 F.3d 1206, 1227-28 (10th Cir.2013) (because class certification involves \u201cintensely practical considerations,\u201d decision lies within discretion of trial court); <em>see also Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., </em>623 F.3d 708, 712 (9th Cir. 2010) (district courts in best position to consider most fair and efficient procedure for litigation); <em>Johns v. Bayer Corp., </em>280 F.R.D. 551, 555-56 (S.D.Cal.2012) (quoting <em>Ballard v. Equifax Check Serv., Inc., </em>186 F.R.D. 589, 600 (E.D.Cal.1999)) (class actions that promote compliance with consumer protection laws \u201cdesirable and should be encouraged\u201d). It must, however, conduct a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d to determine whether the putative class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23. <em>Comcast v. Behrend, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 1431-33, 185 L.Ed.2d 515 (2013); <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551; <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). The elements of class certification are (1) numerosity, (2) commonality, (3) typicality and (4) adequate representation, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a), plus one of the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1) through (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-17\">This case involves Rule 23(b)(2) and (3). Rule 23(b)(2) requires plaintiffs to show that Chevron \u201cacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>whole.\u201d Rule 23(b)(3) requires plaintiffs to show that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Rule 23 does not set forth a mere pleading standard. <em>Comcast, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1431-32 (quoting <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551). As the party requesting class certification, plaintiffs bear the burden of \u201caffirmatively demonstrat[ing]\u201d compliance with these requirements. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551). Plaintiffs \u201cmust be prepared to prove that there are in fact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551). In determining whether plaintiffs have met their burden, the Court \u201cmust accept the substantive allegations of the complaint as true,\u201d but it does not \u201cblindly rely on conelusory allegations which parrot Rule 23.\u201d <em>Shook v. El Paso Cnty., </em>386 F.3d 963, 968 (10th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>J.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, </em>186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n. 7 (10th Cir. 1999)); <em>see also Blackie v. Barrack, </em>524 F.2d 891, 901 n. 17 (9th Cir.1975) (court accepts allegations in complaint as true so long as they are sufficiently specific to permit informed assessment whether plaintiffs have met Rule 23 requirements). The Court is not limited to the pleadings but may \u201cprobe behind the pleadings\u201d and examine the facts and evidence in the ease. <em>Tabor, </em>703 F.3d at 1227-28 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 160,102 S.Ct. 2364); <em>see also Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>657 F.3d 970, 982 (9th Cir.2011) (rigorous analysis requires judging persuasiveness of evidence as well as admissibility). Actual, not presumed, conformance with Rule 23(a) is indispensable. <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">This \u201crigorous analysis\u201d will \u201c[f]requently ... entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiffs underlying claim.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. But the Court should not conduct a mini-trial to determine if the class could actually prevail on the merits of their claims. <em>See Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Retirement Plans &amp; Trust Funds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 1194-95, 1201, 185 L.Ed.2d 308 (2013); <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2552 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"arw-dedup-0\">\n<em>Factual And Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">The three California cases captioned <em>above\u2014Rushing v. Ambest, Inc., </em>No. 06-7621-PJH (N.D.Cal), <em>Lerner v. Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>No. 07-1216-GHK-FMO (C.D.Cal.), and <em>Wyatt v. B.P. America Corp., </em>No. 07-1754-BTM-JMA (S.D.Cal.)\u2014are part of multidistriet litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>No. 07-1840-KHV. Of the numerous claims which plaintiffs brought against Chevron in the California eases, they ask the Court to certify only four: (1) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing <em>(Lemer), </em>(2) unjust enrichment <em>(Lemer </em>and <em>Wyatt), </em>(3) violation of the UCL, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq. (Lemer, Rushing </em>and <em>Wyatt) </em>and (4) violation of the CLRA, Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 1750 <em>et seq. (Rushing).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">In each of the three California eases, plaintiffs ask the Court to certify two different classes\u2014a class of \u201cconsumers\u201d for their CLRA claims and a class of \u201cindividuals and entities\u201d for the others. Plaintiffs propose the following class definition for the CLRA classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">All consumers that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by [Chevron].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-14\"><em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Brief (Doc. </em>#4502) at 2. They propose the following class definition for the rest of their claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">All individuals and entities that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by [Chevron].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-16\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>4</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-17\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on their assertion that the temperature of motor fuel af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>fects the energy content of a gallon of fuel, such that a warmer gallon of fuel contains less energy than a cooler gallon of the same fuel. They allege that Chevron misrepresented or omitted material facts regarding the temperature, energy content and value of motor fuel in every retail motor fuel transaction in California. Among other things, plaintiffs contend that Chevron\u2019s practice of selling motor fuel without disclosing or adjusting for temperature and its effects on motor fuel deprives consumers of the ability to make accurate price and value comparisons, and affects plaintiffs\u2019 pecuniary interest because the transactions are inaccurate, inconsistent, unfair and non-transparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Plaintiffs ask the Court to replicate the class structure in the Kansas motor fuel cases. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Brief </em>(Doc. #4502) at 2. In those cases, under Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3) and (c)(4), Fed. R.Civ.P., the Court certified overlapping classes as to the liability and injunctive relief aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>279 F.R.D. at 615-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Plaintiffs ask that the Court certify two different classes in this manner\u2014a class of \u201cconsumers\u201d for their CLRA claims and a class of \u201cindividuals and entities\u201d for their other claims. Chevron opposes plaintiffs\u2019 request for class certification. It argues that the proposed classes do not meet various requirements in Rule 23(a), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (c)(4). It also argues that named plaintiffs lack Article III standing and statutory standing to bring UCL claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">I. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">A. Article III Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Chevron argues that <em>Rushing </em>plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they did not allege that a named plaintiff purchased motor fuel from Chevron in certain states. Chevron does not name which states are implicated in this argument. The second amended complaint in <em>Rushing </em>alleges that plaintiff John Telles purchased fuel from Chevron in California for personal, family or household use. Chevron\u2019s argument regarding his Article III standing to sue is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Chevron also argues that because each proposed class \u201ccontains numerous individuals who have not suffered monetary injury, it contains members who lack Article III standing and should not be certified.\u201d <em>Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Opposition To Class Certification </em>(Doc. # 4507) at 4. Article III standing is a threshold matter central to the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 612, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) (Rule 23 \u201cmust be interpreted in keeping with Article III constraints\u201d); <em>Vallario v. Vandehey, </em>554 F.3d 1259, 1269 n. 7 (10th Cir.2009) (class certification analysis must begin with Article III standing); <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 978-79. Plaintiffs bear the burden of showing that Article III standing exists. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 559-60, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992); <em>Rector v. City &amp; Cnty. of Denver, </em>348 F.3d 935, 942 (10th Cir.2003); <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 978-79. To have standing, plaintiffs must show that (1) they suffered an injury in fact, i.e. an injury that is sufficiently concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical, (2) the injury is fairly traceable to Chevron\u2019s conduct and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Plaintiffs must show standing with respect to each form of relief sought. <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt\u2019l Servs. (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 185, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). Standing exists if at least one named plaintiff meets the requirements. <em>DG ex rel. Stricklin v. Devaughn, </em>594 F.3d 1188, 1198 (10th Cir. 2010) ; <em>Rector, </em>348 F.3d at 949-50; <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 978-79; <em>Stearns v. Ticketmaster Corp., </em>655 F.3d 1013, 1021 (9th Cir. 2011) .</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In this regard, Chevron\u2019s argument is not that <em>named </em>plaintiffs lack Article III standing to sue under California law, but that the class \u201ccontains members who lack Article III standing.\u201d <em>Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Opposition To Class Certification </em>(Doc. # 4507) at 4. The Court has previously found that plaintiffs\u2019 theory, i.e. that \u201cevery retail motor fuel transaction causes an injury\u2014no matter when it takes place and regardless of the temperature of the fuel or the price per gallon,\u201d is sufficient for Article III standing. <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>No. 07-1840-KHV, 2012 WL 1672994, at *4 (D.Kan. May 14, 2012) (injury sufficient for Article III standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">B. UCL Statutory Standing</p>\n<p id=\"AqF_\">Chevron argues that named plaintiffs do not meet the statutory standing requirements for bringing UCL claims. Under the UCL, \u201c[a]ny person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the claimant meets the standing requirements of Section 17204.\u201d Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17203. Under Section 17204, the \u201cperson\u201d must have \u201csuffered injury in fact and ... lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.\u201d Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17204. This standing requirement applies to only the class representatives, and not to absent class members. <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th 298, 324, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 38 (2009); <em>see also Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, </em>704 F.3d 712, 728 (9th Cir.2012). With respect to fraud claims under the UCL, plaintiffs must show \u201cactual reliance,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>that \u201cdefendant\u2019s misrepresentation or nondisclosure was an immediate cause of the plaintiffs injury-producing conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 306, 326, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 25-26, 39. Named plaintiffs need not show that their reliance was the sole factor or even the \u201cpredominant or decisive factor\u201d influencing their conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. It is enough that the representation played a substantial part, and so had been a substantial factor, in influencing plaintiffs\u2019 fuel purchasing decisions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">A \u201cpresumption, or at least an inference, of reliance arises wherever there is a showing that a misrepresentation [or omission] was material.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A misrepresentation or omission is material if a reasonable person would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Chevron\u2019s representations and omissions regarding the motor fuel which it sold were material. <em>See In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 326-27, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39-40; <em>Ries, </em>287 F.R.D. 523; <em>In re Google Ad-Words Litig., </em>2012 WL 28068, at *9. To the extent that plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claims rest on alleged material omissions, Chevron argues that plaintiffs must show that it had a duty to disclose the information. Chevron had a duty to disclose if it actively concealed a material fact or made partial representations but also suppressed some material facts. <em>See Johnson v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co. Grp., LLC, </em>285 F.R.D. 573, 583 &amp; n. 3 (E.D.Cal.2012); <em>Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>496 F. Supp.2d 1088, 1096-97 (N.D.Cal.2007). At this stage, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Chevron knew that temperature affected the volume and energy content of motor fuel are sufficient to show that Chevron had a duty to disclose. On this record, named plaintiffs who purchased motor fuel from Chevron have standing under the UCL.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">II. Rule 23 Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P., governs class certification. As the party requesting class certification, plaintiffs must first demonstrate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-8\">(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a). Second, the proposed class must satisfy at least one of the three requirements listed in Rule 23(b). Plaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Rule 23(b)(2) requires that \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d For Rule 23(b)(3) to apply, the Court must find that \u201cquestions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d To determine predominance and superiority, the Court considers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">(A) the class members\u2019 interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-14\">(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-15\">(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-18\">Rule 23(c)(4) provides that \u201c[w]hen appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.\u201d The Fifth Circuit has held that a \u201cdistrict court cannot manufacture predominance through the nimble use of subdivision (c)(4).\u201d <em>Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>84 F.3d 734, 745 n. 21 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see Allison v. Citgo Petroleum Corp., </em>151 F.3d 402, 421-22 (5th Cir.1998). In the Fifth Circuit, the \u201cthe proper interpretation of the interaction between subdivisions (b)(3) and (c)(4) is that a cause of action, as a whole, must satisfy the predominance requirement of (b)(3) and that (c)(4) is a housekeeping rule that allows courts to sever the common issues for a class trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit interpretation of Rule 23(c)(4) was motivated by a concern that \u201callowing a court to sever issues until the remaining common issue predominates over the remaining individual issues would eviscerate the predominance requirement of rule 23(b)(3)\u201d and would lead to \u201cautomatic certification in every case where there is a common issue, a result that could not have been intended.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-19\">The Second, Seventh and Ninth Circuits have taken a different view. They have held that \u201cif common questions do not predominate over the individual questions so that class certification of the entire action is warranted,\u201d a court may use Rule 23(c)(4) to \u201cisolate the common issues ... and proceed with class treatment of these particular issues.\u201d <em>Valentino v.

Adequacy Of Class Definition</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify a class of \u201cconsumers\u201d for their CLRA claims and a class of \u201cindividuals and entities\u201d for the others. Plaintiffs propose the following class definition for the CLRA classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">All consumers that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by [Chevron].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-11\"><em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Brief </em>(Doc. # 4502) at 1. Plaintiffs propose the following class definition for the rest of their claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-12\">All individuals and entities that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by [Chevron].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">Chevron argues that the class definitions do not fit plaintiffs\u2019 theories of recovery and are \u201cimprecise, overbroad and unascertaina-ble\u201d because they contain members who have not been harmed. The Court has previously rejected this argument, noting as follows: \u201cThe crux of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is that defendants sell motor fuel at retail without disclosing or accounting for temperature. The proposed class definition captures this premise. Although plaintiffs may rely on the 60-de-gree-Fahrenheit reference temperature in proving their claims, the class definition is precise, objective and presently ascertainable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>without it.\u201d <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>279 F.R.D. 598, 605 (D.Kan. 2012).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">IV. \u201cLiability\u201d Issue Classes Under Rule 23(c)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify issue classes under Rule 23(c)(4) that are limited to the \u201cliability\u201d aspects of their claims. For purposes of certifying the proposed classes, the \u201cliability\u201d aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims include all substantive elements of the claims, including causation and injury. \u201cLiability\u201d does not include questions of remedy, e.g. damages, injunctive relief and restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claims are that (1) plaintiffs and Chevron entered into a contract; (2) plaintiffs did all, or substantially all of the significant things that the contract required; (3) all conditions required for Chevron\u2019s performance had occurred; (4) Chevron unfairly interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right to receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) plaintiffs were harmed. Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (2013), CACI No. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are that (1) plaintiffs conferred a benefit on Chevron, (2) which Chevron knowingly accepted, (3) under circumstances that make it inequitable for Chevron to retain the benefit without paying for its value. <em>See Hernandez v. Lopez, </em>180 Cal.App.4th 932, 938, 103 Cal.Rptr.3d 376, 380 (2009) (citing <em>Dunkin v. Boskey, </em>82 Cal.App.4th 171, 195, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44, 60-61 (2000)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claims are that (1) plaintiffs and Chevron are \u201cpersons\u201d under the UCL; (2) Chevron engaged in unfair competition (i.e. unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business acts or practices); (3) named plaintiffs suffered economic injury as a result of Chevron\u2019s acts or practices; and (4) members of the public were likely deceived. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17201; <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th 298, 312, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 29 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claims are that (1) plaintiffs were \u201cconsumers\u201d under the CLRA; (2) Chevron was a \u201cperson\u201d under the CLRA; (3) plaintiffs and Chevron engaged in a transaction intended to result or which resulted in the sale or lease of goods or services; (4) Chevron used unfair methods of competition, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, in violation of the CLRA; (5) as a result, plaintiffs suffered damage. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1750, 1761,1770,1780.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">A. \u201cLiability\u201d As Appropriate Issue Class</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Without citing any authority, Chevron argues that \u201c \u2018liability\u2019 is a perplexing \u2018issue\u2019 to propose\u201d because it is \u201cnot a narrow issue within the chain of proof that might be appropriately handled under (c)(4).\u201d <em>Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Opposition To Class Certification </em>(Doc. # 4507) at 8-9. Chevron ignores the fact that \u201c[ejertifying a class to determine the defendant\u2019s liability, while leaving the class members to pursue their individual damages claims, is a common example of partial certification.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>2009 WL 648973, at *3. Chevron also argues (in a footnote citing <em>Dukes) </em>that the Supreme Court \u201cwould look with disfavor upon an expansive interpretation of Rule 23(c)(4).\u201d <em>Defendants\u2019 Supplemental Opposition To Class Certification </em>(Doc. # 4507) at 9 n. 5. Chevron does not cite a specific page, section or holding of <em>Dukes </em>to support this position, but simply states that its \u201cfocus on the text, structure and framers\u2019 intent of Rule 23 sug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>gests that it would [do so].\u201d <em>See id. </em>Chevron does not explain what in the text of Rule 23(e)(4) specifically, or Rule 23 generally, indicates that the common practice of certifying class actions as to Chevron\u2019s liability violates Rule 23. These arguments are therefore unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">B. Material Advancement Of Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Chevron argues that certifying Rule 23(c)(4) classes as to \u201cliability\u201d would not materially advance the litigation because common issues are inextricably tied to individual issues outside the (e)(4) classes, and the remaining individual issues make the case unmanageable. The Court disagrees. If the Court certifies Rule 23(c)(4) classes as to Chevron\u2019s liability and Chevron prevails, the class actions will end. If plaintiffs prevail, the Court can determine whether injunctive relief is appropriate. By quantum leaps, this approach will advance the resolution of plaintiffs\u2019 core claims on a class-wide basis. <em>See Memorandum And Order </em>(Doc. # 1675) at 29-30 (injunctive relief is centerpiece of motor fuel eases because it is only way for plaintiffs to change how defendants sell fuel). The \u201cliability\u201d aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are therefore appropriate for issue certification under Rule 23(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">V. Rule 23(a) Prerequisites</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">As noted above, to satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), plaintiffs must \u201caffirmatively demonstrate\u201d that (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) questions of law or fact are common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a); <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. Chevron argues that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed classes do not meet the commonality, typicality and adequate representation requirements of Rule 23(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">A. Numerosity</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Rule 23(a)(1) requires plaintiffs to show that \u201cthe class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d The numerosity requirement requires examination of the specific facts of each case and imposes no absolute limitations. <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of Nw., Inc. v. EEOC, </em>446 U.S. 318, 330, 100 S.Ct. 1698, 64 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980). Although plaintiffs do not know the precise number of class members, Chevron owns roughly 300 retail motor fuel stations in California. The CLRA classes include every consumer who purchased motor fuel at retail from Chevron during a period of more than nine years, and the other classes include everyone who purchased motor fuel at retail from Chevron during that period. It would be impracticable to join all members of plaintiffs\u2019 proposed classes. Moreover, Chevron does not deny that the proposed classes satisfy the numerosity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">B. Commonality</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Rule 23(a)(2) requires plaintiffs to show that \u201cquestions of law or fact are common to the class.\u201d Commonality requires plaintiffs to demonstrate that the class members have \u201csuffered the same injury.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2550-51; <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 157-58, 102 S.Ct. 2364. In other words, the \u201cclaims must depend upon a common contention\u201d that is \u201cof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution\u2014 which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-14\">This ease involves a uniform method of selling motor fuel at retail by the gallon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>without disclosing or adjusting for temperature and its effects on motor fuel. This practice has affected all class members in the same way. Plaintiffs have presented significant proof that Chevron operated under a general policy of selling motor fuel this way. The record is sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement with respect to both the liability and injunctive relief aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See id. </em>at 2553 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 157-58, 102 S.Ct. 2364); <em>see also In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>279 F.R.D. 598, 612-13 (D.Kan. 2012). Plaintiffs have therefore shown that the class \u201csuffered the same injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2551. The elements of plaintiffs\u2019 claims bear this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">1. Breach Of The Duty Of Good Faith And Fair Dealing</p>\n<p id=\"AMs\">To establish a claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, plaintiffs must show that (1) a retail motor fuel transaction constitutes a contract, (2) plaintiffs fulfilled their contractual obligations, (3) all conditions required for Chevron\u2019s performance had occurred, (4) Chevron unfairly interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right to receive the benefit of the contract and (5) plaintiffs were harmed. <em>See </em>Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (2013), CACI No. 325. Because California imposes an objective standard for determining whether a contract existed and whether Chevron unfairly interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right to the benefit of the contract, and because class members\u2019 transactions with Chevron were materially similar, plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing are susceptible to classwide proof based on the expectations of a reasonable consumer. <em>See Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>202 Cal. App.4th 1342, 1385, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 293, 328 (Dist. 2 2012); <em>Wolf v. Walt Disney Pictures &amp; Television, </em>162 Cal.App.4th 1107, 1126, 76 Cal.Rptr.3d 585, 601 (2008); <em>see also Allapattah Servs., Inc. v. Exxon Corp., </em>333 F.3d 1248, 1260-61 (11th Cir.2003) (common questions predominated where agreements between motor fuel dealers and Exxon were \u201cmaterially similar\u2019\u201d; Exxon owed duty of good faith to all dealers and failed to reduce price of wholesale gas for all dealers); <em>In re Chase Bank USA, N.A. Check Loan Contract Litig., </em>274 F.R.D. 286, 290-92 (N.D.Cal.2011) (finding commonality, certifying class claims for breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing under substantially similar Delaware law).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Similarly, the \u201charm\u201d element presents a common question based on plaintiffs\u2019 theory that under Chevron\u2019s method of selling motor fuel at retail, harm is inherent in every retail motor fuel transaction regardless the temperature of the fuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">2. Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">To prevail on their unjust enrichment claim, plaintiffs must show that (1) they conferred a benefit on Chevron, (2) Chevron appreciated or knew of the benefit and (3) Chevron retained the benefit under such circumstances as to make the retention inequitable. <em>U.S. for Use &amp; Benefit of Walton Tech., Inc. v. Weststar Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>290 F.3d 1199, 1204 (9th Cir.2002). Plaintiffs allege that Chevron sold motor fuel to all class members in the same way, without disclosing or adjusting for temperature or its effect on motor fuel. Whether Chevron received a benefit from this practice, whether Chevron knew of the benefit and whether Chevron unjustly retained it, are issues which are common to the class. <em>See, e.g., Westways World Travel, Inc. v. AMR Corp., </em>218 F.R.D. 223, 239 (C.D.Cal.2003) (plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claim posed common questions where plaintiffs alleged that defendants acted in \u201cvirtually uniform manner towards all Class members\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">3. UCL</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">The UCL prohibits unfair competition, which includes \u201cany unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.\u201d Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200. Each of these three prongs is defined broadly;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>present common questions that plaintiffs can address with classwide proof that will \u201cgenerate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551. To state a UCL claim, based on false advertising or promotional practices, plaintiffs only need to show that members of the public are \u201clikely to be deceived.\u201d <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th 298, 312, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 29 (quoting <em>Kasky v. Nike, Inc., </em>27 Cal.4th 939, 951, 119 Cal.Rptr.2d 296, 45 P.3d 243 (2002)).

This is consistent with \u201cthe UCL\u2019s focus on the defendant\u2019s conduct, rather than the plaintiffs damages, in service of the statute\u2019s larger purpose of protecting the general public against unscrupulous business practices.\u201d <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th 298, 312, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, 30. \u201c[R]elief under the UCL is available without individualized proof of deception, reliance and injury.\u201d <em>Stearns v.

The elements of plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claims present common questions that do not require individualized proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">4. CLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">Chevron may be liable for violating the CLRA if, among other things, it represented to plaintiffs that the fuel they purchased had characteristics which it did not have or was of a particular standard, quality or grade, if it was of another. <em>See </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1770(a)(5), (7); <em>see also Klein, </em>202 Cal.App.4th at 1382, 137 Cal. Rptr.3d at 326. Under the CLRA, \u201cfraud or deceit may consist of the suppression of a fact by one who is bound to disclose it or who gives information of other facts which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact.\u201d <em>McAdams v. Monier, Inc., </em>182 Cal.App.4th 174, 175, 105 Cal.Rptr.3d 704, 711 (2010) (quoting <em>Outboard Marine Corp. v. Superior Court, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d 30, 37, 124 Cal.Rptr. 852, 856 (1975)). Unlike the UCL, the CLRA \u201crequires each class member to have an actual injury caused by the [alleged] unlawful practice.\u201d <em>Steams, </em>655 F.3d at 1022 (citing <em>Steroid Hormone Prod. Cases, </em>181 Cal.App.4th 145, 155-56, 104 Cal.Rptr.3d 329, 337 (2010)). Plaintiffs may establish causation on a classwide basis by showing that Chevron\u2019s representations and/or omissions were material. <em>Id. </em>That is, if defendant has made material misrepresentations or omissions, \u201can inference of reliance arises as to the class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Vioxx Class Cases, </em>180 Cal.App.4th at 129, 103 Cal. Rptr.3d at 94); <em>see also Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1195-96 (in securities litigation context, because materiality is objective standard which involves significance of omitted or misrepresented fact to reasonable investor, materiality can be proved by evidence common to class, which is sufficient satisfying Rule 23); <em>McAdams, </em>182 Cal.App.4th at 185, 105 Cal. Rptr.3d at 711 (applying inference of reliance from omission or \u201cfailure to disclose\u201d material information; record permitted inference of common reliance under CLRA where plaintiff alleged that defendant made material misrepresentation to all class members).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">To prevail on a failure to disclose claim under the CLRA, plaintiffs must show that Chevron had a duty to disclose the material fact(s) it withheld. A duty to disclose arises, among other circumstances, if Chevron actively concealed a material fact from plaintiffs or if Chevron made partial representations but also suppressed some material facts. <em>See Johnson v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co. Grp., LLC, </em>285 F.R.D. 573, 583 (E.D.Cal.2012); <em>Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>496 F.Supp.2d 1088, 1096-97 (N.D.Cal. 2007). Because Chevron acted uniformly with respect to the class, whether it had a duty to disclose information is a question common to the class and susceptible to class-wide proof. Because a violation of the CLRA satisfies the \u201cunlawful\u201d prong of the UCL, that prong also presents a common question.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Plaintiffs allege a common practice that caused class members a common injury. Classwide proceedings in this case would therefore \u201cgenerate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation,\u201d and any dissimilarities within the proposed class do not \u201cimpede the generation of common answers.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551 (quoting Richard A Nagareda, <em>Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, </em>84 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 97 (2009)) (quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Court finds \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chevron argues that on the merits the Court should \u201creject\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on <em>Klein v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., </em>202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 137 Cal.Rptr.3d 293 (2012), in which the California Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of similar if not identical claims. But \u201cRule 23 grants courts no license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries at the certification stage. Merits questions may be considered to the extent\u2014but only to the extent\u2014that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.\u201d <em>Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1194-95 (citing <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2552 n. 6). The Court therefore declines Chevron\u2019s invitation to dismiss these claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">C. Typicality And Adequacy Of Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Rule 23(a)(3) requires plaintiffs to show that the \u201cclaims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d The test of typicality is whether all class members were at risk of being subjected to the same harmful practices, regardless of any class member\u2019s individual circumstances. <em>Stricklin, </em>594 F.3d at 1198-99; <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 984. The interests and claims of named plaintiffs and class members need not be identical to satisfy typicality; so long as the claims of named plaintiffs and class members are based on the same legal or remedial theory, differing fact situations of the class members do not defeat typicality. <em>Stricklin, </em>594 F.3d at 1198-99; <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 984; <em>Hanlon v.

A fundamental conflict exists where some class members claim to have been harmed by conduct which resulted in benefit to other class members. <em>Eatinger, </em>271 F.R.D. at 260. In such situations, the named representatives cannot adequately represent the interests of the class because their interests are actually or potentially antagonistic to or in conflict with interests and objectives of other class members. <em>See id.; see also Berrien v.

Inflight Motion Pictures, Inc., </em>582 F.2d 507, 512 (9th Cir.1978) (right to withdraw from class protected interests of dissident class members).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Determining adequacy of representation turns on two questions: (1) whether named plaintiffs and their counsel have any conflicts of interest with other class members and (2) whether named plaintiffs and their counsel will vigorously prosecute the action on behalf of the class. <em>E. Tex. Motor Freight Sys., Inc. v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S.Ct. 1891, 52 L.Ed.2d 453 (1977); <em>Rutter &amp; Wilbanks Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>314 F.3d 1180, 1187-88 (10th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Hanlon, </em>150 F.3d at 1020).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">Chevron challenges the typicality of the class representatives and the adequacy of representation because (1) not every member of the class wants ATC at retail, (2) some class members typically purchase motor fuel that is cooler than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, (3) some class members purchased fuel at a negotiated price under a fleet contract and (4) certain named plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they did not purchase fuel from Chevron in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">1. Desirability Of ATC At Retail</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Chevron argues that the named representatives are atypical and inadequate because some class members oppose one form of injunctive relief which they seek\u2014the implementation of ATC at retail. According to Chevron, some class members believe that ATC at retail will result in higher fuel prices with no corresponding benefit to class members. Although Chevron contends that class members hold differing opinions whether ATC would benefit the class as a whole, it does not argue these differences among class members would cause some class members to benefit at the expense of others. These types of potential conflicts that might arise at a later stage in the litigation do not defeat class certification. <em>See Wallace B. Roderick Revocable Living Trust v. XTO Energy, Inc., </em>281 F.R.D. 477, 485 (D.Kan.2012) (speculative or minor conflicts insufficient to defeat class certification on grounds of adequacy of representation); <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>271 F.R.D. 221 (D.Kan.2010) (finding adequate representation in Kansas cases); <em>see also Soc. Servs. Union, Local 535, </em>609 F.2d at 948; <em>Blackie, </em>524 F.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">Moreover, before plaintiffs may obtain in-junctive relief requiring Chevron to install ATC, they must prove that the requested relief will benefit the class as whole. If the evidence shows that mandating ATC would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>harm the class, plaintiffs will not prevail on their request for injunctive relief. Furthermore, Chevron emphatically contends that implementing ATC at retail will not benefit class members. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Chevron will adequately represent the position of class members who oppose ATC at retail. <em>See, e.g., Curley v. Brignoli, Curley &amp; Roberts Assoc., </em>915 F.2d 81, 86 (2d Cir.1990); <em>Horton v. Goose Creek Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>690 F.2d 470, 487 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Dierks v. Thompson, </em>414 F.2d 453, 456-57 (1st Cir.1969); <em>Groover v. Michelin N. Am., Inc., </em>192 F.R.D. 305, 306-07 (M.D.Ala.2000); <em>Reese v. Miami-Dade Cnty., </em>209 F.R.D. 231, 233 (S.D.Fla.2002); <em>Cmtys. for Equity v. Mich. High Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>192 F.R.D. 568, 574 (W.D.Mich.1999); <em>Messier v. Southbury Training Sch., </em>183 F.R.D. 350, 358 (D.Conn.1998); <em>Wyatt v. Poundstone, </em>169 F.R.D. 155, 162 (M.D.Ala.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">2. Class Members May Typically Purchase Fuel Cooler Than 60 Degrees Fahrenheit</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Chevron argues that named plaintiffs cannot adequately represent potential class members who typically purchase fuel that is cooler than 60 degrees. It has not attempted to demonstrate that any potential class members typically purchase fuel that is cooler than 60 degrees and the record indicates that the average temperature of motor fuel sold in California is warmer than 60 degrees. Regardless, plaintiffs\u2019 theory of recovery does not turn on whether the temperature of fuel is warmer or cooler than 60 degrees. Plaintiffs allege that by not disclosing the temperature of motor fuel at retail some harm to the consumer is inherent in every retail motor fuel transaction regardless the temperature of the fuel. Although the degree of injury may vary among class members based on the temperature of the fuel they purchase, under plaintiffs\u2019 theory every retail motor fuel transaction causes an injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">3. Some Class Members Purchased Fuel At Negotiated Price Under Fleet Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Chevron contends that named representatives cannot adequately represent class members who purchased fuel at a negotiated price under fleet contracts. Based on the class definition, which confines class members to those who \u201cpm-chased motor fuel <em>at retail </em>in the state of California,\u201d it is not clear whether individuals or entities that purchased fuel at negotiated prices under fleet contracts would even qualify. Regardless, this difference does not defeat typicality because \u201cthe claims of the representative plaintiffs and class members are based on the same legal and remedial theories and arise from the same pattern of conduct by defendants: all of them allegedly suffered injury on account of defendants\u2019 sale of motor fuel for specified prices per gallon without disclosing or adjusting for temperature expansion.\u201d <em>In re Motor Fuel Temp. Sales Practices Litig., </em>271 F.R.D. 221, 229 (D.Kan.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">4. Article III Standing\u2014No Purchases From Chevron In California</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">As discussed above, Chevron argues that <em>Rushing </em>plaintiffs lack Article III standing because they did not allege that a named plaintiff purchased motor fuel from Chevron in certain states. If true, named plaintiffs would not be typical of class members who did purchase from Chevron and would not adequately represent the class. <em>See Rector, </em>348 F.3d at 950; <em>Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 978-79. As noted, however, the second amended complaint in <em>Rushing </em>alleges that plaintiff John Telles purchased fuel from Chevron in California for personal, family or household use. This argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">VI. Rule 23(b) Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">In addition to the requirements of Rule 23(a), plaintiffs must affirmatively demonstrate that the class satisfies the requirements of one of the types of class actions listed in Rule 23(b). Here, plaintiffs seek class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">A. Rule 23(b)(2) Classes</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) requires plaintiffs to show that \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\u201d Claims for monetary relief may not be certified under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>this Rule, at least where the monetary relief is not incidental to the injunctive or declaratory relief. <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2557. In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages,\u201d or even \u201cwhen each individual class member would be entitled to a different injunction or declaratory judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, that \u201cthe claims of individual class members may differ factually should not preclude certification under Rule 23(b)(2) of a claim seeking the application of a common policy.\u201d <em>Adamson v. Bowen, </em>855 F.2d 668, 676 (10th Cir.1988); <em>see also Rodriguez v. Hayes, </em>591 F.3d 1105, 1125 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Walters v. Reno, </em>145 F.3d 1032, 1045 (9th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Adamson, </em>855 F.2d at 676).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">1. Cohesiveness And Manageability Of Class</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Under Rule 23(b)(2), plaintiffs request class certification of only their claims for injunctive relief. The gravamen of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for injunctive relief is that Chevron sold motor fuel at retail to plaintiffs by the gallon without disclosing or adjusting for temperature and its effects on motor fuel. This practice applied uniformly to all class members and could therefore be remedied by a single injunction applicable to them all. Chevron contends, however, that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed (b)(2) class is not cohesive because some class members may oppose ATC at retail. Disagreements among class members about the effectiveness of ATC at retail\u2014 which is just one of several forms of injunctive relief that plaintiffs seek\u2014do not implicate the cohesiveness of the class. That is, class members\u2019 disagreement about ATC does not undermine plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Chevron acted uniformly with respect to the class or that injunctive relief would be appropriate respecting the class as a whole. Rather, the argument goes to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for injunctive relief and whether ATC would actually benefit the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Chevron also argues that the class is not manageable because it would require the Court to examine individual purchasing behavior of each putative class member, the temperature of the fuel at the hundreds of retail stations and retailers\u2019 individualized pricing decisions, including how the per-unit retail price would change if ATC were required. This ignores the fact that plaintiffs allege that they suffered similar injuries caused by Chevron\u2019s uniform practice of selling motor fuel by the gallon without disclosing or adjusting for temperature and its effects. Plaintiffs will not need to prove individual circumstances regarding each class member, but can show injury by classwide proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">On this record the Court can conceive of a uniform injunction that could address plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injury that will satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 65(d), Fed.R.Civ.P., which governs injunctions. The Court could craft an injunction requiring Chevron to implement ATC, disclose the temperature of fuel and/or disclose the effect of temperature on fuel in specific terms that describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained or required. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">2. Plaintiffs\u2019 Request For Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">In <em>Dukes, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that Rule 23(b)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2557. Chevron argues that plaintiffs\u2019 request for money damages, in addition to injunctive relief, makes their claims inappropriate for certification under Rule 23(b)(2). <em>Dukes </em>found that a class of current and former female employees of Wal-Mart seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, backpay and punitive damages for violations of Title VII could not be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). It held that Rule 23(b)(2) \u201cdoes not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages\u201d and because \u201cthe combination of individualized and classwide relief in a(b)(2) class is inconsistent with the structure of Rule 23(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2558.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">Here, however, plaintiffs ask the Court to certify a(b)(2) class for injunctive relief only. They ask the Court to certify the liability aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims in a separate issues class under Rule 23(b)(3) and (e)(4), presumably to hold open the possibility of obtaining classwide monetary relief and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>avoid any potential due process or collateral estoppel issues. <em>See Memorandum And Order </em>(Doe. #3208) at 30, 32; <em>see also Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>634 F.3d 883, 895 (7th Cir.2011) (in appropriate ease, Rule 23(b)(2) class and Rule 23(b)(3) class may be certified where real basis for both damages and equitable remedy exists). Under plaintiffs\u2019 dual certification request, the (b)(2) class will not contain their request for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">For these reasons, under Rule 23(b)(2), the Court certifies plaintiffs\u2019 claims for injunctive relief based on unjust enrichment and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and for violation of the UCL and CLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">B. Rule 23(b)(3) Classes</p>\n<p id=\"ArU\">To certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), plaintiffs must show that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). For particular issues to be certified using Rule 23(c)(4), the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) must be satisfied only with respect to those issues. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4); <em>Fulghum, </em>2011 WL 13615, at *2; <em>Emig, </em>184 F.R.D. at 395; <em>Law, </em>167 F.R.D. at 184-85; <em>see also Valentino, </em>97 F.3d at 1234; <em>In re Paxil Litig., </em>212 F.R.D. at 543. In determining whether to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(3), the Court considers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">(A) the class members\u2019 interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">(D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">Here, plaintiffs have met the requirements of predominance and superiority: (A) class members likely have little interest in individually controlling the prosecution of separate actions because the amount at stake for individual class members is small relative to the cost of maintaining a separate action; (B) although a similar case is pending in California state court, <em>see Klein v. Chevron USA Inc., </em>No. BC367812 (L.A.Super.Ct.), it does not appear to be moving toward trial any time soon\u2014plaintiffs have moved to stay that case and Chevron has moved for judgment of abatement; (C) the Court intends to sever all claims against Chevron in these cases, remand the claims to their respective transferor courts with a view to transferring claims in two of the eases to one district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), consolidate the three eases against Chevron for all future proceedings, which is a desirable plan for adjudicating plaintiffs\u2019 claims in a just and speedy manner; and (D) by severing plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Chevron and bifurcating the question of individual damages, the Court has narrowed the class action to discrete questions of law and fact that can be resolved on a elasswide basis. The Court foresees no case management issue that would dissuade it from certifying under Rule 23(b)(3) a class as to the liability and injunctive relief aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. As noted above, the proposed (b)(3) classes involve common questions of law or fact. <em>See </em>supra Part V.B. (discussing commonality). These questions predominate over any individualized questions that may arise, and handling the claims in a class action is better than making class members bring their own claims separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">Chevron argues that plaintiffs\u2019 claims require individualized proof based on the circumstances of each fill-up, including the temperature of the fuel, whether the class member would have paid less or received more fuel for the same price with ATC and whether Chevron purchased fuel at wholesale on a temperature-adjusted basis at the time of each transaction. Because plaintiffs allege that Chevron treated all class members the same in all material respects, these individual inquiries are unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">Determining each class members\u2019 damages, if any, may require individualized determinations, but \u201c[t]he possibility that individual issues may predominate the issue of damages ... does not defeat class certification by making [the liability] aspect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>case unmanageable.\u201d <em>In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., </em>251 F.R.D. 629, 633, 639 (D.Kan. 2008); <em>see also Comcast, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1436-37 n. * (Ginsburg, Breyer, JJ dissenting). The reasoning in <em>In re Urethane Antitrust Litigation </em>applies with equal force here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">Even if individualized issues (rather than common issues) were to predominate the damage inquiry, the more appropriate course of action would be to bifurcate a damages phase and/or decertify the class as to individualized damages determinations. In other words, even if individualized issues predominate the issue of damages, the court believes that common questions nonetheless predominate in this ease because common questions will govern the more difficult, threshold liability issues....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">237 F.R.D. 440, 452 (D.Kan.2006); <em>see also Yokoyama v. Midland Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>594 F.3d 1087, 1094 (9th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Blackie, </em>524 F.2d at 905) (calculating amount of damages \u201cinvariably an individual question,\u201d but \u201cdoes not defeat class action treatment\u201d); <em>Fulghum, </em>2011 WL 13615, at *2; <em>Emig, </em>184 F.R.D. at 394-95; <em>Schreiber v. Nat\u2019l Collegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, </em>167 F.R.D. 169, 176-77 (D.Kan. 1996). Moreover, the Court has bifurcated plaintiffs\u2019 request for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">This approach is consistent with Rule 23(c)(4), which permits, \u201c[w]hen appropriate, an action [to] be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to particular issues.\u201d It is also consistent with the Advisory Committee Note on Rule 23(b)(3), which states that \u201ca fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an appealing situation for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if liability is found, for separate determination of the damages suffered by individuals within the class.\u201d <em>See also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(4) advisory committee note (\u201c[I]n a fraud or similar case the action may retain its \u2018class\u2019 character only through the adjudication of liability to the class; the members of the class may thereafter be required to come in individually and prove the amounts of their respective claims.\u201d). Other federal courts have adopted a similar approach.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court therefore finds ample support for structuring the present class action as it has.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">Structuring the actions in this way will reduce the range of issues in dispute, promote judicial economy and avoid the due process issues which Chevron raises in light of <em>Dukes. </em>By certifying the liability and injunctive relief aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims in a(b)(3) class, the Court avoids any actual or perceived conflict with <em>Dukes. </em>It also avoids possible Seventh Amendment and preclusion issues which other defendants raised in their proposed trial plan in the Kansas cases. <em>See [Kansas] Defendants\u2019 Submission In Response To Court\u2019s November 11, 2010 Order Requiring A Proposed Trial Plan </em>(Doc. # 1734) filed December 3, 2010. For these reasons, and in light of the common questions discussed above which predominate over individual issues, under Rule 23(b)(3) the Court certifies the \u201cliability\u201d aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims for unjust enrichment and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and for violation of the UCL and CLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">VII. Summary Of Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">This class certification order relates only to the following four claims against Chevron: (1) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing (Lemer), (2) unjust enrichment <em>(Lerner </em>and Wyatt), (3) violation of the California Unfair Competition Law (\u201cUCL\u201d), Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq. (Lemer, Rushing </em>and Wyatt), and (4) violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedy Act (\u201cCLRA\u201d), Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1750 <em>et seq. (Rushing). </em>Regarding these claims, the Court certifies two classes in each of the three California <em>cases\u2014Rushing v.

Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>No. 07-1216-GHK-FMO (C.D.Cal.) and <em>Wyatt v. B.P. America Corp., </em>No. 07-1754-BTM-JMA (S.D.Cal.). One class relates to plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claims and consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">All consumers that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by Chevron.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The other class relates to plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims and consists of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\">All individuals and entities that, at any time since January 1, 2004, purchased motor fuel at retail in the state of California, from a gas station owned, operated or controlled by Chevron.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The Court certifies each of these classes under Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3). The (b)(2) class is limited to plaintiffs\u2019 claims for injunc-tive relief and the (b)(3) class is limited to the \u201cliability\u201d aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. As it did in the Kansas eases, the Court bifurcates plaintiffs\u2019 request for damages. Chevron\u2019s liability will be determined in Phase I. Any relief will be determined in Phase II if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 unjust enrichment claims are that (1) plaintiffs conferred a benefit on Chevron, (2) which Chevron knowingly accepted, (3) under circumstances that make it inequitable for Chevron to retain the benefit without paying for its value. <em>See Hernandez, </em>180 Cal. App.4th at 938, 103 Cal.Rptr.3d at 380 (2009) (citing <em>Dunkin, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at 195, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d at 60-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claims are that (1) plaintiffs and Chevron entered into a contract; (2) plaintiffs did all, or substantially all of the significant things that the contract required; (3) all conditions required for Chevron\u2019s performance had occurred; (4) defendant unfairly interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right to receive the benefits of the contract; and (5) plaintiffs were harmed. Judicial Council of California Civil Jury Instructions (2013), CACI No. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 UCL claims are that (1) plaintiffs and Chevron are \u201cpersons\u201d under the UCL; (2) Chevron engaged in unfair competition (i.e. unlawful, unfair and/or fraudulent business acts or practices); (3) named plaintiffs suffered economic injury as a result of Chevron\u2019s acts or practices; and (4) members of the public were likely deceived. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200, 17201; <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 312, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The basic \u201cliability\u201d elements of plaintiffs\u2019 CLRA claims are that (1) plaintiffs were \u201cconsumers\u201d under the CLRA; (2) Chevron was a \u201cperson\u201d under the CLRA; (3) plaintiffs and Chevron engaged in a transaction intended to result or which resulted in the sale or lease of goods or services; (4) Chevron used unfair methods of competition, or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, in violation of the CLRA; (5) as a result, plaintiffs suffered damage. <em>See </em>Cal.

The \"actual reliance\u201d requirement applies only to UCL actions \"based on a fraud theory involving false advertising and misrepresentations to consumers.\u201d <em>See In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 326 n. 17, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39 n. 17; <em>Medrazo </em>v. <em>Honda of N.

The \"concept of reliance ... has no application\" in suits involving \u201cmany types of unfair business practices.\u201d <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 326 n. 17, 93 Cal. Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39 n. 17. <em>But see Durell v. Sharp Healthcare, </em>183 Cal.App.4th 1350, 1355, 108 Cal.Rptr.3d 682, 687-88 (4 Dist.2010) (reasoning of <em>In re Tobacco II Cases </em>applies to claim under \"unlawful\u201d prong of UCL where predicate unlawful conduct based on misrepresentations). At this point the Court need not determine whether named plaintiffs must prove reliance with respect to each of their theories under the UCL. It suffices to say that actual reliance is presumed given Chevron\u2019s material misrepresentations and/or omissions. <em>See In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at 326-27, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207 P.3d at 39-40; <em>Ries v. Ariz. Beverages USA LLC, </em>287 F.R.D. 523 (N.D.Cal.2012) (UCL standing requirement satisfied where plaintiffs alleged that defendant\u2019s representation was \"material\u201d); <em>In re Google AdWords Litig., </em>No. 5:08-CV-3369-EJD, 2012 WL 28068, at *9 (N.D.Cal. Jan. 5, 2012) (named plaintiffs allegations that defendant\u2019s omissions were material sufficient to establish reliance); <em>see also Amgen, </em>133 S.Ct. 1184; <em>infra </em>Part V. 13.3., V.13.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b708-13\">. In support of its motions for summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 UCL and CLRA claims, Chevron argues that California plaintiffs lack standing to bring these claims because they \"received the benefit of their bargain\u201d under <em>Kwikset Corp. v. Super. Ct., </em>51 Cal.4th 310, 322, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877, 884-85 (2011). Chevron does not raise this issue in response to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification. The Court therefore does not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">. 60 degrees Fahrenheit is the national standard reference temperature for petroleum products. The standard was adopted to remedy inequities in wholesale motor fuel transactions by enabling the buyer and seller to calculate the exact number of net gallons involved in a motor fuel transaction regardless of the temperature of the fuel at the time of sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\">. To be entitled to recover under a theory of unjust enrichment, plaintiffs must also show that plaintiffs and Chevron did not have an enforceable contract covering the retail motor fuel transactions in question. <em>See Hernandez, </em>180 Cal. App.4th at 938, 103 Cal.Rptr.3d at 380 (citing <em>Dunkin, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at 195, 98 Cal.Rptr.2d at 60-61).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b710-18\">. The elements of plaintiffs\u2019 claims are subject to clarification as necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. The commonality and typicality requirements \"tend to merge\u201d; \"[b]oth serve as guideposts for determining whether under the particular circumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether the named plaintiff's claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their absence.\u201d <em>Dukes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2551 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 157-58, 102 S.Ct. 2364). Commonality and typicality also \"tend to merge with the adequacy-of-representation requirement, although the latter requirement also raises concerns about the competency of class counsel and conflicts of interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Chevron makes distinct arguments regarding commonality based on <em>Dukes, </em>but their arguments regarding typicality and adequacy of representation overlap. The Court therefore addresses typicality and adequacy of representation together.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b712-5\">. The parties disagree about the elements of plaintiffs\u2019 UCL and CLRA claims, particularly with respect to reliance and injury. The Court does not resolve these disputes at this time. Even under Chevron\u2019s version of the elements (which requires plaintiffs to prove a duty to disclose, reliance and injury), plaintiffs may satisfy their burden with common proof that Chevron misrepresented or omitted a \"material\u201d fact in retail motor fuel transactions with class members. <em>See In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>46 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>326-27, 93 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 207- P.3d at 39; infra Part I.B.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">This case is not like <em>Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., </em>666 F.3d 581, 595-96 (9th Cir.2012), in which the Ninth Circuit found the class to be \u201coverbroad\u201d because the case did not involve a \u201cmassive advertising campaign\u201d like the one in <em>In re Tobacco II Cases, </em>and the class likely included people who were not exposed to defendant's misrepresentations and therefore could not have relied on them. This case is also not like <em>In re Vioxx Class Cases, </em>180 Cal.App.4th 116, 103 Cal.Rptr.3d 83 (2010), in which the California Court of Appeals relied on the fact that the decision to prescribe Vioxx was \"an individual decision made by a physician in reliance on many different factors, which vary from patient to patient,\u201d and where \"evidence indicated that Vioxx <em>did not </em>present an \u2018increased risk of death' compared to traditional NSAIDs for all patients.\u201d 180 Cal.App.4th at 133, 103 Cal.Rptr.3d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Here, Chevron sold fuel at retail without disclosing or adjusting for temperature or its effects. It made the same representations and omissions in every retail transaction. Plaintiffs allege the same form of injury to every person who purchased motor fuel from Chevron based on uniform misrepresentations and omissions. This case is therefore more like <em>In re Tobacco II Cases </em>than <em>Mazza </em>and <em>In re Vioxx Class Cases. See also Gutierrez, </em>704 F.3d at 729 (class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) appropriate where pervasive nature of misleading marketing materials amply demonstrates class members, like named plaintiffs were exposed to materials and likely relied on them).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\">. California state courts have split over \"how to define \u2018unfair\u2019 in the <em>consumer </em>action context.\u201d <em>Lozano, </em>504 F.3d at 736. The Ninth Circuit has stated that the traditional balancing test, stated above, is still a viable option, and federal district courts in California have applied that test. <em>Id.; Ferrington, </em>2010 WL 3910169, at * 12; <em>Davenport v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP, </em>725 F.Supp.2d 862, 878 (N.D.Cal.2010). The Court need not definitively decide whether this is the right test to apply in this case. It is sufficient that this test is one possible test and that Chevron's hybrid formulation of the elements of a UCL claim under the \"unfair\u201d prong are equally susceptible of common proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. <em>See Pella Corp. v.
