Glines was a defaulter. By direction of the court the jury found a verdict for the city. The case comes before this court upon numerous exceptions and assignments of error which present a single question, viz., was the court' below justified in directing the verdict?</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The execution of the bonds was admitted, and the breach of their conditions. The answer set up that the city applied to the company for the delivery of the bonds; that at the time of the application, and in order to induce the company to execute and deliver them, the city made to the company certain materially false representations, concerning Glines, by which the company was induced to execute the bonds; that the city\" then concealed from the company certain material facts for the purppse of inducing the company to execute and deliver the bonds, and, that the company was thereby induced to execute- and deliver them; that, on discovering the falsity of the aforementioned representations, the company tendered back the premiums, notified the city \u201cthat it claimed the bonds had been obtained by fraud,\u201d rescinded the agreement, and demanded their return. The evidence showed false representations by Glines made in the application to the-company. \u2018 The latter conceded that a surety is liable on a bond which, he has been induced to execute by the fraud of some person other than the obligee or his agents, but contended that where the bond is procured by the obligee, and the surety is induced to execute it by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fraud of some one acting in the obligee\u2019s behalf, then the surety is not bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that the laws of Massachusetts authorize a city to procure, of its own motion and in its own behalf, a bond guarantying it from loss through its treasurer; assuming further, though the assumption would deprive the bond of nearly all practical value, that a city, in procuring the bond, may accredit its treasurer, the very official whose honesty is to be guarantied, so as to b\u00bf bound by his representations, yet we are of opinion that in the case at bar the city must prevail. There is no evidence that it procured the execution of this bond on its own behalf, or did anything more than approve the bond which the treasurer gave in compliance with Massachusetts Rev. Laws, c. 25, \u00a7 72, and pay the surety\u2019s charge as authorized by chapter 26, \u00a7 23. The instrument in question was not an insurance policy taken out by the city to protect itself from loss through its employ\u00e9s. It was a bond given by Glines, with the company as surety. The application was made by Glines as treasurer in the service of the city, and the written questions which he answered were addressed to him in the second person. The following questions, among others, were asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">\u201c(23) Do you furnish any additional security covering this position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201c(24) Have you ever given security before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">\u201c(25) Have you ever applied to any company for a bond?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">For answer to the last question Glines gave the name of another fidelity company which had gone surety on a former official bond. His application closed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">\u201cI hereby declare that all the above answers are true; and in consideration of the issue of the indemnity bond, or security hereby applied for and of any further or other bond or security hereafter issued by the said \u00bfEtna Indemnity Company, in my behalf, in my present or any other position in this service, I hereby agree to protect and immediately indemnify the company against any loss, \u2022damage, or expense it may sustain, or become liable for in consequence of this or any such other bond or security granted in my behalf. I hereby agree that any proper evidence of payment by the said company of any such loss, damage, or expense shall be conclusive evidence against me and my estate of the fact and extent of my liability to the company under this agredment.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">\u201cI further agree that said company may decline to issue said indemnity bond hereby applied for, and in case it does issue said indemnity bond, it shall have the right to withdraw or cancel the \u2022same whenever it shall see fit; and in any event the company shall not be required to disclose the reasons upon which its action is based, and shall not be responsible for any loss or damage that I may sustain by reason of such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">In the \u201cEmployer\u2019s Statement,\u201d signed by Rowe, the city\u2019s auditor, \u201cthe application made by John A. Glines\u201d is mentioned, and Glines is styled the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The company relied upon a resolve of the city council of Haverhill establishing \u201cthe salaries and compensations of the principal city \u2022officers,\u201d which read in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>\u201cTreasurer and collector of taxes, in full for all services pertaining to said office, all fees received in his official capacity to go into the city treasury. The city to furnish the bond required by the city council, $2,000.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">While the resolve is expressed inaccurately, in substance it amounts only to a vote of the city council to pay the premium on the treasurer\u2019s bond, as authorized by the statute above referred to. Certainly the language does not override the nature, object, and method of the transaction as otherwise manifested. In American Surety Co. v. Pauly, 170 U. S. 133, 155, 18 Sup. Ct. 552, 561 (42 L. Ed. 977), the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cIn the first place, the procuring of a bond for O\u2019Brien, in order that he might become qualified to act as cashier, was no part of the business of the bank nor within the scope of any duty imposed upon Collins as president of the bank. It was the business of O\u2019Brien to obtain and present an acceptable bond, and it was for the bank, by its constituted authorities, to accept or reject the bond so presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">It was suggested in the company\u2019s brief, though it was little pressed at the argument, that the bond was' voidable by reason of false representations made by Rowe in the \u201cEmployer\u2019s Statement.\u201d Assuming merely for the sake of the argument that the city was bound by Rowe\u2019s statements, we do not find that these statements, fairly construed, .were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">From these considerations, it appears that the learned judge was right in ordering a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant\u2019s exceptions must b.e overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed, with interest, and the defendant in error recovers its costs of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
