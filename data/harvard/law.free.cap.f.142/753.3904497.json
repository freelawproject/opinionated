Baur, in his original patent as it stood before the disclaimer was filed, described and claimed the Kelbe product as \u201ccharacterized by the odor of natural musk,\u201d and he made a similar statement in his subsequent patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">However this may be, we concur in the conclusion of the court below as to lack of proof of infringement by defendants. The burden of proof was upon the complainant to show that the products imported by defendants were derived from the sources named in the patent after disclaimer. The testimony of the experts for complainant fails to establish this fact, and it is therefore insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The decree is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
