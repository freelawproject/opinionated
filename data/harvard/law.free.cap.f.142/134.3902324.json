The action was tried without the intervention of a jury, under the act of Congress of March 3, I860 (Rev. St. \u00a7 649 [U. S. Comp. St 1901, p. 525]), and the only specification of error relied upon, is, that the court \u201cerred in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant.\u201d This specification does, not aver that the judgment to which it relates was founded upon any special finding of fact, and we cannot assume that any such finding was either requested or made, for there is nothing in the record which would justify us in doing so. All that appears is \u201ca general verdict, which includes or may include, as it generally does, mixed questions of law and fact\u201d; and that \u201cin such cases, a bill of exceptions cannot be used to bring up the whole testimony for review any more than in a trial by jury,\u201d is too well settled to be open to question. Norris v. Jackson, 9 Wall. 125, 19 L Ed. 608; Kearney v. Case, 12 Wall. 275, 20 L. Ed. 395; Martinton v. Fairbanks, 112 U. S. 670, 5 Sup. Ct. 321, 28 L. Ed. 862; Dooley v. Pease, 180 U. S. 126, 21 Sup. Ct. 329, 45 L. Ed. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">There is, therefore, no error of which we can take cognizance, and the judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
