(\u201cNADS/USA\u201d) from advertising its \u201cNo Heat Hair Removal Gel\u201d with the representation that \u201cNo Preparation is Required,\u201d without a disclosure that the consumer\u2019s hair needs to be a minimum 1/8 to 1/4-ineh long for the gel to be effective. NADS/USA appeals, contending that the district court erred in concluding that the advertisement is literally false unless reference is made to the minimum hair length. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a), and we agree with NADS/USA.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-21\">\u201cTo demonstrate falsity within the meaning of the Lanham Act, a plaintiff may show that the statement was literally false, either on its face or by necessary implication, or that the statement was literally true but likely to mislead the consumers.\u201d <em>Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co., </em>108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.1997). To find an advertisement \u201cliterally false\u201d by \u201cnecessary implication,\u201d as the district court did here, the claim must be analyzed in its entirety to determine whether \u201cthe audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.\u201d <em>Clorox Co. Puerto Rico v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., </em>228 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.2000). Here, NADS/USA\u2019s claim that its \u201cno heat\u201d hair removal gel requires \u201cno preparation\u201d is at least ambiguous as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>whether \u201cno preparation\u201d of the gel is required, as opposed to that required for other hair removal products (such as heating, for wax), or \u201cno preparation\u201d of the person is required. Given that ambiguity, the doctrine of literal falsity is inapplicable and thus cannot sustain the preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
