R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two violations of the Hobbs Act for robbing two stores, and five violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for either using, brandishing, or discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. Defendant was sentenced to a total of forty years and ten months of imprisonment. He appealed on four grounds. We rejected all but defendant\u2019s argument that the five \u00a7 924(c) convictions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because they were multiplicious. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>247 F.3d 1080 (10th Cir.2001). We concluded that each of defendant\u2019s Hobbs Act convictions could serve as a predicate offense for only one \u00a7 924(c) violation. <em>Id. </em>at 1084. Accordingly, we remanded the action to the district court with directions to vacate the judgments of conviction and sentences on the five \u00a7 924(c) counts and to enter a judgment of conviction and sentence on \u201cno more than one \u00a7 924(c) count per Hobbs Act conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1090-91. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">On remand, defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the district court had discretion to choose which two of the five \u00a7 924(c) counts to enter judgment on and that the court should exercise that discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>enter judgment on the first two \u00a7 924(c) counts, which carried terms of only five and seven years, respectively. In his personal statements to the court, defendant argued that imposing a twenty-five year consecutive sentence for the second firearms offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C) would violate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not mention \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Defendant further argued that the adjustments to his offense level set forth in the presentence investigation report also ran afoul of <em>Apprendi </em>because they depended on facts that were not specified in the indictment or found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The district court rejected the arguments of both defendant\u2019s counsel and defendant himself, and entered judgment against defendant on Counts 1, 4, 6, and 8. The court imposed concurrent sentences of seventy months on Counts 1 and 6 (Hobbs Act violations), which were to run consecutively to a term of ten years on Count 4 (discharging a firearm during a crime of violence), which, in turn, was to run consecutively to a term of twenty-five years on Count 8 (brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence). Although brandishing a firearm ordinarily carries a minimum sentence of seven years, the minimum sentence was increased to twenty-five years under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) because it was a second or subsequent \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>counsel has advised the court that, after conscientious examination, he believes the case to be wholly frivolous, and he has submitted a brief referring to anything in the record arguably supportive of the appeal. Defendant has been given an opportunity to raise any point he chooses, and has filed a statement raising several additional arguments. We have thoroughly examined all the proceedings and conclude that the appeal is in fact frivolous. We therefore grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel addresses the argument that imposing a consecutive twenty-five year sentence for Count 8 under \u00a7 924(e)(1)(C)(i) violates <em>Apprendi. </em>As counsel explains, this case does not implicate the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">First, <em>Apprendi </em>was concerned only with facts that increase the statutory maximum penalty, and the relevant facts under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) increase only the statutory minimum penalty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, <em>Apprendi </em>expressly excludes \u201cthe fact of a prior conviction\u201d from its general rule. 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Here, the only fact that triggered the increased statutory minimum under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) was defendant\u2019s prior conviction for a \u00a7 924(c) violation. This fact did not need to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi 53</em>0 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Villalva, </em>232 F.3d 1329, 1332 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that indictment that does not contain separate charge for prior conviction of aggravated felony does not ran afoul of <em>Apprendi). </em>Finally, because both of defendant\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) convictions arose out of the same criminal proceeding, the jury here did find both the first and the second \u00a7 924(c) convictions beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In his pro se statement, defendant argues that three incremental increases of his offense level for the Hobbs Act violations, which resulted in a total increase of seven points, also violated <em>Apprendi </em>because they depended on facts that were not alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Although these adjustments may have affected the sentence defendant received under the Sentencing Guidelines, they did not affect the statutory maximum sentence defendant received and, therefore, they do not implicate <em>Apprendi. </em>The statutory maximum sentence for a Hobbs Act violation is twenty years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). Defendant received two concurrent sentences of seventy months, or five years and ten months, on his Hobbs Act convictions. These are well below the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Defendant also argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant was not properly advised that his second and each subsequent \u00a7 924(c) violation would trigger a statutory minimum sentence of twenty-five years. Defendant contends that if he had been properly advised of the sentencing scheme, he would have accepted a plea agreement offered by the government for nineteen years. Absent certain limited circumstances not present here, \u201c[t]he rule in this circuit ... is that claims of constitutionally ineffective counsel should be brought on collateral review, in the first petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>56 F.3d 1239, 1242 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc). Ineffective assistance claims that are brought on direct appeal are \u201cpresumptively dismissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1240. Therefore, we will not consider defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The final issue, raised by both defendant and his counsel, is that Agent Nevill provided false testimony to the grand jury about what information he received from third parties about defendant\u2019s involvement in the robberies. Defendant contends that the testimony Agent Nevill gave at a pretrial hearing shows that his earlier testimony before the grand jury was false. This issue was not raised in the first appeal, it was not raised before the district court on remand, and it is clearly outside the scope of our mandate. Accordingly, we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See generally United States v. Duncan, </em>242 F.3d 940, 950 (10th Cir.) (discussing \u201cgeneral rale\u201d that this court will \u201cnot consider an issue not presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 122 S.Ct. 134, 151 L.Ed.2d 87 (2001); <em>United States v. Webb, </em>98 F.3d 585, 587 (10th Cir.1996) (discussing mandate rule and limited circumstances under which departure from scope of mandate is permissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Based upon our careful review, we conclude that this appeal does not raise any non-frivolous issues for review. Therefore, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-7\">. We are aware that the Supreme Court currently has under review a case that presents the question whether a fact that increases the statutory minimum must also be alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 663, 151 L.Ed.2d 578 (2001) (acceptance of certiorari). Even if the Court were to hold that the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>does extend to statutory m\u00ednimums, however, defendant's argument would still fail on the other grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\">. Any challenge defendant might raise to the application of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(ii) to a second \u00a7 924(c) count that arises out of the same criminal proceeding as the first \u00a7 924(c) count is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132-34, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
