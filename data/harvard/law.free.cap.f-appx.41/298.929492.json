R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Defendant-appellant Earnest Daniels, Jr. pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced to forty-six months of imprisonment, to be followed by a term of three years of supervised release. Mr. Daniels presents two issues on appeal: (1) whether a prior conviction for sexual assault on a child was properly defined as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and (2) whether the district court believed that it did not have the authority to depart from sentencing guidelines. We have jurisdiction over Mr. Daniels\u2019 appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our jurisdiction to review Mr. Daniels\u2019 sentence arises under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s factual findings regarding sentencing for clear error and review its legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Arevalo, </em>242 F.3d 925, 927 (10th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Maldonado-Acosta, </em>210 F.3d 1182, 1183 (10th Cir.2000)). Whether Mr. Daniels\u2019 state felony conviction for sexual assault on a child is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Moyer, </em>282 F.3d 1311, 1314 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The district court found that Mr. Daniels\u2019 prior conviction for sexual assault on a child constituted a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d which increased his base offense level to 20, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). Mr. Daniels makes several arguments challenging this determination. First, he contends that the district court erroneously placed the burden on him to prove his state felony conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Based on our review of the entire transcript of the sentencing proceeding, the district court did not place the burden of proof on Mr. Daniels. He is relying on one statement by the court. When read as a whole, the transcript clearly indicates that the burden of proof was not shifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Mr. Daniels was convicted of a violation of Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-3-405, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">\u00a7 18-3-405. Sexual assault on a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">(1) Any actor who knowingly subjects another not his or her spouse to any sexual contact commits sexual assault on a child if the victim is less than fifteen years of age and the actor is at least four years older than the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-16\">(2) Sexual assault on a child is a class 4 felony, but it is a class 3 felony if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-17\">(a) The actor applies force against the victim in order to accomplish or facilitate sexual contact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-18\">(b) The actor, in order to accomplish or facilitate sexual contact, threatens imminent death, serious bodily injury, extreme pain, or kidnapping against the victim or another person, and the victim believes that the actor has the present ability to execute the threat; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-19\">(c) The actor, in order to accomplish or facilitate sexual contact, threatens retaliation by causing in the future the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>death or serious bodily injury, extreme pain or kidnapping against the victim or another person and the victim believes that the actor will execute the threat....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Mr. Daniels argues that his prior conviction was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because a class 4 felony under \u00a7 18-3^405 does not include in its definition force or threats of force as an element of the crime. He contends that because he was convicted of \u201csexual contact,\u201d the least severe unlawful sexual conduct under the Colorado Criminal Code, he is not guilty of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d He states that sexual contact with a child under the age of fifteen does not present a risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">To evaluate his arguments, we look to the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d set forth in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(a) The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">(2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">(Emphasis added.) If Mr. Daniels\u2019 conviction for sexual assault on a child fits the \u201cor otherwise\u201d category of offenses described in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), it is not necessary that the offense had as an element the use or threatened use of physical force, and his base offense level was properly increased by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">In <em>United States v. Reyes-Castro, </em>13 F.3d 377 (10th Cir.1993), this court addressed the question of whether attempted sexual abuse of a child of twelve could be considered a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. The offense in question in <em>Reyes-Castro </em>did not involve physical force as an element of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 379. However, we concluded that \u201c[bjecause the crime involves a <em>non-consensual </em>act upon another person, there is a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense. It does not matter whether physical force is actually used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We further concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">[a] common sense view of the sexual abuse statute, in combination with the legal determination that children are incapable of consent, suggests that when an older person attempts to sexually touch a child under the age of fourteen [below the age of consent in Utah], there is always a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure the child\u2019s compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">A more analogous case would be <em>United States v. Coronado-Cervantes, </em>154 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.1998), which involved determining whether sexual contact with a child under the age of twelve was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the \u201cor otherwise\u201d clause of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). In <em>Coronado-Cervantes </em>we again took the common sense approach and determined, that by <em>its very nature, </em>the act of engaging in sexual contact with a minor \u201cpresented a serious potential risk of injury to [the] victim and thus should be considered a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. Whenever a minor child is sexually assaulted by an older person the inherent power imbalance presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-15\">By statute, the State of Colorado has defined a person under the age of eighteen variously as a child or a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>incapable of consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In crafting \u00a7 18-3-405, the Colorado legislature has purposefully chosen to further protect a more narrow group, children under the age of fifteen. In doing so they recognized the risks present in non-consensual contact with a child fourteen or younger. The district court, in accord with our precedent, properly determined Mr. Daniels\u2019 prior conviction under Colorado law for assault of a minor child a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Mr. Daniels also argues on appeal that the district court erred in denying a downward departure in his sentencing. Generally, we lack jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart from the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Guidry, </em>199 F.3d 1150, 1161 (10th Cir.1999). Mr. Daniels acknowledges that such discretionary decisions are largely unreviewable. However, he maintains that an exception occurs if a court erroneously believes it does not have the authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">This exception has a very narrow application. \u201c[T]he courts of appeals cannot exercise jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the sentencing guidelines except in the very rare circumstances that the district court states that it does not have any authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range for the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir.1998) (citations omitted). We will not assume the district court was unaware of its discretion to depart downward from the guidelines, even if the district court is silent on the point. <em>United States v. Rowen, </em>73 F.3d 1061, 1063 (10th Cir.1996). \u201c[U]n-less the judge\u2019s language unambiguously states the judge does not believe he has authority to downward depart, we will not review his decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>30 F.3d 1318, 1319 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">There is nothing in the record that leads us to believe that the district court was unaware of its discretion to depart from the guidelines. The court listened to argument from Mr. Daniels and specifically found that \u201cthe defendant has not demonstrated that the criminal history category overrepresents the seriousness of defendant\u2019s past record.\u201d R. Vol. 3 at 37. The court addressed both whether or not the criminal history category significantly overrepresented the seriousness of defendant\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood that the defendant would commit further crimes. <em>Id. </em>It is very clear from the district court\u2019s statements regarding the application of USSG \u00a7 4A1.3 that the court understood that it had authority to depart, but did not feel that departure was warranted. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider the court\u2019s departure decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-8\">.
