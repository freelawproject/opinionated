We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-21\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b735-22\">Baldwin was indicted on four federal charges, including one count of armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) (Count I), and one count of brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (Count IV). He moved for the dismissal of Count IV, contending that its inclusion violated principles of statutory construction and double jeopardy. The district court denied Baldwin\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-23\">He subsequently pled guilty to Counts I and IV of the indictment. On May 25, 2000, he was sentenced to 188 months for the armed robbery and a consecutive 84 months for brandishing a firearm during the robbery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges these consecutive sentences on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">The interpretation of a statute by the district court is a legal question, which we review on appeal <em>de novo. See United States v. Thomas, </em>211 F.3d 316, 319 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Baldwin asserts that the express language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) precludes the imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment for armed robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and for brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides that \u201c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who\u201d brandishes a firearm during a crime of violence is to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than seven years. Baldwin submits that this provision creates an exception to the imposition of consecutive sentences mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(D)(ii),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by excluding consecutive sentences when a greater minimum sentence is provided by any other law. Thus, Baldwin argues that since his guideline sentence of 188 months for armed robbery exceeds the 84-month mandatory minimum sentence for brandishing a firearm and because the sentencing guidelines qualify as \u201cany other provision of law,\u201d the imposition of the 84-month sentence violates the \u201c[e]xcept to the extent\u201d language used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We addressed the same general argument in <em>United States v. Jolivette, </em>257 F.3d 581 (6th Cir.2001). Jolivette pled guilty to a three-count indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, armed bank robbery and using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence. <em>See id. </em>at 582. He was sentenced to two concurrent terms for the bank robbery and conspiracy charges, and a consecutive 60-month term for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) firearm violation. <em>See id. </em>Jolivette claimed that the language in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) prohibited the enhancement of his sentence for a firearm violation pursuant to \u00a7 924(c). He argued that because the sentencing guidelines provided greater penalties for robbery committed with a firearm than for robbery committed without a firearm, and because the guidelines included use of a firearm among the specific offense characteristics for the offense of robbery, it was clear that Congress did not intend that \u00a7 924(c) should be available to enhance the penalty for robbery where a firearm was used. <em>See id. </em>at 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The panel rejected Jolivette\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 924(c) and followed similar decisions in <em>United States v. Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d 386 (8th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Studifin, </em>240 F.3d 415 (4th Cir.2001), which held that \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not nullify a consecutive term of imprisonment for a firearm charge when another provision imposes a higher mandatory minimum sentence for conduct other than firearm-related conduct proscribed by \u00a7 924(c)(1) or \u201cby any other provision of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">In <em>Studifin, </em>the defendant claimed that his sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because the imposition of \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)\u2019s mandatory minimum consecutive sentence in addition to the mandatory minimum sentence required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) punished the same conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>and constituted improper double counting under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See Studifin, </em>240 F.3d at 419. Relying exclusively on an earlier opinion from the Eighth Circuit in <em>Alaniz, </em>the court rejected Studifin\u2019s arguments and summed up by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">We agree with the <em>Alaniz </em>court that in light of the structure and language of \u00a7 924(c)(1), it is clear that the \u201cexcept to the extent\u201d language is designed to \u201clink the remaining prefatory language in (c)(1)(A) to\u201d the other subdivisions. <em>Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d at 389. We also believe that the \u201cany other provision of law\u201d language provides a safety valve that would preserve the applicability of any other provisions that could impose an even greater mandatory minimum consecutive sentence for a violation of \u00a7 924(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">Examining the statute as a whole, particularly in light of the language of \u00a7 924(c) and the purpose behind the 1998 amendments, we do not believe that Congress intended to narrow \u00a7 924(c) by eliminating mandatory consecutive sentences where another provision imposes a higher mandatory minimum sentence for conduct other than that described in \u00a7 924(c). For these reasons, we reject Studifin\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 924(c) and conclude that Studifin\u2019s sentence does not constitute double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">In <em>Alaniz, </em>the Eighth Circuit rejected the argument that the \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d language in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) applies to the predicate offense, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aky\">We have scoured the statutory language, yet we find no support for the proposition ... that subdivision (c)(1)(A)\u2019s \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d clause applies to the predicate drug trafficking crime or crime of violence of which a particular defendant has been convicted. Subdivision (c)(1)(A)\u2019s \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d clause refers only to the firearm-related conduct proscribed either by \u00a7 924(c)(1) or \u201cby any other provision of law.\u201d The ten-year mandatory minimum drug sentence at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) does not govern firearm-related conduct, and therefore does not fall within subdivision (c)(1)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cany other provision of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Alaniz, 235 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The panel in <em>Jolivette </em>adopted the Eight Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Alaniz </em>and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">Neither subsection (a) nor subsection (d) of \u00a7 2113 contains a minimum sentence; the sentence prescribed by subsection (a) does not govern firearm-related conduct; and although the sentence prescribed by subsection (d) governs the use of \u201ca dangerous weapon or device,\u201d it is not specific to firearms. We hold that the sentences in those subsections do not fall within \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cany other provision of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-13\"><em>Jolivette, </em>257 F.3d at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Following the decisions in <em>Jolivette, Alaniz </em>and <em>Studifin, </em>we conclude that Baldwin\u2019s consecutive sentences under \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d), and \u00a7 924(c) must stand. We reject Baldwin\u2019s argument that the sentencing provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) fall under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)\u2019s reference to \u201cany other provision of law.\u201d Therefore, we find that his consecutive 84-month sentence is not in violation of the \u201cgreater minimum sentence\u201d language used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b735-24\">.
