For the reasons discussed below, Farrad\u2019s sentence is hereby VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">On June 16, 1999, Defendant-Appellant Malik First Born Allah Farrad (\u201cFarrad\u201d) was indicted for the distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d or \u201ccrack\u201d) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (\u201cCount One\u201d), along with numerous other counts related to the sale and possession of crack cocaine. The indictment charged Farrad generally with crack distribution and possession, without specifying any amount. The jury convicted Farrad on all counts, without making any determination of the quantity of crack involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Prior to sentencing, the probation office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cpresentence report\u201d). As to Count One, the report stated that Farrad\u2019s actions constituted a Class A felony, subject to a sentence of \u201c10 years to life imprisonment, $4,000,000, at least 5 years supervised release.\u201d Under \u201cOffense Conduct,\u201d the presentence report recounted the testimony of several Government witnesses regarding the amount of crack they sold under Farrad\u2019s supervision. Based upon this testimony, the probation officer determined the approximate amount of crack that Farrad possessed and distributed to be between 765 grams and 1.05 kilograms. The probation office ultimately assigned Farrad to an Adjusted Offense Level of 41 for Count One. This offense level, in combination with a criminal history category of IV, subjected Farrad to \u201cthe guideline range for imprisonment [of] 360 months to life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Prior to his sentencing hearing, Farrad filed an objection to the presentence report. In particular, Farrad objected to the calculation of the quantity of crack involved in Count One. Farrad argued that the Government\u2019s witnesses pleaded guilty to the distribution and possession of certain amounts of crack under Farrad\u2019s supervision while they testified to actually handling larger amounts at Farrad\u2019s trial. Farrad stated that it is impermissible for the probation officer to assume amounts based on the testimony of those who pleaded guilty to possessing smaller amounts. Farrad insisted, \u201cthere is something fundamentally wrong with allowing the government on the one hand to manipulate the figures on drug quantity to help those it chooses to help at sentencing and on the other hand to ask a court to look the other way and join the manipulation by finding much higher figures of drug quantity to slam those it wants to crush at sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">On April 24, 2000, at his sentencing hearing, Farrad, through his counsel, renewed his objection to the quantity calculated in the presentence report. The Government countered that this quantity was based not only on the testimony of Far-rad\u2019s co-defendants, but also upon the testimony of Johnson City criminal investigator Richard Witt, who worked with the DEA to facilitate Farrad\u2019s arrest. Witt then testified as to his understanding of the amounts of crack that Farrad handled as to Count One. Farrad again objected to the quantities contained in the report. The district court then sentenced Farrad to 360 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Farrad now appeals this sentence, on the grounds that his sentence violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">Because Farrad\u2019s case was pending when the Supreme Court announced the holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>he may challenge his sentence based upon that decision. <em>See United States v. Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d 462, 467 (6th Cir.2001)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>We review a defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to his sentence <em>de novo. See United States v. Lloyd, </em>10 F.3d 1197, 1220 (6th Cir.1993). The Government argues that because Farrad did not make a specific <em>Apprendi </em>objection before the district court, his claim is subject to only plain error review. However, the law of this Circuit is such that a defendant sentenced prior to <em>Apprendi </em>preserves a constitutional challenge to his sentence wherever he in effect makes an <em>Apprendi </em>objection <em>See Strayhorn, </em>250 F.3d at 467 (\u201cwe believe the record makes plain that Strayhom preserved his <em>[Apprendi </em>] challenge by repeatedly objecting to the drag quantity determination at his plea hearing and his sentencing healing, as well as in a written objection to the calculation of his base offense level in the presentence report.\u201d) Here, Farrad made a written objection to the presentence report as to the quantity of drugs and made multiple objections regarding quantity at sentencing. Indeed, at sentencing, Farrad objected specifically to the district court\u2019s wholecloth adoption of the Government\u2019s theory of the quantity of drugs involved in the crime. Though Farrad did not explicitly use the terms \u201cSixth Amendment\u201d or \u201cdue process,\u201d he in effect made an <em>Apprendi </em>objection. <em>See Strayhorn </em>at 467 (\u201cAlthough he did not utter the words \u2018due process\u2019 at either of these hearings, he made it well known that he disputed the district court\u2019s factual finding with respect to drag quantity. We conclude that he adequately preserved his challenge to his sentence.\u201d) Thus, Far-rad did not waive his objection and his <em>Apprendi </em>claim is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the Supreme Court held that \u201cother than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 490. This Circuit has further held that where a defendant is subject to different statutory ranges based upon various elements of a crime, each and every element that can potentially, increase a defendant\u2019s sentencing range must be presented to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>242 F.3d 348, 351-52 (6th Cir.2001) (\u201cAggravating factors, other than a prior conviction, that increase a penalty from a ... lesser to a greater minimum sentence, are now elements of a crime to be charged and proved.\u201d); <em>United States v. Flowal, </em>234 F.3d 932, 938 (6th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe prosecution is only entitled to the punishment provisions of a crime whose elements it has proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The extension of the <em>Apprendi </em>doctrine to statutory ranges has been explicitly considered in the context of drug quantity under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>See, e.g. Ramirez </em>at 349; <em>Flowal </em>at 936. That section contains three potential statutory ranges under which a defendant can be sentenced, based upon the quantity of drugs involved in the crime. Subject to certain additional factors not present here, if a defendant possesses fifty grams or more of crack cocaine, he is subject to a sentence of ten years to life. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). If a defendant possesses five or more grams of crack cocaine, he is subject to a sentence of five to forty years. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). If a defendant simply possesses \u201ca controlled substance in schedule II,\u201d with no specified quantity, he is subject to a maximum sentence of twenty years with no statutory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>This court has consistently held that where a defendant is sentenced under the higher tiers of this scheme, \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), the quantity of drugs must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt; otherwise the defendant should be subject to the lower sentencing range of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See Ramirez </em>at 352 (\u201cWhen a defendant is found guilty of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), he must be sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) unless the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the minimum amounts required by 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(A) and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)\u201d) <em>See also Flowal </em>at 936 (\u201cBecause the amount of drugs at issue determined the appropriate statutory punishment, a jury should have determined the weight of the drugs beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d) To do otherwise would violate a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process and his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Flowal. Id </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Here, Farrad\u2019s indictment failed to specify a quantity of drugs involved in the violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1). Moreover, while different witnesses testified as to amounts of drugs that they distributed under Far-rad\u2019s supervision, the question of drug quantity was not submitted to the jury and thus was not established beyond a reasonable doubt. Given these set of facts, Far-rad is subject only to the statutory range set forth in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). i.e. up to twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">However, the district court failed to sentence Farrad pursuant to this section, and instead, based upon the suggestion of the presentence report, sentenced Farrad pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), ten years to life. Therefore, based upon the theory that drug quantity need only be determined by a preponderance, Farrad was made subject to the highest possible range of punishment, and was sentenced ten years in excess of the maximum of the appropriate statutory range. This is a quintessential <em>Apprendi </em>violation, and thus Farrad is entitled to resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">For the foregoing reasons, Farrad\u2019s sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
