Abdul Mu\u2019Min Is\u2019Haq, formerly known as Bruce Schmalstig, contends the District Court committed several sentencing errors following his entry of a guilty plea. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">On September 14, 1993, Abdul Mu\u2019Min Is\u2019Haq was charged in a ten-count indictment with three bank robberies (violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2113(a) and (d)) and three firearm offenses (violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)). Court-appointed counsel, who allegedly misinformed Is\u2019Haq of his potential length of incarceration,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> advised Is\u2019Haq to plead guilty. Nevertheless, Is\u2019Haq refused a plea offer for a total of twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment. After a jury convicted Is\u2019Haq on all counts, the District Court sentenced him to almost sixty-seven years\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release, and ordered him to pay $23,328.12 in restitution. We affirmed these convictions in October 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-22\">In 1997 Is\u2019Haq brought a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 claim for post-conviction relief. After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court concluded Is\u2019Haq received ineffective assistance of counsel during his plea negotiations. The District Court requested and received an updated pre-sentence report. Is\u2019Haq filed written objections to the PSR, claiming he deserved a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility and that enhancement for obstruction of justice was not warranted. Is\u2019Haq also contended the restitution order was improper \u201cdouble counting,\u201d because a co-defendant had been ordered to pay the same amount (representing the total loss to the banks). After another hearing, the District Court re-sentenced Is\u2019Haq to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment, as if he had accepted the government\u2019s 1994 plea offer. The Court rejected Is\u2019Haq\u2019s two adjustment arguments and affirmed the restitution order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-24\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-25\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-26\">Is\u2019Haq contends the District Court wrongly denied his request for a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. We review a district court\u2019s \u201cfactual determination with respect to acceptance of responsibility\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>clear error <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>146 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir.1998). Is\u2019Haq argues his resentence should have placed him in the \u201cposition he would have occupied\u201d if prior counsel had provided effective assistance. From that position, Is\u2019Haq suggests he would have accepted the 1994 plea offer, \u201caccepting responsibility\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">We disagree. The District Court determined Is\u2019Haq\u2019s 1994 refusal to plead guilty (his \u201croll\u201d of \u201cthe dice\u201d) resulted in a lengthy trial, during which he falsely testified about the robberies and lied to his trial counsel. Those determinations, which pertain directly to Is\u2019Haq\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, are entitled to \u201cgreat deference,\u201d because the sentencing judge \u201cis in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 app. n. 5. Additionally, the District Court determined Is\u2019Haq had \u201cobstructed justice,\u201d justifying an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. \u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 app. n. 4. Is\u2019Haq did not demonstrate his was an \u201cextraordinary\u201d case falling outside this presumption.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Is\u2019Haq next argues the District Court incorrectly held the 1994 offer required him to plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) (endangering other persons with a dangerous weapon during a bank robbery). We review for clear error. <em>United States v. Boone, </em>279 F.3d 163, 177 n. 9 (3d Cir.2002). The District Court determined the plea offer was for \u201cthree bank robberies and one weapons charge.\u201d As noted, the government offered to cap Is\u2019Haq\u2019s sentence at twenty-five years. Is\u2019Haq suggests the \u201clogical plain-sense understanding\u201d of the plea is that \u201cthree bank robberies\u201d referred to charges under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), the statutory maximum of which would be twenty years. Therefore, when added to the five-year consecutive sentence for a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) charge, the plea offer would total twenty-five years. But in its September 2001 opinion, the District Court found the plea agreement encompassed all six robbery counts, which ultimately enhanced Is\u2019Haq\u2019s total offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">Is\u2019Haq did not demonstrate the government had offered (or would offer) to dismiss the \u00a7 2113(d) counts. When asked about his understanding of the agreement, Is\u2019Haq testified he only thought if he \u201cpled guilty [the government] would drop the two gun charges.\u201d Moreover, the Assistant United States Attorney testified the government\u2019s plea offer would have required Is\u2019Haq to plead guilty to \u00a7 2113(d). The government and defense counsel apparently referred to counts under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) as \u201cthe three bank robberies.\u201d The District Court found the reference to a twenty-year maximum sentence was \u201cnot probative of whether the plea agreement would encompass a guilty plea to the \u00a7 2113(d) charges.\u201d That conclusion is supported by the record. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Is\u2019Haq contends the District Court should not have granted a two-point enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. We review the factual <em>determination that </em>Is\u2019Haq obstructed justice for clear error. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>113 F.3d 464, 467 (3d Cir.1997). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Is\u2019Haq concedes he committed perjury during his trial. But he suggests enhancing his sentence by two levels was improper, because with proper legal representation, he would never have had a trial \u2014 or an opportunity to \u201cobstruct justice.\u201d Is\u2019Haq contends the sentencing court did not \u201creturn\u201d him to his pre-trial \u201cposition\u201d and that any \u201cobstruction\u201d was directly related to ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We disagree. Application note 4 to \u00a7 3C1.1 identifies \u201ccommitting, suborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\u201d as justifications for the enhancement. Is\u2019Haq admitted he committed perjury during trial and induced his father to testify falsely, hoping to establish an alibi. At the post-conviction hearing Is\u2019Haq testified his attorney advised him not to take the stand, so his \u201cobstructions\u201d did not result from counsel\u2019s advice. Sentencing courts responding to claims of denial of effective counsel \u201chave considerable discretion in fashioning a remedy appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Day, </em>969 F.2d 39, 47 (3d Cir.1992). Under the facts of this case, a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 was justified. <em>See United States v. Bethancourt, </em>65 F.3d 1074, 1081 (3d Cir.1995). Moreover, Is\u2019Haq\u2019s adjusted offense level, including the enhancement, was 34, the same it would be under the career offender provision (U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(B)), for which Is\u2019Haq qualified. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Finally, Is\u2019Haq contends the District Court did not adequately address his ability to satisfy the restitution order. Given Is\u2019Haq\u2019s failure to object during the 2255 hearing, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>245 F.3d 294, 312 (3d Cir.2001). During the post-conviction hearing, Is\u2019Haq\u2019s current counsel represented, \u201c[Is\u2019Haq] does not quibble with the $23,000. He just thinks it ought to be equally apportioned. But he understands that it is money he has stolen ... and that therefore he is responsible for the and willing to pay that.\u201d When asked for clarification, counsel said Is\u2019Haq hoped to ensure his obligations were \u201cjoint and several\u201d with his co-defendant, Edward Lugo. The District Court then entered the order on liability that Is\u2019Haq requested, finding Is\u2019Haq and Lugo \u201cjointly and severally\u201d liable for restitution in the amount of $23,328.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">Defense counsel did not object to Is\u2019Haq\u2019s paying restitution under the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP). Is\u2019Haq simply asked the District Court to suspend his obligation to pay while he was incarcerated, and direct him to pay the entire amount on supervised release. Thereafter, the District Court adopted the PSR\u2019s finding that Is\u2019Haq was capable of paying the restitution amount. <em>See United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 207 n. 10 (3d Cir.1999) (holding an unchallenged conclusion in a PSR is \u201cof course, a proper basis for sentence determination\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Cannistraro, </em>871 F.2d 1210, 1214 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cBy failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>contest the underlying factors used by the district court imposing the order of restitution, [defendant] has waived his right to contest this order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The restitution order complied with the requirements of the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court chose not to impose a fine and waived the interest requirement on the restitution sum. Based on Is\u2019Haq\u2019s representations \u2014 along with his good health and vocational skills \u2014 the District Court found Is\u2019Haq could satisfy the restitution order. The District Court met its obligations under VWPA. <em>See United States v. Kendis, </em>883 F.2d 209, 210 (3d Cir.1989) (specific findings relating to a defendant\u2019s ability to pay restitution \u201cnot required when there is no dispute regarding a defendant\u2019s ability to make restitution\u201d) (quotations and citations omitted). We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the sentence imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-19\">. Is\u2019Haq contends counsel advised him that his exposure, if convicted on all counts, would be forty-five years, with a fifteen-year ineligibility period for good-time credits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">. Nor do we believe that District Court \"punished\u201d Is\u2019Haq for \u201csteadfastly denying\u201d the weapon he used was a \"handgun,\u201d the possession of which violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Is\u2019Haq insists he used a pellet gun. But that testimony can be reconciled neither with Is\u2019Haq\u2019s willingness to plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 nor with the testimony of a robbery victim, who stated, based on military experience, that Is\u2019Haq\u2019s weapon was a handgun. The District Court held, \"I don\u2019t believe for a minute that that was a pellet gun .... \u201d Given the discretion accorded the sentencing judge on factual matters, we believe Is\u2019Haq\u2019s failure to \"accept responsibility\u201d for the weapon used during the robberies justified the denial of a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-12\">. Under \u00a7 4B1.1, the \"career offender provision,\u201d a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) carries a statutory maximum of twenty years, with a corresponding career offense level of 32. A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) carries a statutory maximum of twenty-five years, with a corresponding career offense level of 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b616-8\">. The VWPA was supplemented in 1996 by the Vicims Restitution Act of 1996, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A and 3664, which orders restitution regardless of the defendant's ability to pay. But Is\u2019Haq\u2019s crime was committed in 1993, so the VWPAprovides the relevant standards. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>162 F.3d 87, 89 (3d Cir.1998) (considering whether restitution was tailored \"to a defendant\u2019s potential assets or earning capacity\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
