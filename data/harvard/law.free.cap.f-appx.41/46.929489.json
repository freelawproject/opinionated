(\u201cLincoln\u201d) challenges the district court\u2019s order granting appellees David and Celeste Hetland\u2019s (\u201cthe Hetlands\u201d) motion to compel arbitration. Having reviewed <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to compel arbitration, <em>Chiron Corp. v. Ortho. Diagnostic Sys., Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir.2000), we conclude that the Hetlands failed to comply with the arbitration clause requirements of the contract between the parties, and reverse the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">In April of 1993, the Hetlands, in their capacity as owners of Lincoln Pre-Cut Homes, Inc., entered into two separate agreements \u2014 a Production Agreement (\u201cPA\u201d) and a Trademark Sale Agreement (\u201cSA\u201d) \u2014 with Lincoln, a publicly traded corporation engaged in the manufacture of log homes. At the time the agreements were executed, Pre-cut was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The SA assigned Pre-cut\u2019s federal trademark rights in the trademark \u201cLincoln\u201d to a new corporation, Lincoln Holding Corp., to be jointly and equally owned by the Hetlands and Lincoln. The PA, created in partial consideration of the transfer of ownership of the trademark, provided that the Hetlands produce log wall products for Lincoln according to specifications provided by Lincoln.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-16\">Soon after the contracts were executed, Lincoln claimed that the Hetlands were in breach for failure to perform their obligations under the PA. Pursuant to requirements of the PA, Lincoln sent \u201cnotices\u201d claiming the Hetlands had not performed as required by the contract. These \u201cnotices to cure\u201d were sent on October 15, 1993 and November 25, 1993. According to Lincoln, the Hetlands failed to respond to these notices, neither seeking arbitration nor acting to cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>On January 21, 1994, Lincoln\u2019s CEO informed the Hetlands, by letter, that their relationship was terminated immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Lincoln claims that such termination was necessary to prevent further economic harm to its company; the Hetlands claim that this termination left their business \u201cfinancially ruined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The following November, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement between the parties, recommended by the trustee, whereby in exchange for a payment of $37,000 to the Hetlands\u2019 bankruptcy Estate, the Estate released its security interest in the trademark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">On January 19, 2000, just prior to the end of the six year statute of limitations for breach of contract claims under Washington law, RCW 4.16.040(1), and without any prior efforts to seek arbitration under the terms of the contract, the Hetlands filed a complaint in federal district court alleging that Lincoln\u2019s termination of the Production Agreement constituted a breach of contract. In their complaint, the Hetlands sought to compel arbitration of their claim for damages allegedly caused by Lincoln\u2019s termination of the PA in violation of the contract\u2019s arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">On December 15, 2000, the district court issued its decision on Hetlands\u2019 motion to compel arbitration and Lincoln\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. Relying on the PA\u2019s \u201cbroad arbitration clause,\u201d and noting that the district court has \u201clittle discretion to deny an arbitration motion,\u201d (citing <em>Republic of Nicaragua v. Standard Fruit Co., </em>937 F.2d 469, 475 (9th Cir.1991)), the court ordered that the parties proceed to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Lincoln appeals that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Two provisions of the PA are relevant to the dispute before us. First, under \u00a7 10(b) of the PA, titled \u201cCancellation,\u201d the parties agreed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-11\">In the event that Hetland is unable to meet the Company\u2019s [Lincoln\u2019s] production services needs, the Company shall notify Hetland and give him ten (10) days notice to cure any such deficiency; in the absence of which the company shall then have the immediate right to terminate this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">Lincoln contends that pursuant to this clause, it was within its right to unilaterally terminate the contract without resort to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Second, in addition to agreeing, at \u00a7 19, that the PA \u201cshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington,\u201d under \u00a7 17 of the PA, titled <em>\u201cArbitration,\u201d </em>the parties also agreed to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-14\">Any dispute arising pursuant to this Agreement which cannot be resolved by the parties themselves shall be settled by arbitration to be held in the State of Washington. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The decision reached by such arbitration shall be final and binding and may be filed with the clerk of any court of competent jurisdiction and a judgment confirming such decision may, if desired by any party to the arbitration, be entered in such court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">The Hetlands contend that Lincoln\u2019s unilateral termination violated this broad arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">Although the arbitration clause may be controlling, and its meaning clear, the Het<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>lands did not abide by its terms. By the terms of the contract, the parties agreed that while arbitration shall be <em>\u201cheld </em>in the State of Washington,\u201d any arbitration process is to be <em>\u201cconducted </em>in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\u201d (emphasis added). Instead of focusing, as the district court did, on the requirements of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>we need only look to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cthe Rules\u201d), which the parties explicitly agreed to be bound by with respect to arbitration matters, in order to decide whether the district court erred in granting the Hetlands\u2019 motion to compel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The relevant provision of the Rules, R-4, requires the \u201cinitiating party\u201d to, \u201cwithin the time period, if any, specified in the contract(s), give to the other party (the \u2018respondent\u2019) written notice of its intention to arbitrate (the \u2018demand\u2019),\u201d with a description of the nature of the dispute, the parties, and amount involved. Commercial Arbitration Rule R-4(a)(i). The initiating party must also, <em>inter alia, </em>file two copies of the demand with an office of the American Arbitration Association. <em>Id. </em>at (a)(ii). The Hetlands concede that they failed to comply with the Rules. Having failed to ever give notice to Lincoln of its intention to arbitrate its dispute over the PA, despite nearly six years during which time it could easily have done so, the Hetlands may not now compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">REVERSED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">. In its order approving the trustee\u2019s proposed settlement, however, the bankruptcy court explicitly stated, \"Provided that neither the settlement nor this order shall result in the determination of any default under the Trademark Sale Agreement or the Production Agreement.\u201d The court informed the Hetlands \u201cyour rights are <em>not </em>being foreclosed by this settlement,\u201d and \"you're free to pursue whatever individual rights you still have.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\">. At oral argument, counsel for the Hetland's maintained that the Washington Arbitration Act, RCW 7.04.010-7.04.220, should control the outcome of this case. Such a claim is without merit and defies the clear language of the contract, which states that the parties are bound, instead, by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties agreed only to apply Washington\u2019s substantive law to the merits, and that arbitration would be conducted in the State of Washington. Even were we to apply the Washington Arbitration Act to this case, however, the Hetlands\u2019 claims would similarly fail because both relevant provisions of the Act require that notice be given to the other party prior to arbitration. RCW 7.04.040 (\"a party to a written agreement for arbitration claiming the neglect or refusal of another to proceed with an arbitration thereunder may make application to the court for an order directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with their agreement. Eight days notice in writing of such application shall be served upon the party alleged to be in default\u201d); RCW 7.04.060 (\"When a controversy arises from a written agreement containing a provision to settle by arbitration a controversy ... the party demanding arbitration shall serve upon the other party, personally or by registered mail, a written notice of his intention to arbitrate ... [giving the other party 20 days to respond].\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
