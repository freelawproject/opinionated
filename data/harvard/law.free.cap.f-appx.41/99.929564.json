R.App. P. 34(a)(2). The case was originally set for submission without argument on July 12, 2001, but submission was deferred pending the resolution of <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173, <em>opinion amended and superseded by </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (May 28, 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b121-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-23\">Hernandez-Loya appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss an indictment that charged him with, <em>inter alia, </em>importation of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960. Hernandez^ Loya pleaded guilty to violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960, but preserved his right to appeal the constitutionality of that statute. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recite them in detail except as necessary. We have jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Hernandez-Loya first argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This court has rejected that argument. <em>See United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We also note that Hernandez-Loya cannot assert an as-applied challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 because as in <em>Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d at 1109-1110, and <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2002), Hernandez-Loya was never exposed to a sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum. The Supreme Court held in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490. Here, Hernandez-Loya agreed pursuant to the plea agreement that he imported 45.036 kilograms of marijuana. The district court sentenced Hernandez-Loya to 12 months and 1 day in prison and three years of supervised release, far less than the statutory maximum of five years for importing fewer than 50 kilograms of marijuana. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4). Accordingly, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Hernandez-Loya next argues that the indictment should have been dismissed pursuant to <em>Apprendi </em>because it failed to allege knowledge of the nature and quantity of the drug. \u201cA defendant charged with importing or possessing a drug is not required to know the type and amount of the drug,\u201d and <em>Apprendi </em>did not change this. <em>Carranza, </em>289 F.3d at 644. Therefore, the indictment was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AOW\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
