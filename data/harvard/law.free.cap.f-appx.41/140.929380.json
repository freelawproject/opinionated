The district court also held that the disallowance by the I.R.S. of an investment tax credit carryback was not an \u201caffected item\u201d requiring a partner level determination and thus did not require a separate notice of deficiency to McBride. Thus, the six month statute of limitations remains applicable in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-21\">We adopt the reasoning of the district court, set forth in its Order of June 13, 2001, in which it properly dismissed McBride\u2019s claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b162-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
