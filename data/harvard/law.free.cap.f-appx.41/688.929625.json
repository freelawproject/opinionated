Accordingly, when the Pension Trust of Bethlehem Steel Corporation (\u201cPension Trust\u201d) calculated the appellants\u2019 pensions, it excluded COLAs from the base rate of pay used in the calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The dispute in this case arises from the fact that even though no new COLAs have been paid since 1989, the Pension Trust has still been subtracting COLAs from the earnings on which the appellants\u2019 pensions have been calculated. The appellants, who retired in 1994 and later, claim that these subtractions were improper. In response, the Pension Trust explained that, although no new COLAs have been given since 1989, the appellants\u2019 base rate of pay included COLAs from previous collective bargaining agreements, which had been \u201crolled into\u201d the employees\u2019 base rate of pay. Because COLAs since 1975 are, under the terms of the relevant Pension Agreement, to be excluded from earnings for the pension calculation, the Pension Trust subtracted those \u201crolled in\u201d COLAs from the employees\u2019 base rate of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Refusing to accept the Pension Trust\u2019s explanation, the appellants commenced this action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. On the Pension Trust\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the appellants\u2019 claims on the ground that, \u201cunder the express terms of [the relevant Pension] Agreement earnings were strictly defined not to include post-August 1,1975 COLA increases.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Pension Trust of Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>Civil No. 00-418, 2000 WL 708879 (D.Md. May 19, 2000). As such, COLA increases that were rolled into the employees\u2019 base rate of pay had been properly subtracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">On appeal, we affirmed, agreeing with the district court that the Pension Agreement was unambiguous in providing that post 1975</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">COLA increases were to be excluded from base rate of pay. <em>Stewart v. Pension Trust of Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>12 Fed.Appx. 174 (4th Cir.2001). While we affirmed the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Pension Agreement, however, we noted what appeared to be a factual dispute regarding whether the appellants actually received the COLAs that had been deducted from the appellants\u2019 base rate of pay. And on that issue alone we remanded the case to the district court. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 6, 2000 WL 708879.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">On remand, the appellants conceded at a status conference that they were not, in fact, alleging \u201cthat in calculating [the] plaintiffs\u2019 pensions, defendants made a deduction for monies that plaintiffs never received in their paychecks.\u201d Moreover, the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">In opposing defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion, plaintiffs have presented absolutely no evidence to suggest that they did not receive their rolled in COLAs under the 1989 CBA.... Although plaintiffs state that they seek further discovery on the issue, they have made no proffer that would justify such discovery. Such a proffer would be easy to make since, if plaintiffs had received no rolled in COLAs under the 1989 CBA, they would have received substantially less wages under the 1989 CBA agreement than they had been receiving up to that time. They have submitted no affidavits to that effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\"><em>Stewart, </em>Civil No. 00-418, slip op. at 2-3, 2000 WL 1683442. Coupling the lack of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>proffer with the fact that there had been no work stoppage related to COLAs that had not been received, the district court granted the defendants summary judgment, concluding that the appellants had in fact received the pre 1989 COLAs that the Pension Trust subtracted from their base rate of pay to calculate their pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">On appeal, the appellants state the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">The question presented is essentially the same as before: Did the United States District Court err in not permitting the plaintiff to conduct discovery of the appellee\u2019s methods of calculating the plaintiffs pension benefits; and, did the District Court further err when it found that the appellees ... did not act improperly when they deducted substantial portions of income from a retiree\u2019s (appellant\u2019s) \u201cbase rate of pay\u201d prior to calculating appellants\u2019 \u201cpension earnings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Because we have already held that subtracting COLAs that were awarded after August 1, 1975 was appropriate under the Pension Agreement and because we conclude that our previous holding disposed of the issue of the correctness of the pension calculation that appellants now challenge, we affirm. Moreover, our previous holding renders further discovery on the Pension Trust\u2019s methods unnecessary. As the appellants do not challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on the one issue that was before the district court on remand \u2014 \u25a0 whether the appellants actually received the pre 1989 COLAs that were rolled up in their base pay and that were subtracted from their base pay \u2014 we also affirm on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
