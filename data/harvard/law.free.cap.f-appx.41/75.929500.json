The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a), and we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Even assuming Dogloo was automatically added to Doskocil\u2019s policy on the date of the merger, Doskocil may not insure against the loss because the loss had already begun and was known to have begun by September 19, 1997, the date of the merger. <em>See Two Pesos, Inc. v.
