TVA moves for sanctions. Wagner opposes and moves, in the alternative, for the court to transfer the petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. TVA replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121(f) and 7703, Wagner seeks review of an arbitrator\u2019s award in an arbitration between the Law Enforcement Employees Association and TVA upholding TVA\u2019s termination of Wagner from his position as a TVA police officer. Section 7703 provides this court with \u201cbroad jurisdiction\u201d to review final orders and decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. <em>Schafer v. Department of the Interior, </em>88 F.3d 981, 985 (Fed.Cir.1996). On the other hand, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f) \u201cgrants us a narrower jurisdiction in the case of arbitrators\u2019 awards. We may review an arbitrator\u2019s award only if the matter appealed is one \u2018covered under\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4303 ... or 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7512[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Sections 4303 and 7512 cover removals and other adverse actions based on unacceptable performance or misconduct. TVA, a government corporation, is not subject to either of these provisions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301(1)(A)(i) and 7511(b)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">TVA argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over Wagner\u2019s petition because TVA is not subject to the Federal Labor Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7101 <em>et seq. </em>(FLRA). Section 7103(a)(3)(E) of title 5 expressly excludes TVA from the definition of an \u201cagency\u201d subject to the FLRA. <em>See also Salary Policy Employee Panel v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>149 F.3d 485, 490 (6th Cir.1998) (\u201cThe TVA personnel system is independent of the competitive civil service laws ... and, as a federal corporation, TVA is specifically exempt from the provisions of the ... [FLRA], <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a)(3)(E).\u201d). TVA relies on <em>Burke v. United States Postal Service, </em>888 F.2d 833, 834 (Fed.Cir.1989), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-13\">However, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f) (1988) is our sole jurisdictional grant for review of an arbitrator\u2019s award. That section authorizes the same review for arbitration awards under a negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to section 7121(a) as that available for decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-14\">As is clear from the language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7111 (1988), and implicit in the reasoning adopted by this court in <em>Bacashihua v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>811 F.2d 1498, 1501-02 (Fed.Cir.1987), the negotiated grievance procedures authorized by section 7121(a) are limited to those between <em>agencies </em>and labor organizations. An agency for purposes of section 7121(a) is defined as an \u201c[executive agency.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(a) (1988).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cBecause the Postal Service is not an executive agency, Burke\u2019s arbitration award was not the result of a negotiated grievance procedure authorized by section 7121(a). Therefore, section 7121, on its face, does not empower this court to entertain an appeal of an arbitrator\u2019s award pursuant to a Postal Service collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Burke, </em>888 F.2d at 834. TVA argues that the same logic dictates that this court lacks jurisdiction over an arbitration award pursuant to a TVA collective bargaining agreement because the TVA has been explicitly excluded from the definition of an executive agency for purposes of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Wagner concedes that TVA is not an agency for purpose of the FLRA, but asserts that \u00a7 7121(f) contains a \u201csavings clause\u201d that provides for appellate jurisdiction in this court or, in the alternative, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where Wagner resides. Section 7121(f) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">In matters similar to those covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which arise under <em>other personnel systems </em>and which an aggrieved employee has raised under the negotiated grievance procedure, judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s award may be obtained in the same manner and on the same basis as could be obtained of a final decision in such matters raised under <em>applicable appellate procedures.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Without citing to any authority, Wagner maintains that this provision \u201cprovides the protections of judicial review for employees of an entity that would normally be considered an \u2018agency\u2019 but for the fact that it is excepted from such definition in 7103(a)(3).\u201d He argues that the \u201capplicable appellate procedures\u201d referred to in section 7121(f) above is that provided for in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703 pertaining to judicial review of MSPB decisions. Wagner urges: \u201cIn the alternative, ... the phrase \u2018applicable appellate procedures\u2019 in Section 7121(f) refers to those contained in Section 7123 which provides for judicial review of final orders of the Federal Labor Relations Authority!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">Wagner\u2019s alternate constructions of the phrase \u201capplicable appellate procedures\u201d as used in section 7121(f) fails in light of our analysis in <em>Nieuwdorp v. Library of Congress, </em>872 F.2d 1000, 1002 (Fed.Cir.1989). In <em>Nieuwdorp, </em>the former employee of one such \u201cother personnel system\u201d (the Library of Congress) asserted \u201cthat the phrase \u2018applicable appellate procedures\u2019 as used in section 7121(f) should be read as referring to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected this assertion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">The \u201capplicable appellate procedures\u201d are the procedures that would have been available to the employee had the negotiated procedure not been chosen, <em>i.e., </em>the procedures under the Library\u2019s personnel regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">... [Nieuwdorp] argues that he can point to no \u201cother personnel system! ]\u201d which provides for judicial review by statute or regulation. Although our interpretation of \u00a7 7121(f) may generally preclude judicial review of grievance decisions because \u201cother personnel systems\u201d do not authorize judicial review of decisions rendered under the agency\u2019s \u201cappellate procedures, if any,\u201d <em>see </em>section 7121(e)(1), our interpretation is nonetheless completely consistent with the expressed intent of Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Thus, we find no support for Wagner\u2019s assertions that this court has jurisdiction over his petition for review or that transfer is appropriate. Notwithstanding our conclusion that this court lacks jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>over Wagner\u2019s petition for review, the imposition of sanctions is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u2022(1) The motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">(2) TVA\u2019s motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">(3) Wagner\u2019s alternative motion to transfer is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
