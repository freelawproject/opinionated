Brasch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>her husband, filed a complaint against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) for the -wrongful death of her husband. Mr. Brasch, a United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) employee with a history of heart disease, suffered cardiac arrest on the post office premises shortly before he was scheduled to begin work. Although a USPS nurse administered oxygen and CPR to Mr. Brasch until an ambulance arrived, her efforts to revive him were unsuccessful and, appellant asserts, negligent in large part because she did not timely call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Before initiating this action, appellant pursued her administrative remedies under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 <em>et seq. </em>Her FECA claim was denied because she failed to establish a causal connection between her husband\u2019s death and the medical services rendered by the USPS. App. at 28-31, <em>Jacqueline Brasch, </em>No. 00-743, slip op. at 1 (E.C.A.B. Feb. 8, 2001). The Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d) evaluated appellant\u2019s claim under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102(a) and FECA Program Memoranda Nos. 42 and 186. The issue presented in this appeal is whether Program Memorandum No. 42, as supplemented by Program Memorandum No. 186, is a \u201clegislative\u201d rule subject to the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) which, concededly, were not met. We hold that the rule is merely interpretive and, therefore, exempt from those requirements and appellant may not bring an action under the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The FECA entitles a federal employee to compensation for disability or death \u201cre-suiting from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his [or her] duty.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102(a). An employee is also entitled to medical services following an injury sustained \u201cin the performance of duty.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8103. The statute does not identify, however, what activities constitute \u201cin the performance of duty.\u201d In Program Memorandum No. 42, the OWCP\u2019s Division of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation explained that an employee who avails him or herself of an employer\u2019s medical services is \u201cconsidered in the performance of duty on those occasions when such participation causes him [or her] to be absent from his [or her] regular duties\u201d and that the deleterious effects of such services are compensable. This memorandum was supplemented by Program Memorandum No. 186, which emphasized that the FECA applies \u201cto any deleterious result of medical services furnished by the employing agency for non-work related illnesses or injuries,\u201d whether from an \u201cact of commission\u201d or \u201comission.\u201d As noted above, the public was not given notice of or an opportunity to comment on either memorandum before it was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Appellant argues that this lack of notice and opportunity to comment renders the rule embodied in the program memoranda invalid under the APA. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, a federal agency must provide thirty days\u2019 notice and an opportunity for public comment before it may enact a rule. Exempt from this requirement are interpretive rules. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b). Appellant\u2019s argument, therefore, hinges on whether the rule extending FECA coverage to non-work related illnesses and injuries is \u201clegislative\u201d or \u201cinterpretive.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>An administrative rule is deemed \u201cinterpretive\u201d if it \u201cis based on specific statutory provisions, and its validity stands or falls on the correctness of the agency\u2019s interpretation of those provisions.\u201d <em>Dia Navigation Co., Ltd. v. Pomeroy, </em>34 F.3d 1255, 1264 (3d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United Technologies Corp. v. EPA, </em>821 F.2d 714, 719-20 (D.C.Cir.1987)). Interpretive rules seek to construe or clarify the statutes and regulations to which they relate. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, a rule is \u201clegislative\u201d if it is intended to \u201chave the force effect of law\u201d and is promulgated by an agency to implement a statutory mandate. <em>FLRA v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>966 F.2d 747, 762 n. 14 (3d Cir.1992) (citations omitted). \u201cIf a rule creates rights, assigns duties, or imposes obligations, the basic tenor of which is not already outlined in the law itself, then it is substantive [i.e., legislative].\u201d <em>Dia Navige Co., Ltd., </em>34 F.3d at 1264 (quoting <em>La Casa Del Convaleciente v. Sullivan, </em>965 F.2d 1175, 1178 (1st Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Here, the rule announced in Program Memoranda Nos. 42 and 186 merely interprets the language \u201cin the performance of duty\u201d contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8102 and 8103. It has no significance independent of the specific statutory sections it seeks to clarify. There is no indication that the OWCP or its FECA Division intended the program memoranda to have binding legal effect or to create obligations and rights not already outlined in the FECA. Similarly, it does not appear that the rule\u2019s function is to implement a general statutory mandate. In short, Program Memoranda Nos. 42 and 186 reflect nothing more than the OWCP\u2019s current understanding of the phrase \u201cin the performance of duty.\u201d As such, they create an interpretive rule that is exempt from the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the October 29, 2001 Order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">. Appellant maintains that the rule extending FECA coverage to non-work related illnesses and injuries is \"legislative\u201d and cites in support of her position <em>American Mining Congress v. Mine Safety &amp; Health Admin., </em>995 F.2d 1106 (D.C.Cir.1993). Appellant\u2019s reliance is .misplaced. In <em>American Mining Congress, </em>the agency enacted a regulation requiring mine operators to report certain oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>cupational illnesses within ten days of being \"diagnosed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1107. Subsequently, the agency issued several program policy letters explaining that certain X-ray results qualified as \"diagnoses\u201d within the regulation\u2019s purview. <em>Id. </em>at 1108. The D.C. Circuit held that the program policy letters were interpretive and not subject to the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 1112. The facts presented here are very similar.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
