(\u201cM&amp;Z\u201d) appeals a judgment in favor of defendants Cargolift Ltd., Hecny Group and Hecny Transportation Inc. (collectively \u201cCargolift\u201d) on M&amp;Z\u2019s claim that Cargolift was liable for the loss of M&amp;Z\u2019s cargo. Cargolift entered into a contract with M&amp;Z to ship M&amp;Z\u2019s cargo, consisting of two containers of ginseng ethyl alcohol composition. The Latvian authorities seized the cargo as contraband, while it was en route to Russia.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-26\">The district court made findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(c) that Cargolift successfully established lack of liability for the loss of M&amp;Z\u2019s cargo under the \u201cRestraint of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Princes\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defense provided for in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (\u201cCOGSA\u201d), 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(g). As the parties are otherwise familiar with the facts, we need not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">We review findings of fact of a trial court, sitting in admiralty, for clear error. <em>Evanow v. M/V Neptune, </em>163 F.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Mateo v. M/S KISO, </em>41 F.3d 1283, 1287 (9th Cir.1994). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">I. Translations of Foreign Documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">We reject M&amp;Z\u2019s argument that the district court improperly excluded the translated documents in Exhibits 1 and 46.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Security Farms v. Int\u2019l Brotherhood of Teamsters, et al., </em>124 F.3d 999, 1011 (9th Cir.1997). Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence requires all evidence to be authenticated prior to admission. Fed. R. Ev. 901. Without providing any affidavits or testimony regarding the competency of the translators for the translations it submitted, M&amp;Z failed to satisfy the accuracy and reliability requirements of Rule 901. Therefore, while it may be true that the district court mistakenly based its decision to exclude the translated documents on a non-existent local rule, the authentication still failed under Rule 901. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">II Surrender of COGSA Immunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-17\">The district court found that Cargolift was not liable because it had established the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense, which allows a carrier to escape liability where loss of cargo is due to seizure by a foreign government. 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(g). M&amp;Z argues that the district court erred in its application of the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense due to the fact that Cargolift expressly agreed to be \u201cresponsible\u201d for getting the ginseng composition through Latvian customs and, thus, could not seek immunity under that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-18\">Because the March 26th Agreement is silent on the issue, M&amp;Z proffered evidence of prior drafts of the parties\u2019 agreement and oral agreements to prove that Cargolift agreed to shoulder this responsibility. The district court barred this evidence under the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">We do not decide whether this evidence was admissible. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume that it was.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-20\">When we do, we are faced with a situation in which the terms of an alleged oral agreement directly conflict with a defense that COGSA provides. On the one hand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>M&amp;Z submits that Cargolift orally agreed to be \u201cresponsible for Latvian customs,\u201d meaning that it agreed to be responsible for ensuring the goods were successfully transported through Latvian customs. On the other, COGSA\u2019s \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense exempts Cargolift from liability where loss of cargo is due to the seizure by a foreign sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">It is undisputed that COGSA applies to this dispute. COGSA instructs us as to how to determine which of these terms controls. COGSA section 1305 (\u201cSection 1305\u201d) states in relevant part, \u201c[a] carrier shall be at liberty to surrender in whole or in part all or any of his rights and immunities or to increase any of his responsibilities and liabilities under [COGSA], provided such surrender or increase shall be embodied in the bill of lading issued to the shipper.\u201d 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1305. To ascertain whether Cargolift surrendered a right or, in this case, an immunity, in compliance with Section 1305, we must decide if there was a \u201csurrender\u201d embodied in the bill of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">If we literally apply the provision, we quickly conclude that the bill of lading does not satisfy Section 1305. It contains no language indicating that Cargolift either surrendered the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense or agreed to increase its liability regarding government seizure of goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Because the bill of lading merely supplemented the March 26th Agreement, we also look at the March 26th Agreement, which must be considered incorporated into the bill of lading (or vice versa). That document, however, does not reveal anything resembling a surrender of the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense or any intent to increase liability regarding Latvian customs. In fact, the March 26th Agreement does not mention Latvian customs at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Even when we consider the excluded parol evidence, we remain unconvinced that Cargolift elected to surrender the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense. Assuming that Cargolift orally agreed to be \u201cresponsible for Latvian customs,\u201d we conclude that such an agreement did not expressly assume liability for a risk from which the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense would otherwise have shielded Cargolift. Because neither the contract, the prior drafts, nor the oral agreement contain language that satisfies the requirements of Section 1305, Cargolift did not surrender the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">III. \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d Defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Since the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d remained available for Cargolift to assert, we turn to whether the district court\u2019s application of this defense was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">A carrier can establish immunity under the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense if it shows that seizure by a foreign sovereign was the proximate cause of the loss to the cargo. <em>See Sedco, Inc. v. S.S. Strathewe, </em>800 F.2d 27, 33 (2d Cir.1986). A shipper may rebut this burden by proving that the carrier\u2019s negligence led to the loss. <em>See Lekas &amp; Drivas, Inc., v. Goulandris, </em>306 F.2d 426, 430 (2d Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>We see no error in the district court\u2019s finding that Cargolift successfully established its right to immunity under the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d defense. Cargolift presented evidence that the Latvian officials seized the goods because they were \u201ccontraband.\u201d It was up to M&amp;Z to rebut this evidence and show that Cargolift caused the seizure. The district court\u2019s conclusion that M&amp;Z failed to meet its ultimate burden that Cargolift\u2019s negligence was a concurrent cause of the loss was supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The only evidence M&amp;Z provided to explain why the seizure occurred was a letter from the Latvian authorities in response to Cargolift\u2019s protestations of the seizure. The letter stated that the goods were seized based on the fact that the goods were declared \u201cwith counterfeit title.\u201d It also stated Cargolift labeled the goods with the code 3004 90 990. M&amp;Z believes the use of the code 3004 90 990 instead of the code 3507 90 000 code, which it asserts is the correct code for the ginseng composition, is what caused the title to be \u201ccounterfeit\u201d and, in turn, what led to the seizure. But, it is not clear that this is the case. The letter stated that the code should have been 2207 10 000, the code for ethyl alcohol. We do not know whether the customs authorities seized the goods for testing because the code 3004 90 990 was used, rather than the code 3507 90 000; or, whether it was because the code for ethyl alcohol, 2207 10 000, was not used.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">With the little evidence presented as to what happened in Latvia, we find no fault with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the seizure was due to the official acts of the Latvian customs agents, rather than the claimed negligence of Cargolift. M&amp;Z failed to prove otherwise. Therefore, there was no error in the district court\u2019s finding that the \u201cRestraint of Princes\u201d doctrine shielded Cargolift from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b164-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. COGSA prescribes several defenses exonerating carriers from liability. The \"Restraint of Princes,\u201d is one of these statutory defenses enumerated in \u00a7 1304(2). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">(2) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damages arising or resulting from</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">(g) Arrest or restraint of princes, rulers, or people, or seizure under legal process. 46 App.U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(g).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">. We do not address M&amp;Z\u2019s challenge to Exhibit 2 on this basis, as the district court excluded that exhibit under the hearsay rule and not because of improper authentication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b165-22\">. M&amp;Z challenges the district court\u2019s ruling to exclude evidence of prior drafts of the parties\u2019 agreement and testimony regarding oral agreements about responsibility for Latvian customs under the parol evidence rule. Regardless of whether we consider the parol evidence, we find the \"Restraint of Princes\u201d immunizes Cargolift. Therefore, we need not decide whether the district court\u2019s decision to exclude the evidence was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. We also reject M&amp;Z\u2019s argument that because the March 26th Agreement stated that Cargolift was to be responsible for the goods \"door to door,\u201d it somehow satisfied the surrender requirement of Section 1305. The term \"door to door\u201d is used to describe the role of freight forwarders, like Cargolift, which arrange for transportation of cargo when the journey requires different modes of transportation, usually by land and sea. <em>See, e.g., Transway Corp. v. Hawaiian Exp. Serv., Inc., </em>679 F.2d 1328, 1329 n. 1 (9th Cir.l982)(explaining that freight forwarders provide \"door to door\u201d service and assume responsibility for transportation from pick up to delivery). It does not supplant COGSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b167-11\">FERNANDEZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">First, while it is, no doubt, true that documents must be authenticated and must be reliably translated, there was little opportunity to satisfy the district court\u2019s arbitrary demands in that regard. The district court sprung a wholly fictitious requirement on M&amp;Z in the midst of trial on November 8, 2000, and then granted judgment against M&amp;Z on a motion for directed verdict under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c) at a 9:25 a.m. hearing the next morning. I do not think that the absence of the documents makes much difference or that their presence would have affected the district court\u2019s decision, but I am convinced that the district court did err in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">Second, I agree that the restraint-of-princes defense is generally available, and would have been available here if not given up by Cargolift. But, the parol evidence, which to my mind was admissible,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did tend to show that Cargolift agreed to assume all responsibility for getting the goods through Latvia safely. Despite M&amp;Z\u2019s misgivings, Cargolift insisted that it could safely negotiate the Latvian system.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">Then Cargolift commenced attempts to escape from its assurances, but M&amp;Z rejected Cargolift\u2019s bait and switch tactics, or thought it had. Initially, Cargolift tried a provision that M&amp;Z would be responsible for all customs; that was rejected. Then, Cargolift tried a provision that M&amp;Z would be responsible for any delay by \u201cLatvian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>or Russian\u201d customs, and that Cargolift would not be responsible for \u201clocal customs or customs documentation;\u201d that, too, was rejected. Next Cargolift tried a provision that any delay caused by local or transit customs was M&amp;Z\u2019s problem and, again, that Cargolift would not be responsible for \u201clocal customs or customs documentation;\u201d that was treated by M&amp;Z with the same disdain it had shown before. Finally, Cargolift apparently capitulated and dropped all reference to Latvia, but declared that it did not have responsibility with respect to Russian customs or customs documentation, and delay by Russian customs was M&amp;Z\u2019s responsibility; that proposal was accepted by M&amp;Z. I have no difficulty in reading that course of conduct to mean precisely what M&amp;Z says it means, but Cargolift did not accomplish what it promised.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">As a result, no matter how boldly Cargolift\u2019s case can be painted in theory, the true facts etiolate it, and in the real commercial world a real injustice has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. <em>See, e.g., Trident Ctr. v.
