Brown pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of a mixture containing methamphetamine, within 1,000 feet of a public school, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 860. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment and 10 years\u2019 supervised release. On appeal, Brown\u2019s attorney has filed a brief and has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Brown has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Specifically, we reject Brown\u2019s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction, <em>see United States v. Peck, </em>161 F.3d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir.1998), and his pro se claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995). To the extent Brown is also arguing that he is entitled to reversal because his indictment is somehow defective, that argument fails as well. Finally, we note that Brown alludes to allegedly false information in his presentence report, but he does not specify the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Further, we have found no nonfrivolous issues for appeal upon our independent review pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Brown\u2019s motion for a stay of the mandate. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-9\">. The Honorable Richard G.
