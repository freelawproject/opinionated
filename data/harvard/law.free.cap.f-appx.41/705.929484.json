On appeal, Womack contends the district court abused its discretion by increasing by four levels his offense level for being a manager or organizer in the conspiracy. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.1(a) (2000). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The district court\u2019s finding that Womack acted as an organizer or manager is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). Due deference is given to the court\u2019s assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>977 F.2d 866, 870 (4th Cir.1992). In addition, the court is free to adopt the factual findings contained in the PSR without more explanation. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). At sentencing, the court is permitted to consider hearsay testimony and other evidence that has a sufficient indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1021 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">We reject Womack\u2019s argument that the district court abused its discretion by not crediting his testimony and being more receptive to information provided by a co-conspirator. We find the court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous. There was sufficient evidence showing that Womack was more than merely a buyer and seller of LSD. <em>See United States v. Sayles, </em>296 F.3d 219, 225 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Accordingly,- we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
