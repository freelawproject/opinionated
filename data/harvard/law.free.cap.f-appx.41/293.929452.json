This panel originally affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling as to some of Florez\u2019s claims<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and instructed the respondents-appellees (\u201cthe State\u201d) to submit an answer brief as to the remaining issues. <em>Florez v. Williams, </em>No. 01-2172 (10th Cir. Oct. 22, 2001) (unpublished). Following that order, the remaining issues involved whether Florez\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a voluntary intoxication instruction and for failing to request lesser-included offense instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an opinion filed February 26, 2002, we concluded that Florez\u2019s ineffective assistance claims had merit and accordingly reversed the district court\u2019s denial of relief. Central to our holding was our conclusion that the state courts had not decided whether Florez would have been entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction had his counsel requested one. (Slip op. at 8-11.) Examining the issue de novo, we concluded that Florez would have been entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction and that his counsel\u2019s failure to request one amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel meriting relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The facts of this case are summarized in that opinion, with which we presume familiarity</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Now before the court is the State\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc. The State argues, inter alia, that we erred in concluding that the state court had not decided whether Florez would have been entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction. Upon further consideration, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Language in the New Mexico Court of Appeals decision on direct appeal amounted to a conclusion that Florez was not entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction. State <em>v. Florez, </em>No. 20,007, slip op. at 3 (N.M.Ct.App. Apr. 14, 2000) (\u201cIn this case, the evidence of intoxication .... did not establish that Defendant was too intox<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>icated to form specific intent, and, indeed, Defendant himself testified that, although he was buzzed, he knew what he was doing.\u201d). Our prior opinion regarded this language as effectively nullified by the state court\u2019s statement later in the same paragraph that \u201cwe do not mean to suggest that Defendant would not have been entitled to lesser included offense instructions had his counsel requested them. We do not decide the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. However, in our previous opinion we erroneously conflated the argument pertaining to a voluntary intoxication instruction with the argument pertaining to lesser included offense instructions predicated on the diminished capacity resulting from the intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">As a habeas court, of course, we are bound by state court rulings of state law. Because, as we now recognize, the New Mexico courts ruled that Florez was not entitled under New Mexico law to a voluntary intoxication instruction, it follows that counsel was not ineffective for failing to request one. <em>E.g., Boyd v. Ward, </em>179 F.3d 904, 917 (10th Cir.1999). The district court was correct to reject Florez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim based upon counsel\u2019s failure to request a voluntary intoxication instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The question then remains whether counsel was ineffective for failing to request lesser included offense instructions. We now answer this question in the negative. Given that Florez was not entitled to a voluntary intoxication instruction, and given the absence of other promising defenses, counsel\u2019s decision to pursue a defense that the elderly victim consented to Florez\u2019s sexual advances was not constitutionally unreasonable. Florez\u2019s consent defense held out the hope of a complete acquittal, a hope that would have been undermined by presenting the jury with the alternative of conviction on lesser included offenses. Accordingly, the state court\u2019s ruling was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, federal law, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), when it concluded that counsel reasonably could have made a tactical decision to pursue a straightforward consent defense rather than seek lesser included offense instructions and risk \u201cconfusing the jury with legalistic arguments dependent on finding some elements proved, but not others, and dependent on believing some portions of witness testimony, but not others.\u201d <em>Florez, </em>No. 20,007, slip op. at 3-4. \u201cWe conclude that here the decision not to request a lesser included offense instruction falls within the wide range of reasonable professional representation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>843 F.2d 408, 413 (10th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">This panel\u2019s prior opinion, filed February 26, 2002, is hereby withdrawn. The district court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. By our order of October 22, 2001, we denied a certificate of appealability as <em>to each </em>of the following issues raised by Florez in his appeal: an ineffective assistance of counsel claim stemming from counsel\u2019s failure to remove a juror, a due process claim flowing from errors in the jury instructions and in the trial judge's response to a jury question, a double jeopardy claim flowing from his conviction for both second-degree criminal sexual penetration and aggravated burglary, and a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the aggravated burglary. By the same order, we granted a certificate of appealability for, but did not resolve, the remaining issues raised on appeal: whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request jury instructions on intoxication, third-degree criminal sexual penetration, and criminal trespass. Our February 26, 2002 opinion reversed the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief as to these issues. The present order involves a reexamination only of our February 26 opinion, not our October 22 order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\">. Florez was convicted in New Mexico state court of second-degree criminal sexual penetration and aggravated burglary. The lesser included offenses at issue are third degree criminal sexual penetration and criminal trespass.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
