For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for further proceedings. The district court, acting sua sponte, determined from the face of Bell\u2019s petition that his claims were barred by the one-year limitations period set forth in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2244(d) (West Supp.2001), and dismissed the action without giving Bell notice or an opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> At the time it issued its decision, the district court did not have the benefit of our recent opinion in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002). <em>Hill v. Braxton </em>now requires the district court to provide such a warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cunless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Because it is not \u201cindisputably clear\u201d that Bell cannot salvage his petition, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court to provide Hawkins with the notice and opportunity to respond to which he is now entitled pursuant to <em>Hill. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b649-19\"> Bell correctly observes that the district court\u2019s calculation of the toll-ing period did not account for this Court's holdings in <em>Spencer v. Sutton, </em>239 F.3d 626, 629 (4th Cir.2001), and <em>Hernandez v. Caldwell, </em>225 F.3d 435, 438 (4th Cir.2000). Thus, on remand, the district court should allow Bell the benefit of tolling during the entire pendency of his state collateral proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
