Giordano appeals from an Order issued by the District Court for the District of Connecticut (Nevas, J.), dated November 14, 2001, denying appellant\u2019s second motion for bail and authorizing Giordano\u2019s pre-trial detention under the provisions of the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. The District Court found that the Government had met its burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that no combination of conditions would reasonably guard against flight or the danger to the community posed by Giordano\u2019s release on bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-18\">Findings of fact relied upon by a district court in determining pre-trial detention will not be disturbed absent a showing of \u201cclear error\u201d. <em>U.S. v. Ferranti, </em>66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Shakur, </em>817 F.2d 189, 196 (2d Cir.1987). Giordano has provided no adequate basis for disturbing the district court\u2019s findings of fact. The court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous based on the evidence proffered, nor did the court \u201cevinee[ ] a misunderstanding of the legal significance of [any] historical fact\u201d that would require the application of a more stringent standard of review. <em>Shakur, </em>817 F.2d at 197. The District Court\u2019s decision was based upon a straightforward application of the requisite factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(g), and we will not second-guess its considered judgment under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">The District Court\u2019s erroneous application of the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>does not compel a different conclusion. The Government concedes that the presumption does not apply in this case; however, Giordano failed to object below or to raise this issue on appeal, and the issue is reviewed (if at all) for plain error. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>263 F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir.2001). There was no plain error here, because <em>(inter alia) </em>the decision to deny bail would have been no different even if the Court had not applied the presumption. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Nevas\u2019 sealed opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
