The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied the motion, Bland pleaded guilty, and the district court sentenced him to 210 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On appeal, Bland\u2019s counsel filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court improperly denied the motion to suppress. .Bland has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">An appeal of the denied motion to suppress is foreclosed by Bland\u2019s unconditional guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>12 F.3d 836, 839 (8th Cir.1994). Also, having independently reviewed the record, we find no nonfrivolous issues. <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Accordingly, we affirm the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-11\"> The Honorable David S.
