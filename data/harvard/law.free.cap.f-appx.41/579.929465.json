Defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, asserting that Frazier\u2019s appeal raises no nonfrivolous issues. We will grant defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw, and affirm the judgment and sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Frazier pled guilty to a one-count information charging him with conspiring to distribute and possess, with intent to distribute, more than five kilograms of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. The plea agreement explicitly stated Frazier would plead guilty to a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 as charged and that it \u201ccarrie[d] a statutory minimum of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d The District Court conducted a plea hearing in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, and accepted Frazier\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-23\">On July 9, 2001, the District Court held a sentencing hearing. Neither Frazier nor the government objected to the Pre-Sentence Report. Under the guidelines, Frazier\u2019s offense level was 31 with a criminal history category of III, exposing him to a guideline range of 135 to 168 months\u2019 incarceration. Although Frazier entered a non-cooperating plea agreement, he subsequently cooperated with the government and, in return, the government moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based upon Frazier\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-24\">The government asked the District Court to depart downward fifteen months to the mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 but made clear that it was not requesting or authorizing \u201cthe court under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(E) to impose a sentence ... below the level established by the statute as the minimum mandatory sentence.\u201d The District Court granted the downward departure and sentenced Frazier to 120 months\u2019 incarceration, the lowest possible sentence under the statute. Frazier appeals, claiming his attorney promised him that he would receive only five to six years after cooperating with the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\u201cIn <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court established guidelines for a lawyer seeking to withdraw from a case when the indigent criminal defendant he represents wishes to pursue frivolous arguments on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 299 (3d Cir.2001). The Supreme Court directed that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be whohy frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744. The Court further instructed that defense counsel\u2019s request \u201cmust ... be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When counsel submits an <em>Anders </em>brief, our inquiry is \u201ctwofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the rule\u2019s requirements; and (2) whether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 300 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We have stated that when preparing an <em>Anders </em>brief, the duties of defense counsel are \u201c(1) to satisfy the court that counsel has thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues, and (2) to explain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel\u2019s brief focuses on the Rule 11 plea hearing and the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to depart downward from the applicable guideline range to the mandatory minimum sentence. As noted, in his <em>pro se </em>brief, Frazier contends the District Court erred because it only departed downward 15 months instead of departing below the mandatory statutory minimum of 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Defense counsel\u2019s brief demonstrates counsel thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues and explained why the issues are frivolous. The plea colloquy complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. The court established that Frazier understood his constitutional rights and the nature of the criminal charges. Upon review, it is clear that Frazier entered a knowing and voluntary guilty plea to a charge that carries a mandatory statutory minimum of 10 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no question about Frazier\u2019s competence or comprehension. The District Court questioned Frazier on all required and relevant issues related to his role in the offense, as well as his understanding of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">The sentencing proceedings also met the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 32. As noted, the government filed a motion for downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on Frazier\u2019s substantial assistance. In response, Frazier\u2019s counsel at sentencing requested a further downward departure below the minimum mandatory sentence. The District Court denied this request, correctly concluding it did not have the authority to depart downward \u201cbelow a level established by statute as a minimum sentence so as to reflect a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>dant\u2019s substantial assistance\u201d absent a motion by the government. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>see also Melendez v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 120, 125-26, 116 S.Ct. 2057, 135 L.Ed.2d 427 (1996) (\u201cWe believe that \u00a7 3553(e) requires a Government motion requesting or authorizing the district court to impose a sentence below a level established by statute as minimum sentence before the court may impose such a sentence.\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Accordingly, there are no nonfrivolous arguments raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will grant defense counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and affirm the judgment and sentence of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-18\">. <em>Anders v.

Even if Frazier\u2019s attorney made such a promise, it could not invalidate his guilty plea. At the time Frazier entered his plea, there was no agreement with the government to file a motion based upon his cooperation. To the extent Frazier is claiming that his trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>counsel was ineffective for advising him that he would receive a sentence below the mandatory minimum, he may not raise this claim on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Haywood, </em>155 F.3d 674, 678 (3d Cir.1998)(generally claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not entertained on direct appeal: \"We have repeatedly held that the proper avenue for pursuing such claims is through a collateral proceeding in which the factual basis for the claim may be developed.\u201d (quotations and citations omitted)).fn</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b602-10\">. The District Court made certain Frazier understood the applicable mandatory statutory minimum sentence, addressing him: \"Do you understand that a violation of Title 21, United States Code, 846 charged in the information carries with it a statutory minimum penalty of ten years imprisonment and a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as well as a four million dollar fine?\u201d Frazier answered \"yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
