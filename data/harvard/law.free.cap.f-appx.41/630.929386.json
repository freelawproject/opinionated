Because Allen\u2019s three prior felony convictions constituted violent felonies under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (West 2000) (\u201cACCA\u201d), the district court imposed a mandatory minimum 180 month sentence. Allen appealed his sentence, arguing imposition of the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence violated due process. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">This Court reviews de novo the legal determinations attendant to the application of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 188 (4th Cir.2001). Once it is determined that a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify him for sentencing under the ACCA, the sentencing court may only depart below the fifteen-year mandatory minimum if the Government moves for such a departure based on the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance or if the defendant qualifies for application of the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision. <em>See United States v. Pillow, </em>191 F.3d 403, 407-08 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Wade, </em>936 F.2d 169, 171 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-17\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines provide sentencing ranges predicated on the gravity of a defendant\u2019s offense and his criminal history, when that calculus yields a sentencing range below the mandatory minimum for an offense, the guidelines sentence becomes that statutory minimum. <em>See United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(b) (2000). Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>\u00a7 924(e)(1), a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentence \u201cshall\u201d apply to all defendants convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) who have previously committed three or more qualifying violent felonies. Because Allen had three such convictions, the mandatory minimum sentence was properly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Allen\u2019s contention that there is a an arbitrary disparity between his sentence under the ACCA and what it would otherwise be under the Sentencing Guidelines is specious. First, Allen is ineligible for a lesser sentence under the guidelines by operation of \u00a7 5G1.1(b) and \u00a7 924(e)(1). Second, Allen\u2019s prior convictions were qualifying violent felonies under \u00a7 924(e)(1), indicating he is not similarly situated to every other defendant with three prior felony convictions. Because Allen\u2019s criminal history required a fifteen-year sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, we find Allen\u2019s challenge to his sentence unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Accordingly, Allen\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We deny Allen\u2019s motion to appoint new appellate counsel or to file a pro se supplemental brief.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b654-8\"> In so doing, we note Allen\u2019s appellate counsel did not file a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and that Allen's justification for filing a pro se supplemental brief is unpersuasive, <em>see United States v. Samuels, </em>970 F.2d 1312, 1315 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
