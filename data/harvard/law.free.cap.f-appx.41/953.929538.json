Bertelsman, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b976-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Cedric Saulsberry appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, after a three-day bench trial, in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action alleging that his Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights were violated while he was in the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriffs Office. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to modify the pretrial order to permit Saulsberry to raise an Eighth Amendment claim. Saulsberry\u2019s trial counsel waived that claim at the pretrial conference, and there was no \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d in precluding Saulsberry from re-raising that claim because allowing him to raise it would have prejudiced the defendants and disrupted the orderly and efficient conduct of the case. <em>See Byrd v. Guess, </em>137 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.1998). Saulsberry\u2019s claim that the defendants would not have been prejudiced because the factual proof would have been the same is unavailing; an Eighth Amendment claim requires an inquiry into the prison officials\u2019 state of mind, <em>see Jordan v. Gardner, </em>986 F.2d 1521, 1525, 1527 (9th Cir.1993) (en banc), while a Fourth Amendment claim does not. <em>See Mendoza v. Block, </em>27 F.3d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">Nor did the district court err in determining that the officers had not violated Saulsberry\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The district court found that Dr. Mishra ordered the catheterization and drug screen solely for medical purposes and not for any administrative or investigative purposes. This finding is not clearly erroneous, and there was therefore no \u201csearch or seizure\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Attson, </em>900 F.2d 1427, 1431 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-15\">Because there was no Fourth Amendment violation, we need <em>not </em>decide whether the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b976-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
