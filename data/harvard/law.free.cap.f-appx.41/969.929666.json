The permanent rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 apply, <em>see Castro-Espinosa v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1130, 1131 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001) (order), and we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>tion, <em>see Flores-Miramontes v. INS, 212 </em>F.3d 1133, 1135 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Mora-Zamora is removable and statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal because he has been convicted of two aggravated felonies, as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3). MoraZamora\u2019s contention that his prior convictions for harassment and domestic violence do not constitute aggravated felonies is without merit. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (aggravated felony defined as crime <em>of </em>violence for which one year of imprisonment is imposed). MoraZamora\u2019s contention that because a portion of each of his sentences was suspended, he was not sentenced to one year of imprisonment, is similarly without merit. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) (term of imprisonment refers to the period of incarceration imposed by court regardless of a partial or total suspension thereof).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Because Mora-Zamora was convicted of two enumerated offenses pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Flores-Miramontes, 212 </em>F.3d at 1135 (final order of removal); <em>Cruz-Aguilera v. INS, </em>245 F.3d 1070, 1073 (9th Cir.2001) (order) (denial of cancellation of removal). We also lack jurisdiction to review MoraZamora\u2019s constitutional challenge. <em>See Matsuk v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 999, 1002 n. 12 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b991-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
