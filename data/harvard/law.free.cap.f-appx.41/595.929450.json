Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 72-73, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), that \u201cthe 11th Amendment restricts the judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.\u201d In <em>In Re: Sacred Heart Hospital of Norristown, </em>133 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.1998), we observed that \u201csince Seminole Tribe, Section 5 of the 14th Amendment has been the sole basis for Congress to abrogate the States\u2019 immunity under the 11th Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242 (quoting <em>College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, </em>131 F.3d 353, 358 (3d Cir.1997)). We held in <em>Sacred Heart </em>that the bankruptcy clause is not a valid source of abrogation power. <em>Sacred Heart, </em>133 F.3d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In this case, Vegliante asks us to allow him to pursue an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy against the State of New Jersey. The adversary proceeding at issue is plainly a suit within the meaning of the 11th Amendment. <em>Missouri v. Fiske, </em>290 U.S. 18, 26, 54 S.Ct. 18, 78 L.Ed. 145 (1933) (quoting <em>Cuhens v. Virginia, </em>6 Wheat. 264, 19 U.S. 264, 5 L.Ed. 257 (1821)). The State of New Jersey received a summons requiring it to appear in court or face a default judgment against it. That qualifies as a suit. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Vegliante seeks to prosecute a suit against the State of New Jersey without its consent. We cannot oblige that request in light of <em>Sacred Heart\u2019s </em>ruling on state sovereign immunity. Therefore, the District Court\u2019s order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
