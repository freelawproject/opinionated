Specifically, Tate argues that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Court erred by refusing to make a downward departure to his sentence. We will dismiss Tate\u2019s appeal in part and otherwise affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">On June 12, 2001, Tate pled guilty to one of two counts of distributing five or more grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii). For sentencing purposes, the District Court considered Tate a \u201ccareer offender\u201d because he had two prior felony convictions, including one \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and one \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (2001) (hereinafter \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d). In accordance with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the District Court sentenced Tate to a more lengthy sentence than it would have had Tate not been considered a career offender.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">As suggested above, however, Tate does not challenge the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he qualifies as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Rather, he makes two arguments that the District Court erred in declining to depart downward from the sentence prescribed by the career offender provision. First, Tate invites us to review anew the merits of his plea for a downward departure, arguing that the predicate offenses on which his career offender status is based overstate his criminal history and likelihood of recidivism. Tate\u2019s second argument concerns a police report written in connection with his 1994 aggravated assault conviction \u2014 one of the two predicate felony convictions on which his career offender status is based. In this second argument, Tate contends that the District Court erred by considering an unproven allegation made in the report that Tate possessed drugs at the time of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">We must dismiss Tate\u2019s first argument for want of appellate jurisdiction. \u2018We lack jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downward when the district court, knowing it may do so, nonetheless determines that departure is not warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. McQuilkin, </em>97 F.3d 723, 729 (3d Cir.1996). The transcript of Tate\u2019s sentencing hearing makes clear that the District Court was aware of its authority to grant a downward departure. <em>See </em>Appendix at 20a. Indeed, the District Court explicitly referenced the sources of this authority. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Shoupe, </em>35 F.3d 835, 836 (3d Cir.1994) (acknowledging authority of district court to make a downward departure from \u00a7 4B1.1 guidelines where defendant\u2019s criminal offender status overstates his criminal history and likelihood of recidivism) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 (policy statement authorizing such departures)). Therefore, we cannot review anew the merits of the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">While we can address Tate\u2019s second argument since it alleges legal error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we find the argument to be without merit. The District Court properly considered the police report\u2019s allegation of drug posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>sion, notwithstanding the fact that Tate was neither charged with nor convicted of this criminal conduct. Section 4A1.3(e) of the Guidelines specifically allows the district courts to consider uncharged prior criminal conduct of a similar nature in making departure determinations. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Moreover, Tate\u2019s second objection must also fail to the extent that it challenges the admissibility of the drug possession allegation as hearsay. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations not applicable here, the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in the context of sentencing determinations. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3); <em>United States v. Dass, </em>38 Fed.Appx. 714, 2002 WL 549103, 2002 U.S.App. LEXIS 6803 (3d Cir.2002). Rather, \u201c[i]n resolving any dispute concerning a factor important to the sentencing determination, the court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). <em>See also United States v. Brothers, </em>75 F.3d 845, 848 (3d Cir.1996) (applying the same standard specifically to heai'say). Tate does not allege that the police report lacked sufficient indicia of reliability, and we find no support for such a conclusion in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss Tate\u2019s appeal in part and otherwise affirm the September 18, 2001 Judgment of the Distxict Coxxrt.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-6\">.
