Shealy, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, Charleston, South Carolina, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b665-18\">Before WILKINS and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges, and HAMILTON, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b665-19\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b665-20\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b665-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b665-22\">Jose Antonio Garcia appeals the 240-month sentence he received after pleading guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (West 1999). On appeal, Garcia argues the district court erred by declining to award him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and by adjusting his sentence for possessing a dangerous weapon. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-23\">The denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996). In all but extraordinary cases, a defendant who receives an enhancement in his, sentence for obstruction of justice is ineligible for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-24\">After Garcia pled guilty, he fled to Costa Rica and subsequently fought extradition. Garcia argues the district court stated it was precluded from awarding an adjustment under the guidelines. We have reviewed the record and are satisfied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>district court recognized its ability to award an adjustment in an appropriate case. We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Garcia also argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon under USSG \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). The determination that a weapon enhancement is warranted is a factual question subject to clear error review. <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 914 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The district court imposed the adjustment based on two weapons found in Garcia\u2019s home during a seizure of approximately 300 grams of cocaine. The proximity of a gun to illicit narcotics generally warrants the enhancement. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>128 F.3d 850, 852 (4th Cir.1997). Contrary to Garcia\u2019s arguments, <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001), is factually distinguishable because unlike in <em>McAllister, </em>the weapons found in Garcia\u2019s home were in both temporal and spatial proximity to the drugs. We find the district court did not clearly err in imposing the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We grant Garcia\u2019s motion to file a pro se supplemental brief. Garcia argues the denial of a downward departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 or \u00a7 5K2.0 violated his right to due process because the district court recognized that he provided substantial assistance and his was an extraordinary case. The Government did not move for a departure under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and Garcia does not allege the Government had an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Garcia also claims he is entitled to a three-point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, and he attempts to explain why the fire-arms were in his possession. Based on our review of the record, these claims do not warrant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">We affirm Garcia\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\"> Garcia did not challenge the district court\u2019s imposition of an adjustment for obstruction of justice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
