Hornback petitions for a writ of mandamus to direct the Court of Federal Claims to lift its stay of proceedings in certain cases pending a determination by this court in Hornback\u2019s recent related appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Hornback filed several complaints in the Court of Federal Claims. Hornback moved to stay proceedings in the related cases pending a decision by the Court of Federal Claims in case no. 99-38C. The United States did not oppose that motion and the Court of Federal Claims ordered the related cases stayed pending a decision in case no. 99-38C. Thereafter, the Court of Federal Claims issued its decision in ease no. 99-38C and Hornback appealed to this court, 02-5109. In the Court of Federal Claims, Hornback moved to lift the stay in certain of the related cases. The Court of Federal Claims denied Horn-back\u2019s motion, stating that it wished to continue the stay of proceedings pending this court\u2019s disposition of Hornback\u2019s appeal. Hornback now petitions this court to direct the Court of Federal Claims to lift the stay of proceedings in certain cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The remedy of mandamus is available only in extraordinary situations to correct a clear abuse of discretion or usurpation of judicial power. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35-36, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (holding that \u201c[w]here a matter is committed to discretion, it cannot be said that a litigant\u2019s right to a particular result is \u2018clear and indisputable.\u2019 \u201d). Hornback has not shown that the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 determination to stay certain cases pending disposition of a related appeal satisfies these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Hornback\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
