Utecht appeals the November 9, 2000, Order of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, dismissing his declaratory relief action asserting that certain products made by his licensee, Protect Medical Products, Inc. (\u201cProtect\u201d), do not infringe defendant Mary Lou Olson\u2019s U.S. Patent Nos. 4,964,188, 5,301,806, and RE 35,814 (\u201c \u2019814 patent\u201d), for lack of standing. In the same Order, the court also dismissed on the merits all other federal and state claims brought by Utecht and Protect. However, the district court\u2019s Order and entry of judgment neither addressed nor resolved the Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint filed by Olson and DT Labs/Bio-Protective Products, Inc. (\u201cDT Labs\u201d) that alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>infringement of the \u2019814 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Given the ostensible lack of either a final judgment on the counterclaim or a certification for appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), we issued an Order asking the parties to file briefs addressing \u201cwhether the absence of a final judgment resolving all claims at issue in the litigation between the parties precludes this court\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction over Utecht\u2019s appeal.\u201d Utecht did not respond, while Olson responded to our Order as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">[I]t appears, upon review of the pertinent pleadings, that the Orders entered by the District Court ... are not final Orders. In addition, we do not find any entries in the Pleadings relative to a certification by the District Judge pursuant to Rule 54(b) or the other exceptions for jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">We find no final judgment resolving the infringement counterclaim filed by Olson and DT Labs. The district court denied Utecht and Protect\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and dismissal of the counterclaim on July 16, 2000. The court\u2019s ensuing dismissal of their declaratory judgment and associated claims did not resolve the infringement counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1) (2000), this court has jurisdiction over an \u201cappeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States\u201d if that court\u2019s jurisdiction was based, in whole or in part, on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338. A final decision or order is one that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio, </em>527 U.S. 198, 204, 119 S.Ct. 1915, 144 L.Ed.2d 184 (1999) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)). By contrast, a denial of a motion for summary judgment that does not resolve all claims in the litigation is an interlocutory order, which, with few exceptions, is not subject to appellate review. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(1); <em>Gerber Garment Tech., Inc. v. Lectra Sys., Inc., </em>916 F.2d 683, 686 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\u201cThe denial of Gerber\u2019s motion for summary judgment is interlocutory, nonfinal and nonappealable.\u201d); <em>Helifix, Ltd. v. Blok-Lok, Ltd., </em>208 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed.Cir.2000). None of the exceptions to the general rule that non-final orders are not appealable, such as a certification for appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), is present in this case. Accordingly, since Olson and DT Labs\u2019 infringement counterclaim remains unresolved, we lack jurisdiction to adjudicate Utecht\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AcK\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">(1) Utecht\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">(2) Utecht\u2019s MOTION FOR GRANT OF RELIEF SOUGHT ON APPEAL is denied as moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">(3) Olson\u2019s and DT Labs/Bio-Protective Products, Inc.\u2019s MOTION FOR NOTICE OF NAME CHANGE OF THIRD PARTY DEFENDANT FROM PRO-TECT MEDICAL PRODUCTS TO PENN MEDICAL SUPPLIES, INC. is denied as moot.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
