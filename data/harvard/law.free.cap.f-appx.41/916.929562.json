At the time, Hollman was acting as guardian <em>ad litem </em>of a minor claimant in a pending CNMI probate proceeding, whose interests in the probate property would have been affected by the law\u2019s implementation. The district court granted Hollman\u2019s motion for summary judgment, striking down the law on constitutional grounds. The district court also awarded Hollman attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The CNMI appeals only from the fee award and not from the underlying judgment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">CNMI\u2019s contends that the district court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 because Hollman never stated a viable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 1988, the court may award attorney\u2019s fees to a \u201cprevailing party\u201d in a \u00a7 1983 action. Section 1983, in turn, creates liability for \u201cpersons\u201d who, while acting \u201cunder color\u201d of state or territorial law, deprive citizens or other persons of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or federal law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have held that the CNMI is not a \u201cperson,\u201d as that term is defined in \u00a7 1983. <em>See DeNieva v. Reyes, </em>966 F.2d 480, 483 (9th Cir.1992). A \u00a7 1983 action is permissible, however, against a territorial official for prospective relief. <em>See Guam Soc\u2019y of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists v. Ada, </em>962 F.2d 1366, 1371 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">Thus, the dispositive issue is whether this case is properly characterized as an action against the CNMI itself or against CNMI officials. The district court held that even though Hollman named the CNMI as the sole defendant, the action was effectively an action against CNMI officials to prevent them from enforcing Public Law No. 11-105. The CNMI contends that because Hollman named only the CNMI as a defendant, a claim under \u00a7 1983 cannot be enforced against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">We agree with the CNMI. The law is quite clear: a litigant cannot bring a \u00a7 1983 action against the CNMI. <em>DeNieva, </em>966 F.2d at 483. Although it is true that Hollman could have brought an action for prospective relief against CNMI officials, he did not do so. The fact that it might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>have been clear which CNMI officials would have been subject to a suit for prospective relief does not relieve Hollman of the requirement that he, in fact, name the proper defendants. Because Hollman failed to satisfy this requirement, the district court erred in enforcing \u00a7 1983 against the CNMI. Hollman cites no case in support of his contrary position.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The fact that Hollman might have been able to amend his pleadings does not affect this result. To begin with, contrary to the district court\u2019s suggestion, this is not a case in which an amendment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) would have been appropriate. Rule 15(b) expressly authorizes amendments of the pleadings \u201cas may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise ... issues\u201d actually presented \u201cby express or implied consent of the parties.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(b). Here, there was no new evidence revealed during the course of the litigation that would have warranted amendment. Rather, this was simply a case in which Hollman failed to plead his \u00a7 1983 cause of action in the manner dictated by well-established precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Moreover, even if Hollman could have moved to substitute parties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21, he did not do so. Correction of a defect in parties must be specifically raised, rather than simply suggested, as it was here in Hollman\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See </em>7 Charles A. Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1688, at 502-03 (2001). In addition, because prejudice to a non-moving party will defeat a Rule 21 motion, <em>see Sable Communications of Cal, Inc. v. Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>890 F.2d 184, 191 n. 13 (9th Cir.1989), it was improper for the district court to have proceeded in the fashion it did without permitting the potential CNMI official-defendants to raise any arguments regarding prejudice. Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Hollman could have moved to amend his complaint to name CNMI officials in lieu of the CNMI itself, it was error for the district court to relieve him of the obligation to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Hollman is</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">REVERSED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b939-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
