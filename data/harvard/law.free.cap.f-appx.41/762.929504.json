A1 Frazier, a Michigan prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment dismissing his civil action filed pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-34, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985(3), 1986, and 1988. This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">On October 11, 2001, Frazier filed a complaint against the state of Michigan; John Engler, governor of the state of Michigan; and the following individuals: Bill Martin, Dan Bolden, Gil Bettinger, Richard B. Stapleton, Thomas Patten, Michael J. Crowley, George M. Pennell, Dr. Oh Chung Do, Practioner P. Koskiniemi, \u201cPsych\u201d R. Marcenino, \u201cPsych\u201d Nannbery, Dr. Richard D. Shaul, Darlene Edlund, William Luetzow, Sharon Wright, Beth Smith, \u201cRUO\u201d Heally, \u201cRUO\u201d Jack Jackola, \u201cRUO\u201d Mary Peterson, and \u201cRUO\u201d Edward Anderson. The complaint did not indicate the defendants\u2019 positions or the capacities in which the defendants were sued. Although the complaint stated that such information was included in the \u201cattached notice pleadings ... and attached exhibits in support,\u201d no such documents were attached to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">Frazier\u2019s complaint, consisting of three paragraphs in its entirety, alleged in a conclusory manner that he has been subjected to a wide variety of unconstitutional conditions of confinement and deprived of his federal rights during his incarceration. The complaint also referred the court to \u201cattached notice pleadings for full detailed disclosure,\u201d however such \u201cnotice pleadings\u201d were not attached to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-13\">The district court granted Frazier\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. Despite Frazier\u2019s failure to demonstrate exhaustion of his administrative remedies, the district court subsequently dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e), 1915A, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c). Frazier\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment was denied by the district court. Frazier has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a suit for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) and 1915A(b). <em>Brown v. Bargery, </em>207 F.3d 863, 867 (6th Cir.2000). \u201cDismissal of a complaint for the failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted is appropriate only if it appeal's beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>We also review de novo a district court\u2019s judgment dismissing a prisoner\u2019s complaint under \u00a7 1997e(c). <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">A complaint must contain \u201c \u2018either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain a recovery-under <em>some </em>viable legal theory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops, Inc., </em>859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>745 F.2d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir.1984)). The court is not required to accept non-specific factual allegations and inferences or unwarranted legal conclusions. <em>See Dellis v. Corrs. Corp. of Am., </em>257 F.3d 508, 511 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Lillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., </em>76 F.3d 716, 726 (6th Cir.1996); <em>Morgan v. Church\u2019s Fried Chicken, </em>829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987); <em>Chapman v. City of Detroit, </em>808 F.2d 459, 465 (6th Cir.1986); <em>Smith v. Rose, </em>760 F.2d 102, 106 (6th Cir.1985). Furthermore, a complaint must allege that the defendants were personally involved in the alleged deprivation of federal rights. <em>Hall v. United States, </em>704 F.2d 246, 251 (6th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Upon review, we conclude that Frazier\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted and was properly dismissed by the district court. Frazier\u2019s complaint contained no specific facts in support of his conclusory allegations that the defendants violated his constitutional and statutory rights. Moreover, Frazier failed to allege with any degree of specificity which of the named defendants were personally involved in or responsible for each of the alleged violations of his federal rights. Thus, even under the most liberal construction, Frazier\u2019s complaint did not state a claim for relief. The arguments asserted by Frazier in his appellate brief do not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
