We affirm for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Elfvin\u2019s opinion. <em>New York, et al. v. Panex Indus., Inc., et al., </em>94-CV-0400E(F), 2001 WL 241791 (W.D.N.Y. Mar.8, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-21\">Appellants rely here (as with the district court) on the less-than-optimal phrasings of the contract. But they offer no competing, integrated reading that favors their position. In any event, appellants as indemnitees had the burden to show that there was \u201ca \u2018clear and unmistakable intent\u2019 to indemnify.\u201d <em>Commander Oil Corp. v. Advance Food Serv. Equip., </em>991 F.2d 49, 51 (2d Cir.1993). Quibbles, grammatical imperfections, convoluted statements, and near ambiguities are not enough.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
