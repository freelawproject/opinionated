Clifford Wallace, Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b587-20\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b587-21\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">Because the parties are familiar with the background of this appeal, it will not be set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-23\">Adolfo Villegas challenges the 96-month sentence imposed on him after he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. At sentencing, the government moved for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 based on his substantial assistance in the investigation of his co-conspirators. After a hearing, the District Court granted the government\u2019s motion and departed downward one year from the applicable sentence range.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The sole issue presented for review is whether the District Court sufficiently considered the five sentencing factors listed in U.S.S.G. 5K1.1 prior to sentencing the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Section 5K1.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">Upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, the court may depart from the guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-6\">(a) The appropriate reduction shall be determined by the court for real stated that may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information in testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">A panel of our Court has held that a sentencing judge, when presented with a motion for downward departure, \u201cmust, at the very minimum, indicate his or her consideration of \u00a7 5Kl.l\u2019s five factors in determining whether and to what extent to grant a sentencing reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138, 147 (3d Cir.2001). The record here shows that the District Court considered the \u201cfactors that appear in the Torres case.\u201d A78. The extent of a downward departure is a matter of discretion vested solely in the District Court, and we do not have appellate jurisdiction over the extent of an District Court\u2019s exercise of this discretion. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 151-52; <em>United States v. Casiano, </em>113 F.3d 420, 429 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
