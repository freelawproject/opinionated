This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Arispe and two codefendants were named in a 12-count second superseding indictment charging the above offenses in addition to other drug charges and a forfeiture count. On February 14, 2001, a jury convicted Arispe of the counts described above and acquitted him of two other distribution counts. The district court sentenced him on September 10, 2001, to a total of 121 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. Arispe and the government reached an agreement as to the forfeiture count.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Arispe\u2019s court-appointed counsel has filed a brief on appeal and also a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). After a review of the record, counsel was of the opinion that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but did address the following issues: (1) whether the government improperly failed to provide police surveillance notes to defense counsel prior to trial; (2) whether the all-white composition of the grand jury was unconstitutional; (3) whether the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance; (4) whether the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal; (5) whether the jury instructions were proper; (6) whether the trial court erred in denying a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility; (7) whether the sentence was lawfully imposed; and (8) whether the district court erred in denying counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. Arispe was advised of his right to respond to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and has filed a pro se response raising the additional issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">Upon review, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw because he has filed an acceptable <em>Anders </em>brief that concludes, after a review of the entire record, that there are no meritorious grounds for relief and raises the only issues he determined to be arguable. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment because none of the 'issues raised by counsel warrants relief and Arispe\u2019s pro se issue of ineffective assistance of counsel is more properly raised in a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The first issue on appeal concerns the prosecution\u2019s alleged failure to timely provide certain notes used by a witness to refresh his memory. The issue was raised during trial when codefendant\u2019s counsel questioned a witness regarding notes taken during surveillance operations and asked to see them. During a sidebar, the notes were provided to defense counsel, who was allowed time to examine the notes during a break. Furthermore, the witness was recalled at defense counsel\u2019s request so that counsel could conduct a re-cross examination regarding the notes as prior inconsistent statements of the witness. The district court admitted the prior inconsistent statements with a limiting instruction to the jury. Thus, the issue was decided in the defendant\u2019s favor and there was no prejudice to the defense by the prosecution\u2019s failure to provide these records prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>Counsel next challenges the constitutionality of the composition of the grand jury which brought the indictment. This court reviews a defendant\u2019s challenge to the composition of a grand jury <em>de novo. United States v. Blair, </em>214 F.3d 690, 699 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 880, 121 S.Ct. 191, 148 L.Ed.2d 132 (2000). The Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in the selection of grand jurors. <em>Rose v. Mitchell, </em>443 U.S. 545, 555-56, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979). A prima facie case is established if a party shows that: (1) the group excluded is a recognizable,' distinct class capable of being singled out for different treatment under the laws; (2) the grand jury selection process is susceptible to abuse or is not racially neutral; and (3) the degree of underrepresentation has occurred over a significant period of time. <em>Castaneda v. Partida, </em>430 U.S. 482, 494, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977); <em>United States v. Ovalle, </em>136 F.3d 1092, 1105 (6th Cir.1998). Even though Arispe is Hispanic, he still has standing to challenge the underrepresentation of blacks in the grand jury pool. <em>See Campbell v. Louisiana, </em>523 U.S. 392, 397-400, 118 S.Ct. 1419, 140 L.Ed.2d 551 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The district court thoroughly analyzed the defendants\u2019 pre-trial challenge to the grand jury composition both under the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861 <em>et seq., </em>and under the constitutional guarantees of an impartial jury and equal protection and concluded that the defendants had failed to make out a prima facie ease under any of those theories. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Arispe, through counsel, next appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for severance. He argues that his codefendant\u2019s decision to appear at trial in prison garb and the codefendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s indication that he could not predict what the codefendant\u2019s defense would be, jeopardized his own right to a fair trial. The decision to deny a motion for severance rests within the broad discretion of the trial court and so is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Breinig, </em>70 F.3d 850, 852 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">Ordinarily, defendants who are indicted together should be tried together. Fed.R. Crim.P. 8(b); <em>Breinig, </em>70 F.3d at 852. The federal courts\u2019 interest in joint trials is strong and \u201c[therefore, without more, defendants are not entitled to a separate trial simply because they may have a better chance of acquittal if they were tried alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853. Moreover, even a mutually antagonistic defense is not prejudicial <em>per se. Id. </em>Instead, \u201cthe appropriate standard to be used for evaluating a motion for severance once defendants have been properly joined under Rule 8(b), is that of \u2018a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S. Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">When this standard is applied, it is clear that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Arispe\u2019s motion to sever. There was no showing that codefendant Delgado\u2019s clothing reflected negatively on Arispe and Delgado did not present an antagonistic defense; thus, there was no prejudice to Arispe.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Arispe next asserts that the district court erred in denying in part his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. A district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Chambers, </em>195 F.3d 274, 276 (6th Cir.1999). \u201cThe inquiry is \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Our review of the trial transcript as well as the Rule 29 arguments of counsel persuades us that the district court did not err in denying in part the motion for judgment of acquittal. The district court did grant the motion in part, dismissing the charge of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine from count 1. However, as to the other counts, there was sufficient evidence presented that a reasonable juror could have found Arispe guilty of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Arispe\u2019s counsel next raises the question of whether the district court\u2019s jury instructions were proper. Because Arispe did not object to the jury instructions as given, they are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. McGee, </em>173 F.3d 952, 957 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Monus, </em>128 F.3d 376, 386 (6th Cir.1997). The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdX\">[Bjefore an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) \u201cerror,\u201d (2) that is \u201cplain,\u201d and (3) that \u201cseriously affect[s] substantial rights.\u201d If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-7\"><em>Monus, </em>128 F.3d at 386 (quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)) (double-internal quote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Counsel identifies no improper jury instruction and, in fact, notes that they were favorable to Arispe by including instructions for lesser included potential verdicts. We have reviewed the jury instructions and find no plain error affecting Arispe\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Arispe next argues that the district court erred in rejecting his motion for a two-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. After hearing argument, the district court ruled that this was not one of those rare cases as outlined in the application note to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, where the defendant may receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility while exercising his right to go to trial. In addition, the district court did not find a clear demonstration on Arispe\u2019s part that he accepted responsibility for his crimes. For these reasons, the district court denied the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">This court reviews for clear error a district court\u2019s finding that a defendant is not entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>245 F.3d 538, 546 (6th Cir.2001). \u201c \u2018However, the standard of review is de novo where ... the only issue presented is the propriety of the application of the reduction to uncontested facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Tilford, </em>224 F.3d 865, 867 (6th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">In this case, the relevant facts are not in dispute. Arispe did not go to trial merely to assert and preserve issues unrelated to factual guilt. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.2). Instead, as is clear from his allocution, Arispe continued to assert his innocence. Thus, the district court did not err in finding that Arispe was not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief also raises the issue of whether Arispe\u2019s sentence was lawfully imposed under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. This court reviews a district court\u2019s factual findings relating to the application of sentencing guidelines for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Griffis, </em>282 F.3d 443, 446 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-14\">A defendant may seek review of his sentence only on the grounds that: (1) the sentence was imposed in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>law; (2) the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; (3) the sentence represents an upward departure from the applicable guidelines range; or (4) the sentence was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a); <em>Griffis, </em>282 F.3d at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Because Arispe\u2019s sentence falls within none of the categories set forth in \u00a7 3742(a), it is not subject to review on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Counsel\u2019s final issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw. Prior to sentencing, counsel moved to withdraw based upon disagreements between him and his client. The district court conducted a hearing on September 17, 2001, during which Arispe expressed some dissatisfaction with counsel\u2019s handling of the case, but stated that he did not want to fire him. Under the circumstances, the district court did not err in denying counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Finally, Arispe, in his pro se response to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Generally, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not cognizable on direct appeal because the record is inadequate to permit review; therefore it is more properly brought in a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>263 F.3d 603, 612 (6th Cir.2001). However, if the record is adequate, this court may elect to review the issue on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>Although the record in this case includes a transcript of the hearing on counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw before the district court and Arispe includes a number of supporting documents along with his pro se brief, we find that the record is inadequate to review this issue on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
