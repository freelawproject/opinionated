Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>FMCS Case No. 01-05419, slip op. (Oct. 2, 2001). Because Laufenberg did not file a timely petition for review of that decision in this court, we <em>dismiss </em>his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">The United States Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, proposed the removal of Mr. Laufenberg, a GS-14 General Engineer, for misuse of government property, violation of prohibited personnel practices, submission of false travel vouchers, and irregularities in his time logs. <em>Id. </em>at 3-9. The Forest Service later reduced the sanction to a two-grade demotion and a thirty-day suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Laufenberg appealed that decision to an arbitrator. <em>Id. </em>The arbitrator rescinded the thirty-day suspension, but sustained the demotion on the basis of Laufenberg\u2019s having submitted false travel vouchers for reimbursement. <em>Id. </em>at 34. That decision, dated October 2, 2001, was received by Laufenberg\u2019s attorney on October 4, 2001. Laufenberg filed an informal brief to petition for review of that decision by this court on December 20, 2001, or seventy-seven days after Laufenberg\u2019s attorney had received notice of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-17\">Laufenberg argues that we should consider his petition for review as having been timely filed, although he concedes that \u201c[tjimeliness of my appeal is a question I can\u2019t affirm.\u201d He then indicates that he met with his attorney on October 10, 2001, presumably to discuss the arbitrator\u2019s October 2, 2001, decision, of which his attorney was clearly aware. He further states that \u201cI did not know which days are counted, working or calendar, but I believe we have placed the appeal in the most timely and earnest manner and intent possible. I ask that the Court consider the circumstances surrounding this time and allow the appeal.\u201d In his memorandum in support of oral argument, filed after his reply to the government\u2019s brief, Laufenberg additionally argues that his petition for review was timely because he did not receive a copy of the decision until after October 29, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Our jurisdiction is fixed by statute. A petition for review of a final decision of an arbitrator must be \u201cmust be filed within 60 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1) (2000) (stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ing the jurisdictional time limits for petitioning for review of Board decisions); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(f) (applying the time limits for judicial review of Board decisions to arbitration decisions). We cannot waive the timeliness requirement, irrespective of \u201cearnest manner and intent\u201d shown by Laufenberg. Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(2) (proscribing the court from enlarging the time limits for petitioning for review of an agency or board decision except as specifically authorized by law); <em>Pinat v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed.Cir.1991) (dismissing petition received nine days late because the deadline for filing a petition may not be waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Laufenberg\u2019s petition for review was filed outside of the time limits of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). Laufenberg constructively received notice of the decision on October 4, 2001, when his then-attorney received notice. He filed his informal brief on December 20, 2001, seventy-seven days after that date. Moreover, even if Laufenberg\u2019s attorney\u2019s receipt of the notice of the decision was not constructive receipt of notice by Laufenberg himself, Laufenberg admits that he met with his attorney on October 10, 2001, to discuss the decision. His petition for review was thus filed more than sixty days after the date he admitted receiving <em>notice, </em>notwithstanding his assertion that he did not receive a <em>copy </em>of the decision until October 29, 2001. While we recognize that Laufenberg is proceeding <em>pro se </em>in his petition for review by this court, we cannot waive a mandatory jurisdictional requirement. Accordingly, his petition for review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision is untimely and must be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
