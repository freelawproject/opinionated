They contend on appeal that the district court erred by making their sentences consecutive to the undischarged state sentences they were serving without considering factors set out in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000), and the commentary to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s. (2001). We affirm the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-25\">Carraway and Milliner maintain that the district court erred in not making explicit findings concerning the factors set out in the commentary to \u00a7 5G1.3(c). We disagree. We are satisfied from our review of the record that the district court was aware of its sentencing options, of the applicable statutes and guidelines, and was familiar with the facts of this case. The sentencing court is not required to make specific findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>138 F.3d 115, 119 (4th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 924 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-26\">We therefore affirm the sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
