Lanier appeals a district court order denying his motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In 1992, Lanier was convicted of multiple civil rights violations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242. He was sentenced to twenty-five years of imprisonment. Lanier originally filed with the district court a motion to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and then supplemented his request by contending that his conviction was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The district court denied the motion for a reduction in sentence, and noted that it was without jurisdiction to address the <em>Apprendi </em>issue since the argument was essentially a second motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Lanier then attempted to file a notice of appeal with the district court. However, the district court refused to accept his notice of appeal for filing. Lanier then sought permission from this court to file a notice of appeal. In his documents filed with this court, Lanier asserts that he did not file his motion under \u00a7 2255. Rather, the motion and subsequent appeal are based under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">As Lanier contends that his appeal is under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), rather than \u00a7 2255, we accept Lanier\u2019s position and will address the merits of his appeal under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">This court reviews for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision denying a motion to modify sentence. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly denied Lanier\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Lanier argues that his sentence should be reduced in accordance with USSG App. C. Amendment 591, November 1, 2000. However, Amendment 591 does not apply to Lanier\u2019s ease as explained in great detail by the district court in its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s order for the reasons stated by the district court. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
