He now argues that his sentence of 264 months in prison violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm Pearson\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-21\">Because Pearson did not raise his <em>Apprendi </em>claim in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In order to demonstrate plain error, a defendant must show that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. If he can satisfy these requirements, we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error \u201cunless the error seriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-22\">Pearson\u2019s indictment did not charge a specific amount of drugs. Under <em>Apprendi, </em>he therefore was subject to a sentence of only 240. months in prison, and his 264-month sentence constituted plain error. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-26\">We need not decide, however, whether the 264 month sentence affected Pearson\u2019s substantial rights. Pearson stipulated in his plea agreement and at his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing that he was responsible for at least 500 grams and not more than 1.5 kilograms of crack cocaine. Further, Pearson did not object to the factual basis of the plea, which stated that he was responsible for the stipulated amount of crack. The evidence that Pearson was accountable for at least 500 grams but less than 1.5 kilograms of crack was thus overwhelming and uncontroverted and, in accordance with <em>Cotton, </em>we decline to exercise our discretion to correct the <em>Apprendi </em>error. <em>See Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at ---, 122 S.Ct. at 1785-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>We affirm Pearson\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. The motion to dismiss the appeal is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
