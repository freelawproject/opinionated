We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and review de novo the district court\u2019s decision affirming the decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ). <em>Bustamante v. Massanari, </em>262 F.3d 949, 953 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm because the decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recite them in this decision. Woods first argues that the ALJ should have deemed her application to have been filed in 1986. Pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.633, the Commissioner \u201cmay establish\u201d a deemed filing date of an application if she determines that a claimant failed to apply because a Social Security employee gave the claimant \u201cmisinformation\u201d about eligibility for benefits in response to a specific request for information about eligibility. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision not to deem Woods\u2019 application to have been filed in 1986. Woods\u2019 testimony, which conflicted with an earlier letter by Woods to Social Security, was insufficient to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>she failed to apply for benefits in 1986 because of misinformation from Social Security. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.683(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Woods argues that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she was not continuously disabled. Because Woods applied for disability in 1996, after her insured status had expired, she must establish that her current disability has existed continuously since some time on or before the date that her insured status lapsed, June 30, 1990. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.131 (2001); <em>Flaten v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1458 (9th Cir.1995). Substantial evidence, including the eleven-year gap in treatment and Woods\u2019 treating psychiatrist\u2019s reports, supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Woods did not have a continuous severe mental impairment during the required time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Woods argues that the ALJ failed to develop the record by not obtaining more medical evidence or questioning Woods\u2019 husband about her difficulties in functioning during the period without medical records. An ALJ has a \u201cduty to fully and fairly develop the record\u201d if the evidence is ambiguous or \u201cthe record is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.\u201d <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001). The ALJ could not have ordered further medical evidence because such evidence did not exist. Woods failed to seek treatment for 11 years. The last medical evidence from Woods\u2019 treating physician, in 1985, established that Woods was not permanently and totally disabled and that she would be able to work with vocational rehabilitation. Thus, she was not disabled under the social security definition. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a) (2001). Questioning Woods\u2019 husband about her limitations would not have cured the lack of medical evidence necessary to establish that a severe continuous impairment existed prior to June 30, 1990. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b983-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
