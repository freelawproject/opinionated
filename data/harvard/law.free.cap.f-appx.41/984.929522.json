We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States v. Colussi, </em>22 F.3d 218, 219 (9th Cir.1994), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-22\">Osorio-Munoz contends that the district court erred by denying him a one-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-23\">Because the district court granted the two-level adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1(a), the additional one-level adjustment was mandatory if Osorio-Munoz met the requirements of \u00a7 3E1.1(b). <em>See Colussi </em>22 F.3d at 219-20. Here, the district court erroneously believed that granting the \u00a7 3E1.1(b) adjustment was contingent upon the government\u2019s approval of such an adjustment. The government concedes that the district court erred in this regard, but contends that any such error was harmless because Osorio-Munoz did not meet the criteria of either subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-24\">However, because the district court treated the decision as discretionary in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>stead of mandatory, it failed to make sufficient factual findings concerning OsorioMunoz\u2019s eligibility for the \u00a7 3El.l(b) adjustment to allow us to conclude that the error was harmless. We therefore vacate Osorio-Munoz\u2019s sentence, and remand for the district court to determine whether Osorio-Munoz is eligible for the additional one-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(1) or (b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1006-27\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-17\">. We decline to review on direct appeal Osorio-Munoz's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because it requires development of facts not currently in the record. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>206 F.3d 896, 900 (9th Cir.2000). The district court on remand may consider all evidence relevant to the determination of whether Osorio-Munoz satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 3E 1.1(b). <em>See United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
