She contends that the district court erred in its determination that the conduct of her codefendant was fully attributable to her, and that the court abused its discretion in its determination that she must pay restitution to her victim. We exercise jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Taylor was employed as a bank teller by Community First National Bank of Rich-field, Utah, for nearly eight years prior to engaging in the activities that eventually led to her arrest. Sometime between April 1998 and October 1998, Taylor and another teller \u2014 codefendant DonNetta Jorgenson \u2014 began embezzling cash from the bank. The unsophisticated scheme worked by having Taylor write out a personal check and then give it to Jorgenson, who in turn would deliver cash from the bank in payment of the check. Instead of sending the check through the clearing process to be debited from Taylor\u2019s account, however, Jorgenson would simply hold onto it. Taylor performed the same service for Jorgenson. To conceal their diversions, the codefendants would tear the notations of their suspect transactions from the teller tapes and then reconnect the tapes. An FBI investigation determined that Jorgenson had diverted a total of $27,200 from her teller drawer, and that Taylor had diverted $14,398 from her drawer. In a \u201cStipulated Statement of Facts\u201d appended to the \u201cStatement by Defendant in Advance of Plea of Guilty,\u201d Taylor \u201cadmitted] to embezzling monies from Community First National Bank,\u201d and \u201cagree[d] that the sum not to exceed of $41,398 is an appropriate sum to be ordered as restitution.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (R. Doc. 14 Attach. at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Prior to sentencing, a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared. The PSR recommended that, pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) of the United States Sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>fencing Guidelines,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seven points should be added to Taylor\u2019s base offense level because the bank\u2019s loss exceeded $40,000 but was less than $70,000. Although Taylor conceded that up to $41,398 would be appropriate for restitution, she nevertheless contested the PSR\u2019s conclusion that she was criminally responsible for the full amount of the bank\u2019s loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Taylor pled guilty to the one-count indictment, was sentenced to four months\u2019 imprisonment, four months\u2019 home detention,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thirty-two months\u2019 supervised release. She was also ordered to pay $41,398 in restitution at a minimum rate of $100 per month. As part of her plea agreement, she reserved the right to appeal her sentence if it was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines or in violation of the law. She has now done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, but review its underlying findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>229 F.3d 975, 978 (10th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Taylor contends that the district court erred in its determination that the full $41,398 loss incurred by the bank was a result of jointly undertaken criminal activity for which she was responsible. She argues that she is responsible only for the $10,800 that she admits to having misappropriated, along with the $10,000 she contends represents the total amount her eodefendant misappropriated prior to June 30, 1998 \u2014 the date Taylor voluntarily terminated her employment at the bank. Because these figures total only $20,800, if Taylor is correct then under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 her base offense level would be increased by only six points, rather than the seven points that are required where the victim\u2019s loss exceeds $40,000. If the district court did err in this manner, Taylor should have faced a sentencing range of six-to-twelve months rather than the eight-to-fourteen-month range pursuant to which she was actually sentenced. Because she received an eight-month sentence, such error would not have been harmless. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 1231, 1238 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cWe will not permit our result to be guided by idle speculation as to the sentence that might be imposed by the district court on remand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">We conclude that the district court committed no error. The guidelines instruct that a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct shall include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-12\">(A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>anee of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1). The district court, addressing Taylor\u2019s argument that she could not have reasonably foreseen that codefendant Jorgenson would continue embezzling money after Taylor left the bank\u2019s employment, determined that the continuation of the criminal enterprise <em>was </em>reasonably foreseeable. Not only do we conclude that this finding is not clearly erroneous, but we further note that even if Jorgenson\u2019s continuation of the criminal conduct were not reasonably foreseeable, Taylor would still be responsible for the full amount of the bank\u2019s loss because she personally \u201ccommitted, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d the acts that led to the loss of the full $41,398. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A). On June 30, 1998 \u2014 the day she left her job at the bank \u2014 $14,398 was missing from Taylor\u2019s drawer; on April 17, 1998, Jorgenson\u2019s teller tape showed a loss of $27,000. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6.) Taylor was therefore directly involved in the embezzlement from both her own and Jorgenson\u2019s teller drawers of the $41,398 before she left her job. Even without recourse to the district court\u2019s factual determination made pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(B), therefore, it is evident that Taylor is responsible for her codefendant\u2019s criminal conduct pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a restitution order for clear error. <em>United States v. Olson, </em>104 F.3d 1234, 1237 (10th Cir.1997). We review the amount of a district court\u2019s restitution order for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d) provides that the district court \u201cshall order\u201d a defendant to make restitution to his or her victim, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), for any offense that is, inter alia, \u201can offense against property under this title, including any offense committed by fraud or deceit,\u201d \u00a7 3663A(c)(1). The MVRA thus amended the Victim and Witness Protection Act (\u201cVWPA\u201d) to make restitution for certain crimes, such as violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656, mandatory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the MVRA, not only does the district court lack discretion <em>not </em>to order restitution as part of the sentence for a crime like that committed by Taylor, but moreover the court \u201cshall order restitution to each victim in the <em>full amount </em>of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.1(a)(1). Given Taylor\u2019s concession in her stipulation that $41,398 would be an appropriate figure for restitution, the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that she repay the bank this full amount of its loss.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Taylor, in asking us to find that the district court committed clear error in ordering her to pay restitution to the bank, quotes from the VWPA, which required a court to consider \u201cthe financial resources of the defendant, the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant\u2019s dependents, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate\u201d in deciding \u201cwhether to order restitution.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(a) (1994) (repealed 1996). The VWPA, of course, is no longer the congressional mandate, and the district court had no discretion in the present case not to order restitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The MVRA does require the district court, in determining the <em>manner </em>in which restitution will be paid, to consider \u201c(A) the financial resources and other assets of the defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled; (B) projected earnings and other income of the defendant; and (C) any financial obligations of the defendant; including obligations to dependents.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2). Though she and her husband have filed for bankruptcy, Taylor is a high school graduate with at least eight years of employment experience. Based on this information the district court adopted the recommendation in the PSR that Taylor will be able to pay restitution if allowed to do so in monthly payments. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Taylor to pay her victim $100 per month in restitution. <em>Cf. Olson, </em>104 F.3d at 1237 (holding, in a pre-MVRA case, that \u201c[a] restitution order must be consistent with a defendant\u2019s ability to pay,\u201d but that a defendant\u2019s inability to pay at the time of sentencing is not itself a bar); <em>United States v. Rogat, </em>924 F.2d 983, 985 (10th Cir.1991) (noting, in another preMVRA case, that a restitution order \u201cwill be upheld if the evidence indicates a defendant has some assets or earning potential and thus possibly may be able to pay the amount ordered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Taylor\u2019s sentence and the district court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. The 2000 edition of the sentencing guidelines was used in computing Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-12\">The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-16\">. We note that this tortured grammar is the result of the handwritten insertion of the phrase \u201cnot to exceed\u201d into the pre-typed document. We also note that neither party suggests that $41,598 (the total amount of money apparently missing from Taylor\u2019s and Jorgenson\u2019s teller drawers) would have been a more appropriate benchmark for the bank\u2019s losses than the $41,398 figure adopted in Taylor\u2019s stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\">. The sentencing guidelines clarify that the court may order a defendant with a criminal history category of I and an offense level of 11 to serve a sentence of imprisonment \"that includes a term of supervised release with a condition that substitutes community confinement or home detention ..., provided that at least one-half of the minimum term is satisfied by imprisonment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1(d). The district court therefore acted within its discretion when it allowed Taylor to serve four months of her eight-month sentence in home detention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\">. Among the examples of \"property offenses\" provided in the sentencing guidelines are \u201ctheft, embezzlement, [and] fraud.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, introductory cmt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. Under the MVRA, if the court finds that multiple defendants have contributed to the loss of a victim, \u201cthe court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim\u2019s loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(h). There is no indication in the record before us whether the district court apportioned liability between Taylor and her codefendant-who pled guilty and was. sentenced before the same court-or whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>court made the two jointly and severally liable. We note that the bank should not in any case expect a potential windfall from duplicative restitution payments made by each defendant. <em>Cf. United States v. Arutunoff, </em>1 F.3d 1112, 1121 (10th Cir.1993) (holding, in a preMVRA case, that allowing victims to receive more in restitution than they had lost would be at odds with the statute\u2019s limited purpose).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b406-17\">. Taylor committed her crimes and was convicted subsequent to April 24, 1996, the enactment date of the MVRA. She is thus subject to the provisions of the MVRA rather than the VWPA. <em>See </em>MVRA, Pub.L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 211, 110 Stat. 1214, 1241 (1996) (\"The amendments made [to the VWPA] shall, to the extent constitutionally permissible, be effective for sentencing proceedings in cases in which the defendant is convicted on or after the date of enactment of this Act.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
