The government argues that Bishop has waived his right to appeal. Based on our de novo review, <em>United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 272, 151 L.Ed.2d 199 (2001), we agree with the government. Bishop knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal by entering into a plea agreement which provided that he waived all rights to appeal his conviction and sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 958-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1003-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
