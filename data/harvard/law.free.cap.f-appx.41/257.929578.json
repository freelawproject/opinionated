After a sentencing hearing, the district court sentenced Mr. Anderson to 396 months imprisonment on concurrent sentences. Mr. Anderson appealed the convictions and sentence and we affirmed the two drug convictions, but reversed his money laundering conviction. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>189 F.3d 1201, 1214 (10th Cir.1999). In addition, we reversed the trial court\u2019s enhancement of Mr. Anderson\u2019s sentence for his leadership role in the offense and remanded the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">On remand, the district court sentenced Mr. Anderson to 327 months imprisonment for the affirmed drug convictions. During the sentencing hearing on remand, Mr. Anderson\u2019s defense counsel argued the impact of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which the Supreme Court had decided fourteen days earlier. The district court rejected the <em>Apprendi </em>argument, stating that it was not applicable because Mr. Anderson had received a sentence within the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>II Aplt.App. at 9 (Doc. 1036).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">Mr. Anderson filed his notice of appeal <em>pro se, </em>but we appointed counsel to represent him in this appeal. Mr. Anderson\u2019s counsel has now filed an <em>Anders </em>brief seeking leave to withdraw because any further proceedings on his behalf would be wholly frivolous and without arguable merit. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Anderson has filed <em>pro se </em>response and reply briefs to the briefs of his counsel and the Government, respectively. His claim on appeal is that the district court violated <em>Apprendi </em>because it failed to instruct the jury as to drug type and quantity and that it enhanced his sentence based upon drug amounts not found by a jury. We agree that this argument is without merit and will therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">Mr. Anderson claims that because the district court did not instruct the jury on drug type and amount that he should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>been convicted pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) as opposed to \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) or (b)(1)(B). Assuming he is correct, the <em>Apprendi </em>argument would still fail. <em>Apprendi </em>held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Mr. Anderson was convicted of both conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute and was therefore subject, assuming \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) applied, to two separate twenty-year maximum sentences. Under <em>United States v. Price, </em>265 F.3d 1097 (10th Cir.2001), the district court was required to apply section 5G1.2(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1109 (holding that section 5G1.2(d) is a mandatory provision). Section 5G1.2(d) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">[i]f the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment [arrived at through application of the Guidelines], then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">As a result, section 5G1.2(d) required the district court to combine Mr. Anderson\u2019s two sentences to equate the 262 to 327 month sentence he would have received under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>II Aplt.App. at 45 (noting applicable Guideline sentence); <em>see also Price, </em>265 F.3d at 1109 (stating that section 5G1.2 required the district court to run sentences consecutively to approximate the Guideline sentence of life imprisonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Thus, the district court did not impose a sentence beyond the statutory maximum and <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir.2001). Further, Mr. Anderson\u2019s suggestion that the district court inappropriately enhanced his sentence based upon drug quantities not found by the jury is, quite simply, incorrect. We have held, subsequent to the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, that judges may \u201cascertain drug quantities by a preponderance of the evidence for the purpose of calculating offense levels under the Sentencing Guidelines, so long as they do not sentence above the statutory maximum for the jury-fixed crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Heckard, </em>238 F.3d 1222, 1236 (10th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court. Appellate counsel\u2019s request for leave to withdraw is GRANTED. All other pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b280-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
