We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-22\">(1) On June 21, 2001, we vacated submission as to Perez\u2019s claims under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On that same date, we decided his other claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-23\">(2) Perez attacks the failure to submit the issues of type and quantity of the drug to the jury. That was error, but it was not a plain error which requires reversal. <em>See id. </em>at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63; <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 568-70 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002). His conspiracy to distribute a quantity of methamphetamine placed him in the sentencing range of up to 30 years of imprisonment and up to 6 years of supervised release. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). His sentence was below those maxima. It is true that the quantity determined by the district court elevated the statutory mini-ma, but <em>Apprendi </em>does not invalidate that increase. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2419-20, - L.Ed.2d-(2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
