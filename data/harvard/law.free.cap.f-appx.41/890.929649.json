Williams filed a notice of appeal, but his attorney believes an appeal would be frivolous and so has filed a motion for leave to withdraw and a brief outlining the potential issues he considered raising. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel\u2019s brief is sufficient, and because Williams has declined our invitation to respond, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), the brief alone guides our analysis, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-18\">Counsel first considers whether Williams might argue that the district court wrongly assessed a criminal history point for a sentence imposed in 1990, more than ten years before the date the indictment alleges Williams was found in the United States (August 13, 2001). But the point was part of the criminal history calculation contained in the PSR, and Williams waived any objection to that calculation by answering \u201cno\u201d when asked at sentencing whether he wished to make any corrections to the PSR. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Jimenez, </em>No. 01-4234, 294 F.3d 921, 2002 WL 1378749, at *2 (7th Cir. June 27, 2002) (collecting waiver cases). Moreover, counsel observes, the argument would have been frivolous: sentences for offenses a defendant commits as an adult are counted if imposed within ten years of the \u201ccommencement\u201d of the offense of conviction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e); \u201cfound in\u201d offenses like Williams\u2019s commence at the time of the reentry, <em>see United States v. Lopez-Flores, </em>275 F.3d 661, 663 (7th Cir.2001); and Williams conceded at sentencing that he was in the United States as early as May 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-19\">Next, counsel examines whether Williams deserved a downward departure because his deportability subjects him to harsher conditions of confinement. But as counsel conceded in the district court, no such departure is permitted when a defendant is sentenced based on a re-entry violation because the applicable guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, accounts for deportability. <em>See United States v. Bautista, </em>258 F.3d 602, 605 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Martinez-Carillo, </em>250 F.3d 1101, 1107 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>(7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Farouil, </em>124 F.3d 838, 846-47 &amp; n. 6 (7th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Portillo, </em>121 F.3d 1122, 1125 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">We agree with counsel that both potential issues are frivolous. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and Williams\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED. Williams\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
