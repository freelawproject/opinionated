United States, </em>No. 00-38C (Fed.Cl. June 6, 2001). Because a board of inquiry was not required under statute or Navy regulation, Ostler\u2019s separation procedure was proper. And because he is bound by the Agreement to Serve and Degree Requirements to repay his tuition, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">The procedures by which boards of inquiry shall be convened to determine whether an officer should be separated from the service or retained on active duty are set out in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1181-1187. A board of inquiry entails the appearance of the officer whose case is under consideration, representation by counsel, and access to the appropriate records. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1185(a)(3), (4). Ostler argues that his separation was improper because the Navy failed to convene a board of inquiry. We do not agree. <em>Holley v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed.Cir.1997), held that sections 1181-1187 do not apply to the discharge of probationary officers, regular commissioned officers with less than five years of active service. Because Ostler was a probationary officer, with four years and four months of active service, his separation was governed instead by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 630. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c10 U.S.C. \u00a7 630 is specific to the discharge of officers with less than five years of service.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">Under section 630, the procedures for the discharge of probationary officers are left to the discretion of the agency. <em>Holley, </em>124 F.3d at 1467. Section 630 states in relevant part: \u201cThe Secretary of the military department concerned, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense-(l) may discharge any regular officer on the active-duty list who-(A) has less than five years of active commissioned service.\u201d Ostler argues that he was entitled to a board of inquiry under Navy regulations. We find no support for this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">Ostler was discharged for both substandard performance of duty and misconduct. Under Secretary of the Navy\u2019s Instructions (SECNAVINST) 1920.6A, neither charge requires a board of inquiry for probationary officers. Those officers being considered for separation for substandard performance shall be processed under enclosure (7) by which \u201c[njeither a hearing nor a board proceeding is re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>quired.\u201d SECNAVINST 1920.6A Enclosure (4), \u00b6 (3)(a)(1). Probationary officers being considered for separation for misconduct shall be processed under the procedures in enclosure (8). <em>Id. </em>Enclosure (4), \u00b6 (3)(a)(2). Enclosure (8), \u00b6 (1)(c)(3), in turn states that if a probationary officer has been recommended for an Honorable or General discharge, the procedure outlined in enclosure (7) under which a <em>board of </em>inquiry is not required applies. Because Ostler\u2019s discharge was characterized as General (under Honorable conditions), he was properly processed under Navy regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">When Ostler entered the United States Naval Academy, he signed a contract entitled Agreement to Serve and Degree Requirements with the United States government whereby the government agreed to pay for his education and he agreed to serve on active duty for at least five years. In addition, he agreed that should he fail to complete the five year term due to misconduct or otherwise, he would reimburse the United States for the same portion of the cost of his education as the unserved portion of active duty. In his \u201cStatement Concerning Administrative Separation,\u201d Ostler recognized that he owed five years of service upon graduation from the Naval Academy, but requested that the reimbursement obligation be waived. Because the government did not waive repayment, Ostler must perform under the Agreement and reimburse the government $10,302.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We have considered Ostler\u2019s remaining arguments and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b448-7\">MAYER, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYN\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Because we are bound by <em>Holley v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1462 (Fed.Cir.1997), I concur in the result that Ostler was properly separated because a board of inquiry is not required under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 630. I disagree, however, with the reasoning in <em>Holley </em>and in its absence, I would hold that Ostler should have been granted a board of inquiry pursuant to 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1181-1187 because his disciplinary proceedings could, and ultimately did, result in a stigmatizing General discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">A General discharge (Under Honorable Conditions) \u201cis warranted when significant negative aspects of the officer\u2019s conduct or performance of duty outweigh positive aspects of the officer\u2019s military record.\u201d SEVNAYINST 1920.6A Enclosure (5), \u00b6 (2)(b). This type of discharge, even though under honorable conditions, carries a stigma of unprofessionalism. When <em>Holley </em>upheld regulations under which \u201cno hearing before a board of inquiry is offered unless the discharge is upon other than honorable conditions,\u201d 124 F.3d at 1467, it improperly included General discharges. <em>Holley </em>should have been confined to Honorable discharges to which no stigma attaches.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
