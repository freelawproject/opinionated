The first four of these claims explicitly challenge Montana\u2019s refusal to grant him parole. As to those claims, the application is denied as unnecessary because his claims pertain to the calculation of his release date. <em>See Hill v. Alaska, </em>297 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.2002). The remaining three claims, enumerated as grounds five, six, and seven in West\u2019s application, pertain to the initial imposition of his sentence. These are claims that could have been brought in one of West\u2019s earlier habeas petitions. He has not evinced any new constitutional rules or new facts that counsel in favor of permitting him to file a successive habeas petition on any of these three grounds. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Therefore, with respect to grounds five, six, and seven, West\u2019s application is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-22\">APPLICATION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b955-20\">The panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
