Meek (\u201cMeek\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellees Albert J. Wojcik (\u201cWojcik\u201d) and Rodney Walker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(\u201cWalker\u201d), two Riverside County Municipal Court Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Meek was appointed as a Commissioner of the Municipal Court of Riverside County. As Commissioner, Meek adjudicated county code enforcement and small claims cases; conducted arraignments, pretrial and preliminary hearings; and presided at civil and criminal trials as a judge pro tern. After Wojcik and Walker voted to terminate Meek as Riverside County Municipal Commissioner (\u201cCommissioner\u201d), Presiding Judge Hinman gave Meek the options of resigning, retiring, or being terminated. Meek decided to retire, and brought a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging deprivation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Appellees did not violate Meek\u2019s First Amendment rights to campaign for public office when they voted to terminate him. The nature of Meek\u2019s responsibilities, and terms of his employment conferred upon him the status of policymaker. <em>See Walker v. City of Lakewood, </em>272 F.3d 1114, 1132 (9th Cir.2001). In turn, Meek\u2019s status as a policymaker and confidential employee render his termination for political reasons inoffensive to the First Amendment. <em>See Fazio v. City and County of San Francisco, </em>125 F.3d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Meek also faded to raise a genuine issue of material fact on his due process claim. California Government Code Section 72192<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not create a property interest in Meek\u2019s position because the judges were afforded wide discretion to terminate Commissioners at their \u201cpleasure.\u201d <em>See Jacobson v. Hannifin, </em>627 F.2d 177, 180 (9th Cir.1980). Absent a property interest, Meek\u2019s due process claim cannot survive summary judgment. <em>See Dittman v. State of Calif., </em>191 F.3d 1020, 1029 (9th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">.
