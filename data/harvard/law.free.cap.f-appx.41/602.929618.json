They appealed their convictions and sentences and we vacated and remanded in part and affirmed in part, by unpublished per curiam opinion. We now grant appellants\u2019 petition for panel rehearing and, dispensing with briefing and oral argument, modify our prior opinion, in light of the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), so as to affirm the sentences that we previously vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-28\">Under the standard of \u201cplain error\u201d appellate review set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Cotton, </em>we are required to affirm the district court\u2019s original sentence where, as here, there is \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted,\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 122 S.Ct. at 1786, evidence of the defendants\u2019 participation in a drug conspiracy involving at least as great a drug quantity as is required to support the relevant \u00a7 841(b)(1) sentence maximum. The district court sentenced Wall and McLendon to a life sentence and to 27 years, respectively. Neither of these sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tences exceeds the statutory maximum, life in prison, authorized by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), which requires the government to prove a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) involving more than 50 grams of cocaine base. Because there was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence that both appellants Wall and McLendon participated in drug conspiracies involving at least 50 grams of cocaine base, and because neither\u2019s sentence exceeds the maximum allowable under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), we affirm their original sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We leave our prior panel opinion intact in all other respects, including with regard to the sentences of appellants Walter Willougby and Shanell Willoughby, with regard to appellants\u2019 contentions that no instructions were given to the jury on section 860 and that the jury returned no verdict on that section, and with regard to appellants\u2019 remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
