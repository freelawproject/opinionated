He pled guilty to conspiring to possess, with intent to distribute, methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>846. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Arreguin-Rivera to 97 months imprisonment, based on a Guidelines range of 97-121 months, and 5 years supervised release. Arreguin-Rivera appeals, and we affirm. After reviewing the record for plain error, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-22\">In a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Arreguin-Rivera\u2019s counsel concedes Arreguin-Rivera\u2019s sentence is not subject to review, if within a properly calculated Guidelines range and not otherwise in violation of law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a); <em>United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam). We agree. Arreguin-Rivera\u2019s sentence is within a properly calculated range and no violations of law exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-23\">Having independently reviewed the entir\u00e9 record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no plain error affecting Arreguin-Rivera\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002) (standard of review). We do note two issues which warrant comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-26\">First, Arreguin-Rivera received a role in the offense sentencing adjustment based on the plea agreement, which stipulated he was a \u201cminor participant.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (\u201cA defendant who explicitly and voluntarily exposes himself to a specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal.\u201d). Although ArreguinRivera argued at the plea hearing and on appeal that his involvement was virtually non-existent, the district court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>in relying on the plea agreement stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Second, the plea agreement and the statements made at the plea hearing were sufficient to form a factual basis for the conspiracy plea. In the plea agreement, Arreguin-Rivera agreed that he \u201cconspired to deliver methamphetamine to Nebraska.\u201d At the plea hearing, ArreguinRivera\u2019s statements, together with his lawyer\u2019s statements, show that he was pleading guilty to a conspiracy because the car driver was prepared to testify and implicate Arreguin-Rivera in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-19\">. The Honorable Richard G.
