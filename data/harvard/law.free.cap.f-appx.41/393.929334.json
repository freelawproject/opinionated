The two positions had the same grade and pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>When Kreckmann appealed his reassignment to the Board, the Board\u2019s administrative judge noted that because the reassignment was \u201cwithout a loss of grade or pay,\u201d it was questionable whether the Board had jurisdiction. He ordered Kreckmann \u201cto file evidence and argument to prove that this action is within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Kreckmann responded that his hearing officer position \u201cwas in fact abolished due to a planned agency-wide reorganization, and that [his] reassignment and subsequent reclassification was the direct result of that agency reorganization, and that the agency had therefore been required to utilize reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In his initial decision, which became final when the Board refused to review it, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He noted that Kreckmann \u201cdoes not dispute that his grade and pay were not reduced. Rather, the appellant argues that the agency non-competitively reassigned him as part of reorganization without affording him the requisite RIF procedures.\u201d The administrative judge stated that under Board precedent \u201can agency is not required to follow RIF procedure where an employee is reassigned and another employee is not displaced\u201d and that since there was no evidence that Kreckmann\u2019s \u201creassignment resulted in the displacement of another employee,\u201d or that Kreckmann \u201csuffered a demotion as the result of the reassignment, ... the agency was not required to follow RIF procedures under the circumstances presented in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited and \u201callegations of a reassignment without change in grade or pay do not provide a basis for [Board] jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board, </em>742 F.2d 1424, 1426-27 (Fed.Cir.1984). Although Kreckmann argues in his informal brief that his reassignment \u201cwas in fact a \u2018demotion,\u2019 \u201d the notification of personnel action (Standard Form 50-B) covering the reassignment shows that the position to which he was reassigned had the same grade (GM 13) and the same salary ($77,-196) as the position from which he was transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The administrative judge ruled that this was not a reduction in force (over which the Board might have jurisdiction) because there was no indication that another employee was displaced as a result of Kreckmann\u2019s reassignment. Kreckmann contends that \u201cthere were in fact four employees displaced here during this reorganization, triggered by my reassignment.\u201d He has not provided any factual basis for this claim, however, and the administrative judge correctly rejected it and the accompanying claim that Kreckmann\u2019s agency should have followed reduction-in-force procedures in reassigning him.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
