Because the type of damages Hassain seeks cannot be recovered in a citizen\u2019s suit, his complaint was properly dismissed. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6972(a)(2) (allowing injunctive relief and civil penalties in citizen suits), 9659(c) (same); <em>Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc., </em>516 U.S. 479, 484, 116 S.Ct. 1251, 134 L.Ed.2d 121 (1996) (RCRA\u2019s citizen suit provision allows private citizens to seek mandatory or prohibitory injunctions, but not damages); <em>Walls v.
