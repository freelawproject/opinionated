We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Guillemin has standing to bring this lawsuit because, by virtue of his purchase agreement with William Wilson, Guillemin was the equitable owner of the Sheep Ranch Property during the relevant time period. <em>See In re Reid\u2019s Estate, </em>26 Cal.App.2d 362, 79 P.2d 451, 455-56 (Cal.1938). The record does not reflect that he was in breach of this agreement, and defendants do not have standing to raise a statute of frauds challenge. <em>Sauget v. Villagomez, </em>228 F.2d 374, 376 (9th Cir.1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">We reject Guillemin\u2019s contention that the County regulations at issue are preempted by section 43 of the Federal Mining Act. Section 43 does not explicitly prohibit states from enacting rules and conditions other than those related to \u201ceasements, drainage and other necessary means to ... complete development,\u201d 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 43, and County Code provisions 17.56.030 and 17.04.050 (which has since been repealed and incorporated into Chapter 17.56) are not in conflict with any other provision of the Federal Mining Act. Because the County regulations do not conflict with federal mining law, they are not preempted. <em>See Butte City Water Co. v. Baker, </em>196 U.S. 119, 119-28, 25 S.Ct. 211, 49 L.Ed. 409 (1905). Moreover, the County regulations do not contravene the purposes of the Federal Mining Act. <em>See Cal. Coastal Comm\u2019n v. Granite Rock Co., </em>480 U.S. 572, 581, 107 S.Ct. 1419, 94 L.Ed.2d 577 (1987). Finally, <em>Summa Corp. v. California ex rel. Lands Commission, </em>466 U.S. 198, 104 S.Ct. 1751, 80 L.Ed.2d 237 (1984), does not alter our preemption analysis or provide support for Guillemin\u2019s claim that the County may not prescribe regulations other than those listed in the federal patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">Guillemin\u2019s procedural due process challenge is also unavailing. Although we are sympathetic to his frustration with the County\u2019s bureaucratic attitude and handling of this matter, we conclude that Guillemin was afforded sufficient predeprivation process. Seider visited the Sheep Ranch Property on December 30, 1998, and personally told Guillemin that he would have to cease operations and obtain a permit. The record does not establish that Guillemin was precluded from meaningfully responding to Seider\u2019s concerns. This \u201copportunity for informal consultation with designated personnel empowered to correct a mistaken determination\u201d is sufficient to satisfy Guillemin\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law. <em>Weinberg v. Whatcom County, </em>241 F.3d 746, 753 (9th Cir.2001) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and need not decide whether Seider, Waller and the County were immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">Finally, we do not believe sanctions are warranted against Guillemin. He raised a reasonable challenge to defendant\u2019s conduct and complied with all relevant Circuit rules. Both sides shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
