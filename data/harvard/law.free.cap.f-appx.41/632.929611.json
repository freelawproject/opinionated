He was sentenced to a total of 392 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Jones noted a timely appeal and his counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Jones\u2019 guilty plea and whether the district court erred in imposing a 392-month prison sentence, but stating that in his opinion there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Jones has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising eight claims. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">Following a de novo review of the record, we find that the district court complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Jones\u2019 guilty plea. <em>United States v. Goins, </em>51 F.3d 400, 402 (4th Cir.1995) (providing standard). Because the sentence imposed by the district court is within the range recommended by the guidelines, and there is no evidence that the district court based this sentence upon an illegal reason, we are without jurisdiction to review it. <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-21\">In his supplemental pro se brief, Jones argues that the 84-month sentence imposed on count 2 and the 204-month sentence imposed on count 6 violate the Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Castillo v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 120, 120 S.Ct. 2090, 147 L.Ed.2d 94 (2000) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>different types of firearms described in \u00a7 924(c) are elements of the offense and not merely sentencing factors). Because Jones failed to object at sentencing, review is for plain error only. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">As an initial matter, <em>Apprendi </em>was concerned only with facts that increase the statutory maximum penalty and the relevant facts under \u00a7 924(c)(1) increase only the statutory minimum penalty. Jones received less than the statutory maximum on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">More importantly, the Supreme Court has recently held that, where the indictment fails to include an element of the offense under the reasoning provided in <em>Apprendi, </em>but where proof of that element is \u201coverwhelming and uncontroverted,\u201d the error will not be recognized. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002). Here, the evidence of Jones\u2019 brandishing the weapon is \u201coverwhelming and uncontroverted\u201d as stated in the government\u2019s summary of the offense, to which he agreed. With respect to the 204-month sentence he received on Count 6, Jones\u2019 challenge to the application of \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(ii) to a second \u00a7 924(c) count that arises out of the same criminal proceedings as the first \u00a7 924(c) count is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Deal v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 129, 132-34, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Jones also challenges the district court\u2019s jurisdiction on the grounds that the banks were organized and operated under state law only, that the federal bank robbery statute exceeds Congress\u2019 commerce clause power, and, in any event, is preempted by the state robbery statute. We find all of these claims meritless. First, Jones stipulated at the plea hearing that the banks were federally insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Second, similar challenges to Congress\u2019 authority to enact \u00a7 2113 have failed. <em>See United States v. Wicks, </em>132 F.3d 383, 390 (7th Cir.1997) (noting that any argument which claims that \u00a7 2113 exceeds Congress\u2019 powers under the Commerce Clause would be untenable); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>108 F.3d 1107, 1109 (9th Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Finally, Jones claims that his attorney was ineffective for failing to raise all of these objections at trial or at sentencing. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally are not cognizable on direct appeal, except where the record conclusively shows ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Instead, to allow for adequate development of the record, a defendant generally must bring his ineffective assistance claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001). <em>Id.; United States v. Hoyle, </em>33 F.3d 415, 418 (4th Cir.1994). Because the record here does not conclusively establish ineffective assistance, these claims are not cognizable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and find no reversible error. We therefore affirm the judgment. We also deny Jones\u2019 motion and supplements to place his appeal in abeyance pending receipt of a transcript and to appoint new counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
