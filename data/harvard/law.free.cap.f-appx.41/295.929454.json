Flores-Venegas offered four grounds to justify a downward departure: 1) his juvenile status at the time of the underlying aggravated felony; 2) his cultural assimilation; 3) his agreement not to contest the Government\u2019s effort to have him deported again; and 4) a combination of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">It is well-settled that \u201ccourts of appeals cannot exercise jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to depart from the sentencing guidelines except in the very rare circumstance that the district court states that it does not have any authority to depart from the sentencing guideline range for the entire class of circumstances proffered by the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 887 (10th Cir.1998); <em>see also United States v. Fortier, </em>180 F.3d 1217, 1231 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that this \u201crule has been stated countless times\u201d). \u201cThis exception does not apply when a sentencing court concludes under the defendant\u2019s particular circumstances that it does not have the authority to depart.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>140 F.3d at 887 (emphasis omitted). Crucially, this court must \u201ctreat ambiguous statements made by district judges as though the judge was aware of his or her legal authority to depart but chose instead, in an exercise of discretion, not to depart.\u201d <em>Fortier, </em>180 F.3d at 1231. \u201cAccordingly, unless the judge\u2019s language unambiguously states the judge does not believe he has authority to downward depart, we will not review his decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">Flores-Venegas argues that, in this case, \u201cthe sentencing court\u2019s statements regarding its authority demonstrate that it believed it did not have the discretion to consider the factors put forth by Mr. Flores-Venegas, either individually or together.\u201d (App\u2019t Br. at 9.) The statements focused on by Flores-Venegas occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>during the following exchange at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">Defendant. Coun.: I believe my reasoning is set out in my motion [for a downward departure].... He\u2019s reentry of a deported alien. He\u2019s going to be deported as a result of this and go back to Mexico. The problem is he doesn\u2019t even speak much Spanish. He\u2019s going to be going back to Mexico where he has no family. Everyone\u2019s here. They\u2019re in the courtroom for him. He has his family here, his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">This was all a result of a charge when he was a juvenile, though he was sentenced as an adult. It even has a juvenile number, his conviction. He\u2019s not the typical defendant that stands before this Court on a reentry. He is different. He\u2019s been suffering because he has nowhere to go there. What we expect from him I do not know. He was sent there after serving this offense that he was convicted of at age 17, no family there. He came back to his family. He\u2019s done wrong. He knows he\u2019s done wrong, and he readily admitted his error .... Your Honor, for these reasons we believe that the \u2014 that he does not fit the typical defendant and that a downward departure would be warranted in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">Court: Well, I don\u2019t think he fits the typical defendant. He certainly fits the same role as many of the defendants that we see, where they basically spent their life in the United States, but then they\u2019re going to be deported. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 your story is not the first one that I have heard. What you\u2019re talking about is a Congressional action, not judicial action. Your motion for downward departure will be denied....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">Court:____You\u2019re caught on the horns of a dilemma. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have any idea what to tell you, because, as I say, it\u2019s a legislative matter, not a judicial matter at this stage of the game. You\u2019ll be remanded to the custody of the United States Marshals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adq\">(Tr. 2-5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">A defendant\u2019s extensive ties to the United States have been recognized as a potential ground for departure where he is convicted of illegal reentry, but only under \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Lipman, </em>138 F.3d 726, 730 (9th Cir.1998). Admittedly, the court\u2019s rejection of the departure request, coupled with its statement that Flores-Venegas does not \u201cfit[] the typical defendant\u201d would seem to suggest that the court thought it lacked authority even to depart under unusual circumstances. However, the court followed that statement by asserting that Flores-Venegas\u2019s circumstances are not unusual, as \u201cmany of the defendants that we see ... spent their life in the United States.\u201d (Tr. 3.) These subsequent statements suggest that the district court did not find that Flores-Venegas presented a sufficiently extraordinary case to justify a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The court\u2019s references to the need for legislative action, rather than judicial action, reasonably could be interpreted as referring to the Commission\u2019s decision not to provide a departure for defendants who illegally reenter the country because they have lived most of their lives in the United States. The Commission\u2019s failure to recognize departure on this ground does not, however, prevent the district court from departing on such a ground under unusual circumstances. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 109, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996) (recognizing that, as long as ground has not been prohibited by Guidelines, departure is permissible if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>case is outside \u201cheartland\u201d of cases governed by particular Guideline). The district court\u2019s statements are, at a minimum, <em>ambiguous </em>evidence that the district court may have realized that it had authority to depart based on Flores-Venegas\u2019s ties to this country, but only under extraordinary circumstances, and concluded that such circumstances were not shown. In this regard, the district court did not unambiguously state that it lacked authority to depart for the entire class of circumstances at issue \u2014 i.e., for all defendants who illegally reentered the country because of their ties to the country \u2014 but only that the facts of Flores-Venegas\u2019s case did not justify such a departure under the Guidelines as currently written.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s rejection of Flores-Venegas\u2019s departure request, and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
