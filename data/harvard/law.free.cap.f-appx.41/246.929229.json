The district court concluded that the petition was not timely and that Mr. Brittain had failed to show circumstances justifying equitable tolling. The court denied Mr. Brittain\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (COA). Mr. Brittain appeals and renews his request for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-19\">When, as here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a [certificate of appeal-ability] should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>see also Gibson v. Klinger, </em>232 F.3d 799, 802 (10th Cir.2000). Both showings must be made and courts are \u201callow[ed] and encouraged] to first resolve procedural issues.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Mr. Brittain\u2019s section 2255 petition is governed by AEDPA, which establishes a one-year limitation period for federal prisoners seeking habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. It is undisputed that although Mr. Brittain\u2019s judgment of conviction became final no later than April 8, 2000, his section 2255 motion was not filed until June 18, 2001, well over one year later. In response to the government\u2019s assertion that his action was not timely, Mr. Brittain, who is allegedly legally blind, contended the limitation period should be equitably tolled because he was hindered in his attempt to file by numerous transfers between prisons after his incarceration and by the fact that none of the institutions to which he was transferred had legal materials for the visually impaired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u201cAEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling but only \u2018in rare and exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson, </em>232 F.3d at 808 (quoting <em>Davis v. Johnson, </em>158 F.3d 806, 811 (5th Cir.1998)). This equitable remedy is only available \u201cwhen an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 <em>F.3d </em>1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1194, 121 S.Ct. 1195, 149 L.Ed.2d 110 (2001). Mr. Brittain has the burden of establishing that equitable tolling should apply. <em>See Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998) (refusing to apply equitable tolling because petitioner \u201cprovided no specificity regarding the alleged lack of access and the steps he took to diligently pursue his federal claims\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The district court ruled that Mr. Brittain\u2019s allegations were insufficient to invoke equitable tolling here. The court concluded that transfers to and from various prisons were not exceptional circumstances and, while inconvenient, did not rise to such a level that they prevented Mr. Brittain from timely filing. The court also concluded that Mr. Brittain\u2019s allegations regarding the inadequacies of the available legal materials for inmates with visual impairments were likewise insufficient. Accordingly, the court declined to exercise its equitable powers to toll the limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">We review a district court\u2019s decision with respect to equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Fisher v. Johnson, </em>174 F.3d 710, 713 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cEquitable tolling, which is to be employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>only sparingly in any event, has been applied in the context of the AEDPA only if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d <em>United States v. Cicero, </em>214 F.3d 199, 203 (D.C.Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotations omitted). \u201cMoreover, a petitioner must diligently pursue his federal habeas claims.... \u201d <em>Gibson, </em>232 F.3d at 808. Mr. Brittain\u2019s allegations, when measured against these standards, are not a sufficient basis for applying equitable tolling. Significantly, he has failed to demonstrate that he diligently pursued his claims. Indeed, he has not alleged that he even attempted to do so during the relevant period. Moreover, he has not explained in what way his prison transfers actually made it impossible for him to file on time, or to describe how the deficiencies in the legal materials available to him were inadequate in view of his visual impairment. <em>See, e.g., Miller, </em>141 F.3d at 978. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to equitably toll the period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Because we hold that there is no debatable issue as to whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling, <em>see Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, we decline to consider whether Mr. Brittain\u2019s petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right. We DENY Mr. Brittain\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-10\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-6\">. Mr. Brittain also contended that AEDPA\u2019s limitation period is an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus when applied to first habeas petitions. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl.2. Although the district court did not address this argument, we have rejected it under circumstances substantially similar to those in this case. See <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">. Mr. Brittain also contends that the one-year period should be tolled during the time he was in state custody following his federal conviction because he was not \"in custody under sentence of a [federal] court\u201d for purposes of filing a section 2255 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. However, section 2255 plainly provides that the one-year period shall run from the date the judgment of conviction becomes final regardless of a petitioner\u2019s custody status. Moreover, Mr. Brittain has failed to demonstrate that his transfers between state and federal custody made it impossible for him to timely file during the time he was in federal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Mr. Brittain also appears to assert a claim for denial of access to the courts on the basis of his allegation that the various prisons at which he was incarcerated did not provide adequate legal materials for the visually impaired. Such a claim is properly brought as a <em>Bivens </em>action rather than as a request for habeas relief under section 2255. Even if we were to construe this claim as a civil rights action under <em>Bivens, </em>however, Mr. Brittain has failed to allege actual injury as required by <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\"an inmate cannot establish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that his prison\u2019s law library or legal assistance program is subpar in some theoretical sense.\u201d). The Court in <em>Lewis </em>made clear that the actual injury requirement applies to all inmates, even those with special needs. <em>See id. </em>at 356, 116 S.Ct. 2174.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
