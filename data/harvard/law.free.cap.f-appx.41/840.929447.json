Cobb asserted that the district court had ordered the fine paid in installments of unspecified amounts through the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP), 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 545.10-11, and thus \u201cdelegated\u201d to the Bureau of Prisons the authority to determine the amount of the payments. Cobb asked that the court set a payment schedule or, in the alternative, remit the remainder of the fine based on Cobb\u2019s indigence. The district court denied the motion without explanation, and Cobb appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-21\">Contrary to Cobb\u2019s assertions, nothing in the record suggests that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>ordered to pay his fine in installments\u2014 through the IFRP or otherwise. Rather, the judgment reflects that Cobb was fined $1500 due \u201cin full immediately.\u201d Sentencing courts must decide the amount of fines and restitution the defendant owes and the extent to which payment may be deferred; neither determination may be delegated to another entity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Pandiello, </em>184 F.3d 682, 688 (7th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Ahmad, </em>2 F.3d 245, 248-49 (7th Cir.1993). Cobb\u2019s judgment does both, because it specifies both the amount ($1500) and when it must be paid (\u201cimmediately\u201d). The absence of a court-prescribed \u201cpayment schedule\u201d from a judgment does not necessarily present a delegation problem, because such schedules are required only when the judgment explicitly permits the defendant to pay the fine in installments. <em>See McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1999) (no payment schedule required where fine ordered due in full immediately); <em>Pandiello, </em>184 F.3d at 688 (order to pay restitution in \u201cequal monthly installments\u201d through IFRP was improper delegation because court failed to specify \u201chow much must be paid monthly\u201d); <em>United States v. Sung, </em>51 F.3d 92, 94 (7th Cir.1995) (\u201cwhen a court <em>permits </em>the defendant to make restitution by installments, the judge must specify the schedule\u201d) (emphasis added). Cobb\u2019s unilateral decision to <em>pay </em>his fine in installments did not transform his judgment to one that <em>permits </em>installment payments, and thus did not require the court to set a \u201cpayment schedule.\u201d <em>See McGhee, </em>166 F.3d at 886 (defendant\u2019s payment of fine in installments under IFRP did not require court to establish payment schedule because fine had been ordered due in full immediately); <em>Ahmad, </em>2 F.3d at 249 (in criminal restitution as in civil judgments, debtors might pay incrementally \u201ceven though the court has not said a word about installments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Because Cobb\u2019s fine was due in a lump sum, he has no basis for seeking remission. A former version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573 that allowed defendants to petition for remission is no longer in effect, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Kadonsky, </em>242 F.3d 516, 520 (3d Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Linker, </em>920 F.2d 1 (7th Cir.1990), and though a statutory provision governing <em>restitution </em>orders permits \u201cadjustment\u201d of \u201cpayment schedules\u201d based on a \u201cmaterial change in the defendant\u2019s economic circumstances,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k), the parallel provision concerning fines allows adjustments only where the original judgment \u201cpermits payments in installments,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d)(3). Current federal law simply provides defendants in Cobb\u2019s position no opportunity to seek reduction of a fine. <em>See Kadonsky, </em>242 F.3d at 520; <em>Linker, </em>920 F.2d at 1-2. Cobb\u2019s only hope for modification or remission of his fine is a petition filed by the government under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3573 (court may remit fine or defer payments in the interest of justice \u201cupon petition of the government\u201d). Because the government did not file a petition in Cobb\u2019s case, his motion was properly denied. <em>See Linker, </em>920 F.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
