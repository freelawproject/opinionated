Parish\u2019s $467 tax refund was improperly intercepted by the State of California after the County failed to update its computer system to reflect that Parish no longer had a child support arrearage, and Parish claims that the County is liable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The State returned Parish\u2019s tax refund to him after about three months, and the district court awarded Parish statutory interest. In reviewing a judgment following a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <em>Tonry v. Security Experts, Inc., </em>20 F.3d 967, 970 (9th Cir.1994). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Parish contends that the County violated his procedural due process rights. He argues that the tax intercept took place under established state procedure, and thus a pre-deprivation hearing was required pursuant to <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 436, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982). We disagree. Contrary to Parish\u2019s assertions, two predeprivation hearings took place. At the first hearing, the court determined that Parish owed $69,000 in back child support, and at the second hearing, the court entered an order pursuant to a settlement agreement that vacated the arrearage and stated that as of November 30, 1998, Parish owed \u201czero\u201d in delinquent child support payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Parish claims that the County\u2019s failure to enter the results of the second hearing into the computer resulted in a deprivation of his due process rights. However, we agree with the district court that the County\u2019s failure to enter that information into its computer system constitutes, at most, negligence, which does not give rise to a due process claim. <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 333, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Nor is negligence sufficient to state a substantive due process claim. <em>Davidson v. Cannon, </em>474 U.S. 344, 348, 106 S.Ct. 668, 88 L.Ed.2d 677 (1986) (\u201cthe protections of the Due Process Clause, whether procedural or substantive, are just not triggered by lack of due care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Parish relies on <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 543, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), for the proposition that his due process rights were violated because he did not have an opportunity for judicial review of the deprivation. We agree with the district court, however, that the Department of Social Services\u2019 administrative review procedures provided Parish an adequate opportunity to be heard both before and after the tax intercept.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Moreover, the County asserts that it may not be held liable under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t. of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), because the tax intercept did not take place pursuant to a governmental customs or policies, but in spite of them. We agree. This is not a case where the County has been deliberately indifferent. <em>See City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). Instead, an error took place that was in violation of the County\u2019s customs and procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b952-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
