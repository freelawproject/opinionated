United States, </em>No. CV 98-4782, slip op. (E.D.N.Y. July 20, 2001). The Andersen family was detained at their home by FBI agents executing an arrest warrant for Ray Luzio, Tammy Andersen\u2019s brother, at their address. The Andersens contend that their continued detention for thirty minutes after the FBI agents determined that Keith Andersen was not Ray Luzio, constituted false imprisonment pursuant to New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-19\">The District Court found that the FBI agents detained the family to prevent family members from alerting Luzio \u2014 who the agents believed was armed and dangerous \u2014 while other agents traveled a short distance to another home where they believed they would find Luzio. In addition, the District Court determined that the detention was \u201ca reasonable and necessary part of the lawful attempt to arrest Ray Luzio.\u201d <em>Andersen, </em>at 26. We agree. Notably, a van used in the commission of the crime for which the warrant to arrest Luzio was issued was parked in the driveway of the Andersen\u2019s home, and both Tammy Andersen and Keith Andersen refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>provide any information concerning the whereabouts of Luzio. Given these unique circumstances \u2014 namely, the relatively high likelihood that plaintiffs would warn a possibly dangerous person of impending arrest, coupled with the relatively brief period of additional detention involved \u2014 the Government established that the agent\u2019s actions \u201cwere justified by law,\u201d <em>see Caban v. United States, </em>728 F.2d 68, 72 (2d Cir.1984). <em>Cf. Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 699, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981) (\u201c[Sjome seizures admittedly covered by the Fourth Amendment constitute such limited intrusions on the personal security of those detained and are justified by such substantial law enforcement interests that they may be made on less than probable cause, so long as police have an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
