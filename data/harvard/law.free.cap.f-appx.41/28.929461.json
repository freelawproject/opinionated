The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> gave Moreno-Torres a two-level obstruction-of-justice increase for attempting to bribe a witness and sentenced him to 97 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, Moreno-Torres contends the district court improperly applied the obstruction-of-justice increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-22\">We conclude the district court did not commit error. <em>See United States v. Simms, </em>285 F.3d 1098, 1100 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review). The undisputed testimony at sentencing-that Moreno-Torres offered a witness money in exchange for perjured testimony-was sufficient to warrant application of the increase. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 comment, (n.4) (2001); <em>United States v. Pompey, </em>121 F.3d 381, 382 (8th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1133, 118 S.Ct. 1088, 140 L.Ed.2d 145 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-23\">We thus affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b56-25\">The Honorable Richard G.
