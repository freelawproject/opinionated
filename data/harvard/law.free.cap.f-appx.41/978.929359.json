Garcia-Vasquez entered the United States illegally on January 1, 1990 near San Ysidro, California. On November 19, 1999, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served him with a notice to appear in removal proceedings. On June 1, 2000, Garcia-Vasquez filed his application for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1), but the immigration judge rejected his application for cancellation of removal, finding Garcia-Vasquez statutorily ineligible because the service of the notice to appear ended his continuous physical presence in the United States under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) before ten years had passed since his entry. The Board affirmed. Garcia-Vasquez now argues that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A) directly conflicts with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-19\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The Board\u2019s interpretation and application of immigration laws is reviewed de novo. <em>Andreiu v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.3d 477, 482 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). The Board found no conflict between the two provisions nor any ambiguity in the wording of the statute. The Board\u2019s construction of the statute\u2019s provisions is permissible and therefore accorded deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number><em>sources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Garcia-Vasquez did not accrue ten years of continuous physical presence before he was served the notice to appear and was therefore statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. This conclusion is required by the wording of the statute. <em>Ram v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, </em>243 F.3d 510, 518 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cCongress did not intend for aliens to circumvent the stop-time rule by accruing the requisite years of continuous physical presence in the United States after deportation proceedings commence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">The petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aq7i\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
