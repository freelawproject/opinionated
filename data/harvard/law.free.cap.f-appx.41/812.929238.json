This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">In 1996, Dodd pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, an unspecified quantity of heroin, and an unspecified quantity of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Dodd was sentenced to serve 324 months of imprisonment plus five years of supervised release. Dodd did not appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">On February 24, 2000, Dodd filed a motion for a writ of error coram nobis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, which was denied by the district court. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Dodd\u2019s motion. On November 3, 2000, Dodd filed a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), which was also denied by the district court. On January 17, 2001, Dodd filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was dismissed by the district court on March 13, 2001. Dodd appealed the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, but filed a motion to dismiss that appeal before it was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, Dodd alleged that his indictment was defective because it did not contain the drug quantity as an element of the offense for which he was charged, as required by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Dodd also alleged that, in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>his sentence must be vacated because it exceeds the statutory maximum penalty for the offense to which he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The district court dismissed Dodd\u2019s habeas corpus petition and subsequently denied his motion to alter or amend the judgment. Dodd has filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">We review de novo the dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). Such review indicates that the district court properly dismissed Dodd\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 provides that a federal prisoner may bring a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district in which he is incarcerated. If a federal prisoner seeks to challenge the execution of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court having jurisdiction over his custodian. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. If a federal prisoner seeks to challenge the imposition of his sentence, he must file a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the sentence in the district court in which he was sentenced. Pete<em>rman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. Dodd\u2019s petition challenges the imposition of his sentence, not the execution or manner in which his sentence is being served, as he takes issue with the amount of drugs that were attributed to him by the district court when imposing his sentence. Thus, \u00a7 2255, not \u00a7 2241, is the proper vehicle by which to challenge the imposition of Dodd\u2019s sentence. <em>See Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Nevertheless, Dodd may be entitled to review of his claims under \u00a7 2241 if he is able to establish that \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Dodd has not shown that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the district court properly dismissed Dodd\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition because Dodd sought to challenge the imposition of his sentence, but failed to establish that the remedy afforded him under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757-58. Dodd\u2019s arguments on appeal do not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
