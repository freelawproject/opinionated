We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>(1) The district court did not err when it excluded evidence that another person had committed a robbery of a letter carrier at an earlier time. It is true that a defendant may put on evidence that another person committed the crime with which the defendant is charged. <em>See Thomas v. Hubbard, </em>273 F.3d 1164, 1177 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>75 F.3d 1343, 1347 (9th Cir.1996). That, however, does not mean that a defendant can put on evidence that someone else committed other crimes which share no particularly distinctive characteristics with the crime in question. <em>See United States v. Spencer, </em>1 F.3d 742, 744-45 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>937 F.2d 1397, 1400-01 (9th Cir.1991). But that is all that the district court excluded here. The district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>See Perkins, </em>937 F.2d at 1400.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">(2) We will assume that the district court erred when it admitted evidence that Wilson had a pipe that he used to smoke crack cocaine. <em>See United States v. Labansat, </em>94 F.3d 527, 530-31 (9th Cir.1996). However, in light of the other powerful evidence against Wilson, including his own admission, any such error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Beckman, </em>291 F.3d 586, 590-92 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>176 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">(3) We lack jurisdiction to consider Wilson\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion when it declined to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Duran-Orozco, </em>192 F.3d 1277, 1283 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Morales, </em>898 F.2d 99, 101-03 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">AFFIRMED as to the conviction; DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction as to the sentencing issue.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b963-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
