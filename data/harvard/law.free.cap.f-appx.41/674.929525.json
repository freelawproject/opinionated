Caldwell appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendant Duke Energy Corporation and dismissing her employment discrimination action alleging violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634 (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2001). Our review of the record and the district court\u2019s opinion discloses that this appeal is without merit. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Caldwell established a prima facie case of employment discrimination, <em>O\u2019Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp., </em>517 U.S. 308, 310-11, 116 S.Ct. 1307, 134 L.Ed.2d 433 (1996); <em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Alvarado v. Board of Trustees, </em>928 F.2d 118, 121 (4th Cir.1991), we agree with the district court that Caldwell failed to rebut the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons Duke Energy Corporation proffered to support its decision to terminate her. <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254-56, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Conkwright v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>933 F.2d 231, 234-35 (4th Cir.1991). Specifically, the evidence demonstrated that in violation of her employer\u2019s policies, Caldwell, a customer service specialist, intentionally disconnected calls from customers and failed to properly designate a telephone call concerning a fire as a priority call. Caldwell\u2019s self-serving, unsubstantiated statements in opposition to the employer\u2019s evidence in this regard is insufficient to stave off summary judgment. <em>Williams v. Cerberonics, Inc., </em>871 F.2d 452, 455 (4th Cir.1989). Accordingly, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding of non-discrimination was clearly erroneous. <em>Anderson v. City of Bessem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>er, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Duke Energy Corporation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
