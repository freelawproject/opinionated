Gonzalez claims that his plea was not \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d because \u201cthere was no allocution of factual guilt of the count of the indictment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. Specifically, Gonzalez claims that he did not alloeute to an agreement to steal a pneumatic ratchet wrench, as charged in the indictment, nor did he alloeute to any knowledge of \u2014 or intent to have \u2014 an effect on interstate commerce. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment, to which Gonzalez pled guilty, charged that he and others \u201cconspired to rob a car dealership and adjacent living quarters in the Bronx, New York, and stole, among other things, a pneumatic ratchet wrench belonging to that dealership, and did thereby obstruct, delay, and affect [interstate] commerce.\u201d As that language makes clear, Gonzalez was <em>not </em>charged with conspiring to steal a ratchet wrench, but rather, with a conspiracy to rob generally, which robbery resulted in the theft of a wrench. Accordingly, the Government did not have to prove that Gonzalez agreed to steal a specific item, such as the wrench, and it was not necessary for him to alloeute to such an agreement for the District Court to accept his plea. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Heimann, </em>705 F.2d 662, 666 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cBecause proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica of the charges contained in the indictment, this court has consistently permitted significant flexibility in proof, provided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>accord United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number><em>States v. Frank, </em>156 F.3d 332, 337 (2d Cir.1998) <em>(quoting Heimann).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Nor was it necessary for the Government to prove that Gonzalez had the specific intent to affect commerce. Rather, it needed only prove that Gonzalez conspired to perform acts that would have that natural effect. <em>See United States v. Arena, </em>180 F.3d 380, 390 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">At the plea proceeding, Gonzalez told the Court that he agreed \u201cto help\u201d three men to take \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cdrugs\u201d from \u201cthe owner of the store\u201d' \u2014 \u201can auto shop\u201d \u2014 \u201cby force.\u201d Tr. of Plea Proceeding at 17-19. This allocution was sufficient to provide a factual basis for Gonzalez\u2019s plea. <em>See United States v. Calder, </em>641 F.2d 76, 78 (2d Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Augello, </em>451 F.2d 1167, 1169-70 (2d Cir.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">To the extent Gonzalez argues that the District Court failed to insure that Gonzalez knew \u201cthe nature of the charge to which the plea [was] offered,\u201d his right to representation, his right to plead not guilty, or the possible consequences of his plea, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c), or that the District Court failed to insure that the plea was voluntary, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d), we reject his arguments. We have reviewed the transcript of the plea proceeding and find no error by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
