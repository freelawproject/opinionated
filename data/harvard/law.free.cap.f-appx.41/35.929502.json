Atondo-Santos entered a guilty plea to both counts, and the district court sentenced him to 66 months in prison. The United States appeals the sentence, assigning error to the district court\u2019s decision to depart downward for aberrant behavior. The district coxxrt did not specify how many levels it departed downward. However, according to the Presentence Report, Atondo-Santos had a total offense level of 31 and criminal history category of one, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>combination for which the Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide a sentencing range of 108 to 135 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">A district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sablan, </em>114 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (citing <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Guidelines ... will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.\u201d <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 98 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The government argues that Atondo-Santos\u2019 criminal conduct does not satisfy the definition of aberrant behavior set forth in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines: \u201ca single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was of limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding-abiding life.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 5K2.20, cmt. n. 1 (2000). The government claims that Atondo-Santos, by his own admission, did not lead an otherwise law-abiding life. Atondo-Santos admitted that he had smuggled a load of marijuana into the United States within two weeks of the instant offense, and that he sold drugs to support his cocaine addiction. At the sentencing hearing, AtondoSantos\u2019 attorney stated that although his Ghent\u2019s criminal conduct was \u201cnot a technical aberrancy,\u201d it was \u201cout of the norm\u201d of his client\u2019s life. When the district court sentenced Atondo-Santos, instead of explaining the basis for the departure and the extent of the departure, it merely stated the following: \u201cThe number I\u2019ve picked for you in terms of how much time you have to serve is ... 66 months in custody. That\u2019s over five years. That\u2019s about four years less than the guidelines recommend. So you\u2019ve gotten significant benefit. Over the objection of [the government], I\u2019m finding aberrant behavior to allow me to depart downward to that number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">A district court is required to articulate the reasons for its decision to depart and for the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Working, </em>224 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) \u201cThe requirement that the district court explain its reasons for assigning a departure ... is indispensable to furthering the fundamental goal of the Sentencing Reform Act, which is to place federal sentencing on an objective, uniform, and rational (or at least articulable, nonintuitive) basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The district court gave no explanation for its decision to grant a departure for aberrant conduct, an omission that is particularly glaring in light of the evidence that Atondo-Santos\u2019s conduct was not aberrant. In fact, it appears that the district court first decided upon a sentence of 66 months, and only then found \u201caberrant behavior to allow [it] to depart downward to that number.\u201d We cannot uphold a decision to depart from a minimum prison term of 108 months down to an actual sentence of 66 months when the district court articulates no reason for the departure and the defendant himself admits to recent drug smuggling and dealing. Because the record does not provide an adequate explanation for the fact and extent of the departure, we</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">REVERSE AND REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b63-26\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
