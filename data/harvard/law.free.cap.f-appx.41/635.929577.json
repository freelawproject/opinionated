Mandamus is a drastic remedy only to be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826-27 (4th Cir.1987). Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought and there are no other adequate means for obtaining the requested relief. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980); <em>Beard, </em>811 F.2d at 826. Jackson has failed to make the requisite showing for such extraordinary relief. Our review of the district court docket sheet discloses that there has been no undue delay in Jackson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-21\">We grant Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We deny Jackson\u2019s petition for mandamus relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
