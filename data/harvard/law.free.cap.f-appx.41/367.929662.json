R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Johnny Todd Allen appeals from a 200 month drug trafficking sentence imposed by the district court following a remand by this court for resentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Allen was originally charged in a multicount indictment with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, marijuana, and cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. While the individual counts did not specify a drug quantity, the \u201cMANNER AND MEANS\u201d section of the indictment stated that Allen and his coconspirators \u201cpossessed with intent to distribute, and distributed, in excess of one-half kilogram of methamphetamine, one kilogram of cocaine, and hundreds of pounds of marijuana.\u201d Indictment at 5, R. Vol. 1, Doc 26. Allen was convicted and sentenced to 268 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Following Allen\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court issued <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in which it held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. We subsequently held in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 1231 (10th Cir.2000) that, in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 drug prosecutions, the quantity of drugs is an essential element of the crime which must be specified in the indictment and found beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury in order to sentence a defendant under section 841(b)(1)(A) or (B). <em>Id. </em>at 1236. Further, if the indictment does not charge a specific quantity of drugs and the jury does not find that quantity, the defendant can only be sentenced to a maximum of twenty years pursuant to section 841(b)(1)(C), the penalty provision applicable to general possession of an unspecified quantity of drugs. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Citing <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Jones, </em>Allen appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing a single issue: whether his conviction and sentence were valid where the indictment failed to include drug quantities and the issue of drug quantity was not submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. This court affirmed Allen\u2019s conviction, but remanded the case \u201cwith directions to vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and to resentence him within the statutory range authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>No. 00-8054, 2001 WL 578502 at *2, 9 Fed.Appx. 936 (10th Cir. May 30, 2001). As indicated, section 841(b)(1)(C) is the statute applicable to a conviction for possession of an unspecified quantity of drugs. On remand, the district court sentenced Allen to 200 months, a term within the range authorized by section 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Allen appeals again, raising a single new issue: whether his sentence imposed on remand is invalid because, although he was indicted for a conspiracy involving methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana, the jury\u2019s general verdict did not specify which controlled substance supported its verdict of guilty. He asserts, therefore, that he should have been sentenced only for his involvement with an unspecified quantity of the substance carrying the least severe statutory maximum \u2014 in this case, marijuana, which, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), carries a statutory maximum of five years. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">\u201cOrdinarily, we will not review in a second direct appeal an issue that underlies a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>previously affirmed conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Gama-Bastidas, </em>222 F.3d 779, 784 (10th Cir.2000). Two other \u201crelated principles\u201d inform that general rule: \u201cFirst, \u2018[u]nder the law of the case doctrine, findings made at one point during litigation become law of the case for subsequent stages of that same litigation.\u2019 Second, under the mandate rule, the district court should act in conformity with the appellate court\u2019s mandate.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Webb, </em>98 F.3d 585, 587 (10th Cir.1996) <em>(\u201cWebb II\")); see also Ute Indian Tribe v. Utah, </em>114 F.3d 1513, 1520-21 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cAn important corollary of the [law of the case] doctrine, known as the \u2018mandate rule,\u2019 provides that a district court \u2018must comply strictly with the mandate rendered by the reviewing court.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of Am., </em>962 F.2d 1528, 1534 (10th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Our \u201cmandate rule\u201d is not jurisdictional, and there are exceptions to its application. Thus, \u201ca district court may deviate from the mandate \u2018under exceptional circumstances, including (1) a dramatic change in controlling legal authority; (2) significant new evidence that was not earlier obtainable through due diligence but has since come to light; or (3) if blatant error from the prior ... decision would result in serious injustice if uncorrected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Huffman v. Saul Holdings Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>262 F.3d 1128, 1133 (10th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Webb II, </em>98 F.3d at 587). Accordingly, while sentencing on remand is normally conducted de novo, the mandate rule prohibits such de novo sentencing \u201cwhere an appellate court has specifically limited a district court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Webb II, </em>98 F.3d at 587. The interpretation of the mandate is a legal issue which we review de novo. <em>Mason v. Texaco, Inc., </em>948 F.2d 1546, 1550 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In this case, our court specifically limited the district court\u2019s discretion when it remanded the case \u201cwith directions to vacate defendant\u2019s sentence <em>and to resentence him within the statutory range authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).\u201d Allen, </em>2001 WL 578502 at *2 (emphasis added). In <em>United States v. Webb, </em>49 F.3d 636 (10th Cir.1995) <em>(Webb I), </em>the government appealed the district court\u2019s departure downward from a guideline sentence for the defendant\u2019s conviction for, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of marijuana. Finding the district court\u2019s downward departure erroneous, a panel of this court remanded the case \u201cfor resentencing within the prescribed range of twenty-seven to thirty-three months imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640. On remand, the defendant was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment. The defendant then appealed his sentence, arguing the district court erred in believing it lacked the discretion to depart downward again on remand. Another panel of this court affirmed, concluding that the district court correctly resentenced the defendant in accordance with the mandate of <em>Webb I. </em>As the court observed in <em>Webb II, </em>\u201cthe mandate in <em>Webb I </em>directed the district court to do one thing on remand \u2014 impose a sentence within the 27- to 33-month range.\u201d <em>Webb II, </em>98 F.3d at 588. Accordingly, we held in <em>Webb II </em>that the mandate rule had properly prohibited the district court on remand from departing from that 27- to 33-month range.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Similarly, in this case, our court\u2019s mandate instructed the district court to do one thing on remand \u2014 sentence Allen under section 841(b)(1)(C). That is precisely what the district court did. The mandate rule correctly prohibited the district court from sentencing Allen under a different statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Additionally, Allen never challenged the jury\u2019s general verdict in his first appeal, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>asserted that his sentence should be controlled by section 841(b)(1)(D). Indeed, in his brief in his first appeal to this court, he conceded that he had been \u201cconvicted of an offense carrying a statutory maximum of 20 years.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. in No. 00-8054 at 24, Attachment 1 to Addendum to Appellee\u2019s Br. at 30. In that first appeal, Allen sought either to have his conviction vacated or, alternatively, argued that \u201cthe case should be remanded for resentencing and the sentence limited to the maximum of 20 years imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, Addendum to Appellee\u2019s Br. at 31. Accordingly, when this court remanded his case for resentencing under section 841(b)(1)(C), which provides for a twenty year maximum, Allen received precisely the relief he had affirmatively sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Allen\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
