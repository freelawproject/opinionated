In 1996, her depression was diagnosed by her treating psychiatrist as stemming from an adjust-, ment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood and post traumatic stress disorder, chronic, delayed onset. In 1997, the pain in her joints was diagnosed as resulting from fibromyalgia \u2014 a connective tissue disorder of chronic, severe pain and chronic fatigue. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) rejected Bohland\u2019s claim for disability benefits because he found credible neither Bohland\u2019s nor her physicians\u2019 testimony about the severity of her symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-23\">In order to reject the uncontradicted conclusions of a treating physician, and of a claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of symptoms from medically diagnosed medical conditions, the ALJ must provide clear and convincing reasons^-the highest standard of justification in Social Security cases. <em>Moore v. Comm\u2019r of SSA, </em>278 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995). The ALJ did not meet this standard. The testimony of Bohland and her physician support each other and are supported by the medical records in the file. The ALJ\u2019s characterization of Bohland\u2019s testimony as supporting a conclusion that she was able independently to perform many activities of daily living is. not supported by the transcript of the hearing. Even if the ALJ\u2019s eharacteriz\u00e1tion of Bohland\u2019s testimony was accurate, it does not show that Bohland was \u201cable to spend a <em>substantial part </em>of [her] day engaged in pursuits involving the performance of physical functions that are-transferable to a work setting.\u201d <em>Vertigan, </em>260 F.3d at 1049 (emphasis in original). \u201cOne. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>does not need to be \u2018utterly incapacitated\u2019 in order to be disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Under step three of the five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled, see 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)-(f), an award of benefits is required if the claimant has an impairment which is listed in Appendix I that meets the duration requirement for award of benefits. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). The ALJ found that Dr. Small\u2019s conclusions about the severity of Bohland\u2019s emotional impairment, \u201cif supported by the record, would satisfy the criteria of listings 12.04 [affective disorders] and 12.06 [anxiety-related disorders].\u201d At step five of the process, the Social Security Administration has the burden of showing that the claimant can perform other work available in substantial numbers in the national economy. The ALJ found that Bohland\u2019s testimony, if credited, established that she could not perform any job in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Because (1) the ALJ failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting the testimony of Bohland and her physician, (2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made, and (3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited, we remand for determination of benefits. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1292 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b957-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for \"publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
