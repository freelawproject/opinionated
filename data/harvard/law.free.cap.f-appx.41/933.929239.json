He contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence found pursuant to a search incident to arrest. He also argues that the district court erred in refusing to grant a two point downward adjustment for minor participation in the drug scheme under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We affirm Manzo-Maldonado\u2019s conviction, but because the district court erred in applying \u00a7 3B 1.2(b), we vacate Manzo-Maldonado\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, we discuss only those necessary to our determination. We review de novo whether the district court erred in denying Manzo-Maldonado\u2019s motion to suppress the $15,790 recovered from him during his arrest as the fruit of an illegal search. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). We also review de novo whether the district court erred in failing to grant a two-level downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on Manzo-Maldonado\u2019s \u201cminor participant\u201d status. <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">A. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Manzo-Maldonado argues that the district court should have suppressed evidence of the $15,790 because the law enforcement officers lacked probable cause to arrest him without a warrant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Information from an informant may establish probable cause in situations in which that evidence is corroborated by police observation or investigation, <em>see Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 241-45, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), and in which we can presume that the informant is trustworthy because he has been trustworthy before, <em>see United States v. Angulo-Lopez, </em>791 F.2d 1394, 1397 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>761 F.2d 1294, 1300 (9th Cir.1985). Here, the police independently confirmed that a person matching their Cl\u2019s description of Manzo-Maldonado was standing at the location where the Cl told police that he would be. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 242-43, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (discussing <em>Draper v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959)). In addition, the Cl had been working with the police for months and had provided only reliable information up until that point. This was sufficient to establish probable cause, based on the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 238,103 S.Ct. 2317, even without considering the fact that the detective later verified that the Cl\u2019s phone number had been the last number called from Manzo-Maldonado\u2019s phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">B. Downward Adjustment for Minor Role</p>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">Manzo-Maldonado also contends that the district court applied the wrong standard in determining whether he qualified for a downward departure as a \u201cminor participant\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Although the district court did find that Manzo-Maldonado had a \u201csupervisory role,\u201d relative to his two co-defendants, it is not clear from the record that the court considered his role in the entire criminal scheme, as it was required to do under <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>we held that the district court must evaluate a defendant\u2019s role in the criminal scheme \u201crelative to all participants,\u201d not just the ones before the court, 234 F.3d at 472. We therefore vacate and remand the case for resentencing in accordance with <em>Rojas-Millan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b956-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
