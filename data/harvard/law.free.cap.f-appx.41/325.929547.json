R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">Plaintiff James B. White, a state prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. We exercise jurisdiction pm\u2019suant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-24\">White filed a \u00a7 1983 complaint alleging <em>the </em>State of Utah violated his constitutional rights and those of \u201chis community through the prosecution of [an individual named] Tom Green\u201d for bigamy, in violation of Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-7-101. ROA, Doc. 3 at 2. The complaint in part sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>one hundred million dollars in damages and a declaration that \u00a7 76-7-101 unconstitutionally infringed on \u201cAmericans!\u2019] constitutional right to worship freely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The State moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that (1) the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; (2) the State was entitled to immunity from suit under the Eleventh Amendment; and (3) White lacked standing to sue. White initially responded to the motion by filing two proposed amendments to his complaint in which he sought to add several defendants, including the Utah Supreme Court, the Third District Court of Utah, the Juab County Attorney, the United States, Senator Orrin Hatch, and various unnamed scientists involved in stem cell research. The amendments also sought to add a claim for injunctive relief prohibiting stem cell research, and sought to increase the request for damages to one billion and one hundred thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">White also filed two formal responses to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss. In his first response, White construed the state\u2019s motion as asserting that White had \u201cfailed to provide legal codes upon which relief could be granted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Doc. 15 at 1. White alleged he was unable \u201cto provide law codes to prove his case\u201d because he was incarcerated \u201cwithout any access to any law books whatsoever.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. In his second response, White asserted he had standing to sue the State because \u201chis wife left him as a direct cause of the [State\u2019s] actions and then she committed Adultery with someone else of which this ... directly caused his life to be damaged.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Doc. 21 at 9. He further asserted that he \u201cha[d] been a member of or [wa]s currently a member of a religion that espouses polygamy,\u201d and he \u201cintended to become a polygamist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The district court denied White\u2019s claims and dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The district court concluded that White lacked standing to assert his attack on the practice of stem cell research. We agree. The constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d-an invasion of a legally protected interest which is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent.\u201d Second, a causal connection must exist between the injury and the conduct challenged. Third, it must be likely that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). White\u2019s conclusory pleadings fail to establish any of these required elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">We turn to White\u2019s claim challenging the constitutionality of Utah\u2019s prohibition against polygamy. Assuming, for purposes of argument, that White has standing to bring the claim, we conclude it is foreclosed by Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent. <em>See Reynolds v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 166-67, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878) (affirming criminal conviction of a Mormon for practicing polygamy and rejecting the argument that prohibition of polygamy violated the right to free exercise of religion); <em>Potter v. Murray City, </em>760 F.2d 1065, 1068-69 (10th Cir.1985) (concluding Utah was justified, by a compelling interest, in upholding and enforcing its ban on plural marriage to protect the monogamous marriage relationship); <em>see also Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 68 n. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973) (\u201cStatutes making bigamy a crime surely cut into an individual\u2019s freedom to associate, but few today seriously claim such statutes violate the First Amendment or any other constitutional provision.\u201d). White has failed to state a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Finally, we consider White\u2019s claim that he was denied access to adequate legal materials. The Supreme Court has explained that a plaintiff alleging such a claim must establish not only the inadequacy of legal materials available to him, but also that \u201cthe alleged shortcomings ... hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). In other words, a plaintiff must allege an actual injury. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 116 S.Ct. 2174. White\u2019s pleadings clearly fail in this regal\u2019d. His denial of access claim was raised first in his response to the State\u2019s motion to dismiss and was grounded solely on the erroneous assumption that the State\u2019s motion was prompted by failure to provide sufficient legal citations in his pleadings. In any event, we conclude he has failed to demonstrate any injury in fact arising from his alleged denial of access to legal materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">AFFIRMED. The motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
