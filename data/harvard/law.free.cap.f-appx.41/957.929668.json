We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The district court properly denied Munoz-Ramirez\u2019s motion to dismiss Count 2 of the indictment because the indictment alleged the requisite mens rea, that the defendant falsely and willfully represented himself to be a citizen of the Urnted States. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 911 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Munoz-Ramirez also argues that the district court erred in not suppressing his incriminating statement because the advisements given by the immigration officials were confusing. Neither party disputes that Munoz-Ramirez signed a written waiver of Ms <em>Miranda </em>rights after he was adequately advised. \u201cAn express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979). In this case, the issue is whether a later, separate advisement of rights pertaining to administrative proceedings tainted the <em>Miranda </em>warning and prevented the actual waiver from being knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">After reviewing the district court\u2019s finding that the <em>Miranda </em>waiver was \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d for clear error and reviewing the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of the waiver de novo, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Amano, </em>229 F.3d 801, 803 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Doe, </em>170 F.3d 1162, 1168 (9th Cir.1999). Although Munoz-Ramirez claims his <em>Miranda </em>waiver was not knowing or intelligent, he failed to present any evidence that he was actually confused by the two advisements, or that his waiver was not \u201cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>See Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986). Therefore, the district court\u2019s factual finding that the waiver was knowing and intelligent was not clearly erroneous. Finally, there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that Munoz-Ramirez\u2019s decision to sign the written waiver and make a verbal statement was not the product of a free and deliberate choice and, therefore, voluntary. <em>See United States v. Doe, </em>219 F.3d 1009, 1016 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b979-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
