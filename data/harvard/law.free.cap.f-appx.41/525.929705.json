He was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>96 F.3d 1439 (4th Cir.1996) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-24\">Chambers moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the Eastern District of Virginia (Case No. 97-cv-753), but that motion was denied by the District Court, finding that it was not filed within the time limits set forth by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Stat. 1214 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255), and that at all events, Chambers\u2019 substantive claims were without merit. Chambers filed a notice of appeal from the denial of the \u00a7 2255 motion and a motion for a certificate of appealability; however, the Fourth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed the appeal. <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>173 F.3d 852 (4th Cir.1999) (Table). Chambers\u2019 petition for rehearing was denied and the United States Supreme Court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Chambers is presently an inmate at the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He filed the present habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Chambers challenges his conviction and sentence as being contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The District Court denied Chambers\u2019 petition, holding that the appropriate vehicle to assert an argument that <em>Apprendi </em>applies retroactively is an application to the Fourth Circuit for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 application. Chambers then moved to alter or amend judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) and/or 60(b), relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001). The District Court construed the motion as one for reconsideration and denied the motion, holding that the case law presented by Chambers actually bolstered the Court\u2019s prior holding that it should not entertain Chambers\u2019 Apprendi-based habeas claims. This appeal followed, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The law is clear that to seek federal post-conviction relief from a judgment of conviction, persons convicted in federal court are required to bring them collateral attacks challenging the validity of their conviction and sentence by filing a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, with the court that imposed the conviction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Concomitantly, they may not bring suit against the custodian (usually in another District) under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). Indeed, \u00a7 2255 motions are the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge a conviction or sentence that allegedly is in violation of the Constitution or federal laws or that is otherwise subject to collateral attack. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). The only exception is when \u00a7 2255 proves \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of detention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Davis, </em>417 U.S. at 343; <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Chambers, however is unable to bring himself within the exception to \u00a7 2255. As we explained in <em>Cradle v. United States:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOD\">Section 2255 is not \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d merely because the sentencing court is disinclined to grant relief (either because it finds the claim raised to be without merit or because the one-year statute of limitations has expired), or because a petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">290 F.3d 536, 539 (3d Cir.2002). Thus, the mere fact that Chambers may have missed the AEDPA one-year filing deadline, or run afoul of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 (relating to \u201csecond or successive [habeas] applications\u201d) does not enable him to utilize \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Neither can Chambers bring himself within the rule of <em>Dorsainvil </em>itself. There the defendant sought to challenge his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), after the Supreme Court in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), limited the circumstances under which a person could be convicted of that offense. We held that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>could not raise his <em>Bailey </em>issue in a successive \u00a7 2255 petition given the statutory limitations on successive \u00a7 2255 petitions. However, that left Dorsainvil in a unique position in which he may well have been convicted for conduct that was not criminal and yet have no \u00a7 2255 remedy. 119 F.3d at 251. Attempting an analogy, Chambers claims that because he cannot raise his <em>Apprendi </em>claim in a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, he can challenge his convictions and sentence in a habeas petition. <em>Apprendi, </em>however, does not make the conduct that Chambers was convicted of, previously thought criminal, noncriminal. Rather, the case concerns only the issues of the burden of proof and the identity of the fact finder with respect to certain sentencing issues. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir.2001). Under this Court\u2019s <em>Dorsainvil </em>decision, therefore, \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective for Chambers to raise his <em>Apprendi </em>argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Chambers\u2019 \u00a7 2241 habeas petition raising <em>Apprendi. </em>We sympathize with Chambers\u2019 desire to have <em>Apprendi </em>applied to his case, for it might well benefit him. However, as the Government noted in its brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">[I]f the Supreme Court later holds that <em>Apprendi </em>should be applied retroactively, ... Chambers will be able to seek leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and then will have an opportunity to have his claim heard. <em>Turner, </em>267 F.3d at 231 (dismissing defendant\u2019s motion for leave to file a second habeas petition without prejudice in case the Supreme Court subsequently should make <em>Apprendi </em>retroactive to cases on collateral review). In the interim, Chambers cannot evade the gatekeeping requirements enacted by AEDPA by invoking \u00a7 2241 without \u201ceffectively eviscerat[ing] Congress\u2019 intent in amending \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Appellee\u2019s Brief at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
