On appeal, Mr. Favela advances the following arguments: (1) that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a February 16, 2000 traffic stop; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions; (3) that the government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to timely disclose evidence that would have allowed impeachment of a government witness; (4) that the government violated his due process and Sixth Amendment rights by allowing the deportation of material witnesses prior to trial; (5) that the district court issued several erroneous evidentiary rulings; and (6) that the district court\u2019s cumulative errors warrant reversal. We are not persuaded by Mr. Favela\u2019s arguments and therefore affirm his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">At approximately 9:50 a.m. on February 16, 2000, Clinton, Oklahoma police officer Michael Nabors observed a Ford van traveling northbound on a road near Interstate-10. At the suppression hearing, Officer Nabors testified that he could see that there were two people in the front seat of the van and that the driver was an Hispanic male. Officer Nabors also noticed that there was a female passenger who was sitting in between the front two seats in the van and was not wearing a seatbelt. Officer Nabors explained that this passenger seemed to be sitting on her knees. He therefore concluded that she was not wearing a seatbelt and was thus violating Oklahoma law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Officer Nabors stopped the van. As he stood near the driver\u2019s door, he noticed that there were about twenty people inside. According to Officer Nabors, the people in the van \u201creally didn\u2019t look at me, they looked straightforward as if to not make eye contact, just kind of stared straight forward.\u201d Rec. vol. II, at 12 (Tr. of Motions Hr\u2019g, July 5, 2000).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Officer Nabors asked the driver for his license and insurance verification. The driver produced a Texas license, which identified him as the defendant Salvador Favela-Favela. Mr. Favela then stepped out of the van, and Officer Nabors began to question him.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Nabors described the sequence of questions as follows. First, he asked Mr. Favela if he was on a trip, and Mr. Favela responded affirmatively. Then, the officer asked if the van\u2019s passengers were family members or if they were on a church function. To both those questions, Mr. Favela said. \u201cNo.\u201d Then, he asked Mr. Favela \u201cif everybody in the van was \u2018legal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Mr. Favela responded, \u201cNo,\u201d but he added that the passengers were \u201cgood people\u201d who \u201cweren\u2019t causing anybody any problems\u201d and \u201cwere just trying to ... find work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13. Mr. Favela asked Officer Nabors to give him a break and let the passengers go.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-13\">Officer Nabors replied that he needed to keep asking questions. He inquired whether the passengers were paying Mr. Favela. Mr. Favela responded that each passenger had paid him approximately $180.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">At that point, Officer Nabors asked Mr. Favela to return to the van and wait. Officer Nabors then called his supervisor, Sergeant Gene Kelly. At the suppression hearing, Sergeant Kelly testified that, upon arriving at the scene, he too questioned Mr. Favela. He said that in response to his question as to whether the passengers were \u201clegal,\u201d Mr. Favela again responded negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">The officers took Mr. Favela and the passengers to the Clinton police station and contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Mr. Favela volunteered the following information to Sergeant Kelly: that he had made twenty other trips from Arizona to Georgia and Florida, that they were going to the latter two states because the fruit crop and construction business were doing well, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>this was the first time he had been stopped, and that another person told him where to pick up his passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">INS Agents Rodney McDonald and Eugene Graham arrived at the police station shortly thereafter. They told Mr. Favela that he was under arrest and read him the <em>Miranda </em>warnings in Spanish. The INS agents also presented Mr. Favela with two <em>\u201cLujanr-Castro </em>\u201d waiver forms, one in English and one in Spanish. <em>See United States v. Lujan Castro, </em>602 F.2d 877 (9th Cir.1979). Mr. Favela signed the waiver form that was written in Spanish.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">After Mr. Favela signed the <em>Lujan-Castro </em>waiver, eighteen out of the twenty passengers were returned to their country of origin. As to the other two \u2014 Manual Cabanzo-Sanchez and Jorge Alberto Castillo-Estrada, the government took video depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Prior to trial, Mr. Favela filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained by the government following Officer Nabors\u2019 stop of the van. He presented the following arguments: (1) that Officer Nabors lacked probable cause to stop van initially; (2) that Officer Nabors\u2019 questions were unduly intrusive; (3) that the questioning conducted by Sergeant Kelly at the Clinton police station before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given violated Mr. Favela\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights; (4) that the testimony of Mr. Cabanzo Sanchez and Mr. Castillo Estrada (the two passengers who were not deported) should not be admitted at trial because the government permitted them to avoid permanent detention in exchange for their trial testimony; and (5) that the deportation of the eighteen other passengers violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The district court rejected the first, second, fourth, and fifth arguments. It concluded that there was probable cause for the initial stop, that the scope of Officer Nabors\u2019 questions was reasonable, that Mr. Cabanzo Sanchez and Mr. Castillo Estrada could testify at trial because \u201c[n]o evidence was presented that the will of either [man] was overborne or that their statements were the product of impermissible government acts or threats,\u201d and that Mr. Favela had signed the <em>Lujan-Castro </em>form waiving his right to present testimony from the eighteen other passengers. <em>See </em>Rec. vol. I, doc. 77, at 15-16 (District Court Order, filed July 12, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">However, the court also concluded that Sergeant Kelly had questioned Mr. Favela about ownership of the van before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were issued and that, at the time of this questioning, Mr. Favela was in custody and under interrogation. Thus, \u201c[a]ny statements made by [Mr.] Favela to Sergeant Kelly at the police station were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>and [Mr.] Favela\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and will therefore be suppressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">At trial, the government presented video depositions from Mr. Cabanzo Sanchez and Mr. Castillo Estrada. Mr. Sanchez testified that he crossed the border from Mexico without permission of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>government, that he walked from the border to Phoenix, and that friends made arrangements for his transportation with Mr. Favela. Mr. Estrada gave similar testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Agent McDonald provided testimony about unlawful entry into the United States. He testified that the area at which Mr. Sanchez crossed the border was a common staging area for illegal immigrants. He added that Mr. Favela had a phone book with a phone number for Altar Sonora, Mexico. According to Agent McDonald, this location is also a staging area for Mexican aliens to cross into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Mr. Favela\u2019s defense was that he had a legitimate transportation company and that he did not know of the illegal status of his passengers. He offered testimony from the Assistant Manager of the Union Bus Station in Oklahoma City that Greyhound did not have a policy of checking into the immigration status of passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Mr. Favela also sought to minimize the import of his statements to Officer Nabors and Sergeant Kelly. He offered testimony from a social worker and family friend that his knowledge of English was limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Finally, Mr. Favela offered expert testimony from a former police officer, Theodore Montgomery. Mr. Montgomery testified that, if a person was sitting between the front seats of the van, Officer Nabors could not have seen that person.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">\n<em>A. Denial of Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we examine the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Le, </em>173 F.3d 1258, 1264 (10th Cir.1999). We view the record in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id. </em>The ultimate question of whether the government\u2019s conduct was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment is a legal question that we consider de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">In this appeal, Mr. Favela challenges both the initial traffic stop and the questioning by Officer Nabors leading up to Mr. Favela\u2019s statement that the occupants of the van were not \u201clegal.\u201d We examine each argument separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">\n<em>1. Initial Stop</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">Under the Fourth Amendment, a traffic stop constitutes a seizure and therefore must be \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979). A stop is reasonable if it is based on an observed traffic violation or a reasonable articulable suspicion that such a violation has occurred or is occurring. <em>United States v. Botero Ospina, </em>71 F.3d 783, 787 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc). Reasonable suspicion is \u201ca particularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting the person stopped of criminal activity. <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981); <em>see also United States v. Callarman, </em>273 F.3d 1284, 1286 (10th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhile either probable cause or reasonable suspicion is sufficient to justify a traffic stop, only the lesser requirement of reasonable suspicion is necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Mr. Favela first argues that \u201c[n]o reasonable officer could have observed a seat-belt violation under the scenario suggested by [Officer] Nabors.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 27. He maintains that the record establishes that the traffic stop was made because of Mr. Favela\u2019s Hispanic heritage rather than because of Officer Nabor\u2019s observations of a seatbelt violation. In support of this argument, Mr. Favela lists various inconsistencies between Officer Nabors\u2019s statements at the preliminary hearing, the motion to suppress hearing, and the trial. He points to differences in the officer\u2019s ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>count of the order in which he asked questions and in whether the questions were asked when Mr. Favela was still in the van or when he stepped out of it. Mr. Favela also notes that Sergeant Kelly admitted on cross-examination that \u201cthe nationality of the people sitting in front of the van\u201d was \u201ca predominant factor in [his] decision to ask whether or not they were legal.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 21 (citing Rec. vol II, at 104).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">We are not convinced by Mr. Fave-la\u2019s challenge to the initial stop. Here, the district court made the factual finding that Officer Nabors observed an unrestrained passenger in the front seat area of the van. None of the evidence noted by Mr. Favela establishes that this finding was clearly erroneous. In light of this factual finding, the accompanying legal conclusion is justified: Officer Nabors had \u201ca particularized and objective basis,\u201d <em>see Cortez, </em>449 U.S. at 417-418, 101 S.Ct. 690, for suspecting a violation of the Oklahoma seatbelt law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Like the district court, we are not convinced that statements by Officer Nabors and Sergeant Kelly that they noticed the ethnic appearance of Mr. Favela and the passengers rendered the traffic stop unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The fact that both officers noticed the ethnic appearance of Mr. Favela and his passengers does not establish that it was that appearance \u2014 rather than the reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation \u2014 that led to the initial stop. Moreover, \u201c[w]hen determining whether an officer possessed a reasonable articulable suspicion, the subjective motivations of an arresting officer are irrelevant.\u201d <em>Callarman, </em>273 F.3d at 1286 (citing <em>Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d at 787); <em>see also Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (adopting an objective approach). Thus, even if the officers\u2019 statements were some evidence of a bias against Hispanics (an inference the record does not support), the fact that Officer Nabors had a reasonable basis to suspect a violation of the Oklahoma seatbelt law establishes that the stop of the van was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\n<em>2. Continuing Detention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">Mr. Favela further argues that, once Officer Nabors made the initial stop, he had no legitimate basis for the questioning about the identity of the passengers or their immigration status. Again, he maintains that Officer Nabors\u2019s motivation was race-based, and that the continuing detention therefore violated the Fourth Amendment. We analyze this argument under the framework set forth in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), asking whether Officer Nabor\u2019s continuing detention of Mr. Favela \u201cwas reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>see Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Under the Fourth Amendment, a police officer conducting a traffic stop may request vehicle registration and a driver\u2019s license, run a computer check, and issue a citation. <em>United States v. Hunnicutt, </em>135 F.3d at 1345, 1349 (10th Cir.1998). He or she may also ask about \u201ctravel plans ... and the ownership of the car.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>867 F.2d 1261, 1263 (10th Cir.1989). However, after the officer has issued the citation and the driver has pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>duced a valid license and proof that he is entitled to operate the car, the officer must allow him to proceed on his way without further delay. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>264 F.3d 1215, 1221 (10th Cir.2001) (en banc). In two circumstances, the officer may engage in additional questioning: (1) if he or she \u201chas an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that illegal activity has occurred or is occurring;\u201d and (2) if the subject of the additional interrogation consents to it. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lerma, </em>14 F.3d 1479, 1483 (10th Cir.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In assessing what constitutes an objectively reasonable suspicion of illegal activity, we defer to \u201cthe ability of a trained law enforcement officer to distinguish between innocent and suspicious actions.\u201d <em>See United States v. McRae, </em>81 F.3d 1528, 1534 (10th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). We assess the officer\u2019s conduct in the light of common sense and ordinary human experience, considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Melendez-Garcia, </em>28 F.3d 1046, 1051 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This traffic stop jurisprudence does not support Mr. Favela\u2019s argument. Officer Nabor\u2019s initial questions to Mr. Favela concerned his travel plans (i.e. \u201cif [Mr. Favela was on a trip, ... if [the passengers] were all his familyf,] ... [and] if it was a church function [or] church group\u201d). <em>See </em>Rec. vol. II, at 11. As part of the initial inquiry during a legitimate traffic stop, these questions were not unduly intrusive. <em>See United States v. West, </em>219 F.3d 1171, 1176 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[Questions about travel plans are routine and may be asked as a matter of course without exceeding the proper scope of a traffic stop\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The next question asked by Officer Nabors \u2014 whether the passengers were \u201clegal\u201d-cannot be so easily characterized as a routine question about travel plans. However, at the time that he asked that question, Officer Nabors had several grounds for suspecting illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">First, Mr. Favela\u2019s negative answers to the questions about whether the passengers were family members or a church group eliminated two lawful activities that could explain the presence of such a large number of people in the van. Second, Officer Nabors testified that he had learned of several instances in which vans or other large vehicles had been stopped and officers had discovered illegal aliens being transported across the country. <em>See </em>Rec. vol II, at 6. Some of these stops had been made by the Clinton, Oklahoma Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">Based on the totality of the circumstances confronting him, we conclude that Officer Nabors\u2019s question about the immigration status of the passengers was justified by his observations. <em>See United States v. Santana-Garcia, </em>264 F.3d 1188, 1193 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that motorists\u2019 negative response to the question \u201cwhether they were \u2018legal\u2019 \u201d established probable cause to arrest them \u201cfor suspected violation of federal immigration law\u201d); <em>United States v. Salinas-Calderon, </em>728 F.2d 1298, 1301 n. 3 (10th Cir.1984) (stating that \u201c[a] state trooper has general investigatory authority to inquire into possible immigration violations\u201d). We therefore conclude that Officer Nabors\u2019s questioning and the continuing detention of Mr. Favela did not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\n<em>B. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">Mr. Favela argues that the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions. This is a question of law that we examine de novo. <em>United States v. Magleby, </em>241 F.3d 1306, 1311 (10th Cir.2001). We must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>determine \u201cwhether taking the evidence\u2014 both direct and circumstantial, together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom \u2014 in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hanzlicek, </em>187 F.3d 1228, 1239 (10th Cir.1999). We will disturb the jury\u2019s verdict only if our review leads us to conclude that no reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crimes charged. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Mr. Favela was charged with and convicted of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), which makes it illegal for \u201c[a]ny person who ... knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, transports, or moves or attempts to transport or move such alien within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise, in furtherance of such violation of law.\u201d In order to establish a violation of \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), the government must prove: (1) that the defendant transported or moved an alien within the United States, (2) that the alien was present in violation of law, (3) that the defendant was aware of the alien\u2019s status, and (4) that the defendant acted willfully in furtherance of the alien\u2019s violation of the law. <em>See United States v. Barajas-Chavez, </em>162 F.3d 1285, 1289 (10th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Here, Mr. Favela concedes that the government established the first two elements. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 38. However, he argues that the government did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew of the passengers\u2019 illegal status or that he acted willfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In support of this contention, he first argues that his answer to the question whether the passengers were \u201clegal\u201d was ambiguous. According to Mr. Favela, he could have been referring to the passengers not wearing seatbelts or to there being too many people in the van. Similarly, he maintains that his reference to the passengers being \u201cgood people\u201d was evidence that he believed that they were in the country legally. Aplt\u2019s Br. at 37. In general, he asserts that, in light of his limited understanding of English, little weight should be given to his responses to the Clinton police officers\u2019 questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Mr. Favela also points to evidence supporting an inference of a good faith belief that the passengers were legally in the country. He observes that he picked up his passengers far north of the border, that he had no previous contact with them, that many people were traveling lawfully during this time in order to obtain work, and that it was customary for people to travel in groups. Mr. Favela also points to several factors that support the inference that he ran a legitimate transportation business: the van was not constructed to hide passengers, he traveled during the day, he obtained a liability policy providing extensive coverage in case of an accident, and the van was registered properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">We are not convinced by Mr. Fave-la\u2019s arguments. The facts to which he directs us establish only that the evidence is conflicting as to his state of knowledge. As the government observes, there are also facts that controvert Mr. Favela\u2019s interpretation. For example, the alien -witnesses testified that, only a few days after their arrival in the United States, Mr. Favela picked them up, along with the other passengers, at a unfurnished two-to-three room trailer in Phoeniz, Arizona, some 1,231 miles away from Huntsville, Texas (where Mr. Favela usually resided). Additionally, Mr. Favela\u2019s van contained a subscriber agreement for a cellular telephone, which listed a false address in Florida as Mr. Favela\u2019s home address. A jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>could reasonably view these facts as supporting the government\u2019s contention that Mr. Favela knew that he was transporting illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">More importantly, Mr. Favela gave incriminating answers to the Clinton police officers\u2019 questions about the passengers, admitting that they were not \u201clegal\u201d and asking the officers to give the \u201cgood people\u201d a break. Although these answers are arguably ambiguous, any such ambiguities merely presented factual questions for the jury to resolve. <em>United States v. Horn, </em>946 F.2d 738, 743 (10th Cir.1991) (noting that a rational jury could interpret ambiguous testimony in favor of the government).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Because we must view the record in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see Hanzlicek, </em>187 F.3d at 1239, we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support Mr. Favela\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>C. Brady Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Mr. Favela argues that the INS withheld material, exculpatory evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The evidence in question is a false resident alien card and a false social security card possessed by Mr. Estrada, one of the passengers whose video deposition was taken and played at trial. Mr. Favela states that he did not learn of these false documents until the July 5, 2000 suppression hearing, well after Mr. Estrada had been returned to Mexico and was no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">According to Mr. Favela, this evidence was material because it would have shown that he lacked knowledge that the passengers were illegal aliens <em>(ie., </em>if they appeared to have legitimate documents, then Mr. Favela could not have committed the charged offenses knowingly and willingly). Mr. Favela also asserts that he could have used the evidence to impeach Mr. Estrada (by suggesting that, because he had false documents, he may have testified falsely about other matters).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence, (2) the evidence was favorable to the defendant, and (3) the evidence was material. <em>United States v. Quintanilla, </em>193 F.3d at 1139, 1149 (10th Cir.1999); <em>see also Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. Evidence is material under <em>Brady </em>if there is a \u201creasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Here, the evidence in question (the false identification documents) <em>was </em>introduced at trial \u2014 through INS Special Agent Stephen Merrill. Thus, the only difference in what would have happened if the INS had timely disclosed these documents before Mr. Estrada\u2019s video deposition is that Mr. Favela\u2019s counsel could have confronted the witness with them directly, rather than indirectly, by challenging Mr. Favela\u2019s credibility in closing argument. <em>See </em>Aples\u2019 Br at 44-45 (noting that Mr. Favela\u2019s lawyer mentioned in his closing argument that none of the passengers \u201chad ... papers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Mr. Favela has failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability that this difference in the means of impeachment would have affected the result of the trial. Thus, the withheld evidence lacks materiality and his <em>Brady </em>argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">\n<em>D. Deportation of Potential Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Mr. Favela argues that the immediate deportation of eighteen out of the twenty passengers violated his due process and Sixth Amendment rights by depriving him of material evidence and by failing to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>vide him with an attorney before he waived the right to delay deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Mr. Favela\u2019s argument is undermined by the language of the waiver form that he signed. <em>See </em>Rec. vol. I, doc. 77, at 6-7 n. 11 (District Court Order, filed July 12, 2000). That form, presented to Mr. Favela in Spanish and signed by him, states that Mr. Favela waives his right to delay the witnesses\u2019 deportation and also informs him that he has a right to a government appointed lawyer to advise him on the decision: <em>See id. </em>(noting that the form stated, \u2018You have the right to have a lawyer assist you at this time in making this decision to retain or release these witnesses; if you cannot afford a lawyer, the United States government will provide you one at no cost to you.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Mr. Favela argues in conclusory fashion that the waiver is invalid. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s Br. at 44. His conclusory statements are not sufficient to overcome the waiver. <em>See Lujan-Castro, </em>602 F.2d at 878 (affirming the district court\u2019s finding that a similar waiver was knowingly and voluntarily executed and stating that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s conclusion that the waiver was knowingly and intelligently executed is a finding of fact that may not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Favela has failed to establish that any of the eighteen passengers who were deported could have provided exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">We therefore conclude that the deportation of the eighteen witnesses did not violate Mr. Favela\u2019s right to counsel or his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">\n<em>E. Evidentiary Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Mr. Favela sets forth a list of alleged evidentiary errors: (a) allowing the government to use \u201cbuzzwords\u201d like \u201csmuggler,\u201d \u201csafehouse,\u201d and \u201cstaging area,\u201d <em>see </em>Aplt\u2019s Br.at 47; (b) allowing testimony from INS agent McDonald as to a widespread smuggling problem; (c) allowing the jury to be informed of the grand jury indictment; (d) using a financial affidavit, in which Mr. Favela stated that he was indigent, to impeach his statements about having a legitimate business; (e) refusing to allow him to use a videotape that concerned the relative speed of the vehicles at the time of the traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">We review a district court\u2019s rulings on evidentiary matters for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Weller, </em>238 F.3d 1215, 1220 (10th Cir.2001). \u201cIn order to reverse a district court judgment on account of an evidentiary ruling, [an appellant] must make a clear showing [he] suffered prejudice, and the ruling was inconsistent with substantial justice or affected h[is] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Coletti v. Cudd Pressure Control, </em>165 F.3d 767, 773 (10th Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Upon review of the record, we discern no grounds for reversal. As the government notes, many of Mr. Favela\u2019s arguments are conclusory and provide no citations to the record and no explication of the legal authority supporting the claims of error. In any event, Mr. Favela has not established that any of these rulings was \u201cinconsistent with substantial justice or affected h[is] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>\n<em>F. Cumulative Error</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Finally, Mr. Favela argues that the cumulative errors of the government and the trial judge warrant a new trial. \u201c[C]umulative-error analysis should evaluate only the effect of matters determined to be error, not the cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>900 F.2d 1462, 1471 (10th Cir.1990). Because Mr. Favela has not shown any individual errors, he cannot prevail on his claim of cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM Mr. Favela\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-17\">. We also grant the following motions: the government's motion to supplement the record (with the transcripts of the video depositions of Messrs. Cabanzo Sanchez and Cas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tillo Estrada); (2) the appellant\u2019s motion to supplement the record with exhibits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\">. Oklahoma law provides that, with certain exceptions, \"Every operator and front seat passenger of a passenger car operated in this state shall wear a properly adjusted and fastened safety seat belt system, required to be installed in the motor vehicle when manufactured.\u201d Okla Stat. tit. 47, \u00a7 12-417(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-17\">. Officer Nabors further explained, \"[Ujsually you stop a vehicle and people want to stare at you, find out what\u2019s going on. These people didn't seem to do that.\u201d Rec. vol. II, at 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\">. The <em>Lujan-Castro </em>form advised Mr. Favela that: (1) he had the right to require temporary detention of illegal aliens who might serve as witnesses; (2) if he did not require the witnesses to stay, they would be returned to their country of origin and could not later be returned for trial; (3) if the witnesses remained in the United States at his request, they would do so under the supervision of the United States and at the cost of the United States; (4) these witnesses could be called to testify for him or for the government; (5) he had the right to have a lawyer assist him in making the decision to retain or release witnesses and that, if he could not afford a lawyer, one would be appointed for him; and (6) he and his lawyer had the right to speak to the witnesses before his trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">. At oral argument, the parties noted that there was some dispute as to the proper legal interpretation of the Oklahoma seatbelt law, as applied to facts at issue here (i.e., a passenger in the middle of the front seat). However, Mr. Favela\u2019s counsel explained that, in this appeal, he is not challenging Officer Nabors\u2019s interpretation of the statute. Instead, counsel stated, Mr. Favela\u2019s argument is that the record does not support the district court\u2019s finding that Officer Nabors actually saw a woman kneeling in the front seat of the van.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. We do view one evidentiary issue with some concern: the government\u2019s introduction of a financial affidavit (signed by Mr. Favela in order to have counsel appointed for him). The government introduced this affidavit in order to rebut Mr. Favela\u2019s contention that he ran a legitimate business. The district court ruled that the affidavit was part of the court record and could be used for impeachment. <em>See </em>Rec. vol. VI, at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In <em>United States v. Hardwell, </em>80 F.3d 1471, 1483 (10th Cir.1996), this court held that the government violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self incrimination by offering, as part of its case in chief, statements made by the defendant to establish eligibility for appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">In this case, the government attempts to distinguish <em>Hard-well </em>by arguing that it used the affidavit only to impeach witnesses who testified that Mr. Favela had a legitimate transportation business. For several reasons, we need not decide in this case whether the government's attempt to distinguish <em>Hard-well </em>is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">First, <em>Hard-well </em>involves a Fifth Amendment right. In his opening brief, Mr. Favela argues that the admission of the financial affidavit was an evidentiary error, but he does not raise a Fifth Amendment claim. Thus, we need not consider the argument that the admission of the affidavit violated his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>See United States v. Murray, </em>82 F.3d 361, 363 n. 3 (10th Cir.1996) (declining to consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-22\">Moreover, any Fifth Amendment violation arising out of the introduction of the financial affidavit is still subject to review for harmless error. <em>See Hardwell, </em>80 F.3d at 1483 (noting that the financial affidavit had little relevance to one of the charges and therefore affirming that conviction). Here, the government presented other evidence to rebut Mr. Favela\u2019s contention that he ran a legitimate business. Thus, the admission of the affidavit was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
