We discern three points of error that Jones raises in his appeal: (1) that the investigation was not \u201congoing\u201d when his obstructive conduct occurred; (2) that the investigation was not \u201cofficial\u201d as required by the guidelines; and (3) that he had no knowledge of the investigation. We consider each of these arguments in turn, and, exercising our jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">Jones was charged in a multi-count indictment with fraudulent activity connected with his operation of Lake Country Home Care, Inc. (PSR, \u00b61.) Relevant to this appeal, he was charged with conspiring to defraud federal auditors in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, (CR-01-07, Count One), and with obstructing an audit by federal auditors in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516 (CR-01-07, Count Two). Specifically, Count Two charged that Jones, \u201cwith the intent to deceive and defraud the United States, did endeavor to influence, obstruct and impede a <em>Federal auditor, </em>namely, Palmetto Government Benefits Administrator, LLC auditor, in the performance of <em>said auditor\u2019s official duties </em>relating to Lake Country Home Care, Inc.\u201d (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">Relevant to Count Two, the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicates that on June 1, 1998, the Department of Health and Human Services advised Lake Country Home Care, Inc. \u201cthat it would be subjected to an audit of its financial compliance with the rules and regulations of the federal medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>care program.\u201d (PSR, \u00b6 12.) Between September 1, 1998 and December 31, 1998, Jones \u201cfalsified and fabricated documents with the intention to conceal and mislead federal auditors of Lake Country in the performance of their duties from discovery of [false documents].\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Jones waived his right to a jury trial and pled guilty to all charges against him. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, the probation officer recommended that Jones\u2019s conviction for Count Two (obstructing the audit) warranted a two-level adjustment, because Jones stood convicted of an obstruction offense, and the offense with respect to which the obstructive conduct occurred. At sentencing, defense counsel objected to the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, arguing that a sufficient nexus had not been established between the obstructive conduct and the underlying offense, because the obstructive conduct occurred months before \u201cJones became aware that government agents had actively been investigating him.\u201d (Obj. to PSR at 2.) The probation officer maintained that the two-level enhancement was appropriate, and the district court overruled Jones\u2019s objection, upholding the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of the Guidelines de novo. <em>See United States v. Mojica, </em>214 F.3d 1169, 1171 (10th Cir.2000). The district court adopted the factual findings as recited in the PSR, and Jones did not object to those factual findings at sentencing. (Add. to PSR, stating Defendant\u2019s sole objection to the PSR as the application of the two-level enhancement.) Thus, our review is guided by the facts as they appear in the PSR.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">The relevant guideline, \u00a7 3C1.1, states: If (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impeded, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of the conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense, increase the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">We begin by noting that the Guideline itself contains no mention that the investigation must be \u201cofficial,\u201d and the crux of Jones\u2019s argument on appeal is that the audit performed by Palmetto was not an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d as contemplated by the Guidelines. The Guideline\u2019s commentary introduces the concept of \u201cofficial investigation\u201d in Note 4, which gives a non-exhaustive list of the types of conduct to which the adjustment applies. Because the commentary\u2019s instruction that the adjustment applies to \u201cofficial investigations,\u201d is not \u201cplainly erroneous, inconsistent with the guidelines, or violative of the Constitution or a federal statute,\u201d we, as are district courts, are obliged to follow it. <em>Mojica, </em>214 F.3d at 1171 (citing <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 42-43, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)). Therefore, we proceed to analyze whether Jones\u2019 obstructive conduct in connection with the Palmetto audit merits the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">A. <em>Obstruction \u201cduring the course\u201d of the investigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Construing Jones\u2019 brief liberally, we interpret his assertion that the investigation by Palmetto was not \u201congoing\u201d to mean that his obstructive conduct happened before, as opposed to \u201cduring the course\u201d of the investigation, as the Guideline contemplates. Such an argument is without merit, as \u201cwe have previously held that ... awareness of an impending inves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tigation is sufficient to satisfy the nexus requirement so as to warrant enhancement\u201d for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>194 F.3d 1108, 1115 (10th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Norman, </em>129 F.3d 1393, 1399 (10th Cir.1997)). In this case, the facts demonstrate that Jones was aware of an impending investigation by Palmetto. As recited in the PSR, on June 1, 1998, Jones \u201cwas advised by the United States Department of Health and Human Sendees that [Lake Country Home Care, Inc.] would be subjected to an audit of its financial compliance with the rules and regulations of the federal medicare program.\u201d (PSR, \u00b612.) The obstructive conduct with which Jones was charged, and to which he pled guilty, consisted of his actions from September 1, 1998 to December 31, 1998, after he had knowledge of an impending investigation. Therefore, his actions were clearly within the temporal limits of the Guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. <em>\u201cOfficial Investigation\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On appeal, Jones argues that the Palmetto audit was not an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d because it was conducted by \u201cnongovernmental personnel working for a non-governmental business .\u201d We are unconvinced. The indictment indicates that HHS \u201ccontracted with intermediary, Palmetto ..., to administer the Medicare program\u201d with home health care agencies in Oklahoma, and describes Palmetto as \u201ca Federal auditor.\u201d (Exh. D, Count Two \u00b6\u00b6 1,2.) Secondly, Jones received notice from HHS that Palmetto would be conducting an audit for \u201ccompliance with the rules and regulations of the federal medicare program.\u201d (PSR, \u00b6 12.) Jones\u2019s attempt to liken Palmetto\u2019s audit to that of an internal \u201croutine audit to balance the books,\u201d is unavailing. Palmetto\u2019s audit clearly was initiated by HHS, and conducted by Palmetto, its contractual intermediary, for the governmental purpose of assessing compliance with the regulations of a federal agency, HHS. Thus, unlike the facts in <em>United States v. Kirkland, </em>upon which Jones relies, the Palmetto audit was not some \u201cinternal mechanism of a corporation ... wholly unrelated to any governmental entity.\u201d 985 F.2d 535, 537 (11th Cir.1993). Instead, Palmetto, \u201cin the performance of [its] duties,\u201d was required to report to HHS its findings of compliance or non-compliance with federal regulations. (PSR, \u00b6 12.) Based on these factors, as recited in the indictments and the PSR, we conclude that Palmetto\u2019s audit constituted an \u201cofficial investigation\u201d under \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">C. <em>Knowledge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">As explained above, Jones clearly knew about the impending investigation when HHS advised him in June 1998 that Lake Country Home Care, Inc. would be subjected to an audit of its \u201ccompliance with the rules and regulations of the federal medicare program.\u201d (PSR, \u00b6 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Therefore, because Jones knew that Palmetto worked for the government, was investigating for compliance with federal rules and regulations, and had a duty to report its findings to HHS, the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1 was warranted. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-13\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This Order and Judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
