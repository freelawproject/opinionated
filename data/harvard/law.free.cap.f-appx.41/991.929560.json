We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a) for failure to state a claim. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Alley failed to state a due process claim because the disciplinary committee\u2019s decision was supported by sufficient evidence in the record after a proeedurally adequate hearing. <em>See Neal v. Shimoda, </em>131 F.3d 818, 830-31; <em>Burnsworth v. Gunderson, </em>179 F.3d 771, 773 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">Alley failed to state an Eighth Amend: ment claim because the disciplinary measures were neither a sufficiently serious deprivation, nor imposed by a prison official with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Finally, Alley failed to state a First Amendment retaliation claim, because the disciplinary measures were reasonably related to legitimate penological interests of maintaining safety and security. <em>See Stefanow v. McFadden, </em>103 F.3d 1466, 1472 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Alley\u2019s requests for oral argument and supplemental briefing are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1014-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
