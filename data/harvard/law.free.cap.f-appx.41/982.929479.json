We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-24\">Mora contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 29, because the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove either knowing possession or intent to distribute. We review de novo and conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mora knowingly possessed heroin with the intent to distribute. <em>See United States v. Tisor, </em>96 F.3d 370, 379 (9th Cir.1996) (setting forth legal standard for reviewing denial of Rule 29 motion for acquittal); <em>United States v. Davila-Escovedo, </em>36 F.3d 840, 843 (9th Cir.1994) (explaining that jury may infer both knowledge of possession and intent to distribute from quantity and value of drug possessed, and may infer knowledge of possession from fact that appellant was driver and sole occupant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>vehicle containing drugs); <em>United States v. Barbosa, </em>906 F.2d 1366, 1368-1369 (9th Cir.1990) (allowing inference of knowledge of possession from defendant\u2019s apparent nervousness and inconsistent statements given during airport inspection).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1004-25\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
