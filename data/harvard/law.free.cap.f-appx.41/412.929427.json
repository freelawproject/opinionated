Leibowitz seeks review of the June 22, 2001, decision of the Merit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Systems Protection Board, No. NY-0731-00-0368-I-1, 88 M.S.P.R. 635, reversing the initial decision of the Administrative Judge and sustaining the negative suitability determination made by the Department of Justice\u2019s Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). We <em>affim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Leibowitz applied for reinstatement to the position of District Adjudications Officer (DAO) with INS, which he had held from March of 1992 through July of 1995, until he resigned. The INS offered him the position subject to a background investigation. During the investigation, Leibowitz admitted that an illegal alien, his brother-in-law, had been living in his house for approximately eighteen months. On May 17, 2000, citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202, INS concluded that the results of Leibowitz\u2019s background investigation raised serious questions about his suitability for employment, specifically that his conduct was in direct conflict with the mission of INS. It, therefore, withdrew him from consideration for the DAO position. Leibowitz appealed to the board which ultimately sustained INS\u2019s negative suitability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Our review is limited to setting aside any action that is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). <em>See Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">A suitability determination is based upon a variety of factors including criminal or dishonest conduct related to the duties to be assigned to the applicant. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 731.202(b) (2002). An agency also considers the nature of the position for which the person is applying, the nature of the conduct, and the circumstances surrounding the conduct. Id. \u00a7 731.202(c). Leibowitz admits he sheltered a person whom he believed to be an illegal alien. Given his admission, the nature of INS\u2019s mission and the position for which he applied, the board\u2019s decision sustaining the negative suitability determination is not reversible.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
