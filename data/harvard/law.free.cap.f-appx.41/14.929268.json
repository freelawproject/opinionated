Langston appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits (DIB). Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1217 (8th Cir.2001) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-22\">Langston applied for DIB in March 1998, alleging disability since January 1996 from manic depression, left-hip pain, poor vision, and nervousness. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found Langston had the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform medium work and thus his past relevant work (PRW) as an assembler and fork-lift operator was not precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-23\">Langston argues that the ALJ erred in finding that he could perform his PRW. We disagree. The ALJ properly determined that Langston was capable of performing work at the medium exertional level after considering and discounting Langston\u2019s subjective complaints of additional limitations, <em>see Dunahoo v. Apfel, </em>241 F.3d 1033, 1038 (8th Cir.2001) (if ALJ discredits claimant and gives good reasons for doing so, court will defer to his judgment), and after considering the medical records and observations of treating physicians and others,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see Pearsall, </em>274 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>1217-18 (RFC determination). Further, Langston\u2019s description of his PRW was consistent with the vocational expert\u2019s characterization of these jobs as medium or light unskilled work. Thus, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Langston was capable of working as an assembler and fork-lift operator is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Langston\u2019s remaining arguments also provide no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-16\">. The Honorable Susan Webber Wright, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Jerry W. Cavaneau, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-25\">. We note Langston provided no evidence that he sought treatment for his allegedly disabling physical and mental conditions after his prior application was denied in April 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
