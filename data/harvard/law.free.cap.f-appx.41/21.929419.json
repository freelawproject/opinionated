Phillips alleges that Conagra and Swifb-Ekrich- promised to subsidize rent payments for a housing complex Phillips constructed near a Butterball Turkey plant in Huntsville, Arkansas. The district court granted summary judgment after concluding the alleged promises were too indefinite to be enforceable. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude the district court\u2019s rulings were proper. We thus affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-35\">. The Honorable Stephen M.
