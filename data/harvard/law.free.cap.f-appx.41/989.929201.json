Smalls appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment denying his Administrative Procedure Act claim seeking a correction of his military record, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the district court\u2019s orders denying his two motions for reconsideration. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-19\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s judgment and determine for ourselves whether the agency\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Barber v. Widnall, </em>78 F.3d 1419, 1423 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also Rust Constructors, Inc. v. U.S., </em>49 Fed. Cl. 490, 493 (Fed.Cl.2001) (reviewing motion for judgment upon the administrative record under same standard as summary judgment). We review for an abuse of discretion Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) motions. <em>Sch. Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., 5 </em>F.3d 1255, 1262 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-20\">The district court properly denied Smalls\u2019 request for judgment on the administrative record. The Bureau of Correction of Naval Records\u2019s denial of Smalls\u2019 request to change the record of his discharge to show a service-related disability was neither arbitrary nor capricious and was supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Barber, </em>78 F.3d at 1423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Smalls\u2019 successive motions for reconsideration because neither motion presented adequate grounds for relief. <em>See Sch. Dist. No. 1J, 5 </em>F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-22\">We reject Smalls\u2019 remaining contentions as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b1011-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-26\">.
