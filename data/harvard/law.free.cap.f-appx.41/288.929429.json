ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Gary Zane Beavers appeals from the judgment of the district court denying his petition for habeas corpus brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because we agree with the district court that Mr. Beavers has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s allegedly unreasonable representation, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Mr. Beavers pled guilty to first degree murder in Oklahoma district court and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After numerous state court proceedings, Mr. Beavers filed a petition for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the federal district court. Finding his claims to be procedurally barred, the district court denied relief. On appeal, we affirmed in part, but reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on Mr. Beavers\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Beavers v. Saffle, </em>216 F.3d 918, 925 (10th Cir.2000). On remand, the district court found that Mr. Beavers had failed to establish prejudice as a result of his counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance and denied the petition but granted a certificate of appealability. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">Because Mr. Beavers\u2019 claim was not decided on the merits by the state court, and the \u201cdistrict court made its own determination in the first instance, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>LaFevers v. Gibson, </em>182 F.3d 705, 711 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">In his first habeas appeal, Mr. Beavers argued he had received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney informed him that, if he pled guilty to first degree murder, it would be ten to twelve years before he \u201cmade\u201d parole. Mr. Beavers presented an affidavit from his trial counsel stating that such information was wrong at the time of the affidavit and wrong when given and that the correct information would have been that it would take twenty-two and one-half years before Mr. Beavers could \u201cmake\u201d parole on a life sentence. Relying on the twenty-two and one-half year figure and citing cases holding that \u201cgross misadvice concerning parole eligibility can amount to ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>Beavers, </em>216 F.3d at 925 (quotation omitted and collecting cases), this court concluded that \u201c[i]f the facts alleged by Mr. Beavers are true, he would be entitled to relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore remanded for an evidentiary hearing noting, \u201c[i]f the court determines that Mr. Beavers\u2019 factual allegations are uncontested or true and he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, then it must order an appropriate remedy. Oklahoma can either retry Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Beavers within a reasonable period of time, or reduce his sentence so as to provide parole eligibility within ten to twelve years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">On remand, the district court held an extensive evidentiary hearing at which it was established that the proper date for parole eligibility, given Mr. Beavers\u2019 sentence, would have been fifteen years. No one at the hearing could determine how Mr. Albert, Mr. Beavers\u2019 now-deceased attorney, had arrived at the twenty-two and one-half year figure. Proceeding on the basis that Mr. Beavers would be eligible for parole after serving fifteen years, the district court made several findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Initially, the court considered Mr. Beavers\u2019 claim that he had been told he would \u201cmake\u201d parole after ten to twelve years, and that he understood that information to mean he would be released from prison after serving ten to twelve years, not that he would be merely eligible for parole. The district court found this claim to lack credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Although Petitioner might not have had prior knowledge about the details of parole eligibility, it is commonly known that parole is not automatically granted to eligible persons. Parole is granted at the discretion of the Pardon and Parole Board, after consideration of numerous factors. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 57 \u00a7 332.8. Therefore, to the extent Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Albert told him he would actually be released in less than twelve years, as opposed to parole eligible, the Court finds the assertion unconvincing. This disposition is supported by the language of the Tenth Circuit in its order. \u201cIf the court determines that Mr. Beavers\u2019 factual allegations are uncontested or true and he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, then it must order an appropriate remedy. Oklahoma can either retry Mr. Beavers within a reasonable period of time, or reduce his sentence so as to provide <em>parole eligibility </em>within ten to twelve years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ary\">Appellant\u2019s App. at 38-39 n. 2 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Applying the two-part test articulated in <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985), the district court held that Mr. Beavers had failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s advice, although incorrect, was unreasonable. This conclusion was based on evidence that the incorrect parole information had emanated from the District Attorney\u2019s Office and that the criminal bar at the time of Mr. Beavers\u2019 sentencing widely believed, incorrectly, that good time credits could be awarded people serving life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The district court further found that, even if it was unreasonable for Mr. Beavers\u2019 counsel to advise him wrongly about his parole eligibility date, Mr. Beavers had failed to show that he had been prejudiced by the misinformation. The court reasoned that the difference between twelve and fifteen years before parole eligibility was not so great that Mr. Beavers would have gone to trial and risked life without parole on a first degree murder charge. The district court again denied Mr. Beavers\u2019 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">On appeal, Mr. Beavers argues that, under the facts of this case, he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In order to prevail, Mr. Beavers must make two difficult showings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">The Supreme Court has set forth a two-part test for evaluating the claim of a habeas petitioner who is challenging his guilty plea on the ground that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. First, we must ask whether counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. If this prong is met, then the petitioner must show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>his counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced him by demonstrating (1) that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, and (2) that had he rejected the State\u2019s plea bargain, the outcome of the proceedings likely would have changed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>Braun v. Ward, </em>190 F.3d 1181, 1188 (10th Cir.1999) (quotations, citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Mr. Beavers thus must establish a reasonable probability that he would have pled not guilty and that a jury either would not have convicted him of first degree murder or would have sentenced him to a lesser sentence than the one he is now serving. <em>See id. </em>Because Mr. Beavers has failed to make this showing, he has failed to qualify for federal habeas relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">As we noted in Mr. Beavers\u2019 first habeas appeal, gross misinformation concerning parole eligibility can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Beavers, </em>216 F.3d at 925 (citing cases). Mr. Beavers, however, must still \u201caffirmatively prove\u201d that he was prejudiced by the misinformation. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The existence of prejudice is \u201can essentially factual inquiry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Our review of the record in this case and the findings of the district court reveal no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Beavers failed to affirmatively prove that, but for counsel\u2019s erroneous advice, he would have gone to trial and either been acquitted or somehow given some lesser sentence than the one he is serving. Arguments to the contrary in Mr. Beavers\u2019 brief are pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">We thus find no error with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the difference between parole eligibility after twelve years as opposed to eligibility after fifteen years is so great that Mr. Beavers would have gone to trial and faced a sentence of life without parole for first degree murder had he been given accurate advice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Mr. Beavers cites <em>Glover v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 198, 121 S.Ct. 696, 148 L.Ed.2d 604 (2001), in which the Supreme Court rejected the concept that \u201ca minimum amount of additional time in prison cannot constitute prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. We note that no federal court has considered <em>Glover </em>in the context of inaccurate advice regarding parole eligibility, and, because of the uncertain nature of parole, we doubt that <em>Glover </em>applies in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">In <em>Glover, </em>the petitioner had been convicted of labor racketeering, money laundering, and tax evasion. The district court ruled that the money laundering counts should not be grouped with the other offenses, a decision that increased the petitioner\u2019s offense level by two levels. Petitioner\u2019s attorneys did not offer any effective argument in opposition to this decision nor did the same attorneys raise the grouping issue on appeal. In response to petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>court determined that under Seventh Circuit precedent an increase in sentence of six to twenty-one months was insufficient to constitute prejudice for purposes of <em>Strickland. </em>The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting the notion that \u201ca showing of prejudice, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, requires a significant increase in a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><em>Glover </em>is a sentencing case in which legal error by counsel resulted in a longer sentence for the petitioner. The Supreme Court held that an error of law in the sentencing determination which increases time in prison implicates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id </em>at 203. This case, however, involves an error in judgment about how long a prisoner must serve before becoming eligible for parole, an error which did not lengthen the ultimate sentence. Mr. Beavers was sentenced to life imprisonment; counsel\u2019s error as to parole eligibility did not increase that term of imprisonment so as to implicate <em>Glover.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Our reasoning is supported by the language in <em>Glover </em>itself, which is replete with references to prison terms and length of sentence. The Court noted that \u201c[t]his is not a case where trial strategies, in retrospect, might be criticized for leading to a harsher sentence. Here we consider the sentencing calculation itself, a calculation resulting from a ruling which, if it had been error, would have been correctable on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Because we conclude that <em>Glover </em>does not apply to this case, we further conclude that Mr. Beavers\u2019 situation is controlled by the cases cited in his first appeal to this court. Those cases hold that <em>\u201c[gjross </em>misadvice concerning parole eligibility can amount to ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Beavers, </em>216 F.3d at 925 (quotation omitted, emphasis added, collecting cases).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because a three to five year difference between what Mr. Beavers was told and what was actually the case is not \u201cgross misadvice\u201d under these circumstances, we affirm the finding of the district court that Mr. Beavers has failed to demonstrate prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">The cases cited in Mr. Beavers\u2019 brief which reach a contrary conclusion can be distinguished either because the discrepancy between counsel\u2019s bad advice regarding parole eligibility and actual fact was so great, <em>see, e.g., Meyers v. Gillis, </em>142 F.3d 664, 667 (3d Cir.1998), or because the petitioner had been able to convince the district court that there was a \u201creasonable probability that the result of the plea process would have been different but for the erroneous information,\u201d <em>see Hill v. Lockhart, </em>894 F.2d 1009, 1010 (8th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">. This court may address the <em>Strickland </em>performance and prejudice prongs in any order, and need not address both prongs if the appellant fails to satisfy one prong. <em>Foster v. Ward, </em>182 F.3d 1177, 1184 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-10\">. As noted above, Mr. Beavers asserts that he was told he would \"make\u201d parole after serving ten to twelve years. We find no error with the district court's refusal to credit Mr. Beavers' contention that he believed he could be released after serving ten to twelve years. Further, even when comparing the difference between serving ten years before parole eligibility as opposed to fifteen years, Mr. Beavers has not convinced us that he viewed such a five-year difference as so great as to justify the risk of trial and its attendant risk of a life sentence without parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. The Fifth Circuit has recently decided a case involving a difference in sentence allegedly resulting from counsel\u2019s misadvice. <em>See Daniel v. Cockrell, </em>283 F.3d 697 (5th Cir. 2002). That court has concluded that the retroactivity principles of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), bar application of <em>Glover. See id. </em>at 705-06. We do not reach the <em>Teague </em>analysis because we conclude that <em>Glover </em>has no applicability in cases not involving increased sentences and because the State has not made a retroactivity argument, <em>see Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 397 n. 8, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\">. In this context, we note that the first panel of this court to consider Mr. Beavers\u2019 argument was under the mistaken impression (created by the affidavit of Mr. Beavers\u2019 trial counsel) that parole eligibility would be possible only after serving twenty-two and one-half years and not the fifteen years as established in the district court hearing on remand. A difference of ten to twelve and one-half years is much closer to \"gross misadvice\u201d than is the three to five years considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
