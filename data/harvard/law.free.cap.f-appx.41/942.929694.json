This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The statutes which Appellant challenge, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, are facially constitutional. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002); <em>see also, United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 563-68 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>cert. den</em>. \u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002); <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Appellant also makes an as-applied challenge to the sentence he received under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Appellant was never exposed to a sentence greater than 240 months imprisonment, the maximum to which he constitutionally may have been exposed under \u00a7 960(b)(1)- Because the district court in this case did not exceed the maximum sentence permitted for the specified amount of cocaine, <em>Appx'exidi </em>is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">Finally, Zamorano-Flores argues that the grand jury should have been instructed to find, and the government should have been required to prove, that he \u201cknowingly\u201d imported a particular quantity and type of controlled substance. This is not the law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez-Ramirez, </em>875 F.2d 772, 774 (9th Cir.1989)(\u201c[A] defendant charged with importing and possessing a controlled substance need not know the exact nature of the substance with which he was dealing. Instead, a defendant can be convicted under \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 960 if he believes he has <em>some </em>controlled substance in his possession.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); <em>see also Carter v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 255, 269, 120 S.Ct. 2159, 147 L.Ed.2d 203 (2000) (\u201cThe presumption in favor of scienter requires a court to read into a statute only that <em>mens X'ea </em>which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from \u2018otherwise innocent conduct.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., </em>513 U.S. 64, 72, 115 S.Ct. 464, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994))).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b964-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
