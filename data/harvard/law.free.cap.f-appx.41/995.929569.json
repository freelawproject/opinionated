We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We must affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1126 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-25\">Because Aldridge does not have a liberty interest in avoiding placement in administrative segregation, the district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants on his procedural due process claims related to his placement in administrative segregation. <em>See May v. Baldwin, </em>109 F.3d 557, 565 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-26\">Because Aldridge\u2019s first disciplinary hearing was vacated upon administrative appeal due to procedural deficiencies and he was given a new hearing before a different hearing officer, the district court properly granted summary judgment for defendants on his procedural due process claims related to his initial disciplinary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-27\">Because the discipline imposed after the second hearing \u2014 revocation of thirty days\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>good-time credit \u2014 affected the duration of Aldridge\u2019s sentence, and the sanction has not been expunged, summary judgment was proper on Aldridge\u2019s procedural due process claims related to his second hearing. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, 520 </em>U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Butterfield v.

Am. Mgmt. &amp; Amusement, Inc., </em>840 F.2d 1394, 1400 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1017-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
