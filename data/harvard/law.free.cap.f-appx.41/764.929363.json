In numerous cases Mayhew\u2019s chief complaint has been that Lytle and others infringed on copyrights Mayhew claimed to own. <em>See, e.g., Mayhew v. International Marketing Group, </em>6 Fed.Appx. 277 (6th Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cIMG\u201d); Mayhew v. Allsup, </em>166 F.3d 821 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Mayhew v. Gusto, </em>960 F.Supp. 1302 (1997) <em>(\u201cGusto\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b787-16\">This appeal involves three cases. In 1997, Mayhew sued Lytle\u2019s Gusto Records, alleging that Gusto infringed Mayhew\u2019s copyright on several songs, including \u201cSunny Side of the Mountain\u201d and \u201cPatiano, Pride of the Plains.\u201d The district court granted partial summary judgment for Gusto, finding that \u201cSunny Side\u201d and \u201cPatiano\u201d entered the public domain in 1973 when the original owner improperly attempted to renew copyright. <em>See Gusto, </em>960 F.Supp. at 1310. Mayhew did not appeal the partial summary judgment in <em>Gusto, </em>instead filing three Rule 60 motions asking the district court to vacate that judgment and others; all were denied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-17\">Unhappy with the court\u2019s decision in his first case, on March 31, 1999, Mayhew sued Lytle again in federal court, this time also naming as defendants several of Lytle\u2019s attorneys from the first case. <em>See Mayhew v. Lytle, </em>No. 3:99-0266 (M.D.Tenn. May 1, 2001) (sanctions order) <em>(\u201cLytle\u201d). </em>The district court found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>this was merely an attempt by Mayhew to re-litigate issues settled in <em>Gusto </em>and dismissed with prejudice, also requiring May-hew to pay attorneys fees. <em>See id. </em>In 2000, Mayhew filed a third suit in federal court, this time naming only the attorneys as defendants. <em>See Mayhew v. Warnock, </em>No. 3:00-0966 (M.D.Tenn. March 1, 2001), slip op. at 3 (outlining procedural history) <em>(\u2018Warnock\u201d). </em>Although this suit alleged fraud, it too was chiefly an attempt by Mayhew to have his claims re-heard. The district court dismissed Mayhew\u2019s claims against the attorneys as state law claims and reiterated that his copyright claim to \u201cSunny Side\u201d was barred by res judicata and issue preclusion. <em>See id. </em>It also awarded defendants attorneys fees as sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 and ordered Mayhew to cease current or future litigation (1) against defendants for their work as Lytle\u2019s attorneys, (2) concerning any song whose ownership was determined in <em>Gusto, </em>and (3) concerning issues already decided in <em>Gusto </em>and <em>Lytle. </em>Mayhew now appeals from those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Although Mayhew\u2019s briefs are confusing and cite little legal authority for his requests, we liberally construe the briefs of pro se litigants and hold such litigants to less stringent standards than we require of litigants represented by counsel. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). As we decipher them, his briefs ask us to reverse the district court\u2019s 2000 order granting attorneys\u2019s fees and barring him from attempting to religitate the claims settled in <em>Gusto. See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 5 (stating he appeals the award of \u201cunjust fees and sanctions\u201d). We review a district court\u2019s decision to impose sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 for abuse of discretion. <em>See Tropf v. Fidelity Natl. Title Ins. Co., </em>289 F.3d 929, 936 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Before addressing the merits of May-hew\u2019s appeal, we note that his briefs show that what he really wants us to do is revisit the 1997 decision that the copyrights to \u201cSunny Side\u201d and \u201cPatiano\u201d are now in the public domain. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4-5. This appeal is not taken from <em>Gusto, </em>however, but from orders issued in connection with later cases, and Mayhew cites no authority that would allow us to address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Mayhew also appears to be challenging an order issued in his 1999 case, <em>Lytle. </em>There the court assessed attorneys fees against Mayhew, and then sanctioned him after he refused to appear for post-trial deposition and failed to respond to post-trial discovery requests concerning his ability to pay the fees. <em>See Mayhew, </em>No. 99-0266 (sanctions order). The order \u2014 or at least the order appended to Mayhew\u2019s briefs in this case \u2014 did not take any action against Mayhew but merely warned him that if he did not appear for a hearing and deposition he faced contempt of court and imprisonment. Mayhew offers no justification for his refusal to appear. We cannot say in light of these facts that the order was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Mayhew also challenges the orders issued in his 2000 case, <em>Warnock, </em>which awarded the defendants attorneys fees (again) and ordered Mayhew to cease litigating issues settled in <em>Gusto. See Mayhew, </em>No. 3:00-0966 (sanctions order). Rule 11 allows sanctions to be imposed against \u201can attorney or unrepresented party\u201d when they present a pleading to the court \u201cpresented for any improper purpose.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b). \u201cIn this circuit, the test for the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions is whether the individual\u2019s conduct was reasonable under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Tropf, </em>289 F.3d at 939 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The attorneys\u2019s fees were only awarded after defendants filed for sanctions under Rule 11. Mayhew was given 21 days to respond to their request for sanctions, and he did not respond. <em>See Warnock, </em>slip op. at 3. Nothing in the orders (or even in Mayhew\u2019s briefs) suggests that the court acted improperly or abused its discretion in awarding the fees, as Mayhew had a fair opportunity to dispute them at the time. We find they were reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">We also find the sanctions which limited Mayhew\u2019s future litigation reasonable. <em>Wamock </em>was at least the second case in which Mayhew attempted to relitigate issues settled in <em>Gusto. </em>In his first attempt to have the issues reconsidered, the district court made clear to Mayhew that his claims were foreclosed by res judicata and issue preclusion. Even though Mayhew was acting pro se, he thus had notice he was pursuing fruitless and vexatious litigation. Mayhew\u2019s briefs filed in this appeal show that he is still unwilling to accept the decision in <em>Gusto </em>and is still seeking a forum to hear his claims. In light of these facts, we find that Mayhew\u2019s conduct in <em>Wamock </em>was not reasonable under the circumstances and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the challenged sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s imposition of monetary sanctions and AFFIRM its imposition of injunctive sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-13\">. This Court did reverse the district court on Mayhew's third Rule 60(b) motion, holding that due to statutory changes he might be entitled to relief on certain rulings unrelated to Mayhew's claim to \"Sunny Side\u201d and \"Patiano.\u201d <em>See IMG, </em>2001 WL 223848. Although the opinion stated in passing that the district court may also have erred in holding that Mayhew did not have a valid copyright to \"Sunny Side\u201d and \"Patiano,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at *1 n. 1, Mayhew was not appealing that decision and nothing in this court's decision altered <em>Gusto\u2019s </em>holding that those songs had entered the public domain.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
