Wombold argues that the district court erred by permitting the Government to cross-examine her in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and by failing to give the jury a limiting instruction concerning that cross-examination. Finding no reversible error, we will affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Wombold, her brother Hansford Graham, Jr., and David Garcia were part of a conspiracy to defraud Meijer stores, a regional retail department store chain by which Wombold had been employed for some ten years. At the time of the conspiracy, Wombold was a department manager in a Meijer store in Ohio. The scheme \u2014 called \u201crefunding\u201d \u2014 involved obtaining Meijer merchandise by fraud and returning it for full cash refunds using falsified sales receipts. During a three-week period, the defendants perpetrated this fraud on Meijer stores in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan, obtaining fraudulent cash refunds in excess of $12,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Garcia and Graham were arrested in Coldwater, Michigan, driving a rented Cadillac. Following their arrest the police searched their rented car. In it were found rolls of official Meijer receipt tape; numerous receipts and counterfeit receipts for merchandise; a fax/copier machine of the kind necessary to make counterfeit Meijer receipts; and a number of the special markers used by Meijer employees to test the authenticity of the store\u2019s receipts. The police also found in the car envelopes addressed to credit card companies with which Wombold had accounts; the envelopes contained notes with Wombold\u2019s account numbers on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">After his arrest, Graham called Wombold from jail. In them telephone conversation, which the telephone operator told them at the outset was recorded, they discussed how to prevent Garcia from talking: \u201c[W]e got to get David [Garcia] out too. Dave\u2019s got a big mouth.\u201d Wombold repeatedly bemoaned the fact that she had rented a car for Graham and stated \u201cthat\u2019s car is gonna get me in a lot of trouble.\u201d And Wombold repeatedly stated that she was looking for \u201creceipts\u201d from her \u201cvacation fund\u201d and her \u201cmoney market fund\u201d to prove that she had given Graham and Garcia money. At no time in the conversation did Wombold inquire why Graham was in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">A grand jury for the Western District of Michigan returned a one-count indictment against Wombold, Graham, and Garcia, charging them with conspiring to transport more than $5,000 in interstate commerce knowing the money to have been taken by fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. Garcia and Graham pleaded guilty; Wombold went to trial and was convicted by a jury. The district court sentenced Wombold to thirteen months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Garcia testified at Wombold\u2019s trial that Wombold had rented a car for them to drive from Ohio to Michigan for the purpose of defrauding Meijer stores. According to Garcia, Wombold had participated in the conspiracy by, among other things, explaining to Graham how the Meijer security procedures worked and giving them official Meijer receipt paper, special markers used by Meijer store personnel to test the authenticity of receipts, and some of her credit cards to use on the trip to Michigan. Garcia testified that the envelopes addressed to credit card companies were to be used to dispose of some of the cash he and Graham had obtained through the return/refund scheme in order to avoid the suspicion they might engender from having large amounts of cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Elizabeth Graham, Graham\u2019s estranged wife, testified that Wombold had provided Graham with UPC stickers and Meijer receipt tape for Meijer merchandise. According to Elizabeth, Wombold would place receipt tape in a porcelain duck at Wombold\u2019s mother\u2019s residence where Graham would pick it up. Greta Hill, Wombold\u2019s and Graham\u2019s sister, testified that she was regularly at her mother\u2019s home and that there was a porcelain duck in her mother\u2019s kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Wombold testified in her own defense and denied any involvement in or knowledge of the conspiracy. She admitted that in her conversation with Graham while he was in jail she lied about having given Graham the money he was arrested with because she wanted to help him by giving him an alibi as to how he came to have so much cash on his person when he was arrested, admitted that she was willing to lie for her brother, and denied not only that she had ever placed anything in a porcelain duck at her mother\u2019s home but that there was any such duck.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The sole issue in this appeal revolves around one small segment of the Government\u2019s cross-examination of Wombold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-5\">Q Lastly, Ms. Wombold ... isn\u2019t it true that you helped Junior [Graham] to buy a rug at Meijer\u2019s at a reduced price, maybe five dollars?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">Q In fact, weren\u2019t you called by somebody up at the front, maybe it was customer service, maybe even loss prevention, who called you up and asked, How is it that this rug is only five dollars? A I don\u2019t recall that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-8\">Q And didn\u2019t they ask you or didn\u2019t you tell them at the time, oh, it\u2019s because it was a display item or some reason for the fact that this item was reduced in price?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-9\">A No one called me to the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">Q Well, did they call you on the phone and ask for some sort of explanation why the price was reduced on this rug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AhT\">A They may have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-11\">Q So there was that sort of conversation, then, about why a rug was reduced, the price was reduced on a rug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-12\">A There may have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-13\">Q Did they ask you any questions about the fact that this was your brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-15\">Q Wasn\u2019t there a policy against you pricing something for your brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-16\">A I did not mark anything down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-17\">Q Did they discuss the fact that they thought that or they were concerned about who was buying the rug?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-18\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-19\">Wombold\u2019s counsel made no objection to the subject matter of this cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-20\">After the jury was instructed, however, Wombold\u2019s counsel objected to the district court\u2019s not having given an \u201cother acts\u201d instruction concerning the rug incident. The district judge discussed the issue with the attorneys, explaining that in his view, the exchange between Wombold and the prosecutor about the rug was not \u201cother acts\u201d evidence; Wombold denied having marked down the rug, and the Government presented no evidence that she had done so, and pm-sued the matter no further. The district judge expressed his belief that an instruction calling this piece of cross-examination <em>to </em>the jury\u2019s attention would result in more prejudice than good to Wombold, but the court agreed to give a limiting instruction if Wombold\u2019s attorney thought it prudent. After further discussion, Wombold\u2019s attorney let the matter drop and lodged no further objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-21\">Wombold asserts on appeal that the cross-examination on the rug incident\u2014 inferring that she had helped her brother purchase a greatly discounted rug at Meijer\u2019s \u2014 was designed to show that her alleged participation in the conspiracy at hand was in conformity with her prior conduct, a use of evidence prohibited by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">Because Wombold failed to object to the cross-examination about the rug incident, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>167 F.3d 984, 988-89 (6th Cir.1999). To reverse for plain error the reviewing court must find: (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judiciary. <em>United States v. Page, </em>232 F.3d 536, 544 (6th Cir.2000). \u201cThe plain error doctrine is to be used \u2018only in exceptional circumstances\u2019 and only where the error is so plain that the trial judge was \u2018derelict in countenancing it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>90 F.3d 154, 157 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Rule 404(b) limits the ability of a party to introduce character evidence to show action in conformity therewith and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZq\">Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. \u2014 Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused, the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, or during trial if the court excuses pretrial notice on good cause shown, of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASN\">Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). The usual procedure for admission of Rule 404(b) evidence involves four steps: (1) the party seeking its introduction must disclose the purposes for which the challenged evidence is being introduced; (2) the district court must determine whether the purpose is material or in issue; (3) the court must then determine, before admission of the evidence, whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and (4) the district court must instruct the jury concerning the specific purposes for which they may use the evidence. <em>United States v. Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d 1070, 1076-77 (6th Cir.1996). <em>Merriweather </em>\u201cmerely outlined a general approach\u201d to Rule 404(b) evidence and \u201cdid not impose strict, inflexible temporal or sequential mandates.\u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>115 F.3d 361, 366 (6th Cir.1997). We hold that in this case, neither the district court\u2019s failure to follow the precise procedures nor the cross-examination itself constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The cross-examination of Wombold concerning the rug incident was permissible to attempt to show Wombold\u2019s knowledge of Graham\u2019s scheme of refunding, an issue that was clearly contested and material to her conviction. Wombold\u2019s strategy at trial was to claim that she did not know of Graham and Garcia\u2019s plan to refund at numerous Meijer stores and that the assistance she provided them for their trip was purely altruistic. The Government attempted to show at trial that Wombold either knew of the refunding scheme or was willfully ignorant of it. Evidence that Wombold had helped Graham purchase an improperly discounted rug would have been highly probative of her knowledge or willful ignorance, and its probative value would have outweighed any unfair prejudice. This cross-examination, of course, did not yield that evidence, but instead elicited a denial of any knowledge or involvement with Graham\u2019s purchase of a discounted rug.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The defendant in the similar case of <em>United States v. Reese, </em>568 F.2d 1246, 1249-50 (6th Cir.1977), testified on direct that he did not know that the plywood he was charged with transporting in interstate commerce was stolen. The government, during its cross-examination, asked the defendant about alleged previous instances where he had purchased stolen property. <em>Id. </em>at 1249. We ruled that the cross-examination was proper under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>404(b) to show motive, intent, and knowledge. <em>Id. </em>In a similar fashion, the Government\u2019s cross-examination below was proper to test Wombold\u2019s claim that she did not have knowledge of Graham\u2019s refunding scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Whether the district court erred in failing to give a limiting instruction regarding this cross-examination raises a somewhat more difficult question. We have held that after other acts testimony is admitted the \u201cjury <em>must </em>be \u2018clearly, simply, and correctly instructed concerning the narrow and limited purpose for which the evidence may be considered.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jobson, </em>102 F.3d 214, 222 (6th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>27 F.3d 1186, 1193 (6th Cir.1994)) (emphasis added). The court\u2019s instruction must specifically include the reason for which the jury may utilize the other acts evidence. <em>Id. See also Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d at 1077 (stating as mandatory the limiting instruction requirement). <em>But see Johnson, </em>27 F.3d at 1193 (stating the limiting instruction requirement in permissive terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Our later cases have not construed the <em>Memweather </em>jury instruction requirement as mandatory. <em>See Miller, </em>115 F.3d at 366 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that the district court committed reversible error because it violated <em>Merriiveather </em>and did not give a contemporaneous instruction). Further, <em>Memiveather </em>and <em>Jobson </em>are easily distinguishable from the case at hand. In those cases, not only were contemporaneous objections properly raised to the introduction of the challenged evidence, the evidence ,itself clearly was Rule 404(b) evidence. Here, Wombold\u2019s attorney made no contemporaneous objection to the cross-examination; whether that evidence was in fact Rule 404(b) evidence is not at all clear; and Wombold\u2019s counsel, after raising an objection to the court\u2019s failure to give a Rule 404(b) instruction, decided against pursuing the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">When reviewing for plain error, we \u201cview the trial record as a whole to determine if the error seriously affected the fairness of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>20 F.3d 809, 815 (10th Cir.1994). Wombold has failed to demonstrate that any error with regard to the alleged Rule 404(b) evidence seriously affected the fairness of her trial. The evidence of Wombold\u2019s complicity in this conspiracy was abundant, and we find that there is no basis for believing that the cross-examination about the discounted rug might have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
