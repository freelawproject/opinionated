PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">Federal prisoner Miguel NavarreteCarrillo, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>seeks to appeal from the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his sentence. Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo pleaded guilty on January 30, 1998, to one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was sentenced to serve seventy-seven months in prison and did not appeal from his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">Over two years later, on February 16, 2001, Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, contending for the first time that his plea was involuntary and he would not have pleaded guilty if counsel had advised him that the government\u2019s evidence was invalidly obtained by use of a wiretap or that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), \u201cquantity under 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 841 would have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d R. Vol. 1, Doc. 1 at 5. The district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely filed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(1) (providing that one-year period of limitation generally runs from the date the judgment of conviction becomes final). The court also noted that \u201c[njeither the Supreme Court nor the Tenth Circuit ... has applied <em>Apprendi </em>retroactively,\u201d R. Vol. 1, Doc. 7 at 2, foreclosing any tolling of the statute of limitations. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(3) (providing tolling of one-year statute of limitation when the right asserted was newly recognized by the Supreme Court after appellant\u2019s conviction and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo must obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) by making a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When, as here, the district court has dismissed the case on procedural grounds without considering the underlying constitutional claim, the appellant must demonstrate that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo does not argue for a tolling of the limitations period, and we have no reason to question the district court\u2019s holding that his \u00a7 2255 motion was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Therefore, we conclude that jurists of reason would not \u201cfind it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Further, if we were to reach the merits, the record demonstrates that Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo\u2019s decision to plead guilty was based on the fact that his co-conspirator \u201cdecided to plead [guilty] on that last day [before trial] and turned State\u2019s evidence on [him],\u201d and not on any alleged wiretap evidence the government had obtained. Aplt. Br., App. A at 7 (Tr. of Sentencing Hr\u2019g). In addition, the indictment alleged that Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo \u201cpossessed with intent to distribute and/or distributed at least six ounces of methamphetamine during the course of the conspiracy,\u201d R. Supp\u2019l Vol. 1, Doc. 15 at 2, and he conceded at his sentencing hearing that \u201cthere were two instances in which [a witness] saw [him] deliver three ounces.\u201d Aplt. Br., App. A at 7. Under these circumstances, even if <em>Apprendi </em>applied retroactively, there would be no violation because Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and distribute at least six ounces of methamphetamine and the maximum sentence for that offense is twenty years under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>244 F.3d 1208, 1215 (10th Cir.) (noting that reversible <em>Apprendi </em>error arises only when drug quantity causes sentence to exceed the statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2619, 150 L.Ed.2d 773 (2001); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>237 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir.) (holding that, because neither \u00a7 841 nor \u00a7 846 require a specific quantity of drugs as an element of the offense and the maximum sentence under these statutes was twenty years, no <em>Apprendi </em>violation occurred where defendant sentenced to less than twenty years), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 987, 121 S.Ct. 1637, 149 L.Ed.2d 497 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">Mr. Navarrete-Carrillo\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED and the case is DISMISSED. His motion to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>in this court is GRANTED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
