Because we determine that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the father's untimely\n   filed postjudgment motions seeking a new trial, we direct the juvenile court to vacate the orders granting a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 20, 2017, the juvenile court entered separate judgments terminating the father's parental rights to two children. On July 6, 2017, the father, with the assistance of counsel, filed a motion in each case seeking a new trial in which he asserted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"1) On May 20, 2017, this Honorable Court held a final hearing terminating the Father's parental rights in the above-styled matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"2) On June 20, 2017, this Honorable Court entered a final order terminating the Father's rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"3) The Father was not transported for the final hearing on May 20, 2017, and counsel for the Father was not aware the final order was entered until July 7, 2017, as she has been out of town since the week of June 17, 2017.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"4) As the Father was not transported from the Limestone County Correctional Facility for any hearings, he respectfully requests a new termination hearing where he may be present and present testimony in support of his parental rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Wherefore, above premises considered, the Father respectfully requests this Honorable Court set this matter for a new hearing on this the 6th day of July, 2017.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 10, 2017, the juvenile court entered an order in each case setting the father's postjudgment motions for a hearing to be held on July 13, 2017. On July 14, 2017, the juvenile court granted the father's motions for a new trial and set the cases for a termination-of-parental-rights trial to be held on July 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 18, 2017, DHR filed motions seeking to have the juvenile court set aside its orders granting a new trial. DHR asserted, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"3. On July 14, 2017, this court entered an order granting the father's motion and scheduling a new hearing on July 28, 2017, which was electronically filed with the clerk's office on July 14, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"4. DHR maintains that this court's order of July 14, 2017, is improper and that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter same in that the court lost jurisdiction to do so after July 5, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"5. DHR maintains that the father's postjudgment motion was denied by operation of law after July 5, 2017, which was the last day for filing same. The 14 days allowed for filing said postjudgment motion would ordinarily have expired on July 4, 2017, but since that day was an Alabama state holiday and the court was closed to business the father would have been allowed an additional day, July 5, 2017, to file said motion. His failing to file same until July 6, 2017, makes said motion untimely, thus the order granting same is void and due to be set aside.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 26, 2017, the juvenile court denied DHR's motions. On July 27, 2017, DHR filed a motion seeking to stay the termination-of-parental-rights trial, which the juvenile court granted. On August 3, 2017, DHR filed a single notice of appeal to this court, referencing both of the underlying cases. This court docketed two separate appeals and then ordered the appeals consolidated. The father has not filed anything with this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DHR asserts that its motions seeking to set aside the July 14, 2017, orders that granted the father's motions\n   for a new trial were filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), Ala. R. Civ. P. A party may appeal from the denial of relief under Rule 60(b)(4). See\n   <em>\n    Insurance Mgmt. &amp; Admin., Inc. v. Palomar Ins.

Code 1975, provides for an appeal \"from an order granting or refusing a motion for a new trial by the circuit court,\" this court has held that \u00a7 12-22-10 is inapplicable to juvenile-court orders granting a new trial.\n   <em>\n    J.A.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663579\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/238/675/\">\n    238 So.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Generally, a mandamus petition must \"be filed within a reasonable time.\" Rule 21(a)(3), Ala. R. App. P. The presumptively reasonable time for filing a petition for the writ of mandamus is the same as the time for taking an appeal, which, in a juvenile action, is within 14 days of the entry of the challenged order. See Rule 21(a)(3), Ala. R. App. P., and\n   <em>\n    Ex parte R.W.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7044698\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/41/800/#p804\">\n    41 So.3d 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 804 (Ala.

Although DHR filed motions seeking to set aside the juvenile court's July 14 orders, this court has explained that, \" 'unlike a postjudgment motion following a final judgment, a motion to reconsider an interlocutory order does not toll the presumptively reasonable time period that a party has to petition an appellate court for a writ of mandamus.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte C.J.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7063959\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/12/1214/#p1216\">\n    12 So.3d 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1216 (Ala.

Thus, DHR's petitions were not filed within the presumptively reasonable time, and the petitions failed to \"include a statement of circumstances constituting good cause for the appellate court to consider the petition, notwithstanding that it was filed beyond the presumptively reasonable\n   time.\" Rule 21(a)(3), Ala.

The father's motions for a new trial were not filed until July 6, 2017, which was beyond the 14-day jurisdictional time limit. Rule 1(B). The father's postjudgment motions were required to be filed no later than July 5, 2017; although 14 days from June 20 is July 4, because that day is a state holiday, the father had until the next day, July 5, to file his motions.
