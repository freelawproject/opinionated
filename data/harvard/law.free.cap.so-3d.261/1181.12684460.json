We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In May 2008, Alfonzo Morris was convicted of two counts of capital murder for the intentional killing of Miriam Rochester during the course of a first-degree burglary, \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(4), Ala.Code 1975, and the intentional killing of Miriam Rochester during the course of a first-degree robbery, \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(2), Ala.Code 1975. Following a sentencing hearing, the jury recommended, by a vote of 10-2, that Morris be sentenced to death. After the trial court held the final sentencing hearing, the court sentenced Morris to death. This Court affirmed Morris's convictions and death sentence.\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Rochester had transformed her home into a duplex and had taken in a boarder, Elizabeth Russell, who was also elderly and in poor health. The two ladies had become friends, and, on the night of the offense, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Rochester telephoned one of Russell's sons to inform him that Russell had become ill and was being taken to the hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"A rescue unit and fire engine arrived at the house at approximately 9:00 p.m. and were shown to Russell by Rochester. The paramedic who was the driver of the rescue unit testified that the 'house was very neat and orderly.' (R. 201.) After Russell was assessed and the ambulance called, the paramedic testified that she went outside to check on her truck. She testified that she saw someone 'fooling around my rescue unit acting like he was looking in the windows, fooling with the doors.' (R. 203.) She then asked the person if there was a problem and if she could help him. The man, whom she identified in court as Morris, walked up to her and asked what was happening and who was sick; he insisted that he wanted to go inside the house. The paramedic testified that at one point Morris attempted to bypass her and enter the house, but she prevented him from doing so. He told her that 'he lived in that area and he knew everybody and he had a right to go in there.' (R. 205.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Although Morris smelled strongly of alcohol, the paramedic testified that Morris understood what she was telling him and that his responses were appropriate. As the paramedic saw the rescue crew carrying Russell out to the ambulance, she also saw Morris finally turn and walk away. The paramedic thereafter stepped into the ambulance and through the opened back doors of\n   the vehicle saw that Morris had returned. She informed her partner that Morris had been causing trouble previously, and her partner instructed him to leave. The paramedic testified that she saw Morris walk approximately half of a block away as the rescue crew left.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"At approximately 10:00 p.m., Russell's son telephoned Rochester to update her on Russell's condition. He received a call from his brother about an hour later, informing him that the brother had been to Rochester's house at his mother's request and that the door was open and the house appeared to have been ransacked. Both of Russell's sons then went to the house and without entering determined that the house had been vandalized. They attempted to telephone Rochester and then telephoned the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The police and rescue units arrived around midnight, among them the same paramedic who had earlier cared for Russell. She testified that she originally believed that Russell was the deceased. However, because of the number of police officers present, she determined that the death was not believed to be due to natural causes. She informed the officers that she had been called to the house earlier on that night and that the house had not been in disarray. She also told them about Morris's presence and behavior. She did not know his name at that time but gave the officers his description.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The first officer who had arrived at the scene testified that there were 'pry marks' on the door, indicating forced entry. (R. 261.) He took a description from the paramedic of the man who had attempted to gain entry into the house and, after the scene was processed, he left at approximately 4:00 a.m. and resumed his patrol of the area. At approximately 5:00 a.m., he observed a man fitting the description of the person who had earlier attempted to enter Rochester's house. The man appeared to be intoxicated and was staggering down the middle of the street. The officer asked the man questions and he responded in a 'slurred, but logical way.' (R. 265.) The officer determined that it was not safe for the man to continue and arrested him for public intoxication. The officer identified Morris at trial as the man he had arrested. He asked the man if he was carrying any weapons, and he responded that he had a pocketknife in his right front pocket. (R. 267.) He also stated that he had other items in his pockets that he described as 'junk.' (R. 267.) The officer stated that the items were pieces of costume jewelry. He also had a couple of pills and a cigarette in his pockets. Morris identified himself as 'Anthony Morris' and gave the officer an address for his residence.\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   (R. 270.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Before the officer left the scene of Morris's arrest, the paramedic was brought to that location to determine if she could identify him as the man she had seen earlier. The paramedic testified that she was certain that he was the man she had seen earlier at Rochester's house. (R. 223.) Morris was taken to the administrative building where officers concluded that he was too intoxicated to be interviewed. He was taken to jail for the night and interviewed the following day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Rochester's granddaughter and Russell's son identified some of the jewelry taken from Morris as belonging to the victim and Russell. Blood found on Morris's shoe was determined to be Rochester's and a cigarette butt found in the Rochester's house contained Morris's DNA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Morris testified at trial that he had been drinking on the day of the offense and had gotten into an argument with the man with whom he had been living. He left the house and eventually began gambling with a man known as 'Cue Ball.' (R. 433.) He testified that he won a bag of jewelry from 'Cue Ball and that, as he was attempting to gather the jewelry, 'Cue Ball' snatched money from him and a fight ensued. He stated that other gamblers got involved in the altercation, because they did not want him to leave since he was winning. Morris stated that he suffered cuts and bruises, as well as a laceration over his eye, in the altercation. He testified that 'Cue Ball' threw the jewelry at him and that he picked it up and walked to a Huddle House restaurant for breakfast. He stated that he became belligerent with the waitress because he had been drinking, and he was forced to leave. He also testified that after eating he put a cigarette in his mouth but did not light it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Morris testified that he then encountered a police officer who indicated that Morris appeared to have been drinking and arrested him for public intoxication. Morris stated that he was taken in the police car 'to the scene of a crime in a house' (R. 441), where a woman identified him. (R. 443-444.) While he was standing in front of the police vehicle, he stated that a dog 'came from somewhere' and ran around his feet. (R. 444.) He was subsequently taken to the hospital to treat the laceration to his eye and then was taken to the jail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   _______________\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"\n   <sup>\n    1\n   </sup>\n   It was later determined that Anthony Morris is Morris's brother and the address that he gave the officer was that of his brother.

On November 9, 2011, the State filed its answer and moved to dismiss Morris's petition. While the State's motion to dismiss was pending, Morris filed a response to the State's motion to dismiss, a discovery motion, and two motions for funds for expert assistance. On August 9, 2012, the circuit court entered an order summarily dismissing Morris' Rule 32 petition. On September 7, 2012, Morris filed a postjudgment motion in which he objected to the circuit court's adoption of the State's proposed order and to the circuit court's denial of his motions for discovery and for funds to hire experts, and he requested that the circuit court independently review the claims and grant him a new trial. The postjudgment motion was denied by operation of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On appeal Morris reasserts several of the claims he made in his Rule 32 petition.

More to the point, however, is the fact that even when a cumulative-effect analysis is considered, only claims that are properly pleaded and not otherwise due to be summarily dismissed are considered in that analysis. A cumulative-effect analysis does not eliminate the pleading requirements established in Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P. An analysis of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, including a cumulative-effect analysis, is performed only on properly pleaded claims that are not summarily dismissed for pleading deficiencies or on procedural grounds.

We have thoroughly reviewed the circuit court's order in light of the foregoing principles, and we conclude that the court did not confuse the burden of pleading with the burden of proof. Instead, the circuit court's lengthy order includes specific written findings that detail the pleading deficiencies in the petition, making it clear that the court recognized and applied the pleading requirements set forth above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Morris argues that the circuit court erred when it summarily dismissed the 19 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel he alleged in his petition.

In each of the cases from this Court that are cited above the appellants either listed or only briefly summarized numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that, they claimed, the circuit court had improperly dismissed. In each of those cases this Court held that the appellant had waived review of those claims for failing to comply with Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R.App. P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although Morris did not merely list or summarize the 19 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that, he says, were improperly dismissed, the mere \"cutting and pasting\" of each claim into the brief without providing any legal analysis, citation to authority, or argument supporting his assertion that dismissal was improper places him in the same position as the appellants in the foregoing cases-in violation of Rule 28(a)(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Morris argues in his reply brief that Rule 28(a)(10) does not require that appellants draft new arguments. He further argues that his brief contains ample support for his specific arguments, and \"[t]hat these are the same arguments [he] raised in his Rule 32 petition makes perfect sense.\" (Morris's reply brief, at p. 6.) He also argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"Confident in the soundness of the content of his Rule 32 petition, there was no need for [him] to alter or amend the substance of his arguments in response to the circuit court's cursory dismissal, particularly in light of the fact that Mr. Morris has never had the opportunity to be heard on these claims.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (Morris's reply brief, at p. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Morris misapprehends the requirements of Rule 28(a)(10). Morris's obligation as the appellant was to present an argument in support of his position on appeal, and his argument on appeal is that the circuit court erred when it dismissed the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. With respect to that issue, Morris was required to set out the reasons supporting his argument that the circuit court erred, with citations to legal authorities supporting that argument, and citation to parts of the record relied on as support for his claim of error. Morris's argument that the trial court improperly dismissed the 19 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is unsupported by any of the above. The mere repetition of the claims alleged in the Rule 32 petition does not provide any analysis of the circuit court's judgment of dismissal; obviously there was no judgment of dismissal until after the petition was filed. Therefore, Morris has waived these 19\n   claims of error, and we will not address them specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, even if Morris's brief satisfied the requirements in Rule 28(a)(10) and we addressed the claims on the merits, Morris would not be entitled relief. We have thoroughly reviewed Morris's petition and we conclude that all the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel listed above were insufficiently pleaded to satisfy the requirements in Rule 32.3 and Rule 32.6(b) ; therefore, summary dismissal of those claims was proper under Rule 32.7(d).

Specifically, he argues that \"the State failed to produce to him for independent DNA testing properly maintained samples of evidence recovered from the crime scene (a cigarette and a bologna sandwich).\" (Morris's brief, at p. 59.) He also argues that, because the State failed to provide properly maintained samples of the cigarette and the bologna sandwich, he \"was unable to adequately cross-examine the State's DNA expert on numerous important issues, including whether the State mishandled the samples during collection and testing,\" and he was prevented from determining through independent testing whether the samples contained DNA evidence. (Morris's brief, at p. 60.) He further argues that the State's failure to provide a sample of the cigarette prevented him from being able to determine whether the sample had degraded to the point that DNA testing would have been unreliable. The circuit dismissed the claim on the following grounds: That the claim was procedurally barred because it could have been, but was not, raised at trial and on appeal, Rule 32.2(a)(3) and (a)(5), Ala. R.Crim. P.; that the claim was insufficiently pleaded, Rule 32.6(b) and Rule 32.7(d), Ala. R.Crim.

He stated that the bologna was not suitable for any kind of forensic testing because of its degraded condition. (R. 390, trial transcript in CR-07-1997.) The forensic expert further testified that he had found DNA evidence on the filter of the cigarette recovered from the victim's house and that the DNA profile developed from that evidence matched Morris's DNA profile. He also testified that the procedure used to test the cigarette filter for DNA destroyed the filter. (R. 401, trial transcript in CR-07-1997.) However, the State's expert testified on cross-examination that a portion of the DNA extract-the substance that remained\n   after the cigarette filter and the sponge material in the filter were dissolved-remained for future testing if that was required. (R. 420, trial transcript in CR-07-1997.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Because Morris was aware at trial of the condition of the bologna and the cigarette, he could have raised the alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   issue at trial and on appeal, but he did not.

On the page of the opinion to which Morris directs our attention, the United States Supreme Court discusses the appellate review of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   \"When a defendant challenges a death sentence such as the one at issue in this case, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer-including an appellate court, to the extent it independently reweighs the evidence-would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.

He argues, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   \"The circuit court abdicated its responsibility to afford Mr. Morris meaningful review of his postconviction claims. The court's verbatim adoption of the State's proposed order is particularly egregious in a case like this that involves the death penalty. In this grave matter where a man's life is at stake, it was of paramount importance that the court engage in a thorough and meaningful review of Mr. Morris's numerous postconviction claims. The court's wholesale adoption of the State's proposed order calls into serious question whether the court conducted a thorough and meaningful review of Mr. Morris'[s] claims. By signing the State's proposed order without modification and denying Mr. Morris an evidentiary hearing, the court created the appearance of bias, prevented Mr. Morris from developing facts before an impartial decision maker, adjudicated his claims in an unreasonable manner, and violated his right to a fair postconviction review and to due process....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   (Morris's brief, at p. 67.)

Judge Tommy Nail presided over Morris's postconviction proceeding and he also presided over Morris's trial. Therefore, when Judge Nail stated in the final order that he had considered, among other things, the evidence presented at trial and his observations of the trial and of trial counsel's performance, there could be no claim that he lacked personal knowledge and could not have observed the trial, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ingram\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In fact, Morris does not argue that the record establishes that the final order was not the product of the circuit court's independent\n   judgment. Rather, he argues only that by adopting the State's proposed order the circuit court \"created the appearance of bias,\" and that the adoption of the order \"calls into serious question whether the court conducted a thorough and meaningful review of Mr. Morris'[s] claims.\" (Morris's brief, at p. 67.) Those arguments offer only speculation and conjecture. Morris presents no support from the record to demonstrate either bias from the court or the lack of meaningful review of his claims. Furthermore, \"there is nothing definitive in the record or on the face of the order that indicates that the order is not the product of the trial court's independent judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7015460\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/105/1250/\">\n    105 So.3d at 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Therefore, Morris is not entitled to relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Morris states that the circuit court erred in denying him the opportunity to fully litigate his claims.

The circuit court denied the motions. On appeal, Morris argues that he showed \"good cause\" and was entitled to the records so that he could develop and present evidence to prove his allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Land\n   </em>\n   , the Alabama Supreme Court addressed the proper standard by which discovery requests filed by a petitioner in a postconviction proceeding are to be judged. The Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   \"[The] holding-that postconviction discovery motions are to be judged by a good-cause standard-does not automatically allow discovery under Rule 32, Ala. R.Crim. P., and ... does not expand the discovery procedures within Rule 32.4.... By adopting this standard, we are only recognizing that a trial court, upon a petitioner's showing of good cause, may exercise its inherent authority to order discovery in a proceeding for postconviction relief. In addition, we caution that postconviction discovery does not provide a petitioner with a right to 'fish' through official files and that it 'is not a device for investigating possible claims, but a means of vindicating actual claims.'\n   <em>\n    People v. Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4457889\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/51/1179/\">\n    51 Cal.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=275%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20729\">\n    275 Cal.Rptr. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=800%20P.2d%201159\">\n    800 P.2d 1159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Instead, in order to obtain discovery, a petitioner must allege facts that, if proved, would entitle him to relief. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Furthermore, a petitioner seeking postconviction discovery also must meet the requirements of Rule 32.6(b), Ala. R.Crim. P., which states:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   \" 'The petition must contain a clear and specific statement of the grounds upon which relief is sought, including full disclosure of the factual basis of those grounds. A bare allegation that a constitutional right has been violated\n   and mere conclusions of law shall not be sufficient to warrant any further proceedings.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   \"That having been said, we must determine whether Land presented the trial court with good cause for ordering the requested discovery. To do that, we must examine Land's basis for the relief requested in his postconviction petition and determine whether his claims are facially meritorious. Only after making that examination and determination can we determine whether Land has shown good cause.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Land\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11084421\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/775/847/\">\n    775 So.2d at 852-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Morris was not entitled to discovery, because the claims for which he sought discovery were either insufficiently pleaded, procedurally barred, or meritless, and they were dismissed. We have held in the previous sections of this opinion that the circuit court did not err by summarily dismissing Morris's claims, and it follows that Morris did not meet the good-cause standard for obtaining postconviction discovery. Accordingly, the circuit court did not commit error when it denied Morris's postconviction discovery requests. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Davis v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6827827\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/184/415/#p447\">\n    184 So.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (Ala.Crim.App.2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Morris argues that the circuit court erred when it denied his requests for funds to hire experts. Specifically, he argues that the circuit court's denial of funds for a mental-health expert or a social worker and for a forensic expert prevented him from developing the claims in his petition and that this denial deprived him of his right to due process and equal protection. As the State correctly argues, however, this Court has held repeatedly that indigent defendants are not entitled to funds to hire experts to assist in postconviction litigation. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Van Pelt v.

The circuit court committed no error in denying Morris's motions for funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   X.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Morris's final argument is: \"The cumulative effect of the errors of state and federal law alleged in this brief and in Mr. Morris's Rule 32 petition violate Mr. Morris's rights to due process and a fair trial protected by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Alabama law.\" (Morris's brief, at p. 75.) Morris did not raise this claim in his petition; therefore, it is not properly before this Court for review. E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ray v.
