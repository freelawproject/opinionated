Brown\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a declaratory judgment action arising out of the validity of an Agreement Before Marriage (the \"Agreement\") entered into by Appellant, David A. Pirner (\"Mr. Pirner\") and Appellee, Karen L. Brady (\"Ms. Brady\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following their marriage, the couple filed for a divorce. In turn, Ms. Brady filed two separate petitions seeking declaratory judgments regarding the Agreement. The district court rendered two separate judgments in favor of Ms. Brady-one on July 29, 2016 and the other on February 6, 2018. Mr. Pirner seeks appellate review of the district court's February 6, 2018 judgment. Ms. Brady filed a motion to dismiss the appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we deny the motion to dismiss appeal and affirm the district court's February 6, 2018 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time the Agreement was executed by the couple, Mr. Pirner resided in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Ms. Brady resided in New Orleans, Louisiana. The\n   Agreement stated that the couple was entering the Agreement \"in consideration of their marriage and life together.\" The Agreement provided in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Separate Property to Remain Separate\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2.1 Each of [sic] DAVID and KAREN hereby acknowledges and agrees that all of the assets listed on the attached Schedule A, including all of KAREN'S and DAVID'S copyrights, royalties, and any property acquired by bequest, devise, descent or gift, and the appreciation thereof and the income and proceeds derived therefrom are, and shall remain, the separate property (hereinafter referred to as the \"Separate Property\") of DAVID and KAREN, as the case may be. Each of [sic] DAVID and KAREN shall keep and retain sole ownership, control and enjoyment of all such property and expectancies. The income, appreciation, and proceeds of such Separate Property derived therefrom, shall remain the Separate Property of DAVID or KAREN, as the case may be, whether or not due to the other's direct or indirect contributions or efforts of others, including DAVID or KAREN, or to inflation or market conditions. At any time, DAVID or KAREN shall be free to sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any part of his or her Separate Property, as he or she may determine, as effectively as though he or she were unmarried. Upon such sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, any proceeds or property resulting therefrom, whether maintained in separate accounts or commingled with other property, shall remain his or her Separate Property. Without limiting the foregoing in any way, DAVID and KAREN hereby expressly renounce, waive, relinquish and release any right to claim any Separate Property of the other, or any interest in such property under any equitable distribution, special equity, community property, quasi-community property, dower, curtesy, or similar law or rule of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2.2 Any property acquired by either or both of the Parties following their date of marriage, excluding any copyrights and royalties from such copyrights and Separate Property as defined in this Agreement, shall be deemed to be Marital Property. Any property, including Separate Property, transferred to the parties jointly, or used to purchase property in joint names shall be Marital Property, unless expressly agreed by DAVID and KAREN otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.3 The earnings, other income and future copyrights of each party shall be and remain his or her Separate Property. Neither one will at any time or under any circumstances make a claim against the earnings or other income of the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Debt\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Neither party shall assume or become responsible for the payment of the other's premarital debts ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Rights Upon Termination of Marriage\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   4.2 In the event an action for termination of the marriage is commenced after the date of the marriage by either DAVID and KAREN or by both of them jointly, then DAVID and KAREN specifically waive any right, claim, or interest to or in real or personal Separate Property that each of them now owns and in property that either of them may hereafter acquire held or owned singly [sic] in the name of either DAVID or KAREN. Neither DAVID nor KAREN shall seek spousal support or temporary\n   spousal support or any award of property, maintenance, \"equitable distribution\" distributive award, alimony or other order concerning the division of their property. Any Property acquired jointly during the marriage shall be distributed as DAVID and KAREN may agree; and if no agreement has been made previously, or if none can be reached on termination of the marriage, then such jointly owned property shall be distributed equally to DAVID and KAREN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4.2.1 If, after one full \"calendar year\", as hereinafter defined, of DAVID and KAREN'S marriage, a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final decree of divorce dissolving DAVID and KAREN'S marriage, from which no further appeal can be taken, then within thirty (30) days of the entry of said decree, DAVID shall pay to KAREN such sum as described in Schedule C annexed hereto. Any payment made in accordance with this provision shall not be designated as a payment which is not includible in income under Section 71 of the Internal Revenue Service Code, or allowable as a deduction under Section 215 of the Internal Revenue Service Code, as permitted. Upon the payment of such sum to KAREN, DAVID shall have no further obligation to pay any maintenance, spousal support or transfer any other property whatsoever to KAREN ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Occupancy of the Existing Premises.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   5.3 DAVID and KAREN are presently the owners of the premises located at 1331 Pine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70118 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Jointly Owned Premises\"). The provisions of this Article 5 shall apply to the Minneapolis Premises, New Orleans Premises and Jointly Owned Premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   5.5 KAREN and DAVID agree that upon the occurrence of a Termination Event, the Jointly Owned Premises shall be sold within a reasonable period of time. Upon the sale of the Jointly Owned Premises, DAVID shall be reimbursed for the full down payment he had made in the amount of One Hundred Sixty-Two Thousand Five Hundred and Eight Dollars ($162,508), which was contributed by DAVID towards the purchase of the Jointly Owned Premises. After the deduction of the outstanding mortgage and usual closing costs, the balance of the net proceeds, if any, shall be divided equally between DAVID and KAREN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Agreement had a severability clause which provided \"[i]f any provision of this Agreement should hereafter be determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the balance of this Agreement ....\" The Agreement further provided that any dispute regarding the Agreement should be brought in a Minnesota Court and be construed by Minnesota law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 16, 2015, Ms. Brady filed, in the district court, a Petition for Declaratory Judgment (the \"First Petition\") alleging the Agreement \"establishing a regime of separation of property and reservation of fruits and revenues as separate property is invalid and ineffective due to lack of form and lack of filing for registry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 17, 2015, Mr. Pirner filed a Declinatory Exception of Improper Venue as to the First Petition asserting that the parties had agreed, as set forth in the Agreement, that the State of Minnesota would interpret the Agreement. On November 3, 2015, the district court overruled the exception on the ground it was untimely filed. Mr. Pirner did not seek review of the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On July 29, 2016, a hearing was held on the First Petition, and the district court rendered judgment in favor of Ms. Brady. The July 29, 2016 judgment provided that the portion of the Agreement \"purporting to establish a regime of separation of property between the parties\" and \"to reserve the fruits and revenues of separate property\" was invalid as to form; thus, a community of acquets and gains existed between Ms. Brady and Mr. Pirner during their marriage. Mr. Pirner did not seek review of the July 29, 2016 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 28, 2017, Ms. Brady filed, in the district court, a Petition for Declaratory Judgment or Alternatively, to Establish Final Spousal Support (the \"Second Petition\") requesting a judgment declaring that certain provisions of Agreement were valid and enforceable including Mr. Pirner paying Ms. Brady a sum of $175,000, and the property located at 1331 Pine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, be sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The couple agreed to submit the Second Petition on memorandum only to the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court, on February 6, 2018, rendered judgment finding the Agreement was \"a valid and enforceable contract between the parties in accordance with Louisiana law-except as provided for within the July 29, 2016 Judgment ....\" The district court issued written reasons which provided in pertinent part:\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Karen L. Brady argues that the Agreement-while invalid in form as a matrimonial agreement and reservation of fruits-remains an enforceable contract in accordance with Louisiana law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   In opposition, David A. Pirner contends that the entire Agreement comprises a matrimonial agreement, which has been deemed null by this Court, and thus is unenforceable. In particular, [David] retorts that the nullity of the contract as a matrimonial agreement and reservation of fruits vitiates his consent-one of the requirements for the formation of a contract under Louisiana law. Under Louisiana Civil Code Article 1831, the burden of proof on this issue is twofold. First, [Karen] must establish that an obligation exists between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Civ. Code Art. 1831. Meanwhile, [David] must prove that said obligation is null.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   In accordance with Louisiana law, the Court finds that the Agreement is a valid and enforceable contract between the parties-except as provided for within the July 29, 2016 Judgment of this Court. The Agreement at issue is an act under private signature, signed by the parties on April 13, 2009. Therein, the parties purported to (1) establish a legal regime of separation of property, (2) reserve fruits and revenues of their separate property, and (3) create ancillary contractual obligations to have effect following the parties' separation, if such occurs. While the former two (2) provisions are null as to lack of appropriate form, the remainder of the Agreement is valid as an act under private signature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Furthermore, the parties' consent was not vitiated when this Court held that the Agreement is null as an establishment of a legal regime of separation of property and reservation of fruits and revenues of the parties' separate property. Pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code Article 1927, \"[a] contract is formed by the consent of the parties established through offer and acceptance.\" Here, the Agreement clearly evidences the consent of the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he Agreement does not include a contingency provision which bases the contractual obligations therein on the validity of the matrimonial agreement. Instead, the parties agreed to the following term therein:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   12.\n   <em>\n    Enforceability and Severability[.]\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If any provision of this Agreement should hereafter be determined to be wholly or partially unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the balance of this Agreement, and the balance shall be construed by the appropriate court of the State of Minnesota in a manner which such court deems to be reasonable and consistent with the intent of the parties at the time of the making of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    [NOTE: As stated, the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans is the appropriate venue for this matter due to the untimely filing of Mr. Pirner's Declinatory Exception of Improper Venue.]\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Based on the clear language of the Agreement, the parties intended for the Agreement to remain enforceable despite any potential nullity or invalidity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On February 15, 2018, Ms. Brady filed a Motion for Partial New Trial or Reconsideration, or, Alternatively, for a Rule to Show Cause (the \"Motion for Partial New Trial\") asserting in part that the February 6, 2018 judgment did not include an order for payment of $175,000.00 by Mr. Pirner to Ms. Brady and an order that the 1331 Pine Street property be sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On February 26, 2018, Mr. Pirner filed a motion for a devolutive appeal of the February\n   6, 2018 judgment. The district court denied the motion writing \"partial new trial motion is pending.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On May 4, 2018, Mr. Pirner filed a motion for devolutive appeal again seeking review of the February 6, 2018 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Three days later, on May 7, 2018, the couple entered a consent judgment on the Motion for Partial New Trial which significantly provided that Mr. Pirner pay Ms. Brady $175,000 cash and the property at 1331 Pine Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, be sold by private sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On that same day, May 7, 2018, the district court granted Mr. Pirner's appeal on the February 6, 2018 judgment. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Ms. Brady filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal asserting this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction because the February 6, 2018 judgment was a partial judgment which the district court had not designated as a final judgment, and the parties entered a consent judgment on May 7, 2018, which is non-appealable and/or renders the February 6, 2018 judgment moot. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As will be discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he purpose of a declaratory judgment is to establish the rights of the parties or express the opinion of the court on a question of law without ordering anything to be done.\"\n   <em>\n    Bergen Brunswig Drug Co. v.

Ms. Brady's Motion for Partial New Trial did not alter the character of the February 6, 2017 judgment; rather, it ordered Mr. Pirner to comply with the terms of the Agreement that were found to be valid. Accordingly, Ms. Brady's Motion to Dismiss Appeal is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION ON THE MERITS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On appeal, Mr. Pirner challenges the district court's February 6, 2018 judgment asserting that the district court, in granting declaratory relief to Mrs. Brady, committed legal error by (1) giving effect to certain provisions in the Agreement after declaring it null and void; and (2) giving effect to the severability clause after declaring the Agreement null and void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Pirner states that there are no factual issues in dispute-only legal issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The purpose of a declaratory judgment was addressed by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Bergen Brunswig Drug Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11317373\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/639/453/#p455\">\n    639 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   455-56 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The purpose of a declaratory judgment pursuant to these codal provisions is simply to establish the rights of the parties or express the opinion of the court on a question of law without ordering anything to be done.\n   <em>\n    Watts v.
