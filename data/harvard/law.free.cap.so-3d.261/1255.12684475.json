We have jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   art. V, \u00a7 3(b)(1), Fla. Const.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970955\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/946/#p953\">\n    137 So.3d 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (Fla. 2013). On direct appeal, we affirmed her convictions and sentences, including a sentence of death for the murder, and summarized the guilt-phase evidence as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   Johnny [Dublin, Wenda Wright's domestic partner], testified that on the day Wright went missing, Allen came to Dublin and Wright's house and whispered something into Wright's ear. In response, Wright and Allen left the house together. A little while later, Allen returned to Dublin's house and told Dublin that Wright stole about $ 2000 of Allen's money and Allen asked Dublin if she could search his house. Dublin obliged and Allen searched Dublin's house. Dublin testified that he noticed that Allen had scratches on her when she came back to his house. Dublin asked Allen where Wright was, and Allen responded that she was still at Allen's house. Dublin testified that the next day, Allen came back to his house and asked him where Wright was. Dublin testified that Quintin [Allen, a neighbor and friend of Allen] was with Allen. Quintin ... testified for the State ... that he was at Allen's house on the day of the murder when Allen noticed that her purse was missing. Allen left her house, ... returned ... with Wright and asked Quintin to come inside. Allen told Quintin that Wright must have stolen Allen's purse because Wright was the only person at Allen's house before the purse went missing. Allen and Quintin searched for the purse. Allen left the house again and told Quintin not to let Wright leave if she tried. At one point while Allen was gone, Wright tried to\n   leave; Quintin told Wright that Allen wanted her to stay, and Wright obliged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon Allen's return, Quintin plaited Allen's hair. Quintin testified that at one point Wright started crying and begged Allen to let her go home. Wright attempted to leave Allen's house and Allen hit Wright on the head; Wright fell to the ground. Quintin testified that Allen had a gun and told him that if he did not help her with Wright, she would shoot him, so Quintin held Wright down on the floor. While he held Wright down, Allen found chemicals including bleach, fingernail polish remover, rubbing alcohol and hair spritz and poured them all onto Wright's face. At one point, one of Allen's children walked into the room in which this was taking place, and Allen told the child to rip off a piece of duct tape for Allen. Allen attempted to put the duct tape over Wright's mouth, but because Wright's face was wet from the chemicals that were poured on her face, the duct tape would not stick to her skin. Allen retrieved belts from her closet and beat Wright with them. Quintin then tied Wright's feet together with one of the belts. Quintin testified that at that point Wright was not struggling. Allen then put one of the belts around Wright's neck and pulled. At one point, Wright said, \"Please, stop. Please stop. I am going to piss myself.\" Wright's body started shaking and after about three minutes, Wright did not move. Allen then told Quintin to get some sheets to tie Wright's hands together in case Wright woke up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Quintin left soon after the incident. Allen called Quintin throughout the night, but he did not answer her calls. The next day, Allen found Quintin at the barbershop. Quintin testified that Allen still had the gun. Quintin got into the truck that Allen was driving; James Martin [a friend of Allen] was also in the truck. Allen told Quintin that Wright was dead. Allen then told Quintin that he had to help her get rid of the body. Allen, Quintin, and Martin drove to Lowe's to buy plywood to help move Wright's body from inside the house into the truck. They also borrowed a dolly hand truck from a local shop to help move the body. Quintin testified that upon returning to Allen's house, Wright's body had been moved from where he had last seen her and had been wrapped in Allen's carpet. They were eventually able to get Wright's body into the truck. Then, all three took shovels from Allen's mother's tool shed and drove to an area off of the highway to dump Wright's body. Quintin and Martin dug a hole while Allen stood as a lookout. They placed Wright's body in the hole, covered the hole with debris, and took the carpet with them. They threw the carpet into a dumpster outside of a truck stop and picked up Allen's daughter from school. Quintin went to the police and turned himself in. Quintin also took the police to the place where Wright's body had been buried.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   James Martin testified ... that on the day of the murder, he was at Allen's house helping her repair a car. Allen asked Martin to help her search for her purse, and Martin did. He testified that he left Allen's house around 10 p.m. to get a starter belt for the car. Martin finished repairing the car and asked Allen if she had any cocaine. She did not, so Martin left Allen's house, found cocaine, came back to Allen's house, and smoked it. Martin testified that when he got back from finding the cocaine, Wright was the only one at Allen's house. Martin testified that the timing of the events of the day was unclear because he had been high. Martin testified that he slept at Allen's house until the\n   morning and got a ride from Allen when she took her children to school. At that point, Allen told Martin that she needed help. Allen and Martin went back to Allen's house, and Martin saw Wright's body. Martin testified that Allen told him, \"He must have hit her too hard.\" Martin testified that he noticed a bandana tied around Wright's hands. Allen told Martin that they had to bury Wright's body. Allen sent Martin to Allen's brother's house to borrow a truck. Martin testified that the truck was never found by police. Martin testified that the entire plan, including getting the plywood at Lowe's was Allen's idea. Martin testified that he was the only smoker of the group, and he dumped all of the ashtrays out of the car after they buried the body. When they got back to Allen's house, Quintin left, and Martin cleaned the nylon strap that had been used to secure the carpet around Wright's body. Martin also washed the truck but testified that he did not know what became of the vehicle. Martin was at Allen's house when the police came to Allen's house with a search warrant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Denise Fitzgerald, a crime scene technician, testified that she exhumed Wright's body and located a cigarette butt in the vicinity. The State and defense stipulated that the DNA found on the cigarette butt was consistent with Martin's DNA. Dr. Sajid Qaiser, a forensic pathologist and chief medical examiner for Brevard County, testified that ... a body cannot bruise once dead and that Wright had bruising in the following places: upper and lower eye lid, front and back of her ear, left torso, all over the left side, trunk, right hand, thigh, knee, left eyebrow, forehead, upper arm and shoulder area. Additionally, Wright's chest, hands, torso, face, and lower lip had contusions. Wright's wrist showed signs of ligation, meaning her hands were tied. Wright's neck showed signs of ligation, meaning that she was either hung or something was tied tightly around her neck. Dr. Qaiser testified that his medical conclusion was that Wright's death was the result of homicidal violence, and strangulation and ligature were an important cause of death. Dr. Qaiser testified that Wright was morbidly obese, with an enlarged heart, which contributed to her death. He testified that it would take from four to six minutes of strangulation to die. He could not tell whether she was rendered unconscious during the beating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970955\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/946/#p953\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970955\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/946/#p953\">\n    at 951-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

State\n   </em>\n   claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Allen appealed the denial of her rule 3.851 motion, arguing that the postconviction court erred with respect to the following claims: (1) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to improper prosecutorial comments and misstatements and for failing to move for a mistrial during guilt phase closings; (2) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present certain mitigation evidence; (3) that trial counsel was ineffective for eliciting testimony from former-codefendant-turned-State-witness Quintin that Allen poured chemicals on the victim; (4) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Dr. Qaiser's testimony that unconscious people feel pain; (5) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object and move for a mistrial during penalty phase closings based on prosecutorial misconduct; (6) that trial counsel was ineffective for asking if Allen became a part of the culture of \"drugs, thugs, and violence\"; (7) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call his own forensic expert; (8) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Quintin with prior inconsistent statements; (9) that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately challenge or strike a juror during voir dire; (10) that the State committed a\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   violation by eliciting and failing to correct false testimony that Allen was convicted several times for selling drugs; and (11) that Allen is entitled to a new penalty phase under\n   <em>\n    Hurst v.

Allen also claims that counsel should have objected when the prosecutor denied that evidence of a plea offer to Allen existed, and that counsel should have requested that the jury be instructed about the plea offer discussions that took place. This claim is without merit because Allen has failed to establish prejudice. There is not a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's failure to object, the outcome would have been different. Allen is therefore not entitled to relief on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Subclaim 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Allen claims that trial counsel should have objected when the prosecutor stated that petechia results from a tight strangulation. Allen argues that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced her jury because it reduced doubt in the jury members' minds that strangulation actually occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The record shows that in the guilt phase closing argument, the prosecutor stated that \"[Allen] is the one holding that belt around her neck so tightly that it would even cause petechia, the little pinpoint blood vessels that pop in your eyes. Okay? So tight that Dr. Qaiser said that you don't get it unless it is held real tight.\" On cross-examination, Dr. Qaiser testified that \"whenever the strangulation is complete and really tight, you won't see petechia\" and noted that he \"did not see\" evidence of petechia in the autopsy photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Allen has failed to demonstrate that counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's misstatement prejudiced her. The evidence presented at trial showed that\n   Wright was tortured, bound, and strangled by Allen. Whether petechia occurred from the strangulation of Wright does not weaken the evidence made available to the jury. Further, the jury heard from Dr. Qaiser that petechia does not occur during a tight strangulation, and that the autopsy photos did not reveal that petechia occurred. In light of this, there is no reasonable probability that, but for counsel's failure to object, the outcome would have been different. Our confidence in the outcome is not undermined.

In the guilt phase closing argument, the prosecutor made the following statement: \"[Y]ou can take this for discussion, that placing a rope around someone's neck and holding it there for three or four minutes, because that is what Dr. Qaiser said it would take, okay, three or four minutes, all right, that may have some aspects of premeditation here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Allen has failed to demonstrate prejudice. The prosecutor's statement that it takes \"three or four\" minutes to die of strangulation was not wholly inconsistent with the evidence presented at trial that it takes \"four to six minutes\" to die of strangulation, because \"four\" is a correct amount of time. Allen has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for hearing the misstated amount of time, the jurors would not have found Allen guilty.

Failure to properly investigate and present additional mitigation evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Allen argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present certain mitigating evidence about Allen's traumatic background and mental health during the penalty phase. Specifically, she claims that additional mitigation evidence should have been uncovered and presented, including the existence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and extensive sexual and physical abuse. We conclude that the absence of this mitigating evidence does not satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's requirement of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, Allen presented the testimony of Allen's former boyfriend, who testified that he sold drugs with Allen and frequently physically abused her throughout the duration of their relationship. He recounted instances of extremely violent episodes, described Allen having frequent anxiety attacks, and stated that he could not say whether he would have testified at trial had he been asked. He further testified, inconsistently with his other statements, that he also believed that he either more than likely or would have spoken with the defense team had they approached him. He testified that at the time of Allen's trial in 2010, he was living in a federal halfway house after serving ten years in prison. In addition, another of Allen's aunts gave extensive and detailed testimony that Allen suffered physical and sexual abuse as a child at the hands of her mother, grandfather, and brother and that she experienced severe domestic violence as an adult. She stated that Allen suffered from intense anxiety and that she would have testified at trial had she been asked. Allen's daughter also stated that she would have testified at trial if she had been asked. She testified to seeing her mother being beaten up by multiple boyfriends and admitted that she had not been forthcoming in her deposition immediately after the murder. Allen's son testified that he would have been available to testify at Allen's trial, if asked, and that he witnessed Allen's physical abuse and frequent mood swings when he was a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Russell testified at the evidentiary hearing for Allen. In preparation for his testimony, he met with Allen and several family members to discuss her childhood and behavioral problems. He testified of his theory that Allen's childhood traumas caused her to suffer from PTSD, which he\n   said she experienced at the time of Wright's murder. He then testified that in light of Allen's history, records, discussions with her family, and observable emotional dysregulation, she could have been in a state of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the homicide. He stated that persons who are unable to control their emotions would eventually lose their ability to think rationally if faced with the situation that Allen faced the day of the homicide. He testified that had he only reviewed the limited information given to Dr. Gebel at trial, he would not have been able to come to the PTSD diagnosis. He admitted on cross-examination that Allen did not tell him what she was thinking or feeling at the time of the homicide, and that Allen denied murdering Wright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Gamache, the State's expert at the evidentiary hearing, testified that after reviewing numerous records, including the discovery related to the case and investigation and Allen's medical and psychological records, he did not believe that any significant mitigation evidence was left out of Allen's penalty phase. He testified that the jury was informed by Dr. Gebel and Dr. Wu in sufficient detail of Allen's childhood trauma, past sexual and physical abuse, and domestic violence. He also explained that Allen currently exhibited no PTSD symptoms and had never been diagnosed with the disorder, other than by Dr. Russell. He also stated that there was no evidence that Allen displayed PTSD symptoms at the time of the homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Allen's trial counsel testified at the evidentiary hearing that he made several attempts to talk to Allen's family members and asked Allen's aunt, Myrtle Hudson, several times when he could speak with them. He testified that Allen did not want to discuss the case when he met with her and that she did not want her daughter involved in the case. He stated that he made no attempts to talk with Allen's daughter because he was told that she would be uncooperative and did not want anything to do with Allen. He testified that he was hesitant to put her on the stand because she could be impeached. He also testified that he was never provided with any of the names of Allen's former boyfriends but that he asked Allen who they were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Trial counsel also testified that he believed that psychologist Dr. Gebel and neuropsychiatrist Dr. Wu were sufficient to testify to Allen's mental health issues at the penalty phase. Dr. Gebel reviewed Allen's history and interviewed Allen once, telling the jury about the significant intracranial injuries she suffered, as well as her frontal lobe disorder, decreased cognitive ability, and impulse control issues that would prevent Allen from behaving normally and from understanding the consequences of her behavior. Dr. Wu explained to the jury that certain areas of Allen's brain did not function normally and that she suffered from lack of impulse control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At trial, counsel presented the testimony of Dr. Wu, Dr. Gebel, and Allen's aunt Myrtle Hudson that outlined Allen's mental health issues and the physical and sexual abuse she suffered while growing up and as an adult. The jury heard of her issues with impulse control, her intracranial brain injuries, and the traumatic childhood and violent relationships she endured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Upon review of the trial court's order and record, we conclude that defense counsel's mitigation investigation did not prejudice Allen. Had the additional mitigation evidence been introduced as Allen claims, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. First, Allen overemphasizes the value of evidentiary hearing testimony presented by Allen's family members and Dr. Russell. The testimony presented regarding Allen's\n   background was cumulative to the mitigation already presented at trial. This Court has \"repeatedly held that counsel is not ineffective for failing to present cumulative evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8173047\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/998/573/#p586\">\n    998 So.2d 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 586 (Fla. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhodes v.

Any testimony the additional witnesses would have provided would have been cumulative to that provided by the witnesses at resentencing.... The additional testimony would only have added to the mitigation already found. Even if given more weight, the mitigation would not outweigh the ... strong aggravators ....\"). The absence of the more specific evidence regarding Allen's traumatic upbringing therefore does not render the penalty phase unreliable. Further, the jury's recommendation of death was unanimous, and the trial court found that the State established two significant aggravators: (1) committed while Allen was engaged in the commission of kidnapping; (2) especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970955\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/946/#p953\">\n    137 So.3d at 953-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of this aggravation, Allen has not established how the additional mitigation presented at the evidentiary hearing would impact the balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors by the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    England v.

Dr. Russell testified that Allen was likely under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the crime, but admitted on cross-examination that Allen never told him what was going through her mind at the time of the capital felony. He also conceded that she denied killing Wright. The value of his opinion that she suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the homicide is therefore weakened. Further, the State's rebuttal expert, Dr. Gamache, rebutted Dr. Russell's findings, testifying that there was insufficient evidence from which to conclude that Allen suffered from PTSD throughout her life and at the time of the homicide. The additional mitigation presented would not have outweighed the established aggravating factors to undermine the confidence in the outcome such that Allen would have received a life sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8173047\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/998/573/#p586\">\n    998 So.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that there was no reasonable probability that evidence of the defendant's mental health history would have led to a different outcome where the State had established three aggravating factors, including the HAC aggravator);\n   <em>\n    Breedlove v.

Improper eliciting of testimony that Allen poured chemicals on the victim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Allen claims that trial counsel was ineffective during his recross of Quintin because counsel's questioning elicited testimony that Allen argues was harmful to the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The record reflects that in Quintin's deposition he stated that Allen poured caustic substances \"on\" Wright's face. In his police statement, Quintin stated that he could not remember which specific substances were poured onto Wright, but that it was \"a whole bunch of stuff.\" During direct examination, when asked if he knew the types of liquids that were poured onto Wright's face, he answered, \"It was the bleach, the green rubbing alcohol, the spritz for hair, fingernail polish remover.\" On cross-examination, trial counsel asked if each of the chemicals was poured separately into Wright's eyes and mouth, and Quintin answered, \"Yes, sir.\" On redirect examination, Quintin testified that he was not sure what liquids were poured onto Wright other than rubbing alcohol. Then, on recross-examination, when trial counsel asked several times which specific substances were poured onto Wright, Quintin testified that \"bleach, nail polish remover, and ammonia\" were poured \"in\" Wright's face and eyes and down her mouth. The record also shows that Dr. Qaiser testified that the autopsy report did not indicate that any bleach or caustic substances were ever poured down Wright's throat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Allen asserts that Quintin's testimony on recross-examination that Allen poured bleach, nail polish remover, and ammonia in Wright's face, mouth, and eyes was more specific and damaging to her case than his previous, more generic, testimony. Allen argues that the elicitation of this testimony was deficient representation because it harmed the defense's case by painting for the jury a more painful picture of the specific harmful ways that Wright was tortured. The postconviction court found that trial counsel's tactics were not unreasonable, and we agree. The record demonstrates that counsel was not deficient in eliciting Quintin's testimony on recross-examination that bleach, ammonia, and nail polish remover were poured into Wright's eyes, mouth, and face. Quintin's testimony on direct examination specifically mentioned bleach and nail polish remover, but was inconsistent with his other testimony. In his police statement, Quintin said that he could not remember which substances were used, and he also stated on cross- and redirect examination that he could not specifically identify the types of substances poured onto Wright. Counsel's questions regarding which substances were poured, and the elicitation of Quintin's answer regarding nail polish, ammonia, and bleach, were appropriate because counsel was impeaching Quintin by attempting to show the inconsistencies in his testimony. Counsel's elicitation of this testimony on recross-examination was a reasonable tactical decision that resulted in the impeachment of Quintin. Additionally, his testimony about the bleach was further impeached by the forensic evidence and Dr. Qaiser's testimony that no evidence of bleach was found on Wright. Trial counsel was therefore not deficient for the strategic decision to impeach Quintin in that manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Moreover, even if counsel was deficient, Allen has not suffered prejudice. The trial\n   court's HAC aggravator determination was based on a multitude of evidence that was unrelated to the types of chemicals poured onto Wright. The record shows that Allen tied and bound, beat, tortured, and strangled Wright. There is not a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had the jury not heard the specific testimony regarding which chemicals were poured onto Wright and where they were poured.\n   <em>\n    Brant v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787481\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/1051/#p1070\">\n    197 So.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (Fla. 2016) (finding no prejudice in light of the evidence for the HAC aggravator). Our confidence in the outcome is not undermined. Therefore, we affirm the denial of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Failure to object to Dr. Qaiser's testimony that unconscious people feel pain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Allen argues her trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Dr. Qaiser's testimony in the penalty phase that unconscious people have the ability to feel pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The record reflects that Dr. Qaiser testified for the State that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [W]hether people who are unconscious, either they are minimally unconscious, mildly, moderately, or severely or profoundly unconscious, do they perceive pain or not. There is [very] little known about that. But the studies have been done, especially in Belgium, in Europe, and here also in the United States and all the other parts of North America .... So the conclusion was ... that they register the pain, but it is not necessarily that they will outwardly manifest it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The prosecutor then asked, \"And [the victim] also could have been experiencing pain even if she is unconscious?\" Dr. Qaiser answered, \"That's true.\" On cross-examination, Dr. Qaiser also testified, \"[It] is not necessary that the outward manifestation of pain will be there. But as far as the perception of pain by the subject, you cannot rule that out. And studies have shown that this has taken place.\" Dr. Qaiser then admitted that he definitely could not testify within a reasonable degree of medical probability that \"there was a sensation of pain in the present case\" while Wright was unconscious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified that he planned to refute Dr. Qaiser's testimony that unconscious people feel pain by cross-examining him. Trial counsel also testified that Dr. Qaiser admitted on cross-examination that in this case specifically he \"couldn't say one way or the other\" whether Wright experienced pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Allen claims that trial counsel should have objected to Dr. Qaiser's testimony because the testimony was speculative and inflammatory hearsay. However, the record establishes that counsel made a strategic decision not to object and rather to cross-examine Dr. Qaiser because he chose as a matter of strategy to attempt to refute the testimony. He ultimately succeeded in getting Dr. Qaiser to acknowledge on cross-examination that he could not definitively say that Wright felt pain within a reasonable degree of medical probability. This discredited his earlier testimony. Accordingly, the record establishes that counsel's decision was a reasonable one under the norms of professional conduct and, therefore, not deficient. Given that finding, we conclude that counsel was not deficient for failing to object to the testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Allen has also not demonstrated prejudice. Here, there was a large amount of evidence supporting the HAC aggravator finding that was unrelated to Dr. Qaiser's testimony regarding unconscious people feeling pain.

This evidence was completely separate from the question of whether Wright felt pain after she was rendered unconscious. Given Quintin's testimony that Allen strangled Wright even while Wright pleaded to be released and screamed that she would wet her pants, as well as the forensic evidence of contusions on Wright's torso, there is no reasonable probability that an objection to the admissibility of Dr. Qaiser's testimony regarding pain would have affected the outcome of Allen's trial. Our confidence in the outcome is not undermined. Therefore, we affirm the postconviction court's denial of relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing, trial counsel testified that he asked Hudson about Allen's neighborhood, which elicited from her the phrase, \"drugs, thugs, and violence.\" He testified that he did this in order to show \"the atmosphere in which [Allen] lived, and that it had an effect on her.\" He also testified that the general theme of his mitigation was to show the negative atmosphere of Allen's cultural upbringing to the\n   jury and its impact on her. He testified that the phrase at issue was specifically brought up by Hudson, not by him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Allen's claim is refuted by the record. The record reflects that trial counsel's questioning regarding Allen's upbringing was strategic and purposeful-he aimed to show the jury the challenging culture in which Allen lived. When asked to describe the area of town in which Allen grew up, Hudson described the neighborhood using the phrase \"drugs, thugs, and violence.\" This evidence supported the trial court's finding of the nonstatutory mitigator that Allen grew up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood. The testimony elicited by trial counsel thereby amounts to the same information established by counsel and found by the trial court. Counsel was not deficient in bringing up that line of questioning, despite the phrase that was elicited during it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Moreover, Allen has failed to show prejudice. There is no reasonable probability that the jury hearing that Allen grew up surrounded by \"drugs, thugs, and violence\" impacted their balancing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in light of the evidence of torture and the victim's desperate pleas to go home prior to her death.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sochor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156709\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/883/766/#p771\">\n    883 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   771 (citing\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    Brant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787481\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/197/1051/#p1070\">\n    197 So.3d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no prejudice in light of the evidence for the HAC aggravator).

Dr. Qaiser testified that he found ligature marks on the neck, that she suffered a ligature strangulation. He agreed that Dr. Whitmore's report found contusions on the neck, and made no mention of ligature marks. Dr. Qaiser disagreed that cocaine intoxication was a contributory factor, although he admitted that was in Dr. Whitmore's report. Dr. Qaiser testified that there was no evidence of bleach or a caustic substance on Ms. Wright. Dr. Qaiser testified that he could not state within a reasonable degree of medical probability that the victim felt pain while unconscious. Everything Dr. Spitz testified to was brought out on crossexamination of Dr. Qaiser. While Dr. Spitz disagreed with Dr. Qaiser's findings, Dr. Spitz did not completely discredit those findings as scientific impossibilities, but instead agreed they were possibilities. The Court finds that counsel's strategic decision not to hire a forensic expert, but instead to challenge Dr. Qaiser's findings through crossexamination, [sic] was not unreasonable under prevailing professional norms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The record supports the postconviction court's findings. The record reflects that Dr. Qaiser testified that Dr. Whitmore, not Dr. Qaiser, performed the autopsy; that the autopsy report did not mention ligature marks and did mention cocaine being a contributing factor in Wright's death; that no evidence of a caustic substance on Wright existed; and that he could not state within reason that Wright experienced pain while unconscious. Further, these admissions and weaknesses elicited from Dr. Qaiser on cross-examination were the same admissions and weaknesses that Dr. Spitz testified to at the evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the jury was informed as to the conclusions Dr. Spitz would have made if he had testified. The record also reflects that trial counsel understood the science of the case and decided that he did not need an expert to say the same thing that he elicited out of Dr. Qaiser on cross-examination with Dr. Whitmore's autopsy report. There is no deficiency when counsel had a tactical reason for not calling his own expert and his cross-examination elicited the same weaknesses that the expert would have.\n   <em>\n    Rigterink v.

Accordingly, counsel's decision not to call the forensic expert was a strategic one and he was not deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Moreover, Allen cannot show prejudice. The evidence at trial included Quintin's testimony that Wright was kidnapped, bound, beaten, and unable to leave, even as she begged to be released before and while being strangled. Dr. Spitz agreed that the death was a homicide and that ligature strangulation was possible and that he could not rule it out. He even agreed that the bruising on Wright's body could have occurred by restraint. Everything testified to by Dr. Spitz was brought out on Dr. Qaiser's cross-examination. This testimony shows that even if counsel had presented the testimony of Dr. Spitz, it would not have undermined the State's case to any significant extent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abdool v.

Our confidence in the outcome is not undermined, and we conclude that the circuit court properly denied postconviction relief on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Failure to impeach Quintin with prior inconsistent statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Allen argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Quintin\n   with prior inconsistent statements. She contends that counsel failed to impeach Quintin with his police statement indicating that Allen did not pour bleach on Wright, which conflicts with his trial testimony that Allen poured bleach on Wright.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The record reflects that in his police statement, Quintin stated that he could not remember all of what was poured onto Wright before the homicide. He stated that Allen procured \"alcohol\" and hair products to pour onto Wright, that she had boxes of bleach, and that she did not have a bleach bottle but rather used a hair products bottle. He also stated that Wright's legs were tied with a belt while the liquids were poured onto her. On direct examination, Quintin testified that he personally held Wright's arms and legs down as Allen poured bleach and other chemicals on Wright's face. On cross examination, Quintin admitted that his trial testimony conflicted with his previous testimony regarding how Wright was restrained while the substances were poured on her. He testified that the statement he gave to the police was the truth, and that he had lied on direct examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Quintin's police statement shows that he never actually stated that bleach was not poured onto Wright, but rather stated that although Allen had boxes of bleach, she did not have a\n   <em>\n    bottle\n   </em>\n   of bleach and that he was unsure what chemicals, other than alcohol, were used. These statements are not wholly inconsistent with his trial testimony. Moreover, as discussed in relation to claim three, counsel did cross-examine Quintin about many inconsistencies in his testimony and brought out this inconsistency on re-cross-choosing to rely on Dr. Qaiser's testimony that no evidence of bleach was found on Wright to demonstrate that Quintin's testimony should not be believed. This trial strategy was not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   For similar reasons, Allen has not demonstrated prejudice. Given that trial counsel did impeach Quintin with other inconsistent statements at trial, there is not a reasonable probability that the jury would have found Allen not guilty or that the jurors would have weighed the aggravation and mitigation differently had counsel impeached Quintin as Allen claims. \"No prejudice result[s] from counsel's failure to present cumulative evidence of inconsistent statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Green v.

Competent, substantial evidence supports the postconviction court's determination that juror Carll's comments about her opinion of the death penalty did not establish actual bias. While juror Carll did express positive sentiment toward the death penalty and expressly outlined several circumstances in which she would recommend it, she confirmed upon follow-up questioning that she was flexible, would \"absolutely\" listen to aggravation and mitigation, and would listen to mental health evidence. juror Carll also stated that there were certain circumstances where she would not recommend the death penalty, such as if someone was \"a party of someone's death.\" As in\n   <em>\n    Carratelli\n   </em>\n   , the record reveals that juror Carll assured the court that she was willing to listen to the evidence, be fair, and follow the law.

The prosecutor presented and failed to correct false testimony from Hudson regarding Allen's criminal record by asking if Hudson knew that Allen was convicted many times for selling drugs. It is undisputed that Allen had only one conviction for selling drugs. The record shows that the State had knowledge of this fact because it prepared Allen's Criminal Code Scoresheet prior to trial. However, the false evidence presented by the State is immaterial, because there is no reasonable possibility that the number of prior drug convictions that Allen had contributed to the jury's sentencing recommendation. There is no reasonable possibility that the fact that the jurors heard that Allen had multiple prior drug convictions-as opposed to just one prior drug conviction-would have had an impact on their vote in the face of the evidence detailing the horrific events during Wright's kidnapping that resulted in her murder.

Here, the jury recommendation of death was unanimous. Although Allen's jury was instructed that it was \"neither compelled or required to recommend death,\" and was informed that unanimous recommendations were not required, it nevertheless unanimously recommended death. The jurors also heard standard jury instructions informing them that they needed to determine whether sufficient aggravators existed and whether any aggravation outweighed the mitigation before recommending a sentence of death.

Std. Jury Instr. (Crim.) 7.11 (2014). Although the jurors were not informed that the finding that sufficient aggravators existed and outweighed the mitigation must be unanimous, the jury did return a unanimous verdict of death.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176508\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/142/#p174\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"If, after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, you determine that at least one aggravating circumstance is found to exist and that the mitigating circumstances do not outweigh the aggravating circumstances, or, in the absence of mitigating factors, that the aggravating factors alone are sufficient, you may recommend that a sentence of death be imposed rather than a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\"). These instructions support the conclusion that the jury unanimously made the requisite factual findings to impose death before it recommended death unanimously. The\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   error in this case is therefore harmless, as it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's failure to find the facts necessary to impose the death penalty did not contribute to the death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Allen's jury also unanimously found her guilty of kidnapping, which the trial court used to find the in the course of kidnapping aggravator.\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6970955\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/137/946/#p953\">\n    137 So.3d at 953, 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But, without a full picture of Allen's upbringing and background, the jury could never have understood the full extent of the mitigation in her case, which could have caused at least one juror to recommend life. Because Allen's attorney's failure to properly investigate and present mitigation evidence-specifically the testimony of Allen's aunt, Barbara Capers, who could have given first-hand accounts of the abuse Allen suffered-constitutes deficient\n   performance and the absence of important mitigation undermines confidence in the jury's unanimous recommendation for death, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Capers, who was available and willing to testify, would have presented a considerably more complete and detailed picture of Allen's horrific childhood and early adult life, including first-hand accounts and graphic details of the physical and sexual abuse Allen suffered at the hands of her family members and former boyfriends. The testimony would not have been cumulative to the testimony presented at trial. Rather, it would have been compelling based on Caper's first-hand knowledge of the events of Allen's life. However, Allen's attorney never so much as even contacted Capers, even though Capers was at all times available to testify. Thus, because Allen has established ineffective assistance of counsel, I conclude that Allen's sentence of death should be vacated, and this case should be remanded for a new penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Approximately two and a half years before trial, Allen's case was reassigned from the public defender's office to defense counsel. Upon taking Allen's case, counsel failed to conduct an independent investigation into mitigation. Trial counsel only spoke with two mitigation witnesses before the trial-(1) Allen's aunt, Myrtle Hudson, and (2) Allen's sister, whose name he did not remember. He did not enlist the help of an investigator or mitigation specialist. At the postconviction evidentiary hearing, counsel testified that he thought the \"witnesses were all lined up\" before he took the case and it was just a matter of \"putting [the mitigation] on.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Had she been asked to testify, Allen's aunt, Barbara Capers, could have added the following testimony: that she personally witnessed Allen's mother physically abusing Allen by beating her with her hands and fists almost every day; Allen's mother would also beat Allen with belts, whip her with sticks, and slap her in the face; when Allen was twelve, her mother beat her so badly that Capers called the police; Allen's grandfather also physically abused Allen, he would line up the boys and girls naked, including Allen, and go down the row beating them with oak switches; Allen also witnessed her grandfather being abusive to her mother; in her twenties, Allen was beat up by her boyfriend, Bill Skane, and was unrecognizable when Capers visited her in the hospital; Capers witnessed Allen's paramour abuse her many times while she was pregnant, including one time he and another boy kicked and punched Allen in the stomach; when Allen was a young girl, her mother went to jail and Allen stayed with her grandfather, and Allen told Capers that she wanted to stay with her instead because he was sexually molesting her; Allen's uncle Roy also sexually molested her when he visited the grandfather every other weekend; Capers saw Roy touch and grab Allen in private places like her breasts and kiss her on the mouth; Allen told Capers that her brother and another man sexually molested her; Allen had a stroke as a teenager that affected her speech and her memory; and Allen demonstrated signs of severe anxiety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   As the majority explains, to be entitled to relief on her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Allen must satisfy both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Deficiency\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Although Capers' testimony would have involved the same subject as evidence presented at trial, it is not merely cumulative-as the majority and postconviction court suggest. It is impossible to conclude that Capers' testimony would have been similar in breadth and detail to Hudson's. Rather, Capers' testimony was more detailed and included many personal, eyewitness accounts to the abuse Allen suffered. Certainly, hearing first-hand accounts of the abuse suffered by Allen would be far more impactful on the jury than Hudson's vague recollection of Allen's childhood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Further, Allen's childhood and history of abuse were the most significant mitigation the defense presented during the penalty phase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   per curiam op. at 5-6, note 2. While Hudson's testimony was a critical component of the mitigation presented because it could help the jury understand why Allen committed this heinous crime, Capers' testimony would have undoubtedly painted an even clearer picture for the jury of this mitigation, as explained above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Thus, trial counsel's investigation was wholly insufficient and \"fell short of the standards for capital defense work articulated by the American Bar Association (ABA)-standards to which [the United States Supreme Court] long have referred as 'guides to determining what is reasonable,' \" which provide that efforts must be made to discover all reasonably available mitigation and evidence to rebut aggravators.\n   <em>\n    Wiggins v.

Bar Ass'n,\n   <em>\n    Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.11\n   </em>\n   (rev. ed. 2003). Accordingly, I would conclude that Allen has satisfied the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The postconviction court concluded that Allen failed to establish prejudice because, with the \"significant aggravators found and the comparatively weak mitigation found, it is unlikely that the additional mitigation presented would have been sufficient to outweigh the established aggravation.\" Postconviction Ct. Order at 76. Further, the majority asserts that Allen \"overemphasizes the value of evidentiary hearing testimony presented by Allen's family members,\" specifically that the \"testimony presented regarding Allen's background was cumulative to the mitigation already presented at trial.\" Per curiam op. at 1273-74. The majority concludes that Allen could not have suffered prejudice because of the mitigation already presented in this case and the strong aggravation that was presented, which they argue is evidenced by the unanimous jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898384\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/510/#p524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   However, the majority fails to take into consideration the effect of\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the analysis. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Bevel v.

After our more recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   , where we determined that a reliable penalty phase proceeding requires that \"the penalty phase jury must be unanimous in making the critical findings and recommendation that are necessary before a sentence of death may be considered by the judge or imposed,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177689,12177666\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/202/40/\">\n    202 So.3d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we must consider whether the unpresented mitigation evidence would have swayed one juror to make \"a critical difference.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

Further, Capers testified at the postconviction evidentiary hearing that she was contacted by an attorney-not Allen's trial counsel-before trial, was available to speak with an expert, and wanted to testify, but was not asked to do so. Rather than looking into Capers' testimony, trial counsel relied solely on Hudson's testimony for information regarding Allen's childhood and adult life. In fact, Capers wanted to help Allen but was never told that her testimony could help; she was even present in the courtroom for the duration of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Clearly, as explained above, Capers' testimony would have better illustrated for the jury the trauma in Allen's childhood, development, and surroundings as an adult. Indeed, counsel conceded that it would have been beneficial to find witnesses to substantiate Allen's violent family life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

Further, the additional \"insight into [Allen's] childhood and young adulthood\" that Capers could have provided would have \"serv[ed] to humanize [her] to the jury\" and could have persuaded jurors to be more sympathetic and merciful.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007764\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/88/128/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007764\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/88/128/#p140\">\n    at 140-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, I conclude that prejudice has been established because our confidence in the unanimous jury verdict should be undermined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   It is clear that Capers' testimony would have provided the jury with a more complete and accurate picture of the powerful mitigation in Allen's case. However, because of the failure of Allen's attorney to investigate and present this mitigation evidence, the jury only received a partial understanding of the abuse Allen suffered as a child and into her adult life. This half-truth undoubtedly undermines our confidence in Allen's sentence of death. Thus, I would vacate Allen's sentence of death and remand for a new penalty phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Accordingly, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    <em>\n     Hurst v.
