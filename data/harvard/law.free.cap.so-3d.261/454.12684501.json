See \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala. Code 1975. During the penalty phase of the trial, the foreperson of the jury submitted to the court a verdict form reflecting that, by a unanimous vote, the jurors found that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance that Russell's capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses. See \u00a7 13A-5-49(8), Ala. Code 1975. The foreperson of the jury submitted to the court a verdict form reflecting that, by a unanimous vote, the jurors recommended that Russell be sentenced to death. The trial court ordered that a presentence investigation report be furnished to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court sentenced Russell to death following its consideration of the evidence presented at the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, the presentence report, the aggravating and mitigating factors it found to exist, the trial court's determination that the aggravating factor outweighed the mitigating factors, and the jury's advisory verdict. This Court affirmed Russell's conviction and sentence in\n   <em>\n    Russell v.

Accordingly, because in Alabama a jury, not the judge, determines by a unanimous verdict the critical finding that an aggravating circumstance exists beyond a reasonable doubt to make a defendant death-eligible, Alabama's capital-sentencing scheme does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Bohannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12368479\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/222/525/\">\n    222 So. 3d at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the case before us, the jury unanimously found the existence of the aggravating factor that the crime was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel when compared to other capital offenses-the same aggravating circumstance the judge relied upon to impose a sentence of death-and the jury then unanimously recommended a sentence of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thus, Alabama has reviewed its capital-sentencing scheme in light of\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   and has determined that its capital-sentencing scheme does not violate the United States Constitution and does not run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Apprendi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ring\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   .
