Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As part of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, also known as the 2008 Farm Bill, the United States Congress created BCAP to help stimulate the development of renewable \"bioenergy\" sources and to assist agricultural- and forest-land owners and operators with the use of eligible material in a \"biomass conversion facility\" (\"BCF\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   As one element of BCAP, a wood dealer delivering eligible biomass materials to a qualified BCF was eligible to receive a subsidy from the FSA if the biomass material was subsequently used for generating energy. The FSA first announced details of BCAP in the summer of 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 28, 2009, the FSA published a notice outlining what biomass materials were eligible for a BCAP subsidy (\"the BCAP materials list\"). As concerns this case, the BCAP materials list authorized the payment of a subsidy for eligible timber products such as tree branches, treetops, wood chips, and bark; however, the BCAP materials list specifically enumerated materials that were not eligible for a BCAP subsidy, including what is known in the timber and paper-making industries as \"black liquor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 29, 2009, the day after the FSA released the BCAP materials list, the United States Department of Agriculture (\"the USDA\") discussed BCAP in a telephone conference call with representatives of the timber and paper-making industries, including Landegger. During the call, an FSA official responded to a written question about black liquor by stating that \"black liquor is not going to be eligible\" for the BCAP subsidy and that, \"[i]f a wood residue or pulp material is brought to a pulp mill, the component of that would be turned into black liquor and would not be an eligible material.\" Landegger asked why black liquor was ineligible, stating he was \"not sure what the rationale was for removing black liquor as an eligible material or pulp as a byproduct.\" The official responded that all the details of BCAP were still being worked out in the regulatory process and that there could be substantial changes in the forthcoming rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although BCAP did not provide any direct benefits to pulp-mill owners, Landegger decided to participate in the program by obtaining certification for two pulp mills operated by Landegger's companies in Monroe County, Alabama (the two companies eventually became ARG).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ARG mills were thereafter certified by the FSA as qualified BCFs under BCAP. To qualify as a BCF, the ARG pulp mills entered into an agreement with the USDA to follow the rules and regulations governing BCAP and to certify for BCAP subsidies only eligible materials listed on the BCAP materials list. ARG thereafter advertised its BCF status and promoted BCAP to wood dealers throughout its area of operation, explaining to them that they could receive BCAP subsidies for eligible wood products delivered to the ARG pulp mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   ARG also explained to those wood dealers, however, that it would pay a reduced, below market price for wood products delivered to ARG mills that were eligible for BCAP subsidies, with the expectation that the BCAP subsidies would make up for that discount and provide an additional profit for wood dealers as well. ARG further represented that, if the BCAP subsidies were not paid to wood dealers or were lower than expected, it would pay the \"difference\" and make wood dealers \"whole.\" The parties dispute, however, whether the \"difference\" ARG agreed to pay was the difference between the below market price ARG paid and the actual market price in effect at that time or the difference between the below market price ARG paid and the net price the wood dealers expected to get after the advertised BCAP subsidies were paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As an example of ARG's BCAP-related transactions with the wood dealers, one of those dealers-Ayres Forestry-was receiving $39 per ton for wood products delivered to the ARG pulp mills before the start of BCAP. An ARG representative explained that Ayres Forestry would receive only $31 per ton from ARG for delivering wood products on the BCAP materials list, but it would also receive a BCAP subsidy of $12.12 per ton from the FSA, thus resulting in a net gain of $4.12 per ton for Ayres Forestry (and an $8 savings per ton for ARG). To receive the BCAP subsidy, Ayres Forestry had to submit to the local FSA office a form, copies of the sales contracts, and sales receipts signed by the ARG mills in their capacity as a BCAP-qualified BCF and reflecting the amount of eligible material delivered. ARG, as a BCF, was required to measure moisture content and tonnage and other relevant qualities of the wood delivered and to certify how much of the wood was eligible under BCAP. ARG required Ayres Forestry and the other wood dealers to use a system by which drivers delivering \"BCAP wood\" to ARG had to use a card of a particular color.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ARG concluded that there was some ambiguity in the interpretation of the BCAP materials list, specifically whether it barred the payment of a BCAP subsidy for the delivery of only\n   <em>\n    processed\n   </em>\n   black liquor but not materials\n   <em>\n    converted into\n   </em>\n   black liquor. The FSA had stated its intent in the above-referenced conference call that it would not approve wood used for black liquor. Moreover, ARG's chief financial officer and Landegger's son-in-law, Arick Rynearson, sent an e-mail to Landegger warning that \"USDA has made their intent clear-they want to exclude black liquor.\" \"We can push it,\" Rynearson wrote, \"but I suspect that in the end, we will end up only having our bark and forest residue qualify.\" Nevertheless, ARG, with approval from Landegger, made the decision to certify as eligible materials for BCAP subsidies those wood materials that would ultimately be converted into black liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This decision allowed ARG to calculate approximately 50-55% of a tree as eligible under the BCAP materials list, rather than approximately 10-12% of a tree that otherwise would be eligible, thus resulting in higher subsidy payments for the wood dealers and, presumably, more profit for all the parties. In early December 2009, ARG processed an initial \"test\" load delivered by a wood dealer (not one of the plaintiffs) pursuant to this interpretation of the BCAP materials list. ARG provided the wood dealer with a delivery ticket stating that 54% of the \"bone dry tons\" of the wood delivered to ARG qualified for the BCAP subsidy. The FSA state office paid the full subsidy on that 54% certification. On December 21, 2009, ARG began processing timber products in this same manner for approximately 50 different wood dealers who agreed to haul wood to ARG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The wood dealers testified at trial that they were ignorant of the fact that ARG was including in its calculation of eligible materials wood products ARG used in the production of black liquor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 21, 2010, after someone apparently complained to the FSA about ARG, the FSA suspended ARG from participating in BCAP and halted relevant BCAP subsidies to wood dealers who hauled to ARG, explaining in an e-mail sent to county FSA offices that \"there may be possible discrepancies in the methods used by [ARG] to determine the percentage of product that is being used for biomass.\" ARG thereafter learned that the suspension was caused by its decision to certify for a BCAP subsidy material that was being converted to black liquor. ARG immediately began working to get the suspension lifted, and ARG officials, including Landegger, subsequently met with FSA officials in Washington, D.C., to explain their interpretation of the BCAP materials list and to attempt to resolve the dispute and ARG's suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While it worked to reverse the suspension, ARG told the wood dealers that the suspension was just the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to continue to deliver their products to the ARG pulp mills, even though the suspension meant no BCAP subsidies would be paid for wood delivered to ARG. For instance, wood dealer John Ayres of Ayres Forestry testified that, after ARG was suspended, Mark Bond of ARG told Ayres: \"We are not really kicked out. Everything was legal. We got the formula approved by the FSA. Just a misunderstanding. We are going to get put back in the program.\" Accordingly, in order ostensibly to \"help\" the wood dealers with their decreased cash flow after ARG's suspension from BCAP, ARG agreed to \"advance\" the wood dealers the difference between the lower, below market rate ARG was paying and the market rate for all deliveries made during the suspension. ARG drafted promissory notes for those advances and required the wood dealers to sign them in order to receive the advance payments. ARG claimed at trial that it did not intend to demand payment on the notes if the BCAP subsidies were not paid to the wood dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On February 8, 2010, the FSA published for public comment its proposed rules governing BCAP. The proposed rules explicitly provided that black liquor was \"not an eligible material\" and that BCAP subsidies would not be paid for \"[e]ligible material delivered to a qualified [BCF] used to produce black liquor.\" The proposed rules were to become final in October 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 24, 2010, the deputy administrator for farm programs of the FSA revoked ARG's status as a qualified BCF and tentatively found (1) that ARG had engaged in a scheme or artifice to present false information to the FSA in connection with BCAP and (2) that ARG was liable for the amount of BCAP subsidies that had been improperly paid to wood dealers based on ARG's certification as eligible for a BCAP subsidy materials that were delivered to ARG and converted into black liquor. ARG appealed the FSA's decision. While ARG's appeal was pending, many wood dealers continued to deliver wood products to ARG and to file requests for BCAP subsidies with the FSA, continuing to do so through April 2010-when BCAP ended for the fiscal year-with the hope that the FSA would reconsider its decision to terminate ARG's involvement in BCAP. On March 1, 2010, ARG once again began paying wood dealers full market price for delivered materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November 2010, Landegger, on behalf of ARG, formally entered into a settlement with the FSA resolving the dispute\n   over BCAP subsidies that had been improperly paid to wood dealers based on ARG's certification as eligible for a BCAP subsidy materials that ARG turned into black liquor and settling all outstanding requests for BCAP subsidies made by wood dealers for materials delivered to ARG after ARG's suspension on January 21. Pursuant to this settlement, the FSA agreed to withdraw its previous finding that ARG had engaged in a scheme to submit false information to the FSA and to reverse ARG's January 21 suspension and February 24 termination from BCAP as a qualified BCF. The FSA and ARG also agreed that the amount of the BCAP subsidy for all deliveries before January 21 would be recalculated to exclude payments for materials converted to black liquor and that this same formula would be used to calculate the subsidies wood dealers were entitled to for products delivered after January 21. ARG agreed to set up an account of $2.4 million from which payments would be made to the FSA and then to wood dealers who did not receive BCAP subsidies for wood delivered to ARG because of the suspension. The outstanding BCAP subsidies for wood products delivered after January 21, however, would be subtracted from overpayments made before January 21, and the FSA agreed to make additional BCAP subsidy payments to any given wood dealer only to the extent the amount owed exceeded the amount of previous overpayment. If a wood dealer still had an overpayment thereafter, ARG agreed to reimburse the FSA for that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 6, 2010, before ARG entered into its settlement with the FSA, the wood dealers sued ARG, Landegger, and Steve Harris-the president of an ARG affiliate involved in the operation of ARG's pulp mills-in the Monroe Circuit Court, asserting breach-of-contract, negligence, wantonness, and multiple fraud claims. The wood dealers alleged fraudulent misrepresentation against all defendants but alleged breach of contract against only \"[ARG] and/or fictitious defendants A-L,\" excluding Landegger and Harris. The gravamen of the wood dealers' complaint was that ARG had made various misrepresentations to them related to its participation in BCAP in order to induce them to sell wood products to ARG at a reduced price and that they had suffered economic damage as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   ARG, Harris, and Landegger filed an answer denying the allegations, and ARG asserted counterclaims against all the wood dealers except Pineville Timber Co. and THE Timber Company based on the promissory notes those entities had executed for funds ARG advanced them during the time the FSA was not paying BCAP subsidies for timber products delivered to ARG. The wood dealers denied those counterclaims. The wood dealers amended their complaint and added additional plaintiffs, and ARG filed amended counterclaims against six of the wood dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A lengthy pretrial process ensued, during which the ARG defendants broadly allege that the trial court failed to properly manage the case. See, e.g., the ARG defendants' brief, at pp. 2-5. By agreement of the parties, a trial date was finally set for August 24, 2015. On May 26, 2015, approximately one month after that trial date had been set, a New York federal district court sentenced Landegger to two months in federal prison followed by six months of home confinement in Connecticut for an unrelated criminal matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Landegger began serving his sentence on June 24, 2015,\n   and, on June 26, 2015, the ARG defendants and Harris moved the trial court to continue the trial until at least February 2016 so that Landegger could attend and participate. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial began on August 24, 2015. During the course of the trial, the wood dealers dropped their deceit, negligence, and wantonness claims. The trial court ultimately charged the jury only on the wood dealers' misrepresentation and breach-of-contract claims, as well as ARG's counterclaims based on the promissory notes executed by some of the wood dealers. As to the breach-of-contract claim, the trial court gave charges on both express and implied contracts, over the objection of the ARG defendants to the implied-contract charge. As to the wood dealers' misrepresentation charge, the ARG defendants sought, over the objection of the wood dealers, an instruction on promissory fraud. The trial court declined to give the promissory-fraud instruction. The trial court instructed the jury with respect to the verdict form as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"There are three defendants. And you can find against one or all three, defendant Alabama River Group, Inc., defendant Steven Harris, and defendant George Landegger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"And these are compensatory damages, which would be returned under-if you find the plaintiffs, they had a contract and it was breached by the defendants, or if you find that the defendants committed fraud.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 31, 2015, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the wood dealers and against ARG and Landegger for $8,092,692.71-a combined total of $1,092,692.71 in compensatory damages and $7,000,000 in punitive damages. The jury found Harris not liable on all claims against him. The jury also ruled against ARG on its counterclaims. On September 3, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment consistent with the jury's verdict. However, in accordance with the statutory cap on punitive damages set forth in \u00a7 6-11-21, Ala. Code 1975, the trial court subsequently reduced the punitive damages awarded, resulting in a total judgment of $6,395,489.37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 5, 2015, the ARG defendants filed postjudgment motions, including a motion for a judgment as a matter of law, a motion for a new trial, and a motion for remittitur of the compensatory and punitive damages.

ARG and Landegger also argue, alternatively, that this Court should further remit both the compensatory and punitive damages awarded the wood dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Misrepresentation Claims Against ARG\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ARG defendants first argue that the trial court erred in denying their motions for a judgment as a matter of law (\"JML\") because, they say, the wood dealers failed to produce at trial substantial evidence of a misrepresentation of existing material fact. Specifically, the ARG defendants make the following arguments: (1) that the evidence at trial showed merely that the alleged misrepresentations made to the wood dealers were either actually true or not material and (2) that the alleged misrepresentations concerned acts or events to occur in the future, sounding in promissory fraud rather than misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   By statute, misrepresentation claims are a type of legal fraud: namely, \"[m]isrepresenta\n   tions of a material fact made willfully to deceive, or recklessly without knowledge, and acted on by the opposite party, or if made by mistake and innocently and acted on by the opposite party.\" \u00a7 6-5-101, Ala. Code 1975. This Court has articulated the elements of a misrepresentation claim as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"1) [A] misrepresentation of material fact, 2) made willfully to deceive, recklessly, without knowledge, or mistakenly, 3) which was reasonably relied on by the plaintiff under the circumstances, and 4) which caused damage as a proximate consequence.

No arguments are presented concerning the degree of falsity (second element), reasonable reliance (third element), or causation (fourth element). The ARG defendants focus on the first element of misrepresentation; they argue that the wood dealers offered no evidence of a misrepresentation of material existing fact. Any alleged misrepresentation made by the ARG defendants, they argue, was either true, not material, or mere opinion. Specifically, the ARG defendants point to the alleged representations by the ARG defendants (1) that ARG \"had become properly qualified facilities for BCAP,\" which the ARG defendants claim was a true statement; (2) that the wood dealers' wood materials were eligible for BCAP subsidies, which the ARG defendants claim was also a true statement; and (3) that ARG's suspension from BCAP was \"just a misunderstanding,\" which the ARG defendants claim was merely a statement of opinion or prediction. Thus, argue the ARG defendants, there was no, or at least not substantial, evidence in the trial court to support a misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The wood dealers respond that the trial court had before it substantial evidence of several false and material representations and that, on appeal, the ARG defendants selectively take out of context certain statements in the record to support their arguments. The wood dealers do not dispute that ARG's mills were, at least initially, qualified BCFs; in fact, the amended complaint expressly alleged that the ARG defendants applied to the FSA and were \"approved to be a qualified energy conversion facility.\" Rather, the wood dealers alleged that the qualification of ARG's mills as BCFs was a threshold representation upon which the rest of the misrepresentations made to the wood dealers largely depended. As the amended complaint alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"In 2009, [the ARG] [d]efendants approached [the wood dealers] regarding the purchase of eligible materials for BCAP. [The ARG] [d]efendants represented that APP [Alabama Pine Pulp Company, Inc.] and ARP [Alabama River Pulp Company, Inc.] had become properly qualified facilities for BCAP. [The ARG] [d]efendants also stated that in order to sell wood to [ARG], [the wood dealers] would be required to reduce the price of their wood below market rates. In exchange for the reduction in price, [the ARG] [d]efendants ensured that [the wood dealers] would receive the BCAP matching payments, which, according to [the ARG] [d]efendants, would be well over the required reduction in price, and would result in higher profit for [the wood dealers]. [The ARG] [d]efendants also represented that [the wood dealers] would be paid the\n   amounts agreed upon, including the amount due under BCAP, even if [the wood dealers] did not receive their BCAP matching payment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Seen in context, the ARG defendants' representation about its mills' BCAP qualification was never alleged to be a false statement in itself, but it was alleged to be a material predicate for the alleged misrepresentations that followed. In the words of the trial court, \"[b]y becoming qualified in [BCAP], [the] ARG [defendants] aimed to take advantage of federal matching payments for eligible materials delivered to ARG by wood dealers and used by ARG to make energy.\" Therefore, although we agree with the ARG defendants that their representation that the ARG mills were each a \"qualified facility for BCAP\" was, standing alone, a true statement, we agree with the wood dealers that it was also material to the series of misrepresentations allegedly made to the wood dealers about BCAP and the parties' respective roles in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In response to the ARG defendants' next argument-that the representation that the wood dealers' products delivered to ARG were eligible for BCAP subsidies was true-the wood dealers respond that the statement was only partially true: although a portion of the wood delivered was eligible for a BCAP subsidy, wood that was converted to black liquor was not. The evidence submitted below indicates that the FSA did not consider wood converted to black liquor to be an eligible material under the BCAP materials list, that black liquor was expressly listed as an\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   eligible material on the BCAP materials list, and that ARG and Landegger knew the FSA's position on black liquor and material converted to black liquor. Nevertheless, unbeknownst to the wood dealers, ARG included wood material used to make black liquor in its BCAP subsidy calculations and then expressly used this larger subsidy \"formula\" to induce the wood dealers to deliver their wood to ARG's mills instead of its competitors' mills. For example, John Ayres of Ayres Forestry testified that ARG told him \"that [ARG] had a formula that was better than the other mills and that if I hauled wood to them, that I would get paid about two more dollars a ton than if I hauled wood\" elsewhere. When asked if ARG mentioned \"that they put black liquor in the formula\" or if he otherwise knew that, Ayres responded: \"No.\" Wade Rolison of BAR Forest Products testified that, when ARG explained that, under BCAP, BAR's sale price would be lowered $8 per ton, Rolison was assured that ARG \"had gotten approved,\" showed them the ticket from the \"test run\" by another wood dealer, and told Rolison he would receive about $4 more per ton under BCAP if they sold to ARG. Malcolm Smith of Conecuh Timber was asked on cross-examination whether he understood that the reason ARG was \"claiming a higher percentage of the wood as eligible\" for a BCAP subsidy was because of the inclusion of material used to make black liquor. Smith responded: \"None of that was ever mentioned in our meeting, nothing about black liquor.... [ARG] told me that that was their formula for the BCAP.... I didn't know anything about a formula.\" Mackey Bruce of Pea River was asked whether he knew anything about \"the formula that [ARG] was giving\" him to support the prices it quoted him. Bruce replied: \"Absolutely not.\" He was asked whether ARG told him \"they were running this risk trying to include black liquor in that.\" Bruce stated: \"I had no idea.\" When Tommy Mosley of Pineville Timber expressed doubts that he would get a higher price after the BCAP subsidy was paid, ARG assured him that \" '[i]t works' \" and stated that ARG had \"sent a test load through\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   and \" '[t]hey paid it. Everything is fine.' \" David Wright of THE Timber Company was induced to sell to ARG at its reduced price for BCAP because of ARG's assurance that, after the BCAP subsidy, \"it was more money than the other mills the way they were doing their formula. They were the experts, you know. And so I was not the expert.\" The evidence at trial demonstrated that ARG represented to the wood dealers that they would receive a higher BCAP subsidy by selling to ARG, even though ARG's proprietary \"formula\" included a substantial amount of material that was ineligible for a BCAP subsidy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   ARG's representations to the wood dealers that they would receive a BCAP subsidy, even if true for\n   <em>\n    part\n   </em>\n   of the wood products at issue, was not true as to material used to make black liquor. It is no defense that the statements ARG made were, at best, \"half-true.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \" ' \"To tell half a truth has been declared to be equivalent to the concealment of the other half. A partial and fragmentary disclosure, accompanied by the willful concealment of material and qualifying facts is not a true statement, and is as much a fraud as an actual misrepresentation, which, in effect, it is.\" ' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Jackson Co. v.

The record is replete with examples of ARG misrepresenting how much of the wood dealers' wood material was eligible for BCAP subsidies, and therefore misrepresenting the total price the wood dealers would receive. ARG's formula for calculating BCAP subsidies based upon material used to make black liquor was material and, indeed, necessary to its efforts to induce the wood dealers to sell to ARG at a reduced price. We disagree, therefore, with the ARG defendants and hold that there was substantial evidence below from which to conclude that ARG's statements regarding whether the wood dealers' products were eligible for the BCAP subsidy were misleading, false, and material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Next, the parties dispute whether ARG's repeated characterization of its suspension from BCAP as \"just a misunderstanding\" was actionable as misrepresentation or was merely opinion or prediction. The ARG defendants argue that the suspension was a misunderstanding with the FSA and that describing it as such was merely a statement of ARG's opinion or a prediction that the FSA would eventually agree with ARG's position. For support, the ARG defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Crowne Investments, Inc. v. Bryant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7467299\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/638/873/#p877\">\n    638 So.2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (Ala. 1994), in which this Court held that \"mere statement of opinion or prediction as to events to occur in the future\" will not support a fraud claim, absent proof of an intent to deceive. In\n   <em>\n    Crowne\n   </em>\n   , this Court held that an insurance agent's statement, \" 'I think we found an answer to our problem in insuring' \" his client, Mickey Kennedy, was not a statement of existing fact but rather \"a statement of opinion\" or, at most, \"the expression of a belief that the company with which Kennedy applied, Inter-American Insurance Company, would issue Kennedy insurance in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7467299\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/638/873/#p877\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7467299\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/638/873/#p877\">\n    . at 876, 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the present case, however, there was sufficient evidence from which to conclude that the ARG defendants' statements were not merely an opinion or a prediction about events to occur in the future. For instance, Mark Bond of ARG assured Ayres Forestry after ARG was suspended\n   from BCAP that \"[w]e are not really kicked out. Everything was legal. We got the formula approved by the FSA. Just a misunderstanding. We are going to get put back in the program.\" These statements described not future events but\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   actions by the FSA and the current status of ARG: that the FSA had approved ARG's \"formula\" for eligible materials and that ARG mills were not \"really kicked out\" of BCAP. In\n   <em>\n    Crowne\n   </em>\n   , this Court found it significant in determining whether the insurance agent's statement was mere opinion that he said he \"thought\" he had found life-insurance coverage for his client. By contrast, ARG's alleged statements about its BCAP suspension and status were categorical, with no qualifying words of opinion such as \"we think\" or the like. We conclude, therefore, that there was sufficient evidence introduced from which to conclude that the ARG defendants' statements about ARG's suspension from BCAP were statements of material fact and not merely opinion or a prediction about future events. The ARG defendants' first argument that their statements were true or immaterial is unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The ARG defendants' next argument is that the trial court erred in denying their motion for a JML because, they say, the alleged misrepresentations concerned acts or events to occur in the future, sounding in promissory fraud rather than misrepresentation. Promissory fraud, unlike misrepresentation, is a claim \"based upon a promise to act or not to act in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Moulton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005955\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/116/1119/#p1144\">\n    116 So.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1144 (Ala. 2013) (citations and quotation marks omitted). To succeed on a claim of promissory fraud, the ARG defendants note, plaintiffs must prove two elements in addition to the elements of misrepresentation, namely: \"proof that at the time of the misrepresentation, the defendant had the intention not to perform the act promised, and ... proof that the defendant had an intent to deceive.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7005955\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/116/1119/#p1144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations and quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    Benetton Servs. Corp. v.

For example, the ARG defendants focus on the representations alleged in the complaint that the wood dealers \"\n   <em>\n    would receive\n   </em>\n   \" the BCAP subsidies from the FSA; that those subsidies \"would\n   <em>\n    be\n   </em>\n   \" more than the reduction in price, which \"\n   <em>\n    would result\n   </em>\n   \" in higher profits for the wood dealers; and that, after ARG was suspended from BCAP, the ARG defendants \"\n   <em>\n    would pay\n   </em>\n   \" the matching BCAP subsidies even if the FSA did not. The ARG defendants point to similar statements by the wood dealers' attorneys in opening statements and by representatives of the wood dealers who testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The representations at issue here, argue the ARG defendants, are like the promises made by the bank in\n   <em>\n    Southland Bank\n   </em>\n   that the bank \"\n   <em>\n    would extend\n   </em>\n   a loan\" to the plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Southland Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7064293\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/21/1196/#p1210\">\n    21 So.3d at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only question here, however, is not whether evidence below tended to support promissory fraud (an issue we do not decide), but whether there was presented below substantial evidence from which a jury could conclude that the ARG defendants made misrepresentations of present, material fact. We have already concluded that the record supports a misrepresentation claim. We therefore find no error in the trial court's denial of a motion for a JML on this ground and agree with the trial court that, \"regardless of whether [the wood dealers] may have also had an actionable promissory fraud cause of action, there was substantial evidence in front of the jury on all of the elements of the misrepresentation claims, the only tort claim that was submitted to the jury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Claims Against Landegger\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The ARG defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying Landegger's motion for a JML on the wood dealers' breach-of-contract and misrepresentation claims. We address the ARG defendants' arguments concerning each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As to the breach-of-contract claim, the parties dispute whether the wood dealers actually asserted a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger, the ARG defendants being in the curious position of arguing that the wood dealers\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   assert such a claim. The wood dealers dispute this, and the trial court agreed with the wood dealers in its postjudgment order, holding that \"there was no such claim in the case for the court to consider for purposes of Landegger's motion for [a JML].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To support their argument that a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger was essentially \"smuggled\" into this case and survives on appeal, the ARG defendants assert both that the complaint alleges and that the trial court charged the jury with a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger. As to the complaint, the ARG defendants argue that \"the count for breach of contract demanded judgment against the 'Defendant\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   ,' \" which, the ARG defendants argue, included Landegger. Count four of the amended complaint provides as follows, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"37. At all time herein,\n   <em>\n    Defendants APP [Alabama Pine Pulp Company, Inc.], ARP [Alabama River Pulp Company, Inc.], and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L\n   </em>\n   were under a contractual obligation to pay the timber or wood prices agreed upon between the [wood dealers], and Defendants, including any BCAP matching payment, including those payments as represented by Defendants Landegger, Harris, and Fictitious Defendants A-L, who had actual and apparent authority to bind Defendants APP and ARP and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L to those representations, and who did thereby bind Defendants APP and ARP and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L to those representations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"38.\n   <em>\n    Defendants APP and ARP and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L breached their contractual obligations\n   </em>\n   by failing and refusing to properly pay the amounts due under their agreement with [the wood dealers] thereunder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \"WHEREFORE, [the wood dealers] demand judgment against Defendants in an amount of compensatory damages as will be determined by a jury at trial of this cause, plus interest and costs.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The ARG defendants point to one word from the complaint-\"Defendants\"-to demonstrate that count four asserted a breach-of-contract claim\n   against Landegger. The ARG defendants give no further explanation, nor do they identify which of the 12 uses of the word \"defendants\" in count four includes Landegger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As a plain reading of count four indicates, the allegations therein refer only to \"Defendants APP, ARP [now collectively ARG] and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L.\" In paragraph 38 only \"Defendants APP and ARP and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L\" are alleged to have \"breached their contractual obligations\" to the wood dealers. The only reference to Landegger anywhere in count four is the allegation in paragraph 37 that \"Landegger, Harris, and Fictitious Defendants A-L\" had \"actual and apparent authority to bind\" and \"did thereby bind\n   <em>\n    Defendants APP and ARP and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L\n   </em>\n   to those representations.\" (Emphasis added.) Landegger and Harris, therefore, are expressly\n   <em>\n    excluded\n   </em>\n   from the group of defendants accused of breach of contract, that group being repeatedly articulated in count four as the predecessor entities to ARG \"and/or Fictitious Defendants A-L.\" In this context, the concluding demand for \"judgment against Defendants\" in count four would most naturally be read to be seeking judgment against the defendants specified in count four.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ARG defendants make no arguments otherwise, and their bare assertion that the complaint alleges a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger is entirely unconvincing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The ARG defendants also argue that this surreptitious breach-of-contract claim against Landegger survived the trial proceedings and was submitted to the jury. They point to two excerpts from the jury instructions where, according to the ARG defendants, the trial court \"expressly instructed the jury that it could find against Mr. Landegger on this claim.\" The ARG defendants focus on three or four uses of the plural \"Defendant\n   <em>\n    s\n   </em>\n   \" by the trial court in its lengthy oral instructions. The wood dealers respond that they reiterated numerous times leading up to trial that they were not bringing a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger, beginning with their response to Landegger's summary-judgment motion. The wood dealers assert that, in the context of the entire jury charge, the evidence at trial, and their concessions, the jury instructions cannot be read as importing a breach-of-contract claim against Landegger. Finally, the wood dealers argue, the ARG defendants failed to object to the jury charge or seek clarification thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   It seems doubtful to us that a claim not found in the complaint and expressly disavowed by the plaintiffs before trial would somehow be formed whole cloth by a few lines in a lengthy jury instruction.

Evidence introduced below also indicates that Landegger directly participated in conference calls with the USDA and learned that the\n   USDA's interpretation of the BCAP materials list was such that material used for black liquor was ineligible for BCAP subsidies. Rynearson, ARG's chief financial officer and Landegger's son-in-law, warned him of the same.

Landegger certainly \"cannot escape individual liability on the ground that he was acting in an official corporate capacity,\" 644 So.2d at 869, or on the ground that he did not directly communicate with the wood dealers. The evidence in this case was sufficient for a jury to conclude that, in the alleged scheme of misrepresentation in this case, Landegger authorized and directed his companies and his companies' employees in at least one of the essential components of the scheme: the crucial decision that ARG would certify as eligible for BCAP subsidies wood material used to make black liquor. The trial court, therefore, properly denied Landegger's motion for a JML on the individual misrepresentation claim against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jury Instruction on Implied Contracts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The ARG defendants argue next that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on both implied contracts and express contracts, which the ARG defendants argue are \"generally incompatible.\" See\n   <em>\n    Kennedy v.

The wood dealers also note that in\n   <em>\n    Kennedy\n   </em>\n   , cited by the ARG defendants for the proposition that jury instructions on both implied contract and express contract are generally incompatible, this Court nevertheless went on to hold that both instructions may be sustained.

In their answer to the first amended complaint, the ARG defendants admitted \"that the wood dealers entered into contracts to sell wood to be delivered to [ARG],\" but they denied the wood dealers' assertions regarding the terms of those contracts. At trial, witnesses for the ARG defendants described the prices promised to the wood dealers as mere \"estimates\" or \"mathematical examples,\" and \"not guarantees.\" On the other hand, the wood dealers testified that ARG promised them specific prices for their wood, testified about the prior course of dealing and the relationship between the parties, and described the general nature of the lumber industry, where agreements were often based on prior dealings. At the close of trial, the ARG defendants objected\n   to a jury instruction on implied contract but filed in open court their own proposed jury instruction stating: \"The [wood dealers] claim that the [ARG] defendants defrauded them, were negligent in contracting with them, and then breached the alleged contract.\n   <em>\n    The [ARG] defendants deny that there was a contract\n   </em>\n   , that they breached any alleged contract, or defrauded the [wood dealers].\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, in closing arguments, one attorney for the ARG defendants concluded his portion of the arguments by stating plainly: \"\n   <em>\n    And when y'all go out and make your decision, there's no contract here. There's no contract.\n   </em>\n   And there's certainly-there's no fraud.

Instead, the ARG defendants appear to argue that a claim of breach of an implied contract is\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   improper when there is evidence of the existence of an express contract.

The ARG defendants also argue that the prejudice of Landegger's absence was compounded by the trial court's error in excluding positive character evidence regarding Landegger, which, they assert, was triggered by the wood dealers' counsel\n   impugning Landegger's character and \"opening the door\" to such evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As to the first issue, the ARG defendants argue that they were denied a fair trial because of the denial of the continuance and Landegger's subsequent inability to personally defend himself and ARG at trial. On May 26, 2015, Landegger was sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment in New York followed by 6 months' home confinement in Connecticut. One month later on June 26, 2015, the ARG defendants filed a motion in the trial court to continue the scheduled trial until the following civil jury term in 2016. In their motion, the ARG defendants argued that \"it does not appear that [Landegger] will be available to appear for trial before the end of February 2016,\" that Landegger was \"indispensable to the defense of this case,\" and that his absence \"would adversely affect the presentation of his case and the cases of the other defendants.\" The ARG defendants added in their motion that they \"come to this court with hats in hand\" because Landegger had \"previously requested that this case be continued before he was sentenced, and that they agreed to an August 24 trial date.\" Landegger's home confinement began on August 24, 2015, the first day of the scheduled trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   On July 2, 2015, the trial court issued an order denying the ARG defendants' motion for a continuance. In its posttrial order, the trial court referred to this matter, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \"As to Defendant Landegger's contention that he was unfairly prejudiced by being unable to appear at the trial, the court notes that it granted several continuances in this matter (pending for nearly 5 years), and offered to assist Landegger's counsel in obtaining a reprieve from house arrest to attend the trial, but was never asked to provide assistance. Defendant's counsel made no showing of any efforts to obtain an exemption from house arrest for the trial.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   After the trial, at the very beginning of the\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    /\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green-Oil\n   </em>\n   hearing, the trial court again raised the issue of Landegger's absence at the trial, apparently responding to the ARG defendants' assertion in posttrial motions that the court \"excluded [Landegger] from his trial.\" The court asserted: \"[W]ell, that's true and not true. But I want to put this on the record.\" The court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   \"During the course of the trial I said to one of the defense counsel that if I could do anything-he was getting off on to house arrest as I understand. I said if I could do anything to get him-and this was off the record-to get him to come to the trial, sign anything, issue any order, I would do it. And the lawyer replied to me that they had checked with the New York counsel-his New York counsel, and it was either impossible or impractical, whichever. But I just want that on the record.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   No comment in response to this statement, by any counsel, is reflected in the record. In their brief before this Court, the ARG defendants do not directly dispute this statement by the trial court but argue that the court's offer, \"if made, was too late for Mr. Landegger to get to trial\" and to prepare therefor. The ARG defendants argue that Landegger was prejudiced by the court's denial of a continuance because, they say, he was tried in absentia for fraud in a punitive-damages case, his absence \"undoubtedly led the jury to make an adverse inference on his credibility,\" and he would have been an indispensable participant at trial, both on his own behalf and on behalf of ARG. Therefore, argue the ARG defendants, the trial court exceeded its discretion in not continuing the trial until Landegger could attend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Civil litigants in Alabama have no right to a continuance of a trial, nor do incarcerated parties have a right to personally attend or testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   \"A trial judge has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion for continuance,\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

When the ARG defendants filed the motion to continue on June 26, 2015, the litigation was in its fourth year and the trial court had already granted several continuances. The ARG defendants asserted in their motion that, \"[u]nder the terms of his incarceration and home confinement, it does not appear that he will be available to appear for trial before the end of February 2016.\" Attached to the motion were the judgment, sentence, and supervised-release conditions for Landegger's federal crime. Under\n   \"Special Conditions of Supervision\" of Exhibit B, the document reads: \"During this period of home confinement, the defendant may leave his home only to work, attend school, participate in religious services, and attend medical appointments for himself and his immediate family, and for such other activities approved by the Probation Office.\" The ARG defendants assert that,\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he was released to home confinement in August 2015, the first week of trial in this case, Landegger had difficulties contacting his assigned probation officer and thus could not have obtained permission to travel. However, such matters occurring after the trial court's order are not relevant to whether the trial court exceeded its discretion\n   <em>\n    at the time it denied the continuance motion\n   </em>\n   . \"[N]ormally, a reviewing court determines the correctness of a trial court's ruling as of the time when it was made and according to what the record shows was before the lower court at that time.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7013393\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/120/1130/#p1205\">\n    120 So.3d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205-06 (Ala. Crim. App. 2009) (citations and quotations marks omitted). Based on the record as it was before the trial court when the motion for a continuance was filed, Landegger's conditions of home confinement provided that he could \"leave his home\" if attending the trial in Alabama was considered one of the \"activities approved by the Probation Office.\" Despite this apparent option, and the trial court's apparent willingness to assist Landegger's counsel in obtaining a reprieve from house arrest to attend the trial in Alabama, the trial court stated in its posttrial order and again at the\n   <em>\n    Hammond/Green Oil\n   </em>\n   hearing that it was never asked to provide assistance. The ARG defendants do not dispute this. Therefore, based on the materials it had before it when the motion for a continuance was filed, the trial court may have concluded that Landegger still might have been able to attend the trial personally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Furthermore, even if Landegger was indeed unable to attend the trial, the ARG defendants have not shown that the trial court exceeded its discretion in denying the motion for a continuance. In\n   <em>\n    Barbee\n   </em>\n   , the only majority opinion from an Alabama court cited by the ARG defendants, a default judgment was entered against an imprisoned, pro se husband where the trial court both ignored the threshold issue of improper venue and failed to give the husband proper notice of the trial date. By contrast, Landegger faced no \"stacked deck\" against him as did the incarcerated appellant in\n   <em>\n    Barbee\n   </em>\n   : there was no last-minute scramble for a continuance, no prerequisite matter (such as venue) to be resolved, no allegation that Landegger or his counsel did not receive proper notice or had had insufficient access to legal research or case materials, and no default judgment against him. When the ARG defendants' third motion to continue was filed, they noted that Landegger had already been deposed once and made no assertion that he could not be deposed again; thus, the trial court might have presumed Landegger had sufficient time to be deposed a second time before trial. Although out-of-state and unavailable parties may certainly desire, with good reasons, to be personally present at their trial, the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, as we said in\n   <em>\n    Hubbard\n   </em>\n   , expressly provide that, for situations like Landegger's, the \"proper course [was] to take his own oral or written deposition under Rule 30 or 31, [Ala. R. Civ. P.], to be used at trial as specifically provided in Rule 32(a)(3)(C), [Ala. R. Civ. P.].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9583694\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/372/315/#p316\">\n    372 So.2d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, based on the facts before us, we do not believe the ARG defendants have demonstrated that the trial court exceeded its discretion in denying them a continuance of the trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Relatedly, the ARG defendants also argue that the trial court erred in excluding the admission of certain portions of Landegger's deposition to allegedly rebut the wood dealers having \"open[ed] the door\" with evidence meant to impugn Landegger's character. Specifically, the ARG defendants assert that the wood dealers' counsel \"told the jury that Mr. Landegger had made a lot of money off the backs of people in Monroe County, sold his mills, taken the money, and left the county.\" The ARG defendants argue that, under the doctrine of curative admissibility, portions of Landegger's deposition describing more of his contributions to Monroe County and \"the testimony of Pete Black to the same effect\" should have been admitted to rebut the statements by the wood dealers' counsel. See 1\n   <em>\n    McElroy's Alabama Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14.01 (6th ed. 2009);\n   <em>\n    Mutual Sav. Life Ins. Co. v.

App. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The record shows, however, that counsel for the wood dealers actually said the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   \"They want to talk about Mr. Landegger, Mr. Landegger came to Monroe County and the good things he has done. He has made a lot of money off the backs of the people in Monroe County. He has made a lot of money. And he has sold his mill and he has gone on.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In context, counsel was arguing to the jury that punitive damages should be assessed against the ARG defendants, who were accused of breach of contract and fraud. Counsel's brief mention of the \"good things [Landegger] has done\" for Monroe County and that he \"made a lot of money\" and then sold his mill and had \"gone on\" does not appear to be a patent attack on Landegger's character, at least not on a plain reading of a cold record.

Moreover, according to the wood dealers, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in excluding the report because it may have considered the report to have a \"lack of trustworthiness\" under Rule 803(8)(C) inasmuch as the findings and recommendations of the report had been rejected by the deputy administrator, the \"ultimate decisional authority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   First, under Rule 803(8), the report is undeniably a \"[r]ecord[ ], report[ ], statement[ ], or data compilation[ ], in any form,\" of a \"public office[ ] or agenc[y]\"-namely, a record or report generated by and for the USDA generally and the FSA specifically. Second, we disagree with the wood dealers that the report is not part of a fact-finding investigation because it was, they say, an intra-agency, nonfinal recommendation of only proposed findings of fact. The report facially identifies as a report on \"a hearing ... for the purpose of fact finding\" for the office of the deputy administrator and concludes with thanking the deputy administrator for the opportunity to conduct this \"fact-finding effort.\" Moreover, the stated \"goal\" of the hearing, according to the report, \"was to afford [ARG] the opportunity to present additional information for consideration before your issuance of a final adverse determination.\" Even if the recommendations made in the report were rejected by a higher ranking official, nothing about the report indicates it does not contain \"factual findings resulting from an investigation pursuant to lawful authority.\" The report, up to this point in the analysis, qualifies rather easily under Rule 803(8)(C) as a \"public record.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Third, however, \" Rule 803(8) grants trial courts the discretion to exclude an otherwise qualified public record from evidence if 'the sources of information or other circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness.' \"\n   <em>\n    Swanstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7338918\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/43/564/#p574\">\n    43 So.3d at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, this Court has affirmed a trial court's exclusion of a toxicology report produced by the Federal Aviation Administration because the report suffered from several \"missing links in the chain of custody of the blood samples,\" thereby lacking trustworthiness under Rule 803(8)(C).\n   <em>\n    Swanstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7338918\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/43/564/#p574\">\n    43 So.3d at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In the present case, the report suffers from several considerations, both facially and external to it, that would indicate its untrustworthiness. First, as the wood dealers argued below and in this Court, the primary findings and recommendations in the report were ultimately rejected by the deputy administrator. To the extent that the ARG defendants wanted to introduce only the report as bearing the imprimatur of the federal agency administering BCAP, the intra-agency recommendations in the report were rejected by the deputy administrator on behalf of the FSA, meaning that the FSA's opinion on the ARG defendants' actions regarding BCAP, both before the report was issued and after in the final adverse determination, were consistently the\n   <em>\n    opposite\n   </em>\n   of the state committee's. The trial court might have considered the admission of a report extracted from the intermediate level of an administrative-appeals process to be largely misleading and confusing for the jury and more prejudicial than probative. \"[P]ublic reports, otherwise admissible under Rule 803(8)(C), may nonetheless be excluded in whole or in part if the trial court finds that they are ... more prejudicial than probative.\"\n   <em>\n    Hines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10529199\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/886/299/\">\n    886 F.2d at 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Second, the trial court may have considered the report to contain inadmissible legal conclusions inasmuch as the state committee recommended that the deputy administrator conclude that the ARG defendants employed \"no 'scheme or devise [sic],' \" that their failure to comply with BCF certification agreement was \"not done knowingly and willfully,\" and that the written regulations governing BCAP were deficient or lacking entirely. Such legal opinions might be relevant to the claims of misrepresentation against the ARG defendants; indeed, the ARG defendants tout these very portions of the report as their reasons for desiring its admission. As legal opinions in a public record, however, they are generally inadmissible under Rule 803(8)(C). Compare Rule 803(8), Ala. R. Evid., Advisory Committee's Notes (noting that \"a naked legal conclusion found in a police accident report could be excluded if it would not be helpful, as required by Ala. R. Evid. 701(b), or would not assist the trier of fact, as required under Ala. R. Evid. 702\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Third, the hearing conducted by the state committee was attended by and featured statements from only the ARG defendants. No other affected parties or witnesses were heard, rendering the hearing\n   and the fact-finding more of an echo chamber of the ARG defendants' positions and arguments rather than a fair investigative report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Fourth, the state committee in the report confessed its own lack of expertise on BCAP, which it called a \"very new\" program, stating that \"[i]t would certainly take more than a few hours to educate the [state committee] on BCAP to prepare itself to render comprehensive findings on these submitted facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Fifth, the conclusion portion of the report touts BCAP as \"an economic stimulus for economic growth in rural Alabama\" and notes that the then President was \"pressing us to participate in job forum listening sessions.\" Therefore, warns the report, \"we would be hard pressed to explain why USDA is making a decision that is so counterproductive to the big focus ... jobs ... jobs ... jobs.\" Such statements indicate a potential bias by the state committee in favor of pleasing the President by avoiding an FSA determination perceived to be contrary to the ARG defendants and, by extension, inhibitive of \"economic growth in rural Alabama.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   These five considerations, although not exhaustive, lend support to the trial court's decision to exclude the report as untrustworthy under Rule 803(8)(C) or as otherwise inadmissible. The ARG defendants have not demonstrated that the trial court exceeded its discretion in excluding the report from evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The ARG defendants also argue that the trial court erred in excluding the wood dealers' letter of June 18, 2010, sent to Landegger and Harris. Landegger and Harris did not sign the wood dealers' letter. The wood dealers' letter begins ominously by noting that, although ARG and the wood dealers formerly enjoyed a \"good\" business relationship, \"things are changing.\" Citing the \"imminent sale\" of ARG's assets, the writers ask \"for written confirmation of agreements made by [ARG] to us concerning ... BCAP\" and posit two \"points of agreement\" concerning the promissory notes ARG asked the wood dealers to sign. The letter continues, however, and notes that, when ARG was suspended from BCAP, the amounts ARG advanced to the wood dealers via the promissory notes were less than the BCAP subsidy that was being paid before the suspension, leading to a difference that \"will amount to a loss\" for the wood dealers. The wood dealers' letter then proposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \"Because of this we are requesting that in the event that a partial BCAP payment is made to the wood suppliers by the FSA along the lines as other competing mills percentages were paid, then all promissory notes will be voided. If any amounts are paid over above the percentages of the competing mills, then that amount will be returned to [ARG] as full payment of said promissory notes.\n   <em>\n    This would somewhat satisfy most transactions that were made by wood suppliers during the BCAP period for which [ARG] made cash advances as referenced by promissory notes\n   </em>\n   .\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The ARG defendants, who do not quote the portion of the letter set forth above, argue that the trial court erred in excluding the wood dealers' letter because the letter was written before the wood dealers had asserted a legal claim, the letter sought only to confirm existing business agreements, and the letter did not offer \"valuable consideration\" as compromise. See Rule 408, Ala. R. Evid. The wood dealers argue that the letter was plainly an offer to compromise and is therefore inadmissible under Rule 408. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Rule 408 prohibits the admission of evidence of \"furnishing or offering or promising to furnish-or accepting or offering or promising to accept-a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim\" when such evidence is \"offered to prove liability for, invalidity of, or amount of a claim that was disputed as to validity or amount.\" Rule 408(a)(1). The broader scope of Rule 408, unlike at common law, prohibits even \"conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim.\" Rule 408(a)(2). See also Rule 408, Ala. R. Evid., Advisory Committee's Notes (noting \"breadth of exclusion\" extended beyond common law). This Court summed up the \"well established\" principles regarding the admissibility of settlement communications as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   \"The general rule is that offers of compromise by one party to another in a civil action,\n   <em>\n    whether before or after the litigation is begun\n   </em>\n   , [are] inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    Glaze v.

The very issues raised in the wood dealers' letter regarding the promissory notes and BCAP subsidies paid (and then suspended) are the same issues that, just a few months after, crystallized into an actual lawsuit between the wood dealers and the ARG defendants. Thus, the ARG defendants' argument that the wood dealers' letter was sent before the wood dealers had asserted their claims (or the ARG defendants their counterclaims) is not dispositive because the prohibition in Rule 408 generally applies \"whether before or after the litigation is begun.\"\n   <em>\n    Super Valu Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7575743\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/506/317/#p321\">\n    506 So.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nor can we agree that the wood dealers' letter sought only to outline\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   agreements. Rather, the letter proposed two conditional proposals: If a lower BCAP subsidy is paid comparable to what other mills were generating then the promissory notes would be voided, but, if any BCAP subsidies are made that are higher than those found at the other mills then the overage goes to ARG as full payment of the promissory notes. This offer would purportedly \"somewhat satisfy most transactions that were made by wood suppliers during the BCAP period for which [ARG] made cash advances as referenced by promissory notes.\" This is plainly an offer to compromise, including an offer to furnish (or accept) valuable consideration in the form of voiding the promissory notes or paying ARG a portion of the BCAP subsidy, and is therefore prohibited. Indeed, even if the offer did not specify any valuable consideration as required in Rule 408(a)(1), the wood dealers' letter could be considered \"conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim\" under Rule 408(a)(2).

They ask this Court to remit the total compensatory-damages award from $1,092,692.71 to $313,528.82. The wood dealers disagree and argue that, as the trial court held in its posttrial order, the compensatory damages are supported by the evidence and that it was within the independent discretion of the jury to award that amount, even though it is greater than the amount the wood dealers demanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Our review of an award of compensatory damages is guided by the following well established principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   \" 'The authority to disturb a jury verdict on the ground of excessiveness of damages is one which should be exercised with great caution....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   \" '....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   \" 'We begin by recognizing that the right to a trial by jury is a fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed right, Art.

It is only in those cases that a trial court, pursuant to [Ala]. R. Civ. P. 59(f), and this Court, pursuant to [Ala.] Code 1975, \u00a7 12-22-71, may interfere with a jury verdict. Insofar as damages are concerned, a jury verdict may be flawed in two ways. First, it may include or exclude a sum which is clearly recoverable or not as a matter of law, or which is totally unsupported by the evidence, where there is an exact standard or rule of law that makes the damages legally and mathematically ascertainable at a precise figure. In these situations, a trial court may, and should, reduce or increase the amount of the verdict to reflect the amount to which the parties are entitled as a matter of law.

Based on the ARG defendants' preferred formula, therefore, the respective damages for each plaintiff should have been as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-159\">Ayres: $19,365.89 BAR: $0 Conecuh: $68,638.88 Dry Creek: $64,714.73 Pea River: $59,574.58 Pineville: $73,163.55 TTC: $28,071.19 _________ ___________ TOTAL: $313,528.82</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   By these calculations, the ARG defendants assert that the wood dealers' award should be reduced by $682,349.94 and provide extensive record citations to support their proposed calculations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The wood dealers argue that the ARG defendants place before this Court the same figures and formulas that the ARG defendants presented to the jury below but ignore the evidence that the wood dealers put before the jury to support their damages claims. For example, the wood dealers note, John Ayres of Ayres Forestry testified on direct examination that he produced a \"detailed ticket listing out of my accounting program, detailing every ticket that I hauled from the time I signed [up for BCAP] through the BCAP period of April 30th.\" This ticket listing was entered into evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 305A.

Additionally, counsel for the ARG defendants also offered into evidence several exhibits related to Ayres's calculations. Like John Ayres, each of the other six wood dealers had a representative witness testify to their respective company's damages and underlying calculations in much the same way. And for each witness, the ARG defendants cross-examined (and re-crossed) him, countered with their own\n   evidence, and, in their case-in-chief, presented expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   In their appellate attack on this portion of the compensatory damages, the ARG defendants are essentially asking this Court to reexamine the competing arithmetic of the parties, to reweigh the competing testimony and exhibits, and to substitute the jury's verdict with the ARG defendants' formula of the appropriate final sum. Just as \"[a] trial court may not substitute its judgment for that of the jury when the jury has returned a compensatory verdict that is supported by the record,\"\n   <em>\n    Spivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12014263\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/694/1316/#p1326\">\n    694 So.2d at 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , neither may this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Witnesses for every wood dealer testified to the amount of, and the calculations used to determine, their requested damages, and supporting documentation was entered into evidence.

Because the jury signed general verdict forms that provided one compensatory-damages award for both claims for which the ARG defendants were found liable (breach of contract and misrepresentation), we cannot assign any clear division of the award between the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The ARG defendants' first argument against these \"extra\" damages is that, as a matter of law, the wood dealers could not recover damages on the contract and also recover reliance damages, citing\n   <em>\n    Goolesby v. Koch Farms, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8310468\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/422/\">\n    955 So.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 2006). As this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Goolesby\n   </em>\n   , \" 'reliance damages,' are generally awarded in lieu of, not in addition to, expectation damages,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8310468\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/955/422/\">\n    955 So.2d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for breach-of-contract claims. However, the ARG defendants ignore the fact that the wood dealers successfully prosecuted the ARG defendants for fraudulent misrepresentation; this is not merely a breach-of-contract case. Therefore, and as a matter of law, the wood dealers are \" 'entitled to damages for all injuries proximately caused by' \" the ARG defendants' misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    Morris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12382674\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/228/971/#p978\">\n    228 So.3d at 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kidder v.

The ARG defendants do not dispute this argument but, instead, pivot to their second argument against these \"extra\" damages: that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's award of such \"extra\" reliance damages. The ARG defendants concede that THE Timber Company presented evidence of increased transportation costs, that Dry Creek presented evidence of what other mills paid it, and that there was testimony on behalf of each of the wood dealers about higher stumpage costs, but they argue that not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the wood dealers produced such evidence and that\n   there was no evidence of the\n   <em>\n    total amounts\n   </em>\n   of these costs. In support, the ARG defendants cite, without elaboration,\n   <em>\n    Aldridge v. Dolbeer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7541653\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/567/1267/\">\n    567 So.2d 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ala. 1990), in which this Court held that \"[t]he plaintiff has the burden of producing sufficient evidence of his loss to allow the factfinder to calculate the damages without operating from guesswork.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7541653\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/567/1267/\">\n    567 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1270 (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Rather, the wood dealers testified in varying detail to their economic harm incurred and also itemized the amounts they did not include in their final damages figure, including BCAP subsidies received and the \"advances\" received from ARG with promissory notes. They testified to the economic hardship they suffered by continuing to haul their wood to ARG after ARG's suspension from BCAP. For example, as Ayres testified, he tallied his gross total for what he believed he \"should have been paid\" to be $223,119.52. From that number, he testified that he subtracted the BCAP subsidies he received from the FSA, the amount of the promissory notes from ARG, and, finally, $8 per ton for wood he hauled to ARG that was not eligible for a BCAP subsidy. As Ayres explained: \"Well, the eight dollars a ton was what Mark and I agreed on. And\n   <em>\n    even though it was not supposed to be subtracted and even though [ARG] was not supposed to get financial gain off of my wood, I subtracted it because that's what we had agreed on\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) For any one or all of those reasons, the jury may have taken the testimony of those wood dealers who presented more exacting calculations of their increased transportation costs (THE Timber Company) or the amounts other mills paid them (Dry Creek) and applied those figures as estimated damages applicable to some of or all the other similarly situated wood dealers. In its discretion, the jury may have seen fit to include certain amounts of the damages that even the wood dealers (like Ayres) thought should be credited to the ARG defendants' benefit, including the amount the ARG defendants required the wood dealers to discount their prices during the BCAP, thus raising the total compensatory-damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The question is not whether this Court's (or the trial court's) arithmetic might yield different numbers, and we decline the ARG defendants' implicit invitation to measure the \"extra\" compensatory damages awarded with \"mathematical certainty.\" \"If the evidence furnishes data for an approximate estimate of the amount of damages, it is sufficient to support a judgment.\" J.M. Marsh,\n   <em>\n    Alabama Law of Damages\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2:7 (6th ed. 2012).

Moreover, there was clear and convincing evidence that these intentional misrepresentations were designed to use BCAP to lower the price paid to the wood dealers, depriving the latter of \"property or legal rights or otherwise causing injury\" to them.

The ARG defendants argue that their conduct was not reprehensible. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   According to the\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   rubric, the first two considerations do not support a finding of reprehensibility on the part of the ARG defendants: the harm caused by the ARG defendants was not physical and did not demonstrate a disregard for anyone's health or safety. The next three considerations, however, support a finding of reprehensibility. As to the \"financial vulnerability\" of the plaintiffs, the ARG defendants argue that the wood dealers were not \"elderly, poor, disabled, or illiterate\" but were \"successful businessmen.\" The ARG defendants cite no support for the idea that businessmen (or businesses) cannot be considered \"financially vulnerable.\" In the instant case, the purpose of BCAP was to provide assistance for wood dealers in a struggling economy, not to provide a financial windfall for paper mills. But the ARG defendants positioned themselves as the BCAP experts and \"gatekeepers\" to the BCAP subsidies and urged as many wood dealers as they could to sell them wood at a discounted price. When the FSA suspended ARG from BCAP, thereby prohibiting any wood dealer from obtaining a BCAP subsidy for wood delivered to ARG's mills, the ARG defendants doubled down and told the wood dealers to continue delivering wood to ARG's mills anyway. For example, Malcolm Smith, president and part-owner of Conecuh Timber, testified that Conecuh was \"going in the red\" because it had contracted to pay timberland owners a higher price for their timber based on the ARG defendants' promise that Conecuh would receive a BCAP subsidy for the wood it delivered to ARG's mills. Terry Chapman, Conecuh's CEO, stated that Conecuh was \"running out of cash and couldn't borrow any more money to operate on.\" Tommy Mosley, co-owner of Pineville Timber, testified that he asked ARG if he could \"just continue like we are\" and was told: \"If you want to do business with [ARG], you are going to do BCAP.\" When asked at trial about whether he had had a choice to sign the promissory notes, Mosley responded: \"Yes, sir, we could go out of business or we could stay in business. That was our choice.\" Moreover, ARG responded to the financial crisis of the wood dealers no longer receiving BCAP subsidies by paying them what they called an \"advance\" to compensate them in part, but they also made the wood dealers sign promissory notes therefor. In short, the ARG defendants used BCAP subsidies\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the wood dealers for their own profit and responded to the wood dealers' deepening financial vulnerability by converting the wood dealers' losses into debts owed to ARG and enforced by a countersuit. We find ample evidence from which to conclude that the wood dealers were financially vulnerable and became more so throughout the duration of ARG's manipulation of BCAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   As to the last two considerations of reprehensibility, the conduct of the ARG defendants involved repeated misrepresentations to the wood dealers to induce, and\n   then to keep them, delivering wood to ARG's mills. Their decision to certify as eligible for a BCAP subsidy wood used to make black liquor affected every wood dealers' delivery to ARG's mills during BCAP. The misrepresentations here were not isolated incidents, and the ARG defendants' argument in their brief that BCAP was a \"one-time program\" lasting a few months is inapposite. Moreover, the harm to the wood dealers was caused, we have already held, by the ARG defendants' intentional misrepresentations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   In sum, three of the five\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   factors support a finding of reprehensibility regarding the ARG defendants' conduct toward the wood dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n   </em>\n   Gore\n   <em>\n    Guidepost 2: Disparity Between Harm that Occurred and Punitive-Damages Award\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Under the second\n   <em>\n    Gore\n   </em>\n   guidepost, the\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   Court refused to impose a \"bright-line ratio\" of punitive damages to compensatory damages and reiterated its reluctance to \"identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/\">\n    517 U.S. at 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ('[W]e have consistently rejected the notion that the constitutional line is marked by a simple mathematical formula, even one that compares actual\n   <em>\n    and potential\n   </em>\n   damages to the punitive award');\n   <em>\n    TXO[ Production Corp. v.

Even after the trial court applied the statutory cap on punitive damages-which limits punitive damages to the higher of \"three times the compensatory damages\" or, in 2015, the fixed sum of $711,200-the ratio of punitive-to-compensatory damages varied from a low of 2.91:1 to a high of 19.49:1. Specifically, the statutorily capped punitive-damages awards were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-236\"><em>Plaintiff</em> <em>Compensatory</em> <em>Capped Punitive</em> <em>Ratio</em> Ayres: $76,876.17 $711,200 9.25 BAR: $178,536.88 $711,200 3.98 Conecuh: $248,932.22 $746,796.66 3.00 Dry Creek: $343,634.87 $1,000,000 2.91 Pea River: $109,670.88 $711,200 6.48 Pineville: $98,542.50 $711,200 7.22 TTC: $36,499.19 $711,200 19.49</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Nothing in the record supports the wide range of punitive-to-compensatory ratios. In fact, when we consider the defendants' conduct that supports the punitive damages we see that the wrongdoing toward each wood dealer was generally the same. Although some wood dealers brought more BCAP wood to ARG's mills than others, resulting in higher economic damage, there was no material deviation in the facts and circumstances of the ARG defendants' misrepresentations toward the wood dealers. Therefore, the jury's award of a uniform $1,000,000 in punitive damages to every wood dealer appears to be arbitrary and not based upon any relationship to the compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   In determining what the reasonable and proportionate ratio in this case ought to be, we note that the wood dealer who was awarded the highest compensatory damages, Dry Creek, was awarded the lowest damages ratio, even after application of the damages cap, of just under 3:1.

A uniform, mathematical bright-line has been rejected for every case, but for multiple plaintiffs in the same case that have not shown substantially different tortious harm done them by the defendants, the arithmetic for punitive damages should be\n   <em>\n    internally consistent\n   </em>\n   , at least.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Beyond the internal logic of the 3:1 ratio that arises from a reasonable and proportionate application of Dry Creek's damages ratio to those of the other wood dealers, we have described the 3:1 proportion as \"a ratio for which substantial support can be found under Alabama law.\"\n   <em>\n    Sockwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11424307,11424438\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/829/111/\">\n    829 So.2d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Black liquor is created when wood chips are heated under pressure with a chemical mixture known as \"white liquor\" in large vessels called digesters, the object of which is to separate other undesirable materials from the cellulose fibers in wood that make up raw wood pulp. Once these undesirable materials are separated from the wood pulp in the digester, they combine with the other materials used in the process to form black liquor. This black liquor is then sent to the recovery boiler, where it is heated to remove the water, and the materials extracted from the wood are burned to create heat and power for use in the pulp mill. During the burning process, the nonflammable chemicals in the initial white-liquor mixture are also separated and removed, becoming \"green liquor.\" Green liquor is then treated with lime to become white liquor that can subsequently be used again in the digester when the cycle is repeated.
