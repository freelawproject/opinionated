The indictment was amended on April 14, 2015, to charge Defendant with a third count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of La.R.S. 14:95.1 ; and a fourth count of distribution of marijuana, a violation of La.R.S. 40:966(A)(1). On that same date, Defendant waived his right to a jury trial. On June 3, 2015, after a two-day bench trial, the trial judge found Defendant guilty of all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Subsequently, on July 10, 2015, Defendant was charged as a second habitual offender in a separate docket number.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 24, 2015, the trial court accepted Defendant's admission to his status as a second habitual offender on his two convictions for attempted second degree murder and his one conviction for distribution of marijuana. The trial court sentenced Defendant as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Attempted second degree murder - second habitual offender (two counts) - thirty-five years in DOC on each count.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Distribution of marijuana - second habitual offender - fifteen years in DOC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Possession of a weapon by a convicted felon - ten years in DOC. The trial court ordered all sentences to run concurrently. The trial court also found Defendant violated his probation in a separate docket number and ordered that sentence to run consecutively to the sentences above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 31, 2015, Defendant filed a pro se Motion to Reconsider Sentence in the docket number for the underlying convictions. Defendant filed another pro se Motion to Reconsider Sentence on September 22, 2015. Without specifying which of the two motions to reconsider sentence it was denying, the trial court denied the motion by written order on January 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, a Motion and Order for Out of Time Appeal was filed on November 17, 2016. The trial court granted the out-of-time appeal that same date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Now before the court is a brief filed by Defendant alleging four assignments of error, two of which involve Defendant's waiver of his right to jury trial and the other two involve Defendant's adjudication as a second habitual offender.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following Statement of Facts is set forth in Defendant's brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   At Mr. Dubroc's bench trial, the judge concluded that on November 3, 2013, Mr. Dubroc traveled in a vehicle to St. Charles apartments located at 1011 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street Lake Charles, Louisiana to sell marijuana. It was at this location Mr. Dubroc was alleged to have committed the subject offenses, purportedly discharging a weapon striking two persons. It is from this verdict of guilt, and subsequent sentencing, that Mr. Dubroc appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 920, all appeals are reviewed by this court for errors patent on the face of the record.

I, \u00a7 17 and La.Code Crim.P. art. 780.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that will be discussed, we find that this assignment lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant was entitled to a jury trial in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.R.S. 14:30.1 and La.Code Crim.P. art. 782. Both the Louisiana Constitution and the Code of Criminal Procedure provide for the waiver of this right in certain circumstances. La.Const. Art. I, \u00a7 17 and La.Code Crim. P. art. 780. In 2010, the Louisiana Constitution was amended to require the waiver be made no later than forty-five days prior to the trial date:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Except in capital cases, a defendant may knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a trial by jury but no later than forty-five days prior to the trial date and the waiver shall be irrevocable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 17 (A) (in pertinent part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

I, \u00a7 17 to mean the initial trial setting. In the present case, the initial trial setting was June 9, 2014. The trial date was refixed several times. On April 14, 2015, the State amended the grand jury indictment to charge two additional crimes, and Defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the new charges. Defendant also waived his right to a jury trial at the April 14, 2015 hearing. Since Defendant's waiver of his right to jury trial was entered\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the initial trial fixing, Defendant's waiver was not timely under the provisions of La.Const. art. 1, \u00a7 17. However, in light of the cases discussed below, the violation of La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 17 is harmless and waived by Defendant's failure to object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. McKeel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13-855%20%28La.App.%203%20Cir.%202/12/14%29\">\n    13-855 (La.App. 3 Cir. 2/12/14)\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902732\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/1029/\">\n    153 So.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this court found the error in allowing the defendant to waive his jury trial in violation of the time period set forth in La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 17 was harmless where the defendant requested a waiver of his right to jury trial and did not object to the granting of the waiver. This court additionally noted the defendant did not assign as error or argue\n   the jury waiver issue on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like in\n   <em>\n    McKeel\n   </em>\n   , the present Defendant did not object when the trial court granted his untimely waiver. The present Defendant does, however, assign the untimely waiver as an assignment of error on appeal. Despite the fact that Defendant has assigned the untimeliness as an error on appeal, the jurisprudence discussed below supports a finding that the error is harmless and waived by Defendant's lack of objection in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v. McKnight\n   </em>\n   , 16-310, p. 14 (La.App. 1 Cir. 9/16/16),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204942398\">\n    2016 WL 4942398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (unpublished opinion),\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 16-1769 (La. 6/16/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364688,12364682,12364699,12364693\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/219/340/\">\n    219 So.3d 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the first circuit stated the following regarding a defendant's relinquishment of his right to challenge his untimely jury trial waiver:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   As noted by the trial court, pursuant to both La. Const. art. I, \u00a7 17A and La. C.Cr.P. art. 780D, the waiver of a trial by jury is irrevocable and cannot be withdrawn by the defendant. Even if the defendant's exercise of this right might have been untimely under Article I, Section 17A and Article 780D (the defendant's waiver was not made more than forty-five days before the trial date), any such error is not structural in nature and was waived when the defendant elected to be tried before the trial judge in a bench trial. Once the trial court accepted the defendant's untimely waiver with no objection by the State, that waiver became irrevocable by operation of the amendments to Article I, Section 17A and Article 780. To allow the defendant to knowingly and intelligently waive his right to trial by jury and then to reverse the defendant's convictions and sentences on appeal because of an untimely waiver, would be to allow the defendant to seek a favorable outcome from the judge and then to resort on appeal to an error that he instigated in the trial court. Such an outcome would not be in the interests of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Herrod\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9549473\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/412/564/#p566\">\n    412 So.2d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566 (La. 1982) (\"Our law requires that defendant make a contemporaneous objection and state the reason therefor to allow the trial judge the opportunity to rule on it and prevent or cure error.\"). Moreover, the language of the amended constitutional provision itself declares that \"the waiver shall be irrevocable.\" Thus, once the district court accepted the defendant's untimely jury waiver with no objection by the state, and thus no opportunity to cure the error, that waiver became irrevocable by operation of the 2010 amendment. It would be unwise for this court to impair the ability of both the State and defendant to agree on a trial date less than 45 days\n   before trial, as this would lead to inefficient use of judicial resources for the reasons discussed at length in the concurrence in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the Defendant did not make a jury waiver \"no later than 45 days prior to trial,\" the State did not object and the case proceeded to trial, ending in a mistrial. The ruling of the trial court allowing the Defendant to revoke his irrevocable waiver of a jury trial is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for a bench trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Considering the cases cited above, Defendant's waiver of his right to jury trial, although untimely under La.Const. art. I, \u00a7 17, became irrevocable once it was accepted by the trial court. The waiver was made by Defendant without objection by either Defendant or the State. Any error based on the untimeliness, therefore, is harmless and waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although Defendant asserts his untimely waiver also violated La.Code Crim.P. art. 780, this assertion has no merit. Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 780 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A.

The waiver shall be by written motion filed in the district court not later than forty-five days prior to the date the case is set for trial. The motion shall be signed by the defendant and shall also be signed by defendant's counsel unless the defendant has waived his right to counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   C. With the consent of the district attorney the defendant may waive trial by jury within forty-five days prior to the commencement of trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   D.

As previously mentioned, Defendant waived his right to a jury trial on September 16, 2013. Court minutes indicate Defendant was present in open court with his attorney when his right to a trial by jury was discussed and waived. There is no indication that the State objected to the waiver. For those reasons, we conclude that no violation of La.Code Crim.P. art. 780 occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the State's consent in the present case, no violation of La.Code Crim.P. art. 780 occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant additionally asserts that the record contains no written waiver of jury trial as required by La.Code Crim.P. art. 780. However, the court minutes and transcript reflect that defense counsel advised the court in Defendant's presence, that Defendant elected to be tried by a judge alone. The minutes further indicate the trial court questioned Defendant, and Defendant waived a jury trial as to all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, the error in failing to obtain a written waiver in violation of La.Code Crim.P. art. 780 is harmless under the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER TWO\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendant contends the trial court violated his constitutional right to a jury trial by failing to ensure Defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial.

Sir, there's been extensive negotiations about these charges that you're scheduled for trial this week on, they're very serious charges.

If that's what you - - if you want to take what's been offered today the cases are resolved. If you do not there's either two ways to take care of the case, guilty plea or no - - well, three ways, I guess, guilty plea, no contest plea, or a trial. Now, if we go to the trial route the State is not going to amend the bill to one count of\n   attempted murder. It's going to be two counts of attempted murder. That changes the plea offer or the sentencing recommendations or my considerations quite a bit. With these new changes, if you're convicted on either one of those, that changes everything. If a habitual offender bill is filed and you're found to be a second or a third or a fourth habitual offender with these types of offenses it's lights out.

The trial court explained to Defendant that the denial he already entered required the State to produce evidence of Defendant's prior conviction. The trial court additionally informed Defendant that he was not being forced to either admit or deny his status as a second habitual offender. Thus, the trial court adequately cautioned Defendant in language that Defendant could understand about his right to remain silent and his right to have the State prove at a court hearing his identity as a habitual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   We note that, regardless of whether the trial court did not adequately advise Defendant of his right to remain silent, the error is nevertheless harmless.

The decision of the court of appeal is reversed in part, and the trial court's adjudication and sentencing of defendant as a habitual offender are reinstated. The requirements of R.S. 15:529.1(D)(1)(a) that the court inform a defendant of the allegations in a habitual offender bill of information, and of his right \"to be tried as to the truth thereof according to law,\" should not serve as technical traps for an unwary but otherwise conscientious judge.... It therefore appears that defendant was fully informed of the allegations in the habitual offender bill and of his right to contest those allegations, with a correlative right to remain silent at the hearing, that he thereafter voluntarily stipulated to the habitual offender allegations after conferring with counsel, and that the trial court adjudicated him a habitual offender on the basis of not only his stipulation but also the documentary evidence introduced by the state at the hearing. Defendant's interests were fully protected and any technical non-compliance with the statutory directives in R.S. 15:529.1(D)(1)(a) was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Before sentencing Defendant as a second habitual offender, the trial court found Defendant guilty of a probation violation, revoked his probation, and ordered that he serve the previously suspended sentence. The trial court heard argument by both parties and then imposed a sentence on each of Defendant's convictions, including the charges for which he was adjudicated a second habitual offender. After the imposition of sentences, defense counsel suggested the court hear the testimony of Defendant's probation officer. The trial court heard the testimony of Defendant's probation officer, who testified that he supervised Defendant while Defendant was on probation for simple robbery. According to the probation officer, Defendant was still on probation when he committed the other charges. In addition to the testimony of Defendant's probation supervisor at the habitual offender hearing, a probation officer testified at trial that her office was currently supervising Defendant's probation for simple robbery. Judge Ron Ware sentenced Defendant on the simple robbery charge on\n   May 17, 2013, and then presided over both Defendant's current trial and his habitual offender hearing. In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the State introduced independent evidence of the predicate convictions themselves, the State offered no independent evidence that Boutte was the person who committed the predicate convictions. To the contrary, the present Defendant was advised of his right to maintain his denial and require the State to prove his status as a habitual offender. Additionally, the present trial court heard evidence both at trial and at the habitual offender proceeding that established Defendant's identity as the person who committed the simple robbery used as his predicate conviction. Thus, without Defendant's admission, the trial court in the present case would have reached the same result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this court finds the trial court sufficiently advised Defendant of his right to remain silent.
