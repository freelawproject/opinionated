Facts and Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal involves increases in the rates of contributions judges and justices are required to pay into the Judicial Retirement Fund (\"the Fund\"), pursuant to \u00a7 12-18-5, Ala. Code 1975. The Fund was established under the provisions of Act No. 1163, Ala. Acts 1973, codified at \u00a7 12-18-1 et seq., Ala. Code 1975, to provide retirement benefits to qualified judges and justices. The Fund is administered by the Board of Control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-18-2(a), Ala. Code 1975.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 12-18-5 provides that membership in the Fund is mandatory for judges and justices elected or appointed to office after September 18, 1973. When the Fund was established, each judge and justice participating in the Fund was required to \"contribute to [the Fund] four and one-half percent of his earnable compensation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In 1975, \u00a7 12-18-5 was amended to provide that, after February 1, 1977, \"the rate\n   of contribution to be paid by the justices and judges shall be six percent of their salary.\" Ala. Acts 1975, 4th Special Sess., Act No. 66, \u00a7 4, p. 2680. On August 11, 1999, Judge Wood was appointed to the 13th Judicial Circuit in Mobile, at which time he began contributing six percent (6%) of his annual salary to the Fund. Judge Wood served until his retirement on January 15, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 15, 2011, the legislature passed Act No. 2011-676, Ala. Acts 2011 (\"the Act\"), which further amended \u00a7 12-18-5 to provide for additional increases in contribution rates to the Fund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 12-18-5, as amended, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"For all pay dates beginning on or after October 1, 2011, the contribution to be paid by the justices and judges shall be eight and one-quarter percent (8.25%) of their salary. For all pay dates beginning on or after October 1, 2012, the rate of contribution to be paid by the justices and judges shall be eight and one-half percent (8.5%) of their salary.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Judge Wood was serving his second official term\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   when both increases in contribution rates took effect. Beginning October 1, 2011, Judge Wood's contribution to the Fund increased from six percent (6%) to eight and one-fourth percent (8.25%), and, beginning October 1, 2012, his contribution increased to eight and one-half percent (8.5%). As noted, Judge Wood retired on January 15, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In June 2012, Judge Wood, individually, and on behalf of a purported class of \"all members\" of the Fund, sued the State defendants, alleging that the mandatory increases in contributions to the Fund reduced Judge Wood's net pay without affording him any additional retirement benefits. He alleged that the increases in contributions violated the Judicial Compensation Clause of Art. VI, \u00a7 148(d), Constitution of Alabama of 1901 (\"the Compensation Clause\"), which provides that \"[t]he compensation of a judge shall not be diminished during his official term.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In his complaint, Judge Wood sought a judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional as violative of the Compensation Clause. He requested relief in the form of an order restoring to him any and all sums by which his compensation allegedly had been diminished, permanently enjoining the State defendants from continuing to enforce the Act against him, and awarding him costs and attorney fees. He also sought similar relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, he sought to have a class of similarly situated judges and justices certified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The State defendants, pursuant to Rule 56, Ala. R. Civ. P., filed a motion for a summary judgment, arguing that Judge Wood's claims were due to be dismissed on the basis of immunity and mootness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   State defendants also argued that the increases in mandatory contributions did not diminish a judge's or justice's compensation in violation of the Compensation Clause. In response, Judge Wood moved the trial court to enter a summary judgment declaring the Act unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In May 2017, after considering the evidence and the parties' arguments, the trial court entered a summary judgment in favor of the State defendants and against Judge Wood, upholding the Act. In its judgment, the trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Rather than diminishing 'compensation,' the changes in retirement contribution rates implemented by [the Act] simply increased the amount contributed by all education and state employees, including judges, to help pay for their retirement benefits. Indeed, such changes have been made before-in 1975 the legislature increased contribution rates for participants including judges. See Acts 1975, 4th Ex. Sess., No. 66, p. 2680, \u00a7 4. Moreover, it is undisputed that judges retain ownership over their own contributions and that they have the right to withdraw their contributions from the retirement system, with interest, should they choose to do so at the end of their active employment. [ Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 12-18-8(b) ]. The Compensation Clause is not violated, nor is the independence of the judiciary threatened, by [the Act's] broadly applicable increase to retirement benefit costs.

Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Wood argues that the trial court erred by entering a summary judgment in favor of the State defendants-upholding the Act. The trial court entered the summary judgment based on the merits of Wood's claims. However, this Court is compelled to address at the outset the State defendants' arguments concerning immunity and mootness because those arguments implicate subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7638787\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/438/766/#p768\">\n    438 So.2d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768 (Ala. 1983) (\"[I]t is the duty of an appellate court to consider lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    mero\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    motu\n   </em>\n   .\").
