For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and amend in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs, Helen Lopez Languirand and L. Lopez's Sons, Inc. (the \"corporation\"), filed a petition on December 15, 2017 against Defendants, John Magruder Lopez (\"John\"), Shawn Lopez (\"Shawn\"), and John Michael Lopez (\"John Michael\"), seeking to have the January 2017 election of the directors and officers for the corporation declared null and void and to have the April 2017 sale and transfer of treasury shares declared null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her petition, Ms. Languirand alleged that she is a shareholder of the corporation. She asserted that Defendants held an annual meeting of shareholders without issuing proper notice, resulting in a meeting attended only by the three defendants. Ms. Languirand stated that neither she nor shareholder Carroll Campbell attended the\n   meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She alleged that at this meeting, which lacked a quorum, Defendants proceeded without authority to elect themselves as the new directors and officers of the corporation. Thereafter, in April 2017, John, as newly elected president, and Shawn, as newly elected treasurer and secretary, passed a resolution selling a total of 200 treasury shares to Shawn and John Michael. Ms. Languirand averred Defendants failed to offer those treasury shares to her or the other shareholders in violation of law - namely their preemptive rights under La. R.S. 12:1-630.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Languirand contended Defendants' acts of electing directors and officers and selling treasury shares constituted ultra vires acts. She asserted that Defendants, as officers and/or shareholders of the corporation, breached their fiduciary duties to the corporation and its shareholders. Accordingly, she sought to have the January 2017 election of directors and officers and the April 2017 sale of treasury shares declared null and void.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants responded to the petition by filing four exceptions: no right of action, no cause of action, improper joinder of parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and prematurity. They first argued that Ms. Languirand had no right of action to bring an individual claim on behalf of the corporation for breach of fiduciary duties because she did not allege any individual damage as a result of the alleged actions of Defendants. As such, they maintained that any action belongs to the corporation and must be brought as a derivative proceeding. Second, Defendants asserted that the petition failed to state a cause of action because it failed to comply with the requirements for a derivative action set forth in La. R.S. 12:1-742.1. Third, Defendants asserted the petition improperly joined the corporation as a plaintiff because the corporation must be named as a defendant in any derivative proceeding. Finally, Defendants argued the petition was premature because it failed to comply with the statutory requirements that a written demand must be made upon the corporation to take suitable action and that 90 days must pass from the date of demand prior to the commencement of a derivative proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A hearing on the exceptions was held on March 14, 2018. During the hearing, no evidence was presented but rather the entire hearing consisted only of the argument of counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court sustained all four exceptions. A written judgment to that effect was signed on March 22, 2018, and the trial court issued reasons for judgment on April 17, 2018, at the request of Ms. Languirand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its reasons for judgment, the trial court concluded that Ms. Languirand's lawsuit was for a breach of fiduciary duty that resulted in deflation of the value of corporate shares. The trial court reasoned that a shareholder does not have a right to personally sue for a breach of fiduciary duty that does not result in a direct loss to the shareholder. Citing\n   <em>\n    Lawly Brooke Burns Trust v. RKR, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 96-1231 (La. App. 1 Cir. 3/27/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/1349/\">\n    691 So.2d 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the court explained that the decline in the value of stock, which is suffered by all shareholders, has been determined to be an indirect loss from which no individual\n   direct action is permitted. Thus, the trial court concluded that Ms. Languirand may only sue to recover said loss through a derivative suit. Based on this conclusion, the trial court further granted the exception of no cause of action and prematurity, finding Ms. Languirand had not complied with the statutory requirements to sustain a derivative action. Additionally, the trial court granted the exception of improper joinder of parties on the basis that the corporation must be a defendant in any derivative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    ISSUE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In her appeal, Ms. Languirand argues that the trial court erred in finding that she had no right of action to file an individual direct action suit against the corporation's directors and other shareholders to enforce her preemptive rights and to void the sale of shares that were made in violation of her preemptive rights. She contends the trial court erred in concluding that her claims must be brought by a derivative action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An action can only be brought by a person having a real and actual interest in which she asserts. La. C.C.P. art. 681. The exception of no right of action tests whether the plaintiff has a real and actual interest in the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.C.P. art. 927(A)(6). The purpose of an exception of no right of action is to determine whether the plaintiff belongs to the class of persons to whom the law grants a cause of action asserted in the petition.\n   <em>\n    Badeaux v. Southwest Computer Bureau, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 05-612 (La. 3/17/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8429226\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/929/1211/#p1217\">\n    929 So.2d 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The exception of no right of action assumes that the petition states a valid cause of action for some person and questions whether the plaintiff in the particular case is a member of the class that has a legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    Howard v. Administrators of the Tulane Educ. Fund\n   </em>\n   , 07-2224 (La. 7/1/08),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8179947\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/986/47/#p60\">\n    986 So.2d 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The party raising a peremptory exception bears the burden of proof. On the trial of a peremptory exception of no right of action, evidence is admissible to support or controvert the objection pleaded when the grounds do not appear from the petition. La. C.C.P. art. 931. In this case, neither party presented any evidence at the hearing on the exception; thus, this Court must decide, based on the allegations alone, whether Ms. Languirand belongs to the class of persons to whom the law grants the cause of action asserted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The determination of whether a plaintiff has a legal right to bring an action raises a question of law, which requires a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\"\n   <em>\n    Rebel Distributors Corp., Inc. v.

Rather, a shareholder may only sue to recover losses to a corporation resulting from mismanagement and/or a breach of a fiduciary duty secondarily through a shareholder's derivative suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Eckert v.

However, if the breach of fiduciary duty causes a direct loss to the shareholder, with no loss to the corporation, the shareholder may have the right to pursue an individual claim in a direct action to recover his loss.\n   <em>\n    Palowsky v. Premier Bancorp, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7488102\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/597/543/#p545\">\n    597 So.2d 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545 (La. App. 2d Cir. 1992). Where the alleged loss to the individual shareholder is the same loss that would be suffered by all other shareholders (such as a decline in the value of stock), the loss is considered to be indirect and the individual shareholder does not have the right to sue individually.\n   <em>\n    Lawly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11924234\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/691/1349/\">\n    691 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1353 ;\n   <em>\n    Palowsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A review of the jurisprudence shows that distinguishing between derivative and direct claims can be difficult.

The court determined that the alleged acts of mismanagement or fraud belonged to the corporation and not to the individual shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, in\n   <em>\n    Landry v.

The officers and directors argued that the plaintiffs' allegations were simply related to the diminution in value of their stock due to imprudent loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court concluded that the damage was done to the corporation and only indirectly to the shareholders; thus, it should have been brought as a derivative suit. This Court explained that the mismanagement did not personally or directly affect the plaintiffs - those shareholders who purchased their stock in 1974 - but rather all shareholders, except those who purchased in 1976, who experienced a drop in value of their holdings. This Court specifically noted that the plaintiffs were not singled out for unfair treatment in stock transfers or redemptions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1377.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Eckert v.

The minority shareholder filed an individual action against the majority shareholder for mismanagement of the corporate assets, alleging that he had diverted fees collected for the corporation to other personal and third party accounts and, thus, had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation through self-dealings. The minority shareholder further alleged he suffered direct loss as a result of the defendant's mismanagement and self-dealings. This Court concluded that the plaintiff had no individual claim for mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty based on the alleged acts, but rather the proper procedure was a derivative action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 640-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Conversely, the following actions have been classified by Louisiana courts as direct. In\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. H.J. Wilson Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9547966\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/430/1227/\">\n    430 So.2d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.

Thus, the shareholder had a right of action to sue individually for the recovery of his shares or their value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Also, in\n   <em>\n    Succession of Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7627191\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/463/723/\">\n    463 So.2d 723\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. App. 4th Cir. 1985), the shareholder's suit was found to be direct where he sued the succession of a corporate president, alleging fraud and misrepresentation in connection with a stock redemption agreement. And, in\n   <em>\n    Noe v. Roussel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9669276\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/310/806/\">\n    310 So.2d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1975), the Louisiana Supreme Court recognized the right of a shareholder to sue individually for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the liquidation of the corporation - namely an action to rescind a sale of immovable property by an officer and director of the corporation who was the sole liquidator. The shareholder alleged that his stock was fraudulently manipulated by the officer/director and that he was deprived of his rightful share of the corporation's liquidated assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the present case, Ms. Languirand argues that she has an individual direct action to enforce her preemptive rights because such rights are personal and do not belong to the corporation. She maintains that she is not alleging injury or loss to the corporation but rather individual harm - namely, the dilution of her ownership interest and voting rights in the corporation because of the improper sale of additional shares in violation of her preemptive rights. As such, she claims an action to enforce a shareholder's preemptive rights is personal and direct - not derivative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A preemptive right is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, as \"[t]he privilege of a stockholder to maintain a proportionate share of ownership by purchasing a proportionate share of any new stock issue.\" Under La. R.S. 12:1-630(A), the shareholders of a corporation do not have a preemptive right except as provided by the articles of incorporation. However, if the corporation was incorporated prior to January 1, 1969, the articles of incorporation are deemed to contain a provision electing to have preemptive rights unless the articles of incorporation contain a specific provision to the contrary. The violation of a shareholder's preemptive right - when shares are issued to persons other than the existing shareholders in proportion to their present percentage ownership - results in the dilution of that shareholder's voting power and ownership interest in the corporation. Glenn G. Morris &amp; Wendell H. Holmes, Business Organizations, \u00a7 28.03, at 672, in 8 Louisiana Civil Law Treatise (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We are unaware of any Louisiana case addressing the classification of the enforcement of a shareholder's preemptive rights as direct or derivative. Thus, we turn to jurisprudence in other jurisdictions, which overwhelmingly finds such actions to be direct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In discussing the enforcement of shareholders' preemptive rights, the court in\n   <em>\n    Saigh v. Busch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10138061\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/403/559/#p565\">\n    403 S.W.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565 (Mo. 1996), noted the prevailing rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Where the pre-emptive [sic] rights of shareholders have been violated, the wrong is to the shareholders and not to the corporation. Accordingly, an action brought for the violation of such right must be in the right of the shareholder and may not be maintained on behalf of the corporation. Moreover, if the shareholders who have been deprived of their rights do not complain, it does not lie within the power of the corporation to rescind the sale of shares sold in violation of pre-emptive [sic] rights, especially where the sale has been for value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Citing numerous cases from various jurisdictions, the court held that the plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   claim to preemptive rights is a direct action and not a derivative action. It further noted that while a shareholder has a direct action against the corporation to recover the value of his preemptive right, if such a remedy at law would be inadequate to protect the shareholder's interest in the corporation, the shareholder may have equitable relief to protect those interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10138061\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/403/559/#p565\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Barsan v.

And, in explaining the right of a shareholder \"to enjoin or cancel the issuance of shares in violation of his preemptive rights or to recover damages therefore\" as a direct and personal action of the shareholder, the court in\n   <em>\n    Wolf v.

Therefore, we find the trial court properly sustained Defendants' exception of no right of action for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   However, we find Ms. Languirand has a right of action to personally and directly enforce her preemptive rights. Such a claim does not belong to the corporation and cannot be asserted through a derivative suit on behalf of the corporation. Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in sustaining Defendants' exception of no right of action as to Ms. Languirand's claim for the violation of her preemptive rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants argue that Ms. Languirand has not asserted a cause of action for the violation of her preemptive rights because she does not seek to enforce those rights - specifically, she has not made a request to purchase her proportionate share but rather has only alleged that the sale of the treasury shares caused a decline in stock value, which Defendants again contend can only be asserted through a derivative suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Contrary to Defendants' claim, the petition does not allege that the sale of treasury shares caused a decline in stock\n   value. Rather, the petition states that the treasury shares were not offered to Ms. Languirand or any other shareholder in violation of law, or their preemptive rights. As noted above, the violation of preemptive rights results in the dilution of that shareholder's voting power and ownership interest in the corporation and a direct action by the shareholder against the offending officers and/or directors exists for the resulting damage. To the extent Ms. Languirand failed to allege a direct loss as a result of the alleged violation of her preemptive rights, she fails to state a cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A petition should not be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of any claim that would entitle him relief.\n   <em>\n    Kelley v.

However, to the extent the trial court's judgment sustains a no right of action relating to Ms. Languirand's claim for the violation of her preemptive rights, that portion of the judgment is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Additionally, we affirm that portion of the trial court's judgment sustaining Defendants' exceptions of no cause of action and prematurity as it relates to Ms. Languirand's claim for breach of fiduciary duty regarding the election of directors and officers. However, insofar as the trial court's judgment sustaining the exception of prematurity relates to Ms. Languirand's direct action claim for violation of her preemptive rights, that portion is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We further affirm the trial court's judgment sustaining the exception of no cause of action as it relates to Ms. Languirand's claim for violation of her preemptive rights. However, we reverse that portion of the judgment dismissing the claim and amend the judgment to allow Ms. Languirand 30 days from the date of this opinion to amend her petition to state a cause of action, e.g. to allege a direct loss, for violation of her preemptive rights as discussed above, if she can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   And, we affirm the trial court's judgment sustaining the exception of improper joinder of parties. As discussed above, the corporation must be a named defendant in a derivative suit and the right to enforce a preemptive right does not belong to the corporation - thus, the corporation cannot be a plaintiff in either of Ms. Languirand's claims.

In a derivative action, the individual shareholder must bring suit on behalf of the corporation to enforce the corporation's rights against the individual defendants.
