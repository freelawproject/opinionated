First, this court has never squarely addressed the standard by which a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on counsel's failure to assert a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge during jury selection would be evaluated, or whether such a claim is even cognizable on state collateral review. Second, this court has yet to articulate a standard to determine whether the state's ability to respond to an application for post-conviction relief has been materially prejudiced by events not under the control of the State which have transpired since the date of the original conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.C.Cr.P. art. 930.8(B). Both of these issues are presented here, and I believe that in the interest of economy this court should address them before allowing post-conviction proceedings to continue.\n  </author>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
