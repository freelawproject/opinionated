Michele Ann Latham and Roger Dale Latham divorced on February 5, 2016. On March 24, 2017, Michele filed a petition for contempt against Roger, claiming that he had failed to comply with the divorce judgment. After a hearing, Chancellor John S. Grant III found Roger in constructive criminal contempt for failing to comply with several terms of the divorce judgment. Roger appeals, arguing that the chancellor erred because he did not recuse himself before finding Roger in constructive criminal contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62. Because Roger raises the argument for the first time on appeal, it has been waived. Accordingly, the Court affirms the chancellor's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. On February 5, 2016, the chancellor granted Roger and Michele a divorce based on irreconcilable differences. On March 24, 2017, Michele filed a petition for\n   contempt\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Roger, asserting that he had failed to comply with several obligations of the marital dissolution agreement, which had been incorporated in the final divorce judgment. Michele requested that the chancellor find Roger in civil and criminal contempt. Roger was served with a Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 81 summons, and a hearing was set for June 12, 2017, on the petition for contempt. Roger did not file response to the petition for contempt; rather, he filed a motion for a continuance because he had a cruise vacation scheduled. The chancellor denied the motion for a continuance. Roger did not appear for the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. At the hearing, Michele called three witnesses to testify in support of her petition for contempt. Michele also testified. Michele requested that the chancellor incarcerate Roger for his violations of the divorce judgment. Roger's attorney called one witness in his defense. After both parties rested, the chancellor found Roger in civil contempt and criminal contempt because he had failed to comply with certain obligations of the marital dissolution agreement. On June 14, 2018, the chancellor entered a judgment of contempt and ordered Roger to comply with certain terms of the marital dissolution agreement. The chancellor also ordered Roger incarcerated for seventy-two hours, regardless of whether he complied with the obligations set out in the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Roger appeals, but does not challenge the chancellor's finding of civil contempt. Furthermore, Roger does not dispute that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of constructive criminal contempt; rather, Roger raises the following sole argument on appeal: \"The Chancellor erred when he did not recuse himself before finding that Roger was in constructive, criminal contempt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66. Roger appeals solely from the chancellor's finding of criminal contempt. Typically, the Court reviews criminal contempt matters\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   and determines from the record whether the alleged contemnor is guilty of contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Dennis v.

However, as previously noted, Roger does not challenge the contempt finding; rather, Roger raises the sole issue of whether the Chancellor erred by not recusing before finding Roger in constructive criminal contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67. \"The decision to recuse or not to recuse is one left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, so long as he applies the correct legal standards and is consistent in the application.\"\n   <em>\n    Tubwell v.

The dissent suggests that Roger had no notice that he may be subject to the chancellor's finding of constructive criminal contempt. Notwithstanding the record support that Roger did have notice, we find noteworthy that Roger did not argue lack of notice at the contempt hearing, nor did Roger file a motion to set aside the finding of criminal contempt based on any new revelation that he had been subjected to criminal contempt by surprise. Furthermore, on appeal, Roger does not argue that he lacked notice that he might be found in constructive criminal contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614. \"One of the most fundamental and long established rules of law in Mississippi is that the Mississippi Supreme Court will not review matters on appeal that were not raised at the trial court level.\"\n   <em>\n    Miss.

The position advocated by the dissent suffers the same deficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617. The reason why Roger has not raised lack of notice at any level is apparent from the record. Put simply, the record refutes the dissent's suggestion that Roger was not aware of the constructive criminal contempt charges pending against him. Michele's petition for contempt stated that the chancellor had previously entered an order on January 20, 2017, requiring compliance with the divorce judgment and warning that \"failure to strictly comply with the terms of th[e] [o]rder shall be enforceable by the contempt powers of this [chancery c]ourt.\" \"[T]he ability to punish for criminal contempt is derived from the inherent powers of the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Purvis v.

Michele's petition also included a request that \"Roger suffer such\n   <em>\n    punishment\n   </em>\n   as th[e] [chancellor] deems reasonable and proper under the circumstances.\" (Emphasis added.) The dissent excludes Michele's specific request in its recitation of the petition's requests for relief. \"Criminal contempt penalties ... are designed to punish the defendant for disobedience of a court order; punishment is for past offenses and does not terminate upon compliance with court order.\"\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11437484\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/824/604/#p608\">\n    824 So.2d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 10).

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Moulds\n   </em>\n   , in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , Michele testified at the contempt hearing and specifically requested that the chancellor order that Roger be jailed as a consequence of his contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619. Undoubtedly, Roger had notice that he had violated a term of the divorce judgment, which could only have been remedied by the chancellor's imposing a sanction of punishment so as to constitute constructive criminal contempt. For example, Michele's petition for contempt alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Roger was in contempt of the divorce judgment by staying overnight with a member of the opposite sex not related by blood or marriage to him in the presence of their minor children. After hearing the evidence, the chancellor found Roger guilty of the alleged conduct. Obviously, Roger could not have purged himself of the impermissible overnight stays, which the chancellor found had already occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620. Roger's assignment of error is limited to whether our caselaw mandates that judges recuse\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in every case involving constructive criminal contempt. For the foregoing reasons, the assignment of error has been waived. Had Roger properly preserved the issue, Justice Maxwell's well reasoned specially concurring opinion explains why\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   recusal is not mandatory in all constructive criminal contempt cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Michele's Request for Attorneys' Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621. The chancellor ordered Roger to pay $2,500 in attorneys' fees as part of the contempt judgment. Buried at the conclusion of Michele's brief is a one sentence request that the Court award her one-half of the attorneys' fees that had been awarded by the chancellor.

While the Court has declared that the better practice would be for a party seeking attorneys' fees on appeal to file a motion in the Court, we now clarify that Rule 27(a) of the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure requires it. Here, Michele\n   did not file a motion requesting attorneys' fees on appeal; rather she buried a one sentence request in her brief. Such requests do not comport with the Mississippi Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 27(a) provides, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (a) Content of Motions; Response. Unless another form is elsewhere prescribed by these rules, an application for an order or other relief\n   <em>\n    shall be made\n   </em>\n   by filing a motion for such order or relief with proof of service on all other parties. The motion shall contain or be accompanied by any matter required by a specific provision of these rules governing such a motion, shall state with particularity the grounds on which it is based, and shall set forth the order or relief sought.

Because Michele failed to make a viable request for relief under Rule 27, we decline to consider her request. While the Court has suggested that the better practice for a party seeking attorneys' fees on appeal is to file a motion pursuant to Rule 27(a), we hold that, henceforth, such requests must comply with Rule 27(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b625.

I agree with the majority that, by not requesting that the chancellor recuse, Roger has waived this issue on appeal. But given Roger's argument, I find it would be helpful to Roger-as well as the bench and bar-to explain why, in this particular constructive-criminal-contempt case, Roger had to request the chancellor recuse to preserve this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628. Part of Roger's argument is that recusal could not be waived. He suggests it was the chancellor's duty to recuse\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   given the nature of the contempt. As Roger sees it, our caselaw mandates judges recuse in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case involving constructive criminal contempt. Roger's view hinges on his reading of two cases-\n   <em>\n    Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. McGill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046627\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/890/859/#p868\">\n    890 So.2d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 868 (Miss. 2004), and\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442723\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/878/#p888\">\n    926 So.2d 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (Miss. 2006). He argues that, when read together, the cases \"extend\" the requirement to recuse\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in any case involving constructive criminal contempt. But a closer look shows that neither case alters this Court's well-established standard for when a judge must recuse in a constructive-criminal-contempt case. Instead, both cases maintain that \"[i]t is necessary for that individual to be tried by another judge in cases of constructive contempt\n   <em>\n    where the trial judge has substantial personal involvement in the prosecution\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8442723\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/926/878/#p888\">\n    926 So.2d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Williamson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365333\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/838/226/#p238\">\n    838 So.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (Miss. 2002) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper Tire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046627\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/890/859/#p868\">\n    890 So.2d at 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b629.

Nor does the record support such a finding. So the chancellor was not required to recuse\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . As the majority explains, recusal was discretionary.

The waiver rule does not and cannot apply when the defendant is without notice that he or she is at risk of being held in constructive criminal contempt, and no decision of this Court holds otherwise.

The majority relies on two decisions of this Court that are plainly distinguishable. The majority first cites this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Tubwell v. Grant\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that Tubwell's failure to object to the judge's ruling on his case resulted in his waiving his recusal objection.\n   <em>\n    Tubwell v.

However,\n   <em>\n    Tubwell\n   </em>\n   has nothing to do with a judge's exercise of his contempt powers without notice. The trial court dismissed the prisoner's complaint as frivolous and noted that the prisoner already had been barred by the United States District Courts from filing any additional petitions in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11530026\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/760/687/#p689\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Tubwell asserted that the trial judge should have recused himself from deciding the issue on the merits. This Court held that because Tubwell had failed to object contemporaneously or to file a motion for the trial court to recuse, Tubwell had waived such an objection.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11530026\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/760/687/#p689\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11530026\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/760/687/#p689\">\n    at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, at no time was constructive criminal contempt an issue, nor was Tubwell found in contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b634.

They were divorced in February of 2016, and they had a sizeable estate, but you see over here all people are the same.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court: It's very clear to this Court\n   <em>\n    that Mr. Latham has demonstrated a cavalier attitude towards the judgments of this Court, and therefore, to the Court itself.\n   </em>\n   It is without a doubt disconcerting to this Court\n   <em>\n    when someone just obviously and for no good reason disobeys the judgment of this Court which has the force of law.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b639. Upon being asked for clarification by defense counsel, the Chancellor clarified his reasoning for finding Roger in criminal contempt, as opposed to a lesser sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [Defense]: If I may ask a question, Your Honor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [Defense]: What I think I'm hearing you say is 72 hours in jail regardless? No matter what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court: Regardless. No - no get out of jail free card. He goes immediately to the Rankin County jail for 72 hours.\n   <em>\n    And if he comes back here having violated this Court's judgment again, I'm not going to be so lenient with him. He's going to spend ten days in full and he's probably going to get a good bit more.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [Defense]: Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court: I'm tired of this. There's no need in it. It has been ridiculous having to address all these issues\n   <em>\n    which were so plainly stated in the prior judgments of this Court.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b640. In matters of constructive criminal contempt, a trial judge's recusal is mandatory. As this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Corr\n   </em>\n   , \"[w]e conclude that the contempt proceedings were for constructive [ ] criminal contempt, and, therefore, the chancellor was required to recuse himself from the contempt proceedings and issue Rule 81 process giving [the accused] notice of the criminal\n   charges against them.\"\n   <em>\n    Corr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7025930\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/1211/#p1213\">\n    97 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1216 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re McDonald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7032925\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/98/1040/#p1044\">\n    98 So.3d at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he chancellor was required to recuse himself and to issue [ Rule 81 ] summonses to the [d]efendants giving them notice of the criminal contempt charges against them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b641. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   KING, J., JOINS THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In the federal system, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals also has held that, \"[f]or notice of criminal contempt to be valid, it should indicate the criminal nature of the proceeding.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Rumaker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1217969\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/646/870/#p873\">\n     646 F.2d 870\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 873 (5th Cir. 1980).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
