The plaintiff, Raul-Alejandro Ramos, a former tenant of the defendants, Andrew Le and La Rouge Properties, alleges that the defendants unlawfully\n   entered the premises he was leasing and removed his property without his consent. From the trial court's judgment granting the defendants' exception of prescription, Mr. Ramos appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With one exception (discussed elsewhere in this opinion), the essential facts are not disputed. In 2013, Mr. Ramos leased commercial premises from the defendants to operate a restaurant. During his tenancy, Mr. Ramos undertook construction of the premises. Because of the construction, Mr. Ramos moved various items to the rear of the premises. At some point, Mr. Le advised Mr. Ramos that he could not store items in the rear of the premises; Mr. Ramos, however, continued to store items there. Consequently, on three occasions between 2013 and 2015, Mr. Le or his agent entered the leased premises and removed items that were being stored in the rear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 25, 2017, Mr. Ramos, acting\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed this suit asserting those claims. The defendants filed exceptions of non-conformity, vagueness, and ambiguity arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Mr. Ramos had failed to allege the dates on which the acts forming the basis of his claims occurred. The trial court granted the exceptions and ordered Mr. Ramos to amend his petition to set forth such dates with specificity. Pursuant to the trial court's order, Mr. Ramos filed an amending petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants filed an exception of prescription, arguing that, on the face of the petition, Mr. Ramos' claims were prescribed. Mr. Ramos filed an opposition to the exception, arguing that, because the defendants had acted under \"color of landlord authority,\" he had been unaware of his legal rights and, thus, prescription was interrupted. At the hearing on the exception, the parties stipulated that Mr. Ramos' colloquy with the trial court would be received as testimony. Mr. Ramos also offered as an exhibit a demand letter he sent to the defendants on September 30, 2016. Following the hearing, the trial court sustained the exception of prescription and dismissed all of Mr. Ramos' claims against the defendants. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A party asserting that a claim is prescribed must do so through the filing of a peremptory exception of prescription.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ames v.

Although Mr. Ramos assigns numerous errors, this appeal presents essentially two issues for our review: (1) whether the trial court erred in determining that Mr. Ramos' claims are prescribed on the face of the petition; and (2) if so, whether the trial court committed manifest error in determining that prescription was not interrupted. We address each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Prescription\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In determining whether an exception of prescription has merit, the nature of the cause of action must first be identified.\n   <em>\n    Albe v.

C.C. art. 3492\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In his original petition, Mr. Ramos alleged that the defendants entered the leased premises and removed his property on three separate occasions; he failed, however, to allege the dates of those incidents. In his amended petition, Mr. Ramos alleged that the first incident occurred \"in 2013 between July and October\"; despite the trial court's order, however, he failed to allege on what dates the two subsequent incidents occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nonetheless, at the hearing on the exception, Mr. Ramos testified that he learned of the three incidents between 2013 and 2015. Thus, even assuming that Mr. Ramos could have amended his petition to conform to his testimony, all of Mr. Ramos' claims prescribed, at the latest, in 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Mr. Ramos did not commence this suit until 2017, the trial court correctly determined that Mr. Ramos claims were prescribed on the face of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Contra Non Valentem\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court's determination that Mr. Ramos' claims were prescribed on the face of the petition shifted the burden to Mr. Ramos to demonstrate that his claims had not prescribed. Mr. Ramos' contends, as he did in the trial court, that his claims have not prescribed under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The doctrine of\n   <em>\n    contra non valentem\n   </em>\n   is a jurisprudentially-created, \"limited exception [to prescription] where in fact and for good cause a plaintiff is unable to exercise his cause of action when it accrues.\"\n   <em>\n    Corsey v.

Mr. Ramos further contends that it was not until September 2016, while researching his legal remedies in an unrelated eviction action brought against him by the defendants, that he learned he might have claims against the defendants in connection with the removal of his property.

Nonetheless, Mr. Ramos contends that Mr. Le's statement constitutes fraud because it was legally incorrect.
