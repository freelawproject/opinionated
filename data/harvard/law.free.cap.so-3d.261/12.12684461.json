He qualified for that position on January 3, 2018, and he was sworn in on July 2, 2018. A registered voter, Ron Roberts, filed a complaint on August 8, 2018, with the District Attorney, Mr. LeStage, indicating that Michael Dwayne Harris did not reside in the city of DeRidder prior to qualifying for councilman at large and does not currently reside in the city of DeRidder, in violation of the city's charter, Section 2-04(1) and 2-04(2). Mr. Roberts further alleged that he thought Mr. Harris filed a false public record in filing to run for office; and Mr. Roberts asked the District Attorney to investigate and prosecute the matter. Mr. LeStage investigated and filed suit in the district court for a judgment declaring Mr. Harris's seat vacant pursuant to La.R.S. 18:671 -675.\n   <footnotemark>\n    i\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of the parties, the complainant, the trial court, and this court of\n   appeal complied with the procedural rules in those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The relevant portions of The City of DeRidder Charter, specifically referred to by the complainant, Ron Roberts, state as follows (emphasis added):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Sec. 2-04. Qualifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The council members shall have the following qualifications:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) A council member\n   <em>\n    elected\n   </em>\n   at large\n   <em>\n    shall have been legally domiciled and shall have actually resided for at least one (1) year immediately preceding the time established by law for qualifying for office\n   </em>\n   in an area which, at the time of qualification, is within the city. A council member elected from a district shall have been legally domiciled and shall have actually resided for at least six (6) consecutive months immediately preceding the time established by law for qualifying for office in an area which, at the time of qualification, is within the district from which elected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) A council member\n   <em>\n    shall continue to be legally domiciled and to actually reside within the city\n   </em>\n   and, if elected from a district, shall continue to be legally domiciled and to actually reside within the district from which elected, during the term of office. Should the legal domicile and/or actual residence of a council member change from the city or, where applicable, from the district from which elected, the office shall automatically become vacant, which vacancy shall be filled as set out hereinafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Council members ceasing to possess these qualifications or being convicted of a felony shall be disqualified creating a vacancy on the council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After an investigation, the DA issued an opinion stating that the public records indicated that Mr. Harris was not eligible to hold public office based upon Section 2-04(1) and 2-04(2) of the city's charter. However, believing that Section 2-04(1) addressed a person's qualifications for candidacy preceding the election, and no timely objection to candidacy had been filed within seven days of the qualifying period, pursuant to La.R.S. 18:1405, the DA focused on the alleged violation under Section 2-04(2). That section requires that the\n   <em>\n    elected\n   </em>\n   official \"shall continue to be legally domiciled and to actually reside within the district from which elected.\" In spite of the DA's efforts to limit his discussion, he had gathered documentation going back eleven to twelve years before the 2018 election, as well as post-election information, and he presented twenty-five exhibits to the trial court in support of his position that Mr. Harris did not meet the domicile and residency requirements of councilman-at-large in the city of DeRidder. In his opinion, under the heading of \"DOMICILE\" the DA stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Harris appeared to have been domiciled at 806 Lake Court Drive, DeRidder, Louisiana, from at least 2007 until July of 2015. The public record indicates that Mr. Harris built and moved into a home at 386 Harmony Trail, DeRidder, Louisiana, in 2015. The Harmony Trail address is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   within the city limits of DeRidder. He signed a homestead exemption Application and filed the same on July 9, 2015, regarding that Harmony Trial property. On January 18, 2017, Mr. Harris filed an application to change his homestead exemption from the Harmony Trial address back to the 806 Lake Court address (which was less than one year as required by the City Charter of DeRidder to be eligible for a council member position). As stated in La.C.C. Art. 44, a person changes his domicile when he moves his residence to another location with the intent to make that location his habitual residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Neighbors of Mr. Harris have been interviewed regarding Mr. Harris and his family and their use of the property at 386 Harmony Trial. Every neighbor interviewed stated that Michael Harris and his family use the property as their family home and habitual residence. Even though the Homestead Exemption Application was filed to indicate a change of habitual residence [to 806 Lake Court Drive] in January of 2017, neighbors insist that there has been no such change.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The DA's opinion went on to state under the heading of \"RESIDENCY\" the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The City Charter of the City of DeRidder requires that a council member at large has a continuing obligation to \"actually reside\" within the city limits of DeRidder. Several Louisiana cases have discussed the legal implications of \"actually\" or \"actual\" as it describes residency or domicile. These courts point out\n   that \"actually\" is used to require a higher standard of residence - or a more regular presence - to limit political office to citizens who actually live in the district that they represent. The courts point out that the apparent intent of legislation requiring \"actually\", in terms of residence or domicile, was to eliminate a system under which candidates would establish a \"political domicile\" from which to seek office even though they choose to live and maintain their families in another area and were not truly representative of the district in which they sought election.\n   <em>\n    Davis v. English\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7438602\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/660/576/\">\n    660 So.2d 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [,] 579 [ (1995) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   It appears to be true that Michael Harris and his family did move from Lake Court Drive within the city limits of DeRidder to Harmony Trial, which is outside the city limits of DeRidder, and properly filed for Homestead Exemption at Harmony Trail. Lake Court became a property for Mr. Harris' relative(s). According to Mr. Harris, his daughter and son-in-law currently reside in the house. Mr. Harris further stayed at the house overnight from time to time as his parents are elderly and live nearby. My investigation reveals that Mr. Harris resides primarily (and almost solely) at Harmony Trial, and has done so since 2015. Although the Homestead Application was changed to Lake Court, Mr. Harris' residence and domicile on Harmony Trial never changed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In conclusion, the published opinion of the DA stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   My investigation reveals that Michael D. Harris obviously has a strong desire to represent the citizens of DeRidder. Further, Mr. Harris has a great many connections and ties to the City of DeRidder, including, but not limited to his property at 806 Lake Court. Unfortunately, the property at Lake Court does not appear to legally qualify as Mr. Harris' domicile nor does it appear to qualify as Mr. Harris' actual residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The City Charter of the City of DeRidder clearly establishes a continuing obligation on a council member at-large to maintain his domicile in, and actually reside in, the City of DeRidder. Although Mr. Harris has expressed, and no doubt has, a real desire to serve the citizens of DeRidder, he does not meet, and has not met the continuing dual obligations to be domiciled and actually reside within the city. Therefore, it is my opinion, that Michael D. Harris is not qualified to hold the office of DeRidder City Council Member At-Large. It is my duty, in accordance with La.R.S. 18:674, to file suit in the 36\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court within ten (10) days of this report to declare Mr. Harris' office \"vacant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The suit was timely filed, and a hearing timely held on October 8, 2018. At the hearing, the DA entered twenty-five documents supporting the complainant's letter, and the DA's opinion and petition. These included city maps, photographs, tax assessments, and utility records from both residences; homeowners insurance policies, renters insurance, returned mail certifications, mortgage documents, homestead exemption applications, driver's licenses and voter registration records of both Mr. and Mrs. Harris; and the school records and medical emergency designations of the minor child. At the hearing, the trial court heard testimony from six neighbors of the Harmony Trail property and three neighbors of the Lake Court property, as well as the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Harris. The court also received and reviewed the stipulated testimony of the Harris's eleven-year-old son, stating that he lived with his parents at Harmony Trail; they cooked, ate their meals,\n   and slept at Harmony Trail; his parents took him to school from Harmony Trail; his possessions and pet dog were at Harmony Trail; and he had his own room at Harmony Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Following the hearing, the trial court timely issued a judgment and reasons for judgment declaring that Mr. Harris's seat on the City Council of DeRidder was vacant pursuant to the city's charter and La.R.S. 18:671 -675. Mr. Harris timely filed a motion for appeal, citing La.R.S. 18:674. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court's factual findings regarding domicile are subject to a manifest error standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Herpin v.

Mr. Harris contends that it was error for the trial court to consider any residency events that occurred before he was sworn into office on July 2, 2018. We disagree. Both sections of the city's charter address an \"elected\" official's dual requirements of being domiciled\n   <em>\n    and actually residing\n   </em>\n   in the city of DeRidder. Section 2-04(1) (emphasis added) reaches back to a year before the qualifying papers were filed, stating that the \"council member\n   <em>\n    elected\n   </em>\n   at large[,]\" not the candidate, \"\n   <em>\n    shall have been legally domiciled and shall have actually resided for at least one (1) year\n   </em>\n   immediately preceding the time ... for qualifying for office in an area which, at the time of qualification, is\n   <em>\n    within the city\n   </em>\n   .\" While the DA's petition addresses Section 2-04(2), the\n   <em>\n    continuing obligation\n   </em>\n   of the council member\n   <em>\n    to be legally domiciled and to actually reside\n   </em>\n   in the city, the pleading has been expanded by the evidence, without objection, to include the violation of Section 2-04(1), as originally alleged by the complainant, Mr. Roberts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Civ.P. art. 1154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The evidence includes all relevant events needed to determine whether Mr. Harris met the legal domicile requirements\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"actually resided\" in the city a year before he filed his qualifying papers, pursuant to city charter Section 2-04(1),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   whether he currently continues to meet the\n   <em>\n    legal domicile\n   </em>\n   requirement\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the requirement to\n   <em>\n    actually reside\n   </em>\n   in the city of DeRidder, pursuant to Section 2-04(2) of the city's charter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Based upon the testimony and evidence presented in the trial court at the hearing on October 8, 2018, the Harrises purchased and moved into the house at 806 Lake Court Drive in DeRidder in 2006. The house is 1900 square feet, has four bedrooms and two baths, and is assessed at $48,000. The Harrises say it is their family home because it is down the street from Mr. Harris's parents. The Harrises built a two-story house outside the city of DeRidder at 386 Harmony Trial and moved into it in 2015. They also moved\n   their homestead exemption to the Harmony Trail home at that time. Mr. Harris testified that it was built to be their family home, and he called it their primary residence. Later he testified that it was built for large gatherings. The Harrises live there with their minor son and Mr. Harris's sister, Deborah Thurston. The assessed value of the Harmony Trail house is $169,840.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After the Harrises moved out of the Lake Court property in 2015, they rented it to the Dorsey family and took out rental insurance on the property. The Dorseys had seven young children and did a lot of damage that had to be repaired. The electrical power had been in the Dorsey name for eight months during 2016 and then was turned off for five weeks. It was later restored in the name of the Harris's business, Peace and Faith Accessories. From February to September 2017, the Harrises' daughter-in-law Jamie Gates lived in the house, and the power was in her name. From September to November 1, 2017, the power was off and then restored in the name of Peace and Faith Accessories again. In July 2018, after Mr. Harris was sworn in on July 2, 2018, the Harrises' daughter, her husband, and her child moved into the Lake Court house and currently live there. On August 4, 2018, the rental insurance on the house was renewed for another year. We have reviewed the evidence and find that the trial court accurately described the evidence in its reasons for ruling, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The City of DeRidder records showed water usage at the [Lake Court] house of around 900 gallons from October, 2017 through June, 2018. In some months there was no water usage at all. A city employee testified that it was as if no one was living there at all much of the time. The Harrises explained this by saying that repairs were going on, and that he sometimes showered at his parents' house. In July [2018] the Harrises let their daughter and her husband and child move in the house, and the water usage picked up again, with 3680 gallons used in the month of August. That family still lives in the house, rent free.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   After the instant suit was filed, the District Attorney requested copies of insurance policies on 806 Lake court Drive from Mr. Harris. Mr. Harris provided a renter's policy on the property that had been renewed on August 4, 2018. He also provided a new homeowner's policy, dated October 5, which was after he received the DA's request to produce the policy. When questioned about this, Mr. Harris said that he had forgotten that the policy was a renters when he renewed it, and he should have changed it back to a homeowners at that time. Mr. Harris testified that after his daughter and family had moved in, she gave him $250 as rent. He said he refused to accept it as rent, and spent it on his son instead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Harris said that in January, 2017 he had begun thinking about running for public office, and went to seek the advice of a former mayor of DeRidder, Ray Roberts. He said that Mr. Roberts advised him that he should move the homestead exemption back to 806 Lake Court Drive. The tax assessor's records show that he did so on January 16, 2017. He said that he did it mainly for the purpose of running for office. Then later, upon direct examination by his attorney, he said he also did it because it was his family home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   When initially asked his name and address, Mr. Harris stated that 806 Lake Court Drive is his home address. When first asked about the Harmony Trail house, Mr. Harris described it as his \"other home\", his \"second residence.\" Upon further questioning, Mr.\n   Harris said that he stays on Harmony Trail more than at Lake Court Drive, and that he spends the majority of his nights at Harmony Trail with his family. He testified that he eats most meals at Harmony Trail, that he showers and shaves mostly there, and that he \"primarily resides\" at that address with his family. He also described 386 Harmony Trail as his family home and that he built it as his family home. Then, on direct examination, he said that Lake Court Drive is his home. He lives down the street from his parents, and he checks on them regularly. He said he goes to the Lake Court Drive neighborhood nearly every day. He and his wife walk for exercise most days in the neighborhood, but sometimes in a city park, and he spends 1-2 nights a week in the house there. Mr. Harris said that he has stayed at the Lake Court Drive house consistently, habitually for the last 2 years. He said that he considers his domicile to be 806 Lake Court Drive, but acknowledged that he primarily resides at Harmony Trail. On direct, he concluded that he considers his domicile to be 806 Lake Court Drive, but acknowledged again on cross that he primarily resides at Harmony Trail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Harrises placed a Veterans Administration backed mortgage on the Harmony Trail property on May 31, 2017. When questioned by the DA about a provision in the mortgage that requires [him] and Mrs. Harris to remain at [386] as his principal residence, he said that he had complied with that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Harris said that he keeps clothing and toiletries at Lake Court Drive, and that his wife sometimes stays there as well, as does his son. Living in the house full time now are his daughter, son-in-law and their child. When Mr. and Mrs. Harris spend the night, they stay in a spare bedroom. The daughter and her husband occupy the master bedroom. The daughter, Rickita Weeks, testified that her father sleeps there 1-2 times a week, but he is at the house nearly every day. Her 11 year[-old] brother comes mostly on weekends, and her mother spends the night about once a week to help her with Ms. Weeks's daughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   When called on cross examination by the District Attorney, Mr. Harris'[s] wife, Elizabeth, testified that the family lives at both addresses and that the family has possessions at both houses, although most are at Harmony Trail. She said that the majority of her, her husband's and son's nights are spent at Harmony [Trail], and that the family spends the majority of its time there. She also acknowledged that they eat and cook most of their meals at Harmony Trail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Mrs. Harris was later called on direct examination by her husband's attorney. She told him that they built the Harmony Trail house because they needed a \"safe haven\", but that the Lake Court Drive house would never be sold because it is their family home. She described she and her husband as being very active in the Twin Lakes community, where Lake Court Drive is located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   She also said that she stays at Lake Court Drive 1-2 nights a week, sometimes just to watch her favorite television show that she can't get at Harmony Trail because they don't have cable there. Her driver's license has the Lake Court address, and has never had the Harmony Trail one. She has always been registered to vote with the Lake Court Drive address, as has her husband.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   A written stipulation was entered to the testimony of the Harris'[s] 11 year old son, subpoenaed as a witness by the\n   District Attorney. His stipulated testimony was that he lives primarily and habitually at 386 Harmony Trail with his parents, and that he considers it his home. He primarily eats his meals and spends his nights there, that his parents normally take him to school from there, that he keeps his trophies and awards there, that he has a pet dog that lives there, and that he has his own room with his clothing and possessions at 386 Harmony Trail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A stipulation was also entered to the testimony of Beauregard Parish Chief Civil Deputy Sharon Sammons, to the effect that the sheriff's department sent 2017 property tax notices for the Lake Court Drive property to Mr. and Mrs. Harris at 806 Lake Court Drive, and that they were returned by the post office by notice dated November 18, 2017, stamped \"Return to Sender Vacant Unable to Forward\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The District Attorney offered the testimony of 6 neighbors of the Harrises on Harmony Trail. They all said that they knew the Harrises lived there, with various witnesses saying that they saw the son being taken to school from there, seeing their vehicles parked at the house, and visiting with Mr. Harris outside their homes. One witness said that Mr. Harris welcomed him to the neighborhood. Another said that he saw Mr. Harris in town and they discussed the fact that they were both building houses around the same time, and how nice it would be to live out in the country. The witnesses said that they see Mr. Harris in the Harmony Trail neighborhood several times a week, with one witness saying 3 to 5 times a week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Mr. Harris offered testimony from 3 persons who live on Lake Court Drive, besides his daughter. One witness said that he sees defendant every day, early in the morning and late at night. He said that Mr. Harris is his neighbor, but he didn't know if he stays there, or lays his head there at night or not. Another witness said that he met Mr. Harris when he moved in 12-14 years ago. He said that he doesn't physically know if defendant sleeps in the house but sees him there early in the morning and late at night. He said that 806 Lake Court Drive has been vacant several times over the last couple of years. Another witness who lives on Lake Court Drive says that she sees the defendant 2 to 3 times a month, mostly at his mother's, but sometimes out walking and in the yard. She said that she saw his wife about the same. The witness said that she doesn't know if the defendant lives in the house or whether he sleeps there on a regular basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Numerous documents were introduced into evidence, many for the purpose of showing the addresses listed on them. Of 5 vehicles recently or currently owned by the Harrises, one was registered at Lake Court Drive, and the rest at Harmony Trail. Both Mr. and Mrs. Harris have drivers' license addresses of Lake Court Drive. The school records of Jatari Harris show a mailing and physical address of 386 Harmony Trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   After briefly quoting excerpts from two cases, the court opined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The court carefully observed and listened to the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Harris. It is clear from their testimony that they have an emotional attachment to and affection for the Twin Lakes neighborhood and the house at 806 Lake Court Drive. It was their first home, and his parents live on the street. The court also accepts that Mr. Harris, and to a lesser extent Mrs. Harris, are in the neighborhood regularly. They kept their voting registration and driver's license\n   addresses there, even after moving to Harmony Trail. As to the voter registration, it would certainly have to be kept in the city so that Mr. Harris could be eligible, on the face of the documents, to vote for himself, and hold office.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Beyond that, the court finds their testimony to be inconsistent and contradictory. Mr. Harris said that they built the house on Harmony Trail as their family home, then he later testified that [806] Lake Court Drive was his family home. Mrs. Harris said they built [386] Harmony Trail because they needed a \"safe haven\". Their 11 year old son said he considers Harmony Trail his home. He primarily and habitually lives there, eats his meals and spends the nights there, goes to school from there, keeps his trophies and awards there, keeps his pet dog there, and his own room and with his clothing and possessions there. He did not say that he considers Lake Court Drive to be his home. Mr. Harris said they rented the property to the Dorseys. Mrs. Harris said they did not. Upon further questioning, Mr. Harris said he also moved the homestead exemption back to Lake Court Drive because it was his family home. Yet he originally moved it from that address to save money on taxes. Mr. Harris changed the insurance coverage on Lake Court Drive from renters to homeowners only after the District Attorney filed a request for him to produce the policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Both Mr. and Mrs. Harris acknowledge that while they keep clothing at Lake Court Drive, occasionally bring groceries there, and he occasionally cooks meals there, they spend the majority of their time at 386 Harmony Trail, prepare and eat most of their meals there, shower, shave, bathe and sleep there the majority of the time. They have hosted after church get togethers there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Harris says that he has stayed at 806 Lake Court Drive 1-2 times a week for the last two years. However, the utility usage records, indicate that there were lengthy periods of time when no one could have been staying in the house. If they had done so, it would have been without electricity or water.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   In none of the Harrises' testimony did they say that after moving to Harmony Trail, when they went back to [806] Lake Court Drive it was to live. In almost every instance they gave as examples of staying in the house, it was always for a purpose. For example, he stayed at the house to visit his parents, she went to the house to watch her favorite television program, which was not available at Harmony Trail. Their daughter said that her mother came and stayed the night on occasion to help her with her child. The daughter and her family occupy the house on a daily basis, and she and her husband occupy the master bedroom and bath.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   The court is of the opinion that the family, once moving to Harmony Trail, changed their relationship with the house at 806 Lake Court Drive. It became a place to visit rather than their habitual residence and domicile. They may have continued to be a part of the Twin Lakes community through their visits and walking for exercise, but they were no longer domiciled there.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Mrs. Harris even believed that they had moved their domicile to Harmony Trail. Upon questioning by her attorney, she said[,] \"Because I know we had moved our domicile back to Lake Court Drive and our homestead exemption is Lake Court Drive.\" That means that she believed that they had originally moved their domicile to Harmony Trail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   When Mr. Harris transferred the homestead exemption back to Lake Court Drive based on political advice, their life in relation to the house did not change. They continued spending the same amount of time and doing the same things at Harmony Trail. They did not move any furnishings or possessions from Harmony Trail to Lake Court Drive. They did not increase the time they spent at [806] Lake Court Drive. In fact, if the utility records are any indication, they may have spent less time there for some months. But nothing changed. They evidenced no \"... intention to make a new principal establishment or home.\"\n   <em>\n    Herpin v.

There, Fontenot and Leleux ran for police chief of Ville Platte. They lost to Lartigue. Fontenot and Leleux filed a \"Petition to Contest Election\" on the ninth day after the run-off election asserting that Lartigue resided and continued to reside outside the city limits, not at the address stated on his qualification for candidacy papers. They wanted the court to invalidate the election and direct the clerk of court to remove Lartigue from office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Lartigue filed peremptory exceptions of prescription, peremption, and no cause of action. Tom Schedler, as Secretary of State, intervened and also filed exceptions of peremption and no cause of action. The trial court found that the petition was actually objecting to candidacy under La.R.S. 18:493, which allowed only seven days to object after the qualifying period ended; it would not allow the plaintiffs to try to fit their domicile argument into the irregularities or fraud provision of La.R.S. 18:1405(B) as a basis for an election contest, which can be brought within nine days after the election. Accordingly, the trial court granted all of the defendant's exceptions. On appeal, we affirmed, stating in dicta as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   While Mr. Schedler points out that Fontenot and Leleux can pursue having the district attorney take the appropriate steps to have the position of police chief declared vacant due to Mr. Lartigue's purported failure to meet the necessary domiciliary qualifications to hold that position pursuant to La.R.S. 18:671,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., Fontenot and Leleux have deliberately denied that their claim is seeking such relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904655\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/1287/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6904655\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/153/1287/\">\n    at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Higginbotham v.

The court of appeal reversed, finding that the Board did not have the power to do that which was granted only to the courts under La.R.S. 18:671 -675.

La. R.S. 18:671,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . In this section of the Election Code which was added in 1988, the only occurrence for a vacancy which is addressed concerns a change in the officeholder's \"designated domicile,\" which is defined as his residence or domicile listed at the time of his notice of candidacy or his appointment for the office. Such residency/domicile challenge to an officeholder results from the combined actions of a voter in the election district and the district attorney or attorney general, which result in a judicial procedure for removal of the officeholder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   From the above provisions of our law, we find that the Election Code provides the proper procedure for the challenge to the mayor's domiciliary status in this case, so that his requested injunctive relief is warranted. The Election Code provisions, La. R.S. 18:671,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., specifically address a change in the domicile of an officeholder during his term.

There, the parties conceded that Brown lived in his district when he was elected. Two years later he allowed his cousin and his family to move in rent free, while Brown stayed alternatively in his wife's mobile home outside the district, in his grandmother's and friends' homes, and working off-shore. However, Brown continued paying the rent and utilities on the apartment inside the district. Evidence revealed that Brown's cousin was in financial difficulty, and Brown's own marriage was in severe domestic difficulty. Because there was no question that Brown resided and was domiciled in his district when elected, and he had moved back in by trial, the only question was whether he had intended to permanently vacate his domicile in the district and to establish a new domicile elsewhere. Citing the articles, cases, and presumptions on domicile, the majority found that Brown did not so intend, and it rejected the petition to declare a vacancy under La.R.S. 18:671,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The present case is more complicated than the above cases because the designated domicile on Mr. Harris's qualifying papers, 806 Lake Court Drive in DeRidder, was not where he actually resided. He moved his homeowner's exemption and his\n   homeowner's insurance policy back and forth between the old house on Lake Court Drive and the new house on Harmony Trail, for political reasons, while leaving his voter's registration and driver's license at the old house, though he no longer really lived there.

Rather, testimony revealed that the candidate intended on using the 700 square-foot house in the city as a camp. This court concurred with the reasons in\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Section 2-04(2) imposes a continuing obligation upon the elected council member to remain legally domiciled and actually residing where elected.
