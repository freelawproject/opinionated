Brown, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, Sitting by Designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b182-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b182-24\">Celotex Corporation petitioned this Court for rehearing based upon (i) this Court\u2019s failure to examine or follow <em>Blackston v. Shook and Fletcher Insulation Co., </em>764 F.2d 1480 (11th Cir.1985), and (ii) Celotex\u2019s unfortunate misinterpretation of the meaning of footnote 4 of our original opinion. Both points of error represent an incorrect reading of our holding which we feel compelled to address in order to avoid a similar misinterpretation by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-25\">This Court is clearly familiar with our holding in <em>Blackston </em>requiring a plaintiff to show actual exposure to asbestos-containing products. However, <em>Blackston </em>represents the proper analysis of a summary judgment on the merits, which we do not reach in our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-26\">The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was reversed for its failure to consider <em>all </em>the evidence before the Court. The District Court improperly disregarded an affidavit as a sham which was not in direct conflict with the affiant\u2019s deposition testimony and did not meet this Court\u2019s definition of a sham affidavit. Our holding in no way expresses any opinion whether the plaintiff can survive a motion for summary judgment which properly considers all the evidence, or a motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff\u2019s or defendant\u2019s evidence, or a motion for j.n.o.v. because the litigation has not yet progressed far enough for a determination to be made on these issues. It merely prohibits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>District Court from disregarding this affidavit because it requires a determination of credibility and an assessment of the probative value of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Celotex likewise misinterprets footnote 4 in our opinion as somehow exhibiting a bias or prejudice against a party that actively exercises its rights of appeal. This interpretation is not only incorrect, it is distressing. The footnote merely points out the extensive authoritative case law on summary judgment that has evolved from the massive asbestos litigation, of which Celo-tex Corporation has been an original named defendant, which could in itself serve as an extensive treatise on summary judgment. The fact that Celotex was not involved on the appeal of two of the cited cases does not detract from the point made by this Court, but does demonstrate that this Court in no way based this decision or any other on who brought the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In consideration of the above which does not modify, but merely explains our original holding, Celotex\u2019s Petition for Rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-6\">HILL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ang\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">While I agree with the majority\u2019s above-stated explanation of our original opinion, I would go further and address the merits of Celotex\u2019s petition for rehearing. I am now convinced that McIntyre\u2019s deposition testimony is inherently inconsistent with the conclusory allegations in his affidavit; accordingly I would grant rehearing, disregard the affidavit as a sham, and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Celotex. Therefore, I respectively dissent from the court\u2019s denial of this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The panel opinion concluded that the district court improperly disregarded as a sham an affidavit which, according to the majority, was not in direct conflict with the affiant\u2019s deposition testimony and did not meet this court\u2019s definition of a sham affidavit. I believe that Celotex in its petition for rehearing has forcefully shown that both of these characterizations of McIntyre\u2019s affidavit are erroneous. A plain reading of McIntyre\u2019s deposition testimony reveals it to be inherently inconsistent with the bald assertions in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">When one lays the pertinent passages side-by-side, the repudiation of McIntyre\u2019s affidavit by his subsequent deposition testimony becomes apparent. In his affidavit, McIntyre asserted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">While working in close proximity to William Lawrence Tippens I used the following asbestos containing products which produced dust breathed by William Lawrence Tippens and myself:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">(b) Philip Carey asbestos cement and Carey asbestos pipe covering; [Philip Carey is the predecessor company to Celotex Corp.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">When sworn and questioned on deposition less than two months later, McIntyre repudiated the affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-15\">Q. Okay. You don\u2019t have any particular memory of him [Tippens] being next to you while you were using it [Philip Carey asbestos pipe covering]; do you? A. Well, no. No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Deposition of Frank McIntyre at 33. Counsel for Celotex concluded the deposition by showing McIntyre a copy of his affidavit and directing his attention to the portion quoted above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-17\">Q. And to the extent that this says that William Lawrence Tippens was around you when you were using it [Philip Carey asbestos pipe covering], you can\u2019t testify to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-18\">A. No. I couldn\u2019t testify to that either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahu\"><em>Id. </em>at 35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">These passages show that the difference between McIntyre\u2019s affidavit and his depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>sition testimony is not, as the panel opinion states, \u201cmerely an ability to recall specific times, places, and situations.\u201d <em>Tippens v. Celotex, </em>805 F.2d 949, 952 (11th Cir.1986). Much more than that, his testimony on the two occasions is directly contradictory and inherently inconsistent. In his affidavit, McIntyre stated that Tippens worked near him while he was using Philip Carey asbestos pipe covering. In his deposition, however, McIntyre testified that he could not recall Tippens ever being around him while he was using Celotex\u2019s products. When confronted under oath with the bald assertion in his affidavit, McIntyre admitted that he could not testify to the accuracy or truthfulness of that statement. McIntyre not only was unable to cite specific instances when he used Celotex\u2019s asbestos containing products while in close proximity to Tippens, he could not state that he <em>ever </em>did so. His deposition testimony is so irreconcilable with his prior affidavit that the affidavit may justifiably be disregarded as a sham.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">I agree that we must be careful to distinguish \u201cbetween discrepancies which create transparent shams and discrepancies which create an issue of credibility or go to the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Tippens, </em>805 F.2d at 953. The affidavit in this case, however, satisfies this court\u2019s definition of a sham affidavit. In <em>Van T. Junkins and Associates v. U.S. Industries, </em>736 F.2d 656 (11th Cir.1984), we recognized that \u201c[w]hen a party has given clear answers to unambiguous questions which negate the existence of any genuine issue of material fact, that party cannot thereafter create such an issue with an affidavit that merely contradicts, without explanation, previously given clear testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 657; <em>cf. Kennett-Murray Corp. v. Bone, </em>622 F.2d 887, 894 (5th Cir.1980) (affidavit held not to be a sham where it purported to explain certain aspects of deposition testimony and where affiant stated that he was confused during deposition). This circuit\u2019s precedent, therefore, counsels that an affidavit is properly considered a sham whenever the affiant (1) makes a conclusory, unexplained assertion regarding a material fact which (2) directly contradicts that person\u2019s unequivocal deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-17\">McIntyre\u2019s affidavit qualifies as a sham under this test. The relevant portion of his affidavit consists merely of the bald assertion that while working in close proximity to the decedent McIntyre used various asbestos containing products, some of which were produced by Philip Carey (Celotex). The entire content of the affidavit is con-clusory; it contains no details or facts sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>porting his general declarations. <em>See Barwick v. Celotex Corp., </em>736 F.2d 946, 960 (4th Cir.1984). Moreover, when confronted with his affidavit statements during his deposition, McIntyre did not attempt to explain the inconsistencies in his testimony, nor does his deposition reflect any confusion that might require explanation. <em>See Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire Corp., </em>719 F.2d 1361, 1365 (8th Cir.1983); <em>cf. Kennett-Murray Corp., </em>622 F.2d at 894. In addition, there was such a close proximity between his deposition and affidavit<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the inconsistencies in his testimony cannot be rationalized merely by reference to the passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">It comes down to this: for Tippens to recover, she must carry the burden of showing that the deceased was exposed to the asbestos containing products of Celo-tex. In response to Celotex\u2019s summary judgment motion, Tippens proffered McIntyre as a witness to prove this exposure. On deposition, McIntyre swore that he could not assist Tippens to carry that burden. The summary judgment therefore was correctly granted by the district court. <em>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-20\">. There is no need to contrast any of McIntyre\u2019s deposition testimony relating to his use around Tippens of Philip Carey asbestos cement, because in his deposition McIntyre could not even testify for certain that he ever used Carey cement. This portion of his deposition reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-22\">Q. Okay. Do you recall ever using any Philip Carey cement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>A. It seems like I do. But that\u2019s something else I couldn\u2019t testify to either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Q. Okay. Would your testimony be the same about the asbestos-containing properties of that cement? In other words, you don\u2019t know whether any cement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">A. No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">Q. \u2014you might have used contained asbestos?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">A. No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">Q. Is what I said correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">Q. Okay. As to the asbestos cement, you couldn\u2019t say that you ever did use that; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">A. Well, no. I'm afraid to there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">Deposition of Frank McIntyre at 33-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b184-15\">. The panel seemed to place some importance on the fact that the affidavit <em>preceded </em>the discrediting deposition in this case, noting that [w]hile it is much less likely that an affidavit which precedes a weak deposition is filed as a transparent sham than is a discrediting affidavit which is filed after a weak deposition which failed to establish a material issue of fact, we do not need to reach that conclusion today because we find that the affidavit and deposition are not inherently irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"Avh\"><em>Tippens, </em>805 F.2d at 953. I disagree with this assessment. McIntyre\u2019s affidavit was offered by the plaintiff expressly for the purpose of opposing Celotex\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the same purpose for which virtually all sham affidavits are offered. <em>See Van T. Junkins, </em>736 F.2d at 656; <em>see also Babrocky </em>v. <em>Jewel Food Co., </em>773 F.2d 857, 861 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Foster v. Arcata Assocs., Inc., </em>772 F.2d 1453, 1462 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1267, 89 L.Ed.2d 576 (1986); <em>Albertson v. T.J. Stevenson &amp; Co., </em>749 F.2d 223, 228 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Camfield Tires, Inc. v. Michelin Tire Corp., </em>719 F.2d 1361, 1365 (8th Cir.1983). It is the <em>purpose </em>of the affidavit that is important, not when it was filed vis-a-vis the party's deposition. Because the purpose of the affidavit in this case was to create an issue of fact in response to the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion, it is just as susceptible to being a transparent sham as an affidavit which is filed after a weak deposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-23\">.
