Realizing that many tenants are too unsophisticated on account of age or infirmity to evaluate properly the complex choices offered them upon conversion, Congress sought to alleviate developer abuses during the conversion process. At the same time Congress recognized that developers deserve a fair return on their investment. Yet when a developer\u2019s profit is unconscionable, it comes at the tenants\u2019 expense. Thus, the scope of the Act must be determined in light of these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In 1982 Parker 14th Associates (Parker or the developer) sought to convert its apartment building located at 5-19 West 14th Street in New York City to a cooperative form of ownership. Believing the offering plan to be unfair, the tenants banded together and signed a no-buy pledge agreement. Later, they negotiated with the developer for a year over the details of the conversion, the plan became effective and title to the building was transferred to 5 W. 14th Owners Corp., the cooperative association owned by the tenant-shareholders. Owners Corp. now owns the building and is the defendant-appellant in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">As part of the negotiated conversion plan, Owners Corp. \u2014 while still managed by directors appointed by the developer\u2014 signed three long-term contracts that assigned profitable rights to the plaintiffs-ap-pellees, three developer-affiliated corporations, West 14th Street Commercial Corp., West 14th Street Garage Corp. and West 14th Street Laundry Corp. The instant suit was precipitated when a tenant-controlled board took over Owners Corp. and, under the authority of the Act, purported to terminate the three contracts negotiated by the tenants\u2019 organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">A. <em>The Conversion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">After Parker \u2014 the owner of the subject high-rise multiple residence building at Fifth Avenue and 14th Street in Union Square \u2014 decided to convert the building to a cooperative, it filed an Offering Plan in 1982 that included the three contracts in question. In response the tenants organized the P.G. Tenant\u2019s Unity Group (Unity Group) and collected no-buy pledges from over 65% of the tenants. These actions deprived the developer of the number of inside buyers it needed to evict non-buying tenants under New York\u2019s Martin Act, N.Y.Gen.Bus.Law \u00a7 352-eeee (McKinney 1984), amended by 1982 N.Y. Laws c. 555 \u00a7 2. Parker then proposed a non-eviction plan which, to become effective under the Martin Act, required that 15% of the insiders purchase their apartments. <em>Id. </em>Obtaining subscriptions from only 4% of the tenants, the developer was forced into negotiations with Unity Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">Although they now dispute the nature and extent of these negotiations, the two sides met several times during the year, filed amendments to the Offering Plan, and made material changes in all three contracts. The developer stated in the record that it \u201cremained completely adamant\u201d that the laundry, garage and commercial space be leased back to it as part of the conversion plan. It negotiated only as to the rent it would pay. There is evidence that the Unity Group and Parker reached at least a tentative agreement on these leases, which was communicated to the tenants in a newsletter and at a meeting. By January 6, 1984 when the Plan was declared effective, 36% of the units had committed to purchase and by the end of January 85% of the tenants had purchased. On August 28, 1984, a week before the closing, the three contracts were sent to Unity Group\u2019s attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ney for comments. On September 6, 1984, with Unity Group representatives present, the closing was held at which all three of the contracts in question were signed. At that time defendant Owners Corp. was still under the legal control of directors appointed by the developer, and the closing documents were signed for all parties by persons associated with the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">B. <em>The Contracts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The three contracts at issue are the Master Commercial Lease, the Parking Garage Lease, and the Laundry Concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">1. <em>The Master Commercial Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Owners Corp., after replacing the developer as landlord, leased space to plaintiff 14 West Commercial Corp. in the building for four commercial retail stores. The lease ran for a period of 20 years, with a 20-year option to renew. The rent was admittedly well below market, providing plaintiff Commercial Corp. with an opportunity to sub-let the property at a substantial profit. This additional profit potential was acknowledged in the \u201cSpecial Risks\u201d point of the Offering Plan. Owners Corp. remained responsible for providing water, utilities and insurance over the lease term and was obliged to absorb any increase in these expenses. The retail stores were to be open to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">2. <em>The Parking Garage Lease</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Plaintiff 14 West Garage Corp. leased the parking garage space in the building\u2019s basement and cellar from Owners Corp. This lease also ran for 20 years at admittedly below market rent with a similar renewal option. Although the parking garage was open to the general public, unit holders leased about one-third of the spaces and the Garage Corp. had an obligation\u2014 stated in the Offering Plan \u2014 to give building residents first preference when spaces became vacant. The garage lease included a covenant that the space be used only as a parking garage, and set forth the understanding of the parties that the service of a parking garage was an \u201cintegral part of the operation of a high-class multiple dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">3. <em>The Laundry Concession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Owners Corp. also entered into an agreement with 14 West Laundry Corp. for the latter to provide coin-operated washing machines and dryers in the building\u2019s laundry room and receive the income from those machines for the next 20 years in return for paying the cooperative $1,500 per month. The laundry room serves the building\u2019s residents and is not open to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">C. <em>The Termination and Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">On October 10, 1984 a meeting of the shareholders of Owners Corp. was held at which officers and directors independent of the sponsor were elected. The outgoing Board requested, but was denied, a ratification of all prior corporate acts. On June 12,1985, in accordance with \u00a7 3607 of the Act, a meeting of the shareholders was held at which a resolution was passed \u2014 by more than the statutorily required % majority \u2014 to terminate the three described contracts. On July 3, 1985 Owners Corp. served upon plaintiffs the statutorily required 90 day notice of termination. Plaintiffs immediately filed this declaratory judgment action and sought injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Knapp, J.). The district court declared Owners Corp.\u2019s termination of the contracts void and granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment holding that the challenged contracts fell outside the scope of the Act. It also denied defendant\u2019s motions for summary judgment or dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. From the district court\u2019s opinion and judgment, 625 F.Supp. 934 (S.D.N. Y.1986), Owners Corp. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">I FEDERAL QUESTION JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">Owners Corp. argues for the first time on appeal that the district court lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>subject matter jurisdiction. Because all the parties are New York corporations, if jurisdiction is to be found it must rest upon 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (1982) which grants jurisdiction to federal district courts for civil actions \u201carising under\u201d federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">To define what constitutes federal question jurisdiction, it is helpful to analyze the subject in historical perspective. Under the Constitution federal question jurisdiction was originally very broad. Chief Justice Marshall, commenting on the constitutional provisions of Art. Ill \u00a7 2[1] in <em>Osborn v. Bank of United States, </em>9 Wheat. 738, 22 U.S. 326, 6 L.Ed. 204 (1824), stated that \u201c[w]hen a question to which the judicial power ... extend[s] ... forms an ingredient of the original cause, it is in the power of congress to give the circuit courts jurisdiction of that cause, although other questions of fact or of law may be involved in it.\u201d 9 Wheat, at 823, 22 U.S. at 362. Later, as a result of a statutory enactment, access to a federal forum was restricted. Judiciary Act of 1875, Act of March 3, 1875, ch. 137, \u00a7 1 et seq., 18 Stat. 470. Section 5 of that Act directed a federal court to dismiss or remand a suit if it appeared at any time \u201cthat such suit does not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within [its] jurisdiction.\u201d There is wide agreement that the statute narrowed the path, <em>see, e.g., Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., </em>358 U.S. 354, 379, 79 S.Ct. 468, 483, 3 L.Ed.2d 368 (1959), but defining that path\u2019s precise boundaries has often proved to be a Sisiphyean task.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">There are two tests under which an action may present a federal question. The first asks whether federal law creates the cause of action. If so, federal question jurisdiction exists. In <em>American Well Works Co. v. Layne &amp; Bowler Co., </em>241 U.S. 257, 36 S.Ct. 585, 60 L.Ed. 987 (1916), Justice Holmes devised this still relied upon rule writing that \u201c[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 36 S.Ct. at 586; <em>see also The Fair v. Kohler Dye &amp; Specialty Co., </em>228 U.S. 22, 25, 33 S.Ct. 410, 411, 57 L.Ed. 716 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">If state law creates the cause of action, the second test asks whether that cause of action poses a substantial federal question. The lineage of this second test of \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction reaches back 65 years to <em>Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., </em>255 U.S. 180, 201, 41 S.Ct. 243, 245, 65 L.Ed. 577 (1921). In that case, plaintiff sought to enjoin defendant corporate officers from investing corporate funds in farm loan bonds issued by federal land banks because the act authorizing their issue was unconsitutional \u2014 and hence constituted an investment in an unlawful security under Missouri law. The Supreme Court found federal jurisdiction present because of the necessity to decide the constitutional issue as an element of the state law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In determining whether the complaint presents a federal question, the court must examine it in accordance with the well-pleaded complaint rule. Posited 13 years after the 1875 Act in <em>Metcalf v. Wa-tertown, </em>128 U.S. 586, 95 S.Ct. 173, 32 L.Ed. 543 (1888), this rule states that federal jurisdiction must be found from \u201cwhat necessarily appears in the plaintiff's statement of his own claim ..., unaided by anything alleged in anticipation of avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Anderson, </em>234 U.S. 74, 75-76, 34 S.Ct. 724, 724, 58 L.Ed. 1218 (1914); <em>see also Louisville &amp; Nashville Ry. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908). This \u201cpowerful doctrine\u201d, <em>Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 9, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 2846, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983), remains the initial reference by which a federal court must determine whether there is \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction. <em>See Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Thompson, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 3232, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986). Examining only those allegations which are properly raised in a well-pleaded complaint, the court must then determine whether the substance of those allegations raises a federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Recently, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its adherence to the \u201cwell-pleaded com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>plaint\u201d rule and to the two tests for \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction just described. Emphasizing that any federal issue raised in a non-federal cause of action must be really substantial, the Court warned, \u201cthe mere presence of a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer federal question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Merrell Dow, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3235 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Gully v. First National Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 116, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936) (where in a state cause of action \u201c \u2018the federal nature of the right to be established is decisive\u2019 \u201d there is a substantial federal question) (quoting <em>Puerto Rico v. Russell &amp; Co., </em>288 U.S. 476, 483, 53 S.Ct. 447, 450, 77 L.Ed. 903 (1933)). To determine when the federal element is deemed sufficiently substantial we must look to the nature of the federal interest at stake. <em>Merrell Dow, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3236 n. 12. <em>Mer-rell Dow </em>held that when Congress has provided no private right of action under a federal statute, the borrowing of that federal law as a standard of conduct in a state created action is not sufficiently substantial to confer federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In short, not every case or cause of action that knocks on the federal courthouse door gains entrance. To determine whether the court has federal question jurisdiction to decide the case, the complaint must contain either a federal cause of action or a state cause of action embodying a substantial federal question. With this formula in mind, we turn to the jurisdictional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">II APPLICATION TO INSTANT CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Applying the above rules to the facts of the present case, we conclude that because one section of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3611, expressly grants plaintiffs the right to bring an action in federal court under \u00a7 3607, the provision of the Act that authorizes termination of self-dealing contracts, plaintiffs\u2019 well-pleaded complaint presents a federally-created cause of action. Alternatively, we hold that even if plaintiffs have no statutorily created federal action under \u00a7 3607, their state claims encompass a substantial federal question under the</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Condominium and Cooperative Abuse Relief Act. We further conclude that either finding is sufficient to establish \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">A. <em>Federal Cause of Action </em>[5] 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3611 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Suits at law or equity</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">(a) Unless otherwise limited as in section 3607 or 3608 of this title, any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may sue at law or in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Recovery of actual damages</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">(b) In any action authorized by this section for a violation of section 3607 or 3609 of this title where actual damages have been suffered, such damages may be awarded or such other relief granted as deemed fair, just, and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">Based on this provision, plaintiffs\u2019 three developer-affiliated corporations seek a declaration that defendant\u2019s termination of the three contracts was not authorized by \u00a7 3607 and was, therefore, void. The complaint asserts subject matter jurisdiction in federal court under both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3612. The latter gives the federal courts jurisdiction to hear \u201cactions at law or in equity brought under [The Condominium and Cooperative Abuse Relief Act of 1980] without regard to the amount in controversy.\u201d Thus, the allegations of the complaint alone \u2014 under the well-pleaded complaint rule \u2014 reveals that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is a direct product of \u00a7\u00a7 3607, 3611, and 3612.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">Defendant Owners Corp. argues that neither party has an \u201caction at law or equity\u201d under \u00a7 3607 because the statute was intended to furnish a \u201cnon-judicial\u201d remedy. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 736 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 51, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3506, 3558. But \u00a7 3611(b) refers to \u201cany action authorized by this section for a violation of section 3607.\u201d Hence, even a cursory reading of the statute demonstrates that defendant\u2019s contention is without merit. Further \u00a7 3611(a) grants a private right of action to \u201cany person aggriev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>ed by a violation of this chapter.\u201d We conclude that plaintiffs were so aggrieved. In essence, plaintiffs claim that Owners Corp. wrongfully terminated their contracts under the auspices of \u00a7 3607. If Owners Corp.\u2019s termination under \u00a7 3607 was not lawful, plaintiffs have been aggrieved by Owners Corp.\u2019s misapplication of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Legislative history supports this conclusion. The Senate version of \u00a7 3611 had originally provided for a civil remedy only by \u201cone or more purchasers, or by a tenants\u2019 organization or an owners\u2019 association\u201d against \u201c[a] developer or his successor or agent\u201d S.Rep. No. 736 at 78, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News at 3385. The Conference version amended this provision to give a remedy to \u201cany person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter.\u201d The amendment plainly indicates that Congress did not limit the right to sue under this statute merely to aggrieved tenants. Moreover, the general purpose of the Act to provide federal relief in an area traditionally reserved to the states coupled with an explicit grant of federal jurisdiction strongly suggests a Congressional purpose to resolve all \u00a7 3607 disputes under federal law. It would make little sense to relegate developers to a state law remedy when the actions complained of are taken under the authority of a federal statute. Consequently, plaintiffs, as aggrieved persons, have a right of action expressly provided in \u00a7 3611 that supports the exercise of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Merrell Dow, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3232-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">B. <em>State Created Cause of Action Presenting a Substantive Federal Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Even if plaintiffs had no express right of action under the statute, their complaint would still present a federal question sufficient to confer jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. That complaint seeks a declaration \u201cthat the termination of the leases by Owners Corp. is of no force and effect\u201d because the statutory authorization under \u00a7 3607 does not encompass the three contracts at issue or, in the alternative, if the statute applies, that it is unconstitutional. Plaintiffs also sought an injunction against future terminations by Owners Corp. and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">Defendant urges that the complaint simply sets forth a state-law claim for breach of contract, with the federally authorized termination asserted only as an anticipated defense. Plaintiffs respond that its declaratory judgment complaint raises a federal question. We note at the outset that federal jurisdiction cannot be based on the fact that a declaratory judgment is sought because the declaratory judgment statute does not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., </em>339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct. 876, 878, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950). Instead, a court must look beyond the declaratory judgment allegations and determine whether a substantial federal question arises either from the defendant\u2019s threatened action, <em>Franchise Tax Board, </em>463 U.S. at 16 &amp; n. 14, 103 S.Ct. at 2849 &amp; n. 14; <em>Public Service Commission v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952), or from the complaint when viewed as a request for coercive relief apart from the defendant\u2019s anticipated suit. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp. v. Ilsley, </em>690 F.2d 323, 327-28 (2d Cir.1982), <em>aff'd., </em>463 U.S. 1220, 103 S.Ct. 3564, 77 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1983). Under either approach plaintiffs have a cause of action that arises under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">1. <em>Defendant\u2019s Threatened Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The first approach analyzes an action that would have been brought by the declaratory judgment defendant. In <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>the Supreme Court stated that</p>\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Federal courts have regularly taken original jurisdiction over declaratory judgment suits in which, if the declaratory judgment defendant brought a coercive action to enforce its rights, that suit would necessarily present a federal question.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">463 U.S. at 19, 103 S.Ct. at 2851. The developer-affiliated plaintiff corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>argue that the declaratory judgment defendant, Owners Corp., was threatening to and could have brought a federal action under \u00a7 3607. Because plaintiffs were anticipating a federal suit, they claim that their declaratory judgment action presents a federal question. Owners Corp. responds that it need not have brought a federal suit, but could have sued in state court in trespass, ejectment, or contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Although there is no meritorious contract action available to Owners Corp., it is true that it could have brought a state action in trespass or ejectment. But, a well-pleaded complaint under either of these theories would have to set forth Owners Corp.\u2019s current right to possession. <em>Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, </em>414 U.S. 661, 666, 94 S.Ct. 772, 776, 39 L.Ed.2d 73 (1974) (ejectment); <em>New York v. White, </em>528 F.2d 336 (2d Cir.1975) (same); <em>Donohue v. Whitney, </em>133 N.Y. 178, 30 N.E. 848 (1892) (trespass); <em>Firment v. Bry-den, </em>54 A.D.2d 796, 387 N.Y.S.2d 737 (3d Dep\u2019t 1976) (same). And, because Owners Corp.\u2019s \u201ccurrent right to possession [is allegedly] conferred by federal law\u201d under the authority of \u00a7 3607, a well-pleaded complaint alleging these state law posses-sory actions would necessarily raise a federal question. <em>Oneida Indian Nation, </em>414 U.S. at 666, 94 S.Ct. at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Owners Corp. further contends that it need not have sued under \u00a7 3607 but could have locked-out plaintiffs and their sub-tenants forcing them to initiate coercive legal action. Yet, under <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>the question is not whether the declaratory judgment defendant would necessarily bring a federal action, but rather <em>if it brought an action </em>would such action necessarily have raised a federal question. Although defendant might have regained possession of the property through self-help remedies, it could not have disposed of the legal dispute without judicial resolution of the propriety of its actions under \u00a7 3607; hence in bringing suit it would have created federal question jurisdiction for the issues in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">2. <em>The Complaint As Coercive Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The second approach leads to the same conclusion. In addition to examining defendant\u2019s \u201cthreatened\u201d action, we examine plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to see if it raises a federal question when viewed as a coercive action apart from defendant\u2019s anticipated suit. <em>Stone &amp; Webster, </em>690 F.2d at 327-28. To do this, it is necessary to identify the substantive theory upon which plaintiffs could have brought their cause of action to determine whether the federal issue would arise under a \u201cwell-pleaded\u201d complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Although there is some discretion when construing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, <em>New York State Waterways Assoc. v. Diamond, </em>469 F.2d 419, 421 (2d Cir.1972), federal jurisdiction may not rest on an equitable claim when an adequate remedy at law that would not confer such jurisdiction is available. <em>White, </em>528 F.2d at 338. No legal remedies adequately fit plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. There is no action for trespass or ejectment because plaintiffs are in possession or constructive possession (through sub-tenants) of the real property, <em>see White, </em>528 F.2d at 338-39. Nor would a contract action be appropriate because plaintiffs seeks to retain possession of the property under the leases rather than merely obtain damages. Thus, we assume that whatever state claim plaintiffs have is equitable in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Viewing the complaint as an equitable action seeking coercive relief, it may properly be considered as a common law or statutory action to remove a cloud on title. Under <em>Hopkins v. Walker, </em>244 U.S. 486, 37 S.Ct. 711, 61 L.Ed. 1270 (1917), \u201cthe existence and invalidity of the instrument or record sought to be eliminated as a cloud upon the title are essential parts of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d 244 U.S. at 490, 37 S.Ct. at 713. Consequently, since it is the provisions of \u00a7 3607 that give rise to the cloud, the statute must necessarily be pleaded in a well-pleaded action to remove that cloud. <em>Hopkins, </em>244 U.S. at 491, 37 S.Ct. at 713; <em>White, </em>528 F.2d at 339. Thus considered as a common law action, the complaint necessarily raises a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>federal question on the face of a well-pleaded complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">This conclusion is no different under a modem statutory action. New York has codified the common law action to quiet title and statutorily redefined the necessary elements for a well-pleaded remaining cloud on title complaint. Under Article 15 of the Real Property Actions and Proceeding Law, the plaintiff need only plead its claim to an estate or interest in land and defendant\u2019s adverse claim; plaintiff need not plead the \u201cinvalidity\u201d of defendant\u2019s claim as required under the common law. N.Y. Real Prop. Acts Law \u00a7 1515.1 (McKinney 1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plainffs\u2019 well-pleaded complaint under the quieting title statute would have to allege defendant\u2019s adverse claim under \u00a7 3607 and would therefore raise a federal question. Consequently, under either the common law or statutory formulation federal question jurisdiction would necessarily arise in a well-pleaded complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">3. <em>Substantial Federal Question</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ad\"><em>Merrell Dow </em>teaches that the above discussion \u2014 showing that a federal question appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint \u2014 is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of \u201carising under\u201d jurisdiction. One final question remains: whether the federal issue arising in the state law cause of action is sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to confer federal-question jurisdiction. <em>Mer-rell Dow, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3236. In this inquiry, \u201cthe nature of the federal issues at stake,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3236 n. 12, with an eye to \u201cpracticality and necessity,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3234, must be analyzed. In <em>Merrell Dow, </em>the Supreme Court looked at substantiality with narrowed eyes holding that where Congress has not provided plaintiff with a private right of action under a federal statute, it must be concluded \u201cthat the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently \u2018substantial\u2019 to confer federal-question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3236.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Nonetheless, assuming that plaintiffs have no private right of action under \u00a7 3607, we conclude that the federal element in plaintiffs\u2019 state cause of action would still be sufficiently substantial to confer arising under jurisdiction. In <em>Merrill Dow </em>the federal statute was merely incorporated by reference as a standard of conduct in a state negligence action. Here the situation is quite different. In construing the Condominium Relief Act in a state cause of action, the federal issue is decisive because upon that Act\u2019s construction the vindication of rights and definition of relationships <em>created by federal law </em>depends. <em>See Gully, </em>299 U.S. at 116, 57 S.Ct. at 99. In light of this qualitative difference, the federal ingredient in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this case is sufficiently substantial to confer the arising under jurisdiction. Having found federal jurisdiction, we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Ill REQUIREMENTS OF \u00a7</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">3607(a) MET</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the three terminated contracts do not fall within the scope of \u00a7 3607(a). This section gives the cooperative association the right to terminate contracts which provide for (1) \u201cthe operation, maintenance, or management of a ... cooperative association ... or of property serving the ... cooperative unit owners,\u201d and are (2) between the unit owners and developer, (3) which were ent\u00e9red into while the cooperative association was controlled by the developer, (4) and are for a period of more than three years. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607 (1982).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>All four of these statutory elements must exist for a contract to fall within reach of the Act. The district court concluded that the contracts did not satisfy the elements of subdivisions (2) and (3) and therefore could not lawfully be terminated under \u00a7 3607. The district court reasoned that the negotiations between the parties rendered the remedial provisions of the Act unavailable to Owners Corp. Because it is conceded that all the contracts were for more than three years, subdivision (4) was not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the four subdivisions of \u00a7 3607 have been met. Although plaintiffs concede that the laundry room concession is subject to \u00a7 3607 of the Act, they argue that the garage and commercial leases \u2014 in addition to not meeting subdivisions (2) and (3), as the district court concluded \u2014 do not satisfy the elements of subdivision (1) either. Plaintiffs contend that these two leases do not involve \u201cproperty serving\u201d unit holders, and that the instruments in question are \u201cleases\u201d subject to \u00a7 3608 of the Act, not \u201ccontracts\u201d within \u00a7 3607. In the discussion that follows, we take up all of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">\u2014Subdivision (1) of \u00a7 3607(a)\u2014 <em>Contracts Which Provide for Operation, Maintenance or Management</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">In attempting to establish that the garage and commercial leases are not \u201ccontracts\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 3607, plaintiffs claim that the problem of unconscionable <em>leases </em>was addressed by \u00a7 3608.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since \u00a7 3608 allows termination of leases only after the cooperative satisfies stringent limitations not present in \u00a7 3607, plaintiffs argue that an interpretation of \u00a7 3607 which includes leases would render these limitations ineffective. They also urge that a lease is a transfer of an estate in land, not a contract for operation maintenance or management and, therefore, beyond the scope of \u00a7 3607.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">These arguments are flawed on a number of grounds. First, a \u201clease\u201d as used in \u00a7 3608 is defined narrowly to include only property owned by the developer (or developer affiliated companies) leased <em>to </em>the cooperative project; not, as here, cooperative property leased <em>by </em>the cooperative to the developer. \u00a7 3603. Hence, the limitations of \u00a7 3608 are not undercut if \u00a7 3607 is construed to apply to leases where the cooperative association is the lessor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>ond, legislative history reveals that leases as well as contracts are covered by \u00a7 3607. For example, Senator Williams, the bill sponsor, described \u00a7 3607 as a method for residents to void \u201ca long-term self-dealing <em>leasing arrangement\u201d </em>126 Cong.Rec. 28,-178 (1980) (emphasis added). The Senate Report also refers to \u201clease provisions\u201d in discussing \u00a7 3607. S.Rep. No. 736, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 95, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3601 (Additional Views of Senators Gam, Lugar, Tower, and Armstrong). Third, a line drawn between leases and contracts would exalt form over substance. Leases, a species of contract, may contain covenants that require the lessee to perform certain contractual services for the landlord. For instance, both leases in this conversion contain affirmative covenants: the plaintiff garage tenant convenanted to \u201cuse and occupy the Demised Premises as a storage garage for ... automobiles\u201d and to give first preference to the cooperative residents; the plaintiff commercial tenant con-venanted to \u201cuse and occupy the demised premises for sale of retail goods to the public.\u201d Thus, a lease, in substance, may be nothing more than a contract of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Finally, construing this statute so as to permit cooperatives to cancel only maintenance-type contracts, but not leases would, contrary to Congress\u2019 aim, serve as an incentive to developers to try and retain as much control over cooperative property as possible. For example, a <em>contract </em>for the operation of a laundry room, where the developer retained a fair percentage of the profits would be terminable, while a <em>lease </em>for the same laundry room space where the laundry room-tenant (developer) paid a below market fixed-rent would not be. Such an anomalous result would thwart Congress\u2019 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>\u201cProperty Serving\u201d the Unit-Owners</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Plaintiffs also assert that the commercial and garage spaces are not \u201cproperty serving the ... cooperative unit owners\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 3607 because they do not <em>exclusively </em>serve the residents of the building. We cannot adopt such a narrow reading of this remedial law. The words \u201cexclusive\u201d or \u201cexclusively\u201d do not appear in the statute. Further, such an interpretation would enable developers in future conversion projects to sidestep the statute simply by eliminating the exclusive nature of any service. For instance, by opening a handful of spaces in a private parking lot to the public, or by giving the public access to a heretofore private laundry room, developers could remove their contracts from \u00a7 3607\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Because no special meaning was attached to \u201cproperty serving\u201d, we assume instead that Congress did not contemplate one. Consequently, the phrase should be accorded its plain, ordinary meaning of providing services. <em>Perrin v. United States, </em>444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S.Ct. 311, 314, 62 L.Ed.2d 199 (1979). In reaching this conclusion we rely on Congress\u2019 purpose. Legislative history reveals that the statute was designed to protect those services associated with recreational leases and management contracts, such as the provision for security, general maintenance and repair, elevator service, and the upkeep of communal areas. <em>See </em>4B R. Powell &amp; P. Rohan, <em>The Law of Real Property </em>f 633.-35[3], 633.36 (1986) (describing the various services); Krebs, <em>Legislative Response to \u201cSweetheart\u201d Management Contracts: Protecting the Condominium Purchaser, </em>55 Chi-Kent L.Rev. 319 (1979); Annot., 73 ALR 3d 613 (1976) (collecting and analyzing cases in which contracts challenged on claim of self-dealing); Note, Real Property-Condominiums-Developer Self-Dealing, 1975 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 295. From this history, it is plain that Congress aimed to protect property providing services primarily for the benefit of the unit-owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Applying this standard, an on-site parking garage is property providing a service primarily for the benefit of the cooperative. A parking garage, with or without tenant preferences, provides a service that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>tenants might reasonably expect as an essential adjunct of their apartment complex. In the instant case, a number of factors make it especially clear that the parking garage \u201cserves\u201d the unit-owners. The garage lease contained an affirmative covenant that the garage tenant would use the space to provide a specific service, <em>i.e., </em>the operation of a parking garage. Further, although the garage was open to the public, both the Conversion Offering Plan and the building\u2019s certificate of occupancy contain provisions indicating that residents would have first preference for vacant spaces. Finally, the parties in this case set forth in the garage contract their understanding that \u201cthe services to be furnished by [the garage tenant] ... are an integral part of the operation of a high-class multiple dwelling____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Commercial stores, on the other hand, are primarily for the benefit of the <em>public. </em>Although the availability of commercial stores may be deemed to \u201crelate directly to the ease, comfort and economy of the cooperative shareholders,\u201d <em>Phoenix Tenants Association v. The 6465 Realty Co., </em>119 A.D.2d 427, 435, 500 N.Y.S.2d 657 (1st Dep\u2019t 1986) (dissenting opinion), they do not serve as an integral benefit to the unit-holders in the same respect as on-site parking.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Concededly, it may be more convenient for unit-owners to have easily accessible banks, cleaners, drug and grocery stores, and the like. But these services are not the sort that a tenant should reasonably expect as an essential adjunct of an apartment complex. Again, the contracts bolster this conclusion. Clause 1 provides that the \u201ctenant shall use and occupy demised premises for sale of retail goods <em>to the public </em>and for no other purpose,\u201d and Clause 45A provides that the space \u201cshall be used for retail space and services compatible with similarly situated cooperative apartment buildings <em>in the general area </em>of the Building.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">In sum, the garage leasing contract is a contract that provides for the operation, maintenance, or management of \u201cproperty serving\u201d the cooperative unit owners; but the commercial lease does not so qualify within the meaning of \u00a7 3607(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">\u2014Subdivision (2) of \u00a7 3607(a)\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"ATc\">\n<em>Between the Unit Owners and Developer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">The contracts were signed by Parker, a \u201cdeveloper\u201d as defined by \u00a7 3603(14)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Owners Corp., a \u201ccooperative association\u201d as defined in \u00a7 3603(9).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, it seems plain that the contracts were \u201cbetween\u201d the cooperative association and the developer. Nevertheless, the district court held that the contracts \u2014 while formally \u201cbetween\u201d the developer and Owners Corp. \u2014 were in reality \u201cbetween\u201d the developer and the tenants\u2019 Unity Group which negotiated the contracts. The district judge therefore held that the contracts could not be avoided by Owners Corp. Realizing that Unity Group could not legally bind Owners Corp., the trial court also concluded that the contracts were \u201cratified\u201d when 80% of the tenants purchased shares in Owners Corp.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">We reach the opposite conclusion. First, a contract is \u201cbetween\u201d \u2014 hence binding on \u2014 only those who are parties to it, as evidenced by their signatures. On this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ground, only Owners Corp. and the developer as signatories, and not Unity Group, are parties to the contracts. Logically, the contracts could not be \u201cbetween\u201d Unity Group and the developer because Unity Group is not a party to them. Although ratification could serve to bind Owners Corp. to the contracts, <em>see </em>1A W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, </em>\u00a7 210 (C.V. Swearingen rev. ed. 1983), no ratification took place. That event only occurs upon a vote of the board of directors to adopt the contracts, <em>id.; </em>it does not occur through the purchase of stock in the corporation. Thus, the purchase of shares in Owners Corp. by 80% of tenants is irrelevant. In short, because it was only the cooperative Owners Corp. itself that could ultimately bind the cooperative, the contracts must be \u201cbetween\u201d it and the developer.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u2014Subdivision (3) of \u00a7 3607(a)\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AZ_\">\n<em>Control by Developer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">Again, the contracts easily appear to satisfy the control by developer element of \u00a7 3607. Owners Corp. was under \u201cspecial developer control\u201d when it signed the contracts because it was directed by a board appointed by a developer-affiliate in accordance with the Offering Plan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the district court recognized this, it still reasoned that because even an \u201cindependent\u201d board would have signed the contracts, the undisputed evidence of developer control should be disregarded. The court believed an independent board would have been compelled to sign the contracts or risk losing the conversion plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">This focus is misplaced. The crucial inquiry under \u00a7 3607 is whether the cooperative was free from developer control when it became obligated under the contracts, not whether an independent board would have signed them. As noted, the evidence that Owners Corp. was under developer control when it signed the contracts is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">IV NEGOTIATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Having found two of the three contracts to be within \u00a7 3607(a), we now address whether the negotiations between Unity Group and the developer render the Act inapplicable. As \u00a7 3607\u2019s title suggests, it was Congress\u2019 purpose to afford relief to unit-holders from the imposition of \u201cself-dealing\u201d or sweetheart developer contracts. The district court found that the contracts in this case were \u201cin no sense \u2018self-dealing\u2019 \u201d because of the negotiations between the parties. 625 F.Supp. at 942. This effort to read negotiations into the statute is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">In enacting \u00a7 3607 Congress provided tenants a non-judicial remedy. The Senate Report on \u00a7 3607 \u2014 containing but a single sentence \u2014 makes the point: \u201cSection [3607] provides a means by which unit owners ... may terminate a long-term, self-dealing contractual arrangement <em>without having to resort to judicial action.\u201d </em>S.Rep. No. 736 at 51, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News at 3558 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 95; 1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3600-01 (Additional Views of Senators Garn, Lugar, Tower, and Armstrong). The district court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 3607 that would allow developers to plead tenant negotiations as a defense to a \u00a7 3607 termination would force every termination into litigation. Courts would have to determine, for example, whether the specific contracts were the subject of negotiations and/or whether the parties were bargaining in good faith from roughly equal bargaining positions. Such a result would undermine the legislatively provided non-judicial remedy. Accordingly, we decline to read \u201ca negotiation defense\u201d into \u00a7 3607.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">This conclusion is further supported by comparing \u00a7 3607 to its neighbor \u00a7 3608.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Unlike \u00a7 3607, \u00a7 3608(a) specifically provides for \u201ca judicial determination\u201d that a lease was unconscionable after considering several factors including \u201cthe commercial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>setting of the negotiations.\u201d \u00a7 3608(c)(1); <em>see also </em>126 Cong.Rec. 28,179 (1980) (\u201c[I]t is our intent that courts permit evidence on such matters as the relative bargaining position of the parties.\u201d) (statement of Sen. Williams). The absence of these factors in \u00a7 3607 persuasively indicates that Congress did not envision negotiations playing a role in the application of \u00a7 3607.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">As a practical matter, a consideration of negotiations would deter future tenants from engaging in any discussions with developers for fear that they would be deemed to have waived their rights under the Act. Moreover, this view of \u00a7 3607 is consistent with Congress\u2019 desire to protect cooperative apartment owners in that it prevents the developers from offering the tenants a deceptively low purchase price financed by hidden costs spread over a number of years. Congress may have determined that even with effective representation in negotiations, tenants may still be unduly tempted by an artificially low insider purchase price into accepting hidden future costs. There may also have been concern that non-tenant buyers without representation by a tenant\u2019s organization might not be informed of concealed costs. Consequently, the existence of negotiations is not a relevant factor in determining whether a termination of a contract satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 3607.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">To summarize: the garage and laundry contracts satisfy all the elements of \u00a7 3607 and accordingly could properly be terminated by Owners Corp. At the same time, because the commercial lease is not a contract for the operation, maintenance, or management of property serving the cooperative unit owners, it was improperly terminated by Owners Corp. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs insofar as it nullified the Owners Corp.\u2019s termination of the laundry room concession and the parking garage lease is reversed. We remand that portion of the judgment to the district court with directions to enter judgment in favor of appellant Owners Corp. In all other respects, the judgment below is affirmed.
