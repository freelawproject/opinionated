Bernard, 644 F.Supp. 701. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-25\">1. FACTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-26\">This case arises out of Steurer\u2019s attempts to collect Social Security benefits based on her ex-husband\u2019s earnings record. Specifically, Steurer asserted that her child was a dependent of her ex-husband, and was, therefore, entitled to child\u2019s insurance benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d). The controversy below centered on whether her child was a dependent. Section 402(d)(1)(C) requires a showing of dependency, <em>inter Q/liCtf</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-28\">(ii) if [the insured] has died, at the time of such death, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-29\">(iii) if [the insured] had a period of disability which continued until * * * the month of his death, at the beginning of such period of disability or at the time he became entitled to such benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-30\">The following evidence was introduced regarding the child\u2019s dependency on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1250\">*1250</page-number>natural father. Steurer married the insured deceased wage earner, Walter W. Bernard, in 1971, and a child, Jason Nicholas, was born to that marriage on May 28, 1972. Steurer and the insured were divorced in 1975, with Steurer retaining custody of Jason. In October 1978, Steurer married Joseph Steurer, who, in 1982, adopted Jason. Jason\u2019s last name was changed to Steurer. Jason\u2019s birth certificate was amended to list Joseph Steurer as his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">At her hearing before the AU, Steurer, who was represented by counsel, testified that she alone was responsible for Jason\u2019s care and custody since his birth. She stated that at the time she divorced the insured, he \u201chad a heavy drug history\u201d but could not be sure whether disability from drugs or alcohol contributed to his death. According to Steurer, the insured \u2014 during the eight years following their divorce and prior to his death \u2014 sent \u201chardly anything\u201d in terms of support, except birthday money for Jason in 1977 and \u201cpart of a plane ticket\u201d at some point unspecified in time. Ultimately, Steurer admitted that Jason did not, in fact, depend upon the insured for his support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">Pursuant to Steurer\u2019s counsel\u2019s request, the AU left the record open to allow Mrs. Steurer the opportunity to specifically address the question of whether the insured was disabled by his alleged drug habit and, as a result of that disability, was incapable of supporting Jason. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d)(l)(C)(iii). Nothing in the record indicates that Steurer submitted any further evidence on this issue. In his decision, the AU stated that \u201cthere is no evidence to suggest that the insured * * * had a period of disability at any time * * Additionally, the AU found that the insured did not live with Jason or support Jason at any time prior to or including the time of death. In light of these findings, the AU concluded that Jason did not meet the dependency requirements of the Act and, therefore, neither he nor his mother was eligible to receive benefits based on the insured\u2019s earnings record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-6\">The district court, based on the Magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation, affirmed the AU\u2019s decision. After reviewing the record, the court found that Jason was the insured\u2019s natural child and that at no point in time did he meet the dependency criteria set out in the Act or in the Social Security regulations. Furthermore, the court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommended finding that Steurer \u201cpresented no medical or other competent evidence to substantiate that [the insured] was disabled even though her attorney acknowledged that such evidence was necessary and was given an opportunity to produce it after the hearing.\u201d Accordingly, the court held that substantial evidence supported the AU\u2019s decision and upheld the Secretary\u2019s denial of Steurer\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">On appeal, Steurer argues, apparently, that no substantial evidence existed to support the AU\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">In reviewing a denial of Social Security benefits, this court must determine whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Secretary\u2019s decision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982); <em>Bastian v. Schweiker, </em>712 F.2d 1278, 1280 (8th Cir. 1983). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Heckler, </em>744 F.2d 1333, 1337 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-10\">Social Security regulations state that a natural child of an insured deceased wage earner is presumed dependent <em>unless </em>that child was legally adopted by someone else during the insured\u2019s lifetime. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.361. Where a child is legally adopted by someone else during the insured\u2019s lifetime, however, the child will not be \u201cdeemed dependent on his natural parent [if] at the time of his death [the natural parent] was not living with or contributing to the support of the child.\u201d <em>Moretti v. Bowen, </em>806 F.2d 1238, 1239-40 (5th Cir. 1986); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.361.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-11\">Unquestionably, Jason is Bernard\u2019s (the insured\u2019s) natural child, and Bernard died fully insured. However, substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1251\">*1251</page-number>evidence exists in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s determination that Jason did not meet the dependency requirements set out in the Act or the regulations interpreting the statute. By her own statements, Steurer admits that Jason received virtually no support from his natural father during the course of the insured\u2019s lifetime. Additionally, in the absence of any competent evidence on the question of the insured\u2019s alleged drug addiction, the ALJ reasonably concluded that Jason\u2019s natural father did not have any period of disability pertinent to Steurer\u2019s proceedings. Finally, in directing Steurer\u2019s attention to the lack of evidence concerning the insured\u2019s alleged drug problems and allowing her time to supplement the record, the AU fulfilled his duty to fully develop the record. <em>See, e.g., Thome v. Califano, </em>607 F.2d 218, 219-20 (8th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and the AU\u2019s decision dismissing Steurer\u2019s claims for mother\u2019s insurance benefits and child\u2019s insurance benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1345-19\">.
