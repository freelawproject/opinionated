Inman Oil Co., </em>774 F.2d 895 (8th Cir.1985), this court concluded that Conoco had breached a duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to Inman Oil under a Jobber Franchise Agreement. Conoco\u2019s breach of contract consisted of bidding directly against Inman Oil, its own distributor, to supply petroleum products to St. Joe Minerals Corporation (St. Joe), a pre-existing customer of Inman Oil. As stated in our previous decision, Conoco \u201cused its superior position as a supplier to out-price Inman Oil and appropriate the latter\u2019s oldest and largest customer, St. Joe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 908. We therefore remanded this case to the magistrate<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for a determination of Inman Oil\u2019s damages \u201cflowing from Conoco\u2019s 1980 and 1981 bids for the St. Joe contracts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">Conoco\u2019s 1980 bid resulted in a contract to supply 200,000 gallons of bulk hydraulic oil to St. Joe in 1981. Inman Oil estimated $0.24 per gallon as the profit it would have earned had its own bid been accepted for this contract. Because of labor problems, however, St. Joe actually purchased only 113,638 gallons under the 1981 contract. The magistrate therefore calculated Inman Oil\u2019s lost profits from the loss of the 1981 contract as $27,273.12, i.e., $0.24 per gallon for 113,638 gallons.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">Similarly, Conoco\u2019s 1981 bid resulted in a contract for the delivery in 1982 of 50,000 gallons of packaged lubricant products. Inman Oil\u2019s estimated lost profits for that contract were $0.28 per gallon, i.e., $14,000. Thus the magistrate awarded Inman Oil a total of $41,273.12 as the damages flowing from Conoco\u2019s 1980 and 1981 bids for the 1981 and 1982 St. Joe contracts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">Inman Oil asserts on appeal that it is entitled to an additional $0.12 per gallon for both the 1981 and 1982 contracts. This figure derives from the $0.12 per gallon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>paid by Conoco to its delivery agent for transporting the petroleum products to St. Joe. According to Inman Oil, Conoco in its dual capacity as supplier and distributor decided to absorb delivery costs so as to underbid Inman Oil for the St. Joe contracts. Therefore Inman Oil reasons that the delivery cost of $0.12 per gallon was in the nature of bid assistance or price support furnished by Conoco, as supplier, to the Conoco division which bid against In-man Oil at the distributor level in 1980 and 1981. Inman Oil asserts that had Conoco properly refrained from competing against Inman Oil for the St. Joe contracts, Conoco would or should have provided equivalent bid assistance to Inman Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We consider this reasoning highly speculative. As the magistrate concluded, Cono-co had no obligation to use Inman Oil as its delivery agent. Moreover, the nature of Conoco\u2019s breach was in bidding against In-man Oil. Thus the damage flowing from that breach is limited to Inman Oil\u2019s own lost profits and is otherwise unrelated to Conoco\u2019s decision to absorb delivery costs on the St. Joe contracts. The general contract language quoted in support of Inman Oil\u2019s argument that it was entitled to \u201cdistributor development\u201d assistance does not translate into the specific $0.12 per gallon price support or bid assistance which In-man Oil claims as additional damages for the lost St. Joe contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Inman Oil also contends that Conoco\u2019s successful bids for the 1981 and 1982 St. Joe contracts drove Inman Oil out of business. Inman Oil ceased operations in February 1982. On this issue the magistrate reviewed the evidence and concluded that long term financial ill health, poor management, market forces, and emotions experienced by Inman Oil\u2019s owner, Ronald Inman, precipitated Mr. Inman\u2019s decision to close the company. These findings are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment of the magistrate is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\">. The Honorable David D.
