Petitioners principally argue that insofar as FDIC regulations allow nonmember insured banks to have subsidiary or affiliate relationships with firms engaged in securities work, those regulations violate the command of \u00a7 21 of the Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall Act), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378 (1982), that securities firms shall not engage in receiving deposits \u201cto any extent whatever.\u201d We cannot agree. The clear language of the Glass-Steagall Act demonstrates that Congress intended to differentiate between the activities of banks and the activities of banks\u2019 subsidiaries and affiliates. As we see no provision in the Act, including \u00a7 21, that prohibits subsidiaries or affiliates of nonmember insured banks from engaging in securities work, and because we find unmeritorious petitioners\u2019 arguments under \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1816, 1818 (1982), we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the defendants, <em>see ICI v. FDIC, </em>606 F.Supp. 683 (D.D.C.1985), and dismiss the petition for review of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-8\">Federal regulation effectively divides the United States commercial banking community into three major categories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Banks that choose to become members of the Federal Reserve System fall under the jurisdiction of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 221, 248 (1982). National banks come within the jurisdiction of the Comptroller of the Currency. <em>See id. </em>Finally, insured state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System operate under the watchful eye of the FDIC. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1811, 1815. Although the FDIC insures the deposits of all three categories, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1811, it regulates directly only the third group. <em>See generally id. </em>\u00a7 1815. The Glass-Steagall Act seeks to draw a sharp line between the activities of these three categories of commercial banks and the activities of investment banks and other securities firms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 24, 78, 377, 378; <em>Board of Governors v. Investment Company Institute, </em>450 U.S. 46, 63, 101 S.Ct. 973, 985, 67 L.Ed.2d 36 (1981) <em>(\u201cBoard of Governors </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-12\">This case explores the periphery of the separation of the banking and securities industries mandated by the Glass-Steagall Act. As the condition and character of the two industries have shifted over the past fifty years, the separation policy has shifted as well. Its changing shape has promoted particularly significant and protracted litigation in recent years, <em>see, e.g., Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors, </em>468 U.S. 137, 104 S.Ct. 2979, 82 L.Ed.2d 107 (1984) <em>(\u201cBecker </em>\u201d) (commercial paper is a security under the Glass-Steagall Act); <em>Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors, </em>468 U.S. 207, 104 S.Ct. 3003, 82 L.Ed.2d 158 (1984) <em>(\u201cSchwab \u201d) </em>(Board may allow bank holding company to acquire affiliate engaged in securities brokerage); <em>Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors, </em>807 F.2d 1052, 1058 (D.C.Cir. 1986) (Board may allow banks to sell third-party commercial paper), and has prompted this court to call upon Congress to clarify its precise contours. <em>American Bankers Ass\u2019n v. SEC, </em>804 F.2d 739, 755-56 (D.C. Cir.1986) (SEC has no authority to regulate securities activities of banks).</p>\n<p id=\"b1638-13\">The specific issue presented here is the extent to which Congress intended to bar subsidiaries and affiliates of insured nonmember banks from engaging in the securi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1543\">*1543</page-number>ties business. In September 1982 the FDIC published in the Federal Register a policy statement that found the Glass-Stea-gall Act \u201cdoes not prohibit an insured nonmember bank from establishing an affiliate relationship with or organizing or acquiring a subsidiary corporation that engages in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities.\u201d 49 Fed. Reg. 46709 (Nov. 28, 1984). <em>See </em>47 Fed. Reg. 38984 (Sept. 3, 1982). The FDIC did note, however, that the securities activities of such affiliates or subsidiaries might raise questions of \u201cunsafe or unsound banking practices\u201d and practices not \u201cconsistent with the purposes of\u201d deposit insurance under \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the Federal Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1816, 1818 (1982). <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1639-4\">In November 1984, after notice and comment proceedings, the FDIC adopted a final rule regulating the securities activities of affiliates and subsidiaries of insured nonmember banks under \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the FDIA. 49 Fed.Reg. 46709 (Nov. 28, 1984), regulations <em>codified at </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.4 (1986). Although the rule does not prohibit such securities activities outright, it does restrict that activity in a number of ways. Banks may only maintain \u201cbona fide\u201d subsidiaries that engage in securities work. The rule defines \u201cbona fide subsidiary\u201d so as to limit the extent to which banks and their securities affiliates and subsidiaries may share company names or logos, as well as places of business. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.4(a)(2)(ii), (iii); 49 Fed.Reg. at 46710. The definition also requires banks and subsidiaries to maintain separate accounting records and to observe separate corporate formalities. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.-4(a)(2)(iv), (v). The two entities cannot share officers, and must conduct business pursuant to independent policies and procedures, including the maintenance of separate employees and payrolls. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 337.-4(a)(2)(vi), (vii), (viii); 49 Fed.Reg. at 46711-12. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the rule requires a subsidiary to be \u201cadequately capitalized.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.-4(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-7\">Petitioners Investment Company Institute and Securities Industry Association, representing mutual fund companies and investment bankers, simultaneously filed a petition for review in this court and an action to enjoin the regulation in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. They argue that the rule violates \u00a7 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378 (1982), and \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1816, 1818 (1982). We stayed our proceedings until the District Court had ruled on the matter. Order of February 19, 1985. District Judge Gesell, on cross-motions for summary judgment, upheld the FDIC\u2019s regulations and dismissed the ICI and SIA action. <em>ICI v. FDIC, </em>606 F.Supp. 683 (D.D.C.1985). We consider now both the appeal from that judgment (No. 85-5769), and the original petition for review of the FDIC rule (No. 84-1616).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-8\">II. Petitioners\u2019 Standing Under the</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-9\">Glass-Steagall Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-10\">Before we address the merits of petitioners\u2019 challenge, we must examine the standing of securities industry plaintiffs to challenge the FDIC rule at issue. At the outset, we note that petitioners have shown sufficient \u201cinjury in fact\u201d from these regulations for standing purposes. The FDIC will deal petitioners competitive injury by allowing insured nonmember banks to enter the securities field indirectly through subsidiaries and affiliates. <em>See, e.g., Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co., </em>390 U.S. 1, 6, 88 S.Ct. 651, 654, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1967); <em>Chicago Junction Case, </em>264 U.S. 258, 44 S.Ct. 317, 68 L.Ed.2d 667 (1924); <em>see also ICI v. FDIC, </em>606 F.Supp. at 684 (FDIC regulation \u201cplainly threatens\u201d economic injury to securities firms).</p>\n<p id=\"b1639-11\">But the standing inquiry, of course, does not end with \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1544\">*1544</page-number>petitive injury alone does not confer standing. <em>Hardin, </em>390 U.S. at 5-6, 88 S.Ct. at 654-55. Once we find such injury, we must turn to the \u201cprudential\u201d or \u201czone of interests\u201d standing test enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Association of Data Processing Services v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 153, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). If the interest the petitioner seeks to protect is \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question,\u201d petitioner has standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-4\">The Supreme Court recently clarified the meaning of the \u201czone of interests\u201d standing test in its opinion in <em>Clarke v. Securities Industry Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987). In that case securities industry plaintiffs challenged a decision of the Comptroller of the Currency that national bank discount brokering services are not \u201cbranch services\u201d for purposes of the McFadden Act. 107 S.Ct. at 754. The McFadden Act places stringent limits on interstate branch banking activities, <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 36(c) &amp; (f), 81 (1982), and plaintiffs feared that the Comptroller\u2019s relatively narrow interpretation of the range of services the Act covers would expose the securities industry to competitive injury. <em>Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-6\">The Court rejected the Comptroller\u2019s argument that SIA lacked standing because Congress had not intended the McFadden Act to protect the competitive position of the securities industry. <em>Id. </em>at 759. The zone of interests test, stated the Court, \u201cdenies a right of review if the plaintiff\u2019s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 757. The Court found that the security industry\u2019s competitive interest bore a \u201cplausible relationship\u201d to the interests Congress sought to protect, <em>id. </em>at 759,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that in any event there were \u201cno indications * * * that make \u2018fairly discernible\u2019 a congressional intent to preclude review * * <em>Id., quoting Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>467 U.S. 340, 347, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 2454, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984). Notably, the Court overturned this court\u2019s decision in <em>Control Data Corp. v. Baldrige, </em>655 F.2d 283 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 881, 102 S.Ct. 363, 70 L.Ed.2d 190 (1981), and instructed the lower courts to consider \u201call indicators helpful in discerning\u201d the interests and parties Congress intended to protect. <em>Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 757-58 &amp; n. 15.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1640-9\">With these guiding standards firmly in mind, we turn to petitioners\u2019 standing in this suit under \u00a7 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act and \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-10\">A. <em>The Glass-Steagall Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1640-11\">In <em>Investment Company Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 620-21, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 1093-94, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971), the Supreme Court held that securities industry groups had standing to challenge regulations promulgated under the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed national banks to enter the securities field. The Court concluded that in \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21 of the Act Congress \u201carguably\u201d had legislated against the competition ICI sought to prevent. 401 U.S. at 620, 91 S.Ct. at 1093. We find that <em>Camp </em>controls our Glass-Steagall standing analysis in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1640-12\">The FDIC attempts to distinguish <em>Camp </em>by pointing out that ICI\u2019s challenge here rests on \u00a7 21 alone. Section 21 is a criminal provision, notes FDIC, and thus seeks to protect the <em>public interest, </em>not the interests of securities firms. Implicitly, FDIC</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1545\">*1545</page-number>argues that the <em>Camp </em>Court actually rested its standing determination on \u00a7 16, not \u00a7 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-6\">Although the FDIC\u2019s point on the criminal focus of \u00a7 21 is well taken, it does not adequately demonstrate that the present case is different from the situation in <em>Camp. </em>First of all, nothing in the <em>Camp </em>decision indicates that the Supreme Court meant to distinguish between \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 21 for standing purposes. 401 U.S. at 620, 91 S.Ct. at 1093. In fact, the Court\u2019s short standing discussion speaks of the two provisions in the same breath, and fails to draw any distinction whatever between them. <em>Id. </em>Second, even though \u00a7 21 does contain a criminal penalty element, FDIC\u2019s authority to interpret that section stems from purely civil enforcement powers. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1818 (1982). Section 21 has repeatedly and consistently received \u201ccivil\u201d regulatory interpretation. <em>See, e.g., Becker, </em>468 U.S. at 139, 104 S.Ct. at 2981; <em>Board of Governors, </em>450 U.S. at 62, 101 S.Ct. at 984. After all, the <em>Camp </em>case itself was purely civil in nature. 401 U.S. at 617-18, 639, 91 S.Ct. at 1091-92, 1103. In fact, petitioners assert, without contradiction by respondents, that no criminal action has <em>ever </em>been brought under the section. Supplemental Brief for Appellants/Petitioners at 11 n. **.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-7\">Moreover, it is well established that courts applying the prudential standing test may look for the requisite protective intent on the part of Congress not only in the specific statutory provision at issue but also in other provisions of a statute. <em>See Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 758; <em>Tax Analysts &amp; Advocates v. Blumenthal, </em>566 F.2d 130, 141 (D.C.Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1280, 55 L.Ed.2d 791 (1978); <em>see also Autolog Corp. v. Regan, </em>731 F.2d 25, 30 n. 3 (D.C.Cir.1984). As the Supreme Court has specifically indicated that \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 21 seek to \u201cdraw the same line,\u201d <em>Becker, </em>468 U.S. at 149, 104 S.Ct. at 2985, we appropriately look to \u00a7 16 to help inform our standing decisions under \u00a7 21. <em>Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 757-58. In so doing, our analysis falls squarely within the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Camp </em>holding that ICI has standing under \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 21 to challenge regulations allowing banks to enter the securities field. As a consequence, <em>Camp </em>controls. Petitioners\u2019 standing under \u00a7 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act to challenge these regulations is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-9\">B. <em>The Federal Deposit Insurance Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1641-10\">Sections 2[6] and 2[8] of the FDIA speak in broad terms, forbidding bank practices that are not \u201cconsistent with the purposes\u201d of federal deposit insurance or that are \u201cunsafe and unsound.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1816, 1818 (1982). Petitioners argue that it is clear from the breadth of this language that Congress has legislated against the very activities that petitioners allege have caused them injury. <em>See Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 756, 759 <em>(quoting Investment Company Institute v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. at 620, 91 S.Ct. at 1093).</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-11\">Congress enacted the FDIA as part of the Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 162, for purposes of providing for \u201cthe safer use of the assets of banks, to regulate interbank control, to prevent the undue diversion of funds into speculative operations, and for other purposes * * H.R.Rep. No. 150, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (May 19, 1933). Although Congress did not expressly indicate a desire to protect the competitive position of the securities industry, we cannot say that the industry\u2019s interests in limiting bank activities in the securities field are \u201cso marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u201d <em>Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 757. As a consequence, we find that petitioners have standing under the FDIA to challenge the regulations at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1641-12\">The facts of the <em>Clarke </em>case bolster this conclusion. In <em>Clarke </em>a securities industry plaintiff asserted standing on the basis of competitive injury under the McFadden Act. 107 S.Ct. at 754. The language of that Act does not expressly protect the competitive position of the securities industry, and neither is any such intent on the part of Congress discernible from the legislative history. <em>See Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Comptroller of the Currency, </em>765 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1546\">*1546</page-number>F.2d 1196, 1197 (D.C.Cir.1985) <em>{en ba\u00f1e) {per curiam) </em>(Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing <em>en banc) </em>(dissent from Court of Appeals decision upheld in <em>Clarke </em>argues that Congress no more meant the McFadden Act to protect the securities industry\u2019s competitive position than it meant the Act to protect the position of \u201cbusinesses competing for the parking spaces that an unlawful branch may occupy\u201d). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court found that securities industry competitors were \u201cvery reasonable candidates\u201d to seek review of the agency\u2019s ruling in that case. We see no basis for distinguishing the situation in <em>Clarke </em>for standing purposes from that confronting us in the present case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1642-4\">Finally, we find no indication \u201cfairly discernible in the statutory scheme\u201d of congressional intent to preclude judicial challenges by this particular class of petitioners. <em>Clarke, </em>107 S.Ct. at 757. This case does not, for example, present a situation in which permitting suits by plaintiffs otherwise within the zone of interest would \u201cseverely disrupt [a] complex and delicate administrative scheme.\u201d <em>Id. (quoting Community Nutrition Institute, </em>467 U.S. at 348, 104 S.Ct. at 2455).</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-5\">III. The Glass-Steagall Act Challenge</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-6\">Petitioners present a straightforward statutory argument. Section 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act makes it illegal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1642-7\">For any person, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization, engaged in the business of issuing, underwriting, selling, or distributing, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, or other securities, to engage at the same time to any extent whatever in the business of receiving deposits * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1642-8\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378(a)(1). Petitioners interpret the phrase \u201cto any extent whatever\u201d to bar insured nonmember banks from having subsidiaries or affiliates engaged in the securities business. FDIC responds that when Congress intended to bar subsidiary or affiliate relationships of this sort it clearly indicated that intent, and that in any event the court should defer to its reasonable interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1642-12\">In weighing these competing interpretations of \u00a7 21 and the Glass-Steagall Act, we are bound by a venerable line of precedent counseling judicial deference toward an agency\u2019s evaluations of the statutes that give it legal life and authority. <em>See, e.g., NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., </em>322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 860, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, </em>395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). That line of cases recently culminated in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), which established a simple two-part test, now familiar. If Congress has spoken clearly to the issue presented in a case, that intent controls. 467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. If the agency\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the clear intent of Congress, the agency\u2019s interpretation is invalid. If, on the other hand, Congress had no clear intent as to the particular question at issue, the courts may invalidate the agency\u2019s interpretation only if it is \u201cunreasonable\u201d or \u201cimpermissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we find in the present case that Congress clearly intended \u00a7 21 to allow insured nonmember banks to maintain subsidiary or affiliate relationships with securities firms, we uphold FDIC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 21 and affirm the District Court. Given this clear intent, we need not reach Chevron\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d prong of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1547\">*1547</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-6\">Congress enacted the Glass-Steagall Act in response to the dramatic wave of bank failures of the early Depression, a wave that many perceived to have been the result of securities speculation by the banking industry. <em>See Board of Governors, </em>450 U.S. at 61 &amp; n. 28, 101 S.Ct. at 984 &amp; n. 28; <em>Camp, </em>401 U.S. at 629-30. The Act seeks to separate the banking and securities industries \u201cas completely as possible.\u201d <em>Board of Governors, </em>450 U.S. at 70, 101 S.Ct. at 989. But while Congress may have intended to build an insurmountable barrier between member banks of the Federal Reserve System and the securities industry, <em>see </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 24, 78, 377 (1982), Congress was far from certain in 1933 that it had authority to effect such a sweeping separation for insured state nonmember banks. In fact, several members of Congress nervously commented during the debate leading to enactment of the bill that Congress might lack power to regulate nonmember banks at all. <em>See </em>75 Cong.Rec. 9905 (May 10, 1932) (remarks of Sen. Wal-cott); <em>id. </em>at 9911, 9913-14 (remarks of Sen. Bulkley).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-7\">The hesitation of the 73rd Congress to regulate state nonmember banks is quite apparent in the actual language of the Act. National banks and banks that have chosen to become members of the Federal Reserve System are subject to stringent regulation that bars them from the securities field. Section 16 severely limits the ability of <em>national </em>banks to deal in securities and bars them from underwriting securities. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (1982); <em>see also Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors, </em>807 F.2d 1052 (D.C.Cir.1986). Section 20 bars firms \u201cprincipally\u201d engaged in securities transactions from affiliating with <em>member </em>banks. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 377 (1982). Section 32 bars <em>member </em>banks from sharing officers or board members with securities firms. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-8\">Only \u00a7 21 regulates both <em>member </em>and <em>nonmember </em>banks. Section 21 bars <em>any </em>\u201cperson, firm, corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization\u201d from engaging in securities business while receiving deposits \u201cto any extent whatever.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 378 (1982). It says nothing explicitly about the propriety of insured nonmember banks establishing subsidiaries or affiliates that engage in the securities business. Petitioners suggest, nevertheless, that Congress intended that the section prohibit such relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-10\">This argument is difficult to support. If we read \u00a7 21 to prohibit insured nonmember banks from establishing securities subsidiaries or affiliates, the coherence of the statute as a whole begins to crumble. Section 21 applies to both member and nonmember banks. If it prohibits all bank affiliate or subsidiary relationships with securities firms, then \u00a7 20\u2019s somewhat permissive language, which allows <em>member </em>banks to establish affiliate relationships with firms doing some limited amount of securities work, becomes meaningless. Accepting petitioners\u2019 interpretation, therefore, would require us to eliminate a provision of the statute, a clear violation of a fundamental canon of construction. <em>See National Insulation Transportation Committee v. ICC, </em>683 F.2d 533, 537 (D.C. Cir.1982); <em>In re Surface Mining Regulation Litigation, </em>627 F.2d 1346, 1362 (D.C. Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-11\">Petitioners play down this difficulty by arguing that \u00a7 20 constitutes a special exception for member banks to the general prohibition set out by \u00a7 21. Petitioners submit that although banks generally cannot maintain affiliate or subsidiary relationships with securities firms \u201cto any extent whatever,\u201d \u00a7 20 specifically authorizes <em>member </em>banks to maintain such relationships with firms not \u201cprincipally\u201d engaged in securities work. <em>Nonmember </em>banks, however, cannot maintain such relationships. This explanation suffers from two readily apparent flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b1643-12\">First of all, Congress knew how to indicate that a section of the Act was intended as a specific exception to another section. Congress amended \u00a7 21 in 1935 to include language that expressly indicated that ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1548\">*1548</page-number>tivities implicitly authorized under \u00a7 16 of the Act were not barred by \u00a7 21\u2019s broad language. Act of August 23, 1935, c. 614, \u00a7 303, 49 Stat. 707; <em>see also Securities Industry Ass\u2019n v. Board of Governors, </em>807 F.2d 1052, 1056 (D.C.Cir.1986) (discussing interplay of \u00a7\u00a7 16 and 21). Congress has not done the same for \u00a7 20, and we see no basis whatever for inferring such intent. On the contrary, \u00a7 20 speaks in the language of prohibition, not authorization. Member banks \u201cshall not be affiliated in any manner * * * with any corporation, association, business trust, or other similar organization engaged principally\u201d in securities activities. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 377 (1982). Congress presumably did not indicate that \u00a7 20 should be an \u201cexception\u201d to \u00a7 21 because it did not intend that \u00a7 21 should extend to the activities of affiliates and subsidiaries in the first place. The two sections regulate separate activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-4\">Second, if we were to accept petitioners\u2019 argument that \u00a7 20 exempts member banks from the full prohibitory force of a \u00a7 21 that applies to both banks and their affiliates, we would be left with an anomalous result. Under petitioners\u2019 interpretation, <em>member </em>banks would be subject to <em>less </em>stringent \u00a7 21 regulation than would be insured <em>nonmember </em>banks. This outcome is dramatically counter to what we would expect on examination of the statute and its history. It seems clear that Congress felt its efforts to regulate nonmember banks rested on shaky, if not ramshackle, authority. Members of Congress explicitly discussed this problem as it pertained to regulation of nonmember bank affiliates, and specifically indicated that regulation of such affiliates was probably beyond the power of Congress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That Congress would have imposed more demanding regulation on nonmember banks than on member banks, given this uncertainty, seems utterly improbable. Absent clear evidence, we will not infer that Congress had such contrary, even irrational, intentions for the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-11\">Despite petitioners\u2019 considerable efforts, then, the language and structure of the Glass-Steagall Act do not support the view that \u00a7 21 bars insured nonmember banks from maintaining affiliate or subsidiary relationships with securities firms. Section 21 on its face fails to prohibit such relationships, and any judicial inference of such a prohibition would be inconsistent with the overall structure of the Act. This reasoning standing on its own demonstrates not only that FDIC\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 21 is \u201cpermissible\u201d but, in fact, that it is the only valid approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b1644-12\">Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance on the proper scope of \u00a7 21 supports the agency\u2019s interpretation. In <em>Board of Governors v. Investment Company Institute, </em>450 U.S. 46, 101 S.Ct. 973, 67 L.Ed.2d 36 (1981), the Supreme Court addressed the argument that \u00a7 21 applies to bank holding companies as well as to banks, and that as a consequence it bars bank holding compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1549\">*1549</page-number>ny subsidiaries from engaging in securities work. The Court found that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 21 cannot be read to include within its prohibition separate organizations related by ownership with a bank, which does receive deposits.\u201d 450 U.S. at 58 n. 24, 101 S.Ct. at 982 n. 24. As if this statement were not clear enough, the Court went on to emphasize that because \u00a7 20 specifically addressed the proper relationship between member banks and securities affiliates, \u201cthe structure of the Act reveals a congressional intent to treat banks separately from their affiliates. The reading of the Act urged by respondent [arguing for \u2018single entity\u2019 treatment of banks and their affiliates under \u00a7 21] would render \u00a7 20 meaningless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And to lay the question to rest once and for all, the Court stated that under Glass-Steagall \u201cbank affiliates may be authorized to engage in certain activities that are prohibited to banks themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 101 S.Ct. at 983. In light of our reasoning above, this language clearly guides the proper holding on the issue presented in this case. The agency\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 21 is entirely consistent with Congress\u2019 intent, and must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-6\">Petitioners put forward no direct response to the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Board of Governors. </em>Instead, they argue that the FDIC\u2019s rule is at odds with \u201cthe legislative purpose underlying Section 21.\u201d Brief for Appellants/Petitioners at 21. This is not a legislative history argument aimed at proving that the express terms of \u00a7 21 actually do bar nonmember bank activities of the sort the petitioners challenge. Rather, petitioners\u2019 argument merely adverts to the general policy objectives of the Glass-Steagall Act and attempts to demonstrate that those policies are thwarted, or at least are not furthered, by the FDIC rule at issue here. <em>Id. </em>at 27-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-7\">Petitioners\u2019 policy arguments can carry but little weight in a judicial forum. Our duty as a court is to interpret the banking laws, not to set national banking policy on the basis of general objectives set out by Congress. <em>See, e.g., American Bankers Ass\u2019n, </em>804 F.2d at 749. Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that Congress\u2019 intent in this provision is unclear. Even if they had, and if every policy objection they raise were irrefutable, we could not overturn FDIC\u2019s regulation unless the face of the statute and its legislative history demonstrated that FDIC\u2019s interpretation was \u201cimpermissible\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2782. Petitioners\u2019 \u201clegislative purpose\u201d arguments do not take this approach, however. They focus on policy alone. As the Supreme Court recently stated, \u201cWhen a challenge to an agency construction, fairly conceptualized, really centers on the wisdom of the agency\u2019s policy, rather than whether it is a reasonable choice within a gap left by Congress, the challenge must fail.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 866, 104 S.Ct. at 2793. It is not our place to implement congressional policy in ways Congress itself fails to pursue. <em>Board of Governors v. Dimension Financial Corp., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 681, 688-89, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986); <em>TVA v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 194-95, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2301-02, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978). Congressional intent for \u00a7 21 is clear, and FDIC\u2019s interpretation is in line with that intent. We need go no further to uphold FDIC\u2019s view of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-11\">IV. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b1645-12\">Petitioners also argue that the rule violates the \u201cunsafe and unsound banking practices\u201d provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1818(a) &amp; (b), 1816 (1982) (powers of state chartered banks must be \u201cconsistent with the purposes of\u201d federal deposit insurance). Quoting the Fifth Circuit, petitioners assert that the FDIC rule here presents an \u201cabnormal risk of loss or damage to an institution, its shareholders, or the agencies administering the insurance funds.\u201d Brief for Appellants/Petitioners at 33-34, <em>quoting Gulf Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Federal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1550\">*1550</page-number><em>Home Loan Bank Board, </em>651 F.2d 259, 264 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-4\">The FDIC itself, of course, has recognized that bank subsidiaries and affiliates engaged in securities activities pose dangers under these two sections. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. at 46709. In fact, the rule promulgated by the FDIC undertakes to ensure that the harms Congress sought to prevent with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act do not become real. Petitioners\u2019 argument, then, is not that the rule is inconsistent with these sections of the FDIA, but rather that the rule does not go far enough, as it fails to find affiliate or subsidiary relationships of this kind <em>per se </em>\u201cunsafe and unsound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-5\">The failure of this challenge on its merits is unquestionable. Petitioners\u2019 FDIA arguments rest, in the first instance, on the assumption that the FDIC rule is invalid under \u00a7 21. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellants/Petitioners at 34. As we have found above that the rule is entirely consistent with \u00a7 21, this element of petitioners\u2019 argument collapses of its own weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-6\">But even if we read the FDIA challenge to include an <em>independent </em>attack on the FDIC rule, it does not persuade us to invalidate that rule. Petitioners have not demonstrated that when Congress used the broad language \u201cunsafe and unsound bank-. ing practices\u201d it intended a specific result on the issue presented here. And for good reason. Congress intended to delegate a substantial degree of authority to the agency by the use of this language. <em>See Investment Company Institute v. FDIC, </em>728 F.2d 518 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Independent Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Heimann, </em>613 F.2d 1164, 1169 (D.C.Cir.1979). Authority to determine what constitutes an \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cunsound\u201d banking practice is firmly committed to the agency. <em>See, e.g., First National Bank of Lamarque v. Smith, </em>610 F.2d 1258, 1265 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-7\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Chevron </em>analysis, if the intent of Congress on a particular issue is not clear, the courts may only overturn the agency\u2019s view of that issue if it is \u201cimpermissible\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. Petitioners have given us no rationale that demonstrates the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of FDIC\u2019s decision to impose stringent regulations on insured nonmember banks\u2019 affiliate and subsidiary relationships with securities firms, in lieu of pursuing an outright ban on such relationships. As the regulation adopted by the FDIC represents precisely the sort of expert decision Congress committed to that agency, <em>see Investment Company Institute v. FDIC, </em>728 F.2d at 523, petitioners\u2019 mere assertion that it is inconsistent with the underlying policies of the FDIA simply cannot carry the day. We find that the agency\u2019s rule is consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] of the FDIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-9\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-10\">Petitioners have standing to challenge these FDIC regulations under the Glass-Steagall Act and the FDIA. As the FDIC has demonstrated, however, that its rule is consistent with the clear intent of Congress in the Glass-Steagall Act, and because we find FDIC\u2019s construction of the broad language of FDIA \u00a7\u00a7 2[6] and 2[8] to be reasonable, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in No. 85-5769, and dismiss the petition for review in No. 84-1616.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1638-9\">.
