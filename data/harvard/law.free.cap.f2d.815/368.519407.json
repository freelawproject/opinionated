WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b486-24\">Appellant Clyde Williamson appeals the dismissal of his claims against the Department of Agriculture and several federal government officials for deprivation of property without due process of law, tor-tious interference with contract, and misrepresentation. The district court had granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Williamson\u2019s appeal exposes the tension between the need to protect government officials from the misplaced wrath of citizens disappointed by the actions of the officials, and the need to protect those citizens whose disappointment is alleged to be a constitutional injury. We resolve that tension in this case in favor of the government and its officials, and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing Williamson\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Appellant Clyde Williamson was a farmer in Adams County, Mississippi. Beginning in April, 1978, appellant applied for and received eleven loans from the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) totalling $963,110.00. As of September 20, 1985, appellant owed FmHA $616,851.26, with interest accruing on his account at a daily rate of $122.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On March 8, 1981, appellee Joe Dockins was appointed FmHA County Supervisor in Adams County. At his first meeting with appellant, appellant told him he had sold his 1980 soybean crop and had used the proceeds to pay advance rent for 1981 on his farm. Dockins pointed out to appellant that those proceeds had been pledged to FmHA to repay his 1980 crop loans, and that appellant had been entitled to pay only his 1980 rent out of the proceeds before paying FmHA. Finally, according to appellant, Dockins said that he intended to run appellant out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Appellant\u2019s 1980 soybean crop had been sold to Concordia Grain Co. in Yidalia, Louisiana, under the name of appellant\u2019s wife, Donna Williamson. Her name did not appear on Concordia\u2019s list of FmHA financed farmers, although the name \u201cClyde Williamson\u201d and the name of his company, \u201cTriangle 44 Farms,\u201d did appear on the list. Dockins subsequently asked Concordia to repay the proceeds of the sale. Appellant asserts that, as a result, Dockins caused Concordia to pay to FmHA funds to which the agency was not entitled. These funds had been earmarked by appellant for repayment of loans he had received from First Natchez Bank in Natchez, Mississippi, for his 1981 crop. Appellant asserts that Dockins\u2019 actions caused him to default on his loan from First Natchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Appellant also alleges that Dockins \u201cmaneuvered\u201d him into selling Smithland Plantation at this time. Dockins testified that he simply had agreed to release an FmHA lien on the property to allow the sale to occur, and had offered appellant his opinion that the land was being sold at a good price. Appellant alleges that the sale of this property contributed to his subsequent ineligibility for FmHA loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">Because appellant had violated the covenants of his 1980 security agreement with FmHA, the FmHA Mississippi State Office informed Dockins on May 9, 1981, that appellant\u2019s 1981 loan application would not be processed. Four days later, Dockins and appellee Kent, FmHA District Director for Southwest Mississippi, recommended to the FmHA State Office that appellant receive his 1981 loans despite his technical ineligibility. We note that this recommendation came after, according to appellant, Dockins had told him that he was going to be run out of business. Appellant filed complaints concerning his ineligibility with FmHA, and with his congressman and senators. Subsequently, appellant\u2019s loans were approved, and he borrowed $301,-760.00 on June 23, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Because of this delay in his 1981 funding, and because Adams County was considered a disaster area for the 1980 crop year, appellant applied for a disaster loan from the Small Business Administration (SBA). Appellant claims, and appellees deny, that Dockins subsequently informed SBA that appellant \u201cdid not want\u201d the disaster loan for which he had been approved. It appears from a review of the record that appellant never received an SBA disaster loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">In late 1981, Dockins and appellant prepared an FmHA plan for use by appellant in applying for his 1982 loans. At this time, appellant signed over to FmHA a check for the proceeds of his 1981 crop. FmHA had a lien on those proceeds, obtained as security for the 1981 loans. Appellant claims that he signed over the check in reliance on Dockins\u2019 promise that he would receive his 1982 loans. Dockins denies having ever made such a promise. After preparing the plan, Dockins determined that appellant was not eligible for 1982 FmHA loans. Under the then-applicable agency guidelines, appellant\u2019s history of past production and expenses demonstrated a lack of repayment ability. Appellant requested and got a meeting with Doc-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>kins\u2019 supervisor, appellee Kent, who reached the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Subsequently, FmHA changed its guidelines for loan eligibility, removing various restrictions that had previously rendered appellant ineligible. After the change, appellant was tentatively approved for a 1982 loan in the amount of $225,000.00. Before the loan was to be closed on March 23, 1982, however, a lien search by FmHA revealed that Mississippi Federated Cooperative (MFC) had filed a judgment against appellant on March 22 for $60,000.00. Doc-kins and Kent testified that they had asked MFC to wait until appellant\u2019s loan was closed before it filed the judgment, but that MFC refused to cooperate. Once the lien was discovered, appellant was once again ineligible for his FmHA loan. Several months later, MFC still refused to subordinate its lien so as to allow FmHA to close its loan with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On April 2, 1982, one of appellant\u2019s landlords called Dockins to inquire about the status of appellant\u2019s 1982 loans, explaining that appellant owed her $32,000.00 rent. Dockins refused to release any information to the landlord, and had no other contact with her. Appellant claims that Dockins told the landlord that appellant would not be able to work the farm in question, at which point the landlord obtained an injunction keeping appellant off the farm. As a result, appellant claims, he was unable to recover his crops, seed, chemicals, fuels, and trucks that remained on the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In early 1983, appellant applied for FmHA loan assistance once again. On February 10, 1983, the Mississippi State Office turned down his application because he could not demonstrate sufficient cash flow. On February 23, the State Office decided to \u201caccelerate\u201d appellant\u2019s account because of the number of his loans which were past due. At that point, the full amount of all of appellant\u2019s FmHA loans became due and payable immediately. Appellant was given notice of his right to appeal the acceleration, and he did so. On August 15, 1983, a hearing officer upheld the State Director's decisions, whereupon appellant requested a review by the Deputy Administrator of FmHA in Washington. On October 26, 1983, the FmHA National Office found no basis for overturning the decisions of the State Office to deny appellant\u2019s 1983 loan request and to accelerate his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Appellant also claims that during the period described above, Dockins falsified crop yield reports to indicate that appellant\u2019s fields would yield more than they actually yielded. Further, appellant claims that Dockins accused him of failing to account for his crop insurance proceeds, when Doc-kins knew that those proceeds had been paid to First Natchez Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">On March 1, 1983, appellant filed a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. On May 17, 1983, FmHA filed a proof of claim in the Bankruptcy Court in the amount of $506,130.88 against Clyde Williamson, d/b/a Triangle 44 Farms. Appellant asserts that this proof of claim lists loans he never received and fails to credit his account for hundreds of thousands of dollars actually paid to FmHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Appellant subsequently filed suit on December 17, 1984, against appellees United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); FmHA; John Block, the Secretary of Agriculture; James Perry, Don Barrett, and John Author, individually and as past and present FmHA Mississippi State Directors; Dan Mattox, individually and as Assistant FmHA Mississippi State Director; Henry Magnum, individually and as Mississippi Chief of FmHA Programs; Wesley Kent, individually and as FmHA District Director for Southwest Mississippi; and Joe Doc-kins, individually and as Adams County FmHA Supervisor. Appellant claimed that these officials were amenable to suit under the Federal Torts Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80, and were liable for committing common-law torts against him: interfering with his contracts with third parties, misrepresenting to him and to others the probability of his receiving federal loans, and, generally, committing a series of negligent and intentional acts designed to force ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>pellant into bankruptcy. Further, appellant requested relief for violation of his constitutional rights, claiming that appel-lees had committed a series of constitutional torts by depriving him of his property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Appellant\u2019s suit was filed as an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court. Appellees filed a Petition for Retention of Jurisdiction with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi and obtained a stay of discovery pending resolution of that petition. On September 19, 1985, the district court rendered its decision to retain jurisdiction. On September 30, appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss, and on October 11, they obtained a second stay of discovery pending a ruling on that motion. On April 11, 1986, the district court, ruling on the Motion to Dismiss as a Rule 56 Motion for Summary Judgment, granted summary judgment for appellees on all appellant\u2019s claims. <em>Williamson v. United States Department of Agriculture, </em>635 F.Supp. 114 (S.D.Miss.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Appellant instituted this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In reviewing the summary judgment, we must consider the full record of the case to determine if \u201cthere is [any] genuine issue as to any material fact and [if] the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In doing so, of course, we \u201cmust view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party resisting the motion\u201d for summary judgment. <em>Simon v. United States, </em>711 F.2d 740, 743 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Appellant also claims reversible error in the failure of the district court to permit discovery in this case prior to its granting the motion for summary judgment. \u201cControl of discovery is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its discovery rulings will be reversed only where they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Mayo v. Tri-Bell Industries, Inc., </em>787 F.2d 1007, 1012 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Dukes v. South Carolina Ins. Co., </em>770 F.2d 545, 548-49 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Perel v. Vanderford, </em>547 F.2d 278, 280 (5th Cir. 1977). Yet if discovery could uncover one or more substantial fact issues, appellant was entitled to reasonable discovery to do so. <em>Trevino v. Celanese Corp., </em>701 F.2d 397, 405 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>707 F.2d 515 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Finally, appellant complains that the district court, in ruling on appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, considered affidavits that were inadmissible as evidence. Review of this alleged error is also limited to a search for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Air Crash Disaster Near New Orleans, La., on July 9, 1982, </em>764 F.2d 1084, 1090 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>770 F.2d 164 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Jon-T Chemicals v. Freeport Chemical Co., </em>704 F.2d 1412, 1417 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">III. <em>The Federal Tort Claims Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">The district court dismissed appellant\u2019s claims against the USDA, FmHA, and the individual appellees in their official capacities because each of those appellees were protected by sovereign immunity. We agree with the ruling of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">The doctrine of sovereign immunity is inherent in our constitutional structure and is in part enshrined by the Eleventh Amendment. It renders the United States, its departments, and its employees in their official capacities as agents of the United States immune from suit except as the United States has consented to be sued.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While it is \u201c[d]ecried as irrational and immoral by some, ... criticized on historical grounds by others, ... recognized by all to have little doctrinal coherence, the doctrine of sovereign immunity has nonetheless retained the endorsement of the two institutions that matter \u2014 the Supreme Court and Congress.\u201d <em>Interfirst Bank Dallas, N.A. v. United States, </em>769 F.2d 299, 303 (5th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 1458, 89 L.Ed.2d 716 (1986). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Supreme Court has held repeatedly that \u201c[t]he United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued ..., and the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court\u2019s jurisdiction to entertain the suit.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 1351, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980), <em>quoting United States v. Sherwood, </em>312 U.S. 584, 586, 61 S.Ct. 767, 769-70, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941). <em>See also Stanton v. United States, </em>434 F.2d 1273, 1275 (5th Cir.1970) (\u201cThus the district courts\u2019 jurisdiction over the United States depends entirely upon the terms of the congressional waiver of sovereign immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">One of the vehicles by which the United States has consented to be sued is the Federal Torts Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. The statute provides broadly that the United States will accept liability for common torts committed by its agents to the same extent and in the same manner as liability would attach to a private individual in similar circumstances. <em>United States v. Orleans, </em>425 U.S. 807, 813, 96 S.Ct. 1971, 1975, 48 L.Ed.2d 390, 297 (1976); <em>Thomas v. Calavar Corp., </em>679 F.2d 416, 418 (5th Cir.1982). The consent to be sued upon claims arising from \u201c \u2018the negligent or wrongful act or omission\u2019 by an officer or employee of the federal government acting within the scope of his employment,\u201d <em>Williamson, supra, </em>635 F.Supp. at 116, <em>citing </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672, is peppered with exceptions, however, which we are bound to apply rigorously. <em>Sherwood, supra, </em>312 U.S. at 590, 61 S.Ct. at 771, 85 L.Ed.2d at 1063; <em>Ware v. United States, </em>626 F.2d 1278, 1286 (5th Cir.1980). The district court held that appellant\u2019s claims were not covered by the FTCA\u2019s waiver because they fell into exceptions created by \u00a7\u00a7 2680(a) and (h), and also that appellant had failed to satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a). We address these findings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">(a) <em>\u00a7 2680(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">One of the limitations in the FTCA upon the waiver of sovereign immunity is found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a), which provides that sovereign immunity shall not be waived with respect to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government, exercising due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation, whether or not such statute or regulation be valid, or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The Supreme Court carefully examined the contours of this section of the FTCA in <em>Dalehite v. United States, </em>346 U.S. 15, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953), and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">the \u2018discretionary function or duty\u2019 that cannot form a basis for suit under the Tort Claims Act includes more than the initiation of programs and activities. It also includes determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans, specifications or schedules of operations. Where there is room for policy judgment and decision there is discretion. It necessarily follows that acts of subordinates in carrying out the operations of government in accordance with official directions cannot be actionable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">346 U.S. at 35-36, 73 S.Ct. at 968 (footnotes omitted). The scope of the exception was thus early interpreted so broadly that this Circuit was prompted to issue the following caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">[i]f the Torts Claims Act is to have the corpuscular vitality to cover anything more than automobile accidents in which government officials were driving, the federal courts must reject an absolutist interpretation of <em>Dalehite ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-13\"><em>Smith v. United States, </em>375 F.2d 243, 246 (5th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Thus the courts began the difficult task of divining the boundaries of governmental discretion. Some courts emphasized the relative simplicity of asking whether the government-defendant was acting in a planning or policy-making role, or in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>operational or policy-implementing role.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court focused more upon a broader inquiry into \u201cthe nature and quality of the discretion involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This broader inquiry was recently endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea Rio Grandense, </em>467 U.S. 797, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984). <em>Empresa </em>shed light on \u201cseveral factors useful in determining when the acts of a Government employee are protected from liability by \u00a7 2680(a).\u201d <em>Id., </em>467 U.S. at 813, 104 S.Ct. at 2764. The Court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adc\">it is the nature of the conduct, rather than the status of the actor, that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case____ Thus, the basic inquiry concerning the application of the discretionary function is whether the challenged acts of a Government employee \u2014 whatever his or her rank \u2014 are of the nature and quality that Congress intended to shield from tort liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Id.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In this case, the challenged acts of the various FmHA officials involve the granting, administration, and denial of various FmHA Operating Loans and FmHA Emergency Loans. These actions are unmistakably committed to the discretion of the Secretary of Agriculture by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, Pub.L. 87-128 (codified as amended at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1921-2000). The statute is replete with discretionary responsibilities. It grants the Secretary the power \u201cto make and insure\u201d Operating Loans to farmers that \u201chave either training or farming experience that the Secretary determines is sufficient to assure reasonable prospects of success in the proposed farming operations,\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1941(a), and the power \u201cto make and insure\u201d Emergency Loans to farmers that \u201chave experience and resources necessary to assure a reasonable prospect for successful operation with the assistance of such loan[s].\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">The Secretary is also given the authority to \u201ccompromise, adjust, or reduce claims, and adjust and modify the terms of mortgages, leases, contracts, and agreements entered into or administered by the Farmers Home Administration under any of its programs, as circumstances may re-quire____\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(d). There is also discretionary power to \u201crelease mortgage and other contract liens if it appears that ... their enforcement likely would be ineffectual or uneconomical.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981(f). The Secretary has further power to \u201cconsent to the transfer of property securing any loan or financed by any loan or grant made, insured, or held by the Secretary under this chapter ... upon such terms as he deems necessary to carry out the purpose of the loan or grant or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>protect the financial interest of the Government.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">There is ample judicial precedent that the granting and denying of Operating Loans and Emergency Loans by FmHA are acts that Congress intended to place behind the shield provided by the discretionary exception to the FTCA. In <em>Teupker v. Farmers Home Administration, </em>708 F.2d 1329, 1332 (8th Cir.1983), the Court held that FmHA\u2019s decision to deny Teupker\u2019s requests for additional emergency loans was \u201ca qualitative, subjective decision based on agency expertise within the bounds of the statutory directive ...\u201d As a result, the Court found that Teupker\u2019s FTCA claims were \u201cbarred under the Act\u2019s exception for discretionary actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333. In <em>Matzke v. Block, </em>564 F.Supp. 1157, 1166 (D.C.Kan.1983), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>732 F.2d 799 (10th Cir.1984), the district court found that \u201cthe administration of a farm loan program necessarily entails broad discretion in the application of objective and subjective factors to individual circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also, Lathan v. Block, </em>627 F.Supp. 397 (D.C.N.D.1986) (FmHA decisions as to the protection of FmHA interests in secured property constitute discretionary decisions under the FTCA).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">This discretion granted to the Secretary of Agriculture is properly delegated to and is exercised by other FmHA officials, including the County Supervisor and his superiors. Department of Agriculture regulations provide that the types of FmHA loan applications made by appellant shall be approved or denied in the first instance by the County Supervisor and the County Committee. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.4. Congress deemed that the relative experience and training of farmers and their prospects for economic success should be factors in determining loan eligibility. The Secretary of Agriculture, in turn, decreed that the County Committee and the County Supervisor \u201cwill determine eligibility.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.4(c). Unmistakably those officials are responsible for exercising the statutory discretion Congress gave to the Secretary. <em>See Poolman v. Nelson, </em>802 F.2d 304 (8th Cir.1986). We hold that all the appellees in this case had responsibility for the exercise of discretion within the meaning of \u00a7 2680(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">We agree with the district court that the \u201cdiscretionary function exemption affords the government a defense where there is room for policy judgment and decision making where, as here, loan eligibility, processing and servicing is involved.\u201d <em>Williamson, supra, </em>635 F.Supp. at 116. Appellant\u2019s claims regarding loans either made or denied him, asserted against the United States, its agencies, and the individual defendants in their official capacities, cannot be maintained under the FTCA and are therefore barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">(b) <em>\u00a7 2680(h)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">A second limitation to the FTCA\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity is found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(h), which provides that sovereign immunity shall not be waived with respect to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>[\u0430] ny claim arising out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The district court found that those claims against the United States, its agencies, and the individual defendants in their official capacities which were not already barred by \u00a7 2680(a) were barred by \u00a7 2680(h): interfering with appellant\u2019s contracts with his landlord; interfering with appellant\u2019s contracts with First Natchez Bank; misrepresenting the productive capabilities of his farm; misrepresenting the extent of FmHA interest in his property; and misrepresenting the probability of appellant\u2019s obtaining FmHA loans upon the disposition of various pieces of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">[\u0431] In <em>Kosak v. United States, </em>465 U.S. 848, 104 S.Ct. 1519, 79 L.Ed.2d 860 (1984), the Supreme Court noted that a court\u2019s task in applying \u00a7 2680(h) is \u201cto identify \u2018those circumstances which are within the words and reason of the exception\u2019 \u2014 no less and no more.\u201d 465 U.S. at 853, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. at 1523, n. 9 (citation omitted). The words and reason, in turn, of the misrepresentation exception within \u00a7 2680(h) were clarified in <em>Block v. Neal, </em>460 U.S. 289, 103 S.Ct. 1089, 75 L.Ed.2d 67 (1983). In <em>Neal, </em>the Court reaffirmed its earlier interpretation of \u00a7 2680(h) as relieving the government of tort liability for pecuniary injuries attributable to reliance on negligent or intentional<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> misstatements by the government. <em>Id., </em>460 U.S. at 296-97, 103 S.Ct. at 1093-94.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In other words, failure of the government to use due care in conveying information is not actionable under the misrepresentation exception. The Court held that \u00a7 2680(h) did not apply, however, when the government\u2019s failure to use due care constitutes a breach of a separate, independent duty.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Several courts have faced the task of drawing the distinction set out in <em>Neal.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The most in-depth analysis is found in <em>Metz v. United States, </em>788 F.2d 1528 (11th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 400, 93 L.Ed.2d 353 (1986). That case involved the termination of a federal employee undergoing psychiatric evaluation. The Eleventh Circuit reviewed whether the employee\u2019s claims for false light, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and intrusion into seclusion \u201carose out of\u201d torts listed in \u00a7 2680(h), as interpreted by <em>Neal.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARU\">a cause of action which is distinct from one of those excepted under \u00a7 2680(h) will nevertheless be deemed to \u201carise out of\u201d an excepted cause of action when the underlying governmental conduct which constitutes an excepted cause of action is \u201cessential\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">788 F.2d at 1534. Applying that standard, the <em>Metz </em>Court found all the plaintiff\u2019s claims barred by \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-16\">We also find that appellant\u2019s claims regarding acts of misrepresentation are barred by \u00a7 2680(h). Appellant points to no duty of the government or its agents to characterize the productive capacity of appellant\u2019s farmland apart from the duty to use due care in making such a character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ization. Regarding FmHA\u2019s alleged statement of its interest in appellant\u2019s soybean crops and its alleged promise to provide loans if he sold some land, appellant\u2019s claim for damages rests upon the allegations that these were misrepresentations, and they did not reflect the truth. No independent duty is even mentioned. Appellant makes no claims arising out of these facts that are not dependent upon an allegation that the government made misrepresentations and sovereign immunity has not been waived as to misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">As for the exception involving interference with contract rights, the words of and reasons for that exception under \u00a7 2680(h) are plain. <em>See, e.g., Art Metal-U.S.A., Inc. v. United States, </em>753 F.2d 1151 (D.C.Cir. 1985) (holding that claims of interference with prospective advantage are barred as claims for interference with contract rights); <em>Goodman Group, Inc. v. Dishroom, </em>679 F.2d 182 (9th Cir.1982) (barring claims for tortious interference with contract). Here, appellant asserts that appellees interfered with his contract to rent farmland from his landlord, and that appellees interfered with his loans obtained from First Natchez Bank, causing him to default on those loans. These claims fall within the plain meaning of the statutory exception and are barred by \u00a7 2680(h).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In conclusion, we hold that appellant\u2019s claims regarding misrepresentations and interference with contract rights, asserted against the United States, its agencies, and the individual defendants in their official capacities, cannot be maintained under the FTCA and are therefore barred by sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">(c) <em>\u00a7 2675(a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Even if appellant\u2019s claims were not barred by \u00a7\u00a7 2680(a) and (h), they would be barred for appellant\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies before asserting his claims in federal court. Since we find the claims barred substantively, we note this default by appellant only in passing. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States ... unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.\u201d The district court found that appellant had failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2675(a). <em>Williamson, supra, </em>635 F.Supp. at 116. No evidence counters this finding. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s FTCA claims against appellees also fail to satisfy that statute\u2019s procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">As to all FTCA claims, we find that they all involve discretionary acts, alleged misrepresentations, and alleged interference with contract rights, and that appellant also failed to satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirements of \u00a7 2675(a). We therefore affirm the summary judgment in favor of the United States, its agencies, and the individual defendants in their official capacities regarding all common-law torts alleged in appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">IV. <em>Individual Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXr\">Appellant\u2019s claims run against not only the United States and its officers in their capacities as agents of the United States, but also against those officers personally. Sovereign immunity does not shield the individual appellees in their individual, as opposed to their official, capacities. <em>White v. Franklin, </em>637 F.Supp. 601, 612 (N.D.Miss.1986); <em>Keese v. United States, </em>632 F.Supp. 85, 92 (S.D.Tex.1985). We look, therefore, to other considerations to resolve the tension between protecting government officials from suit and protecting the citizens they serve from tortious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>wrongs. The danger to effective government is that \u201cfear of being sued will \u2018dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most irresponsible [public officials], in the unflinching discharge of their duties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2736, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), <em>quoting Gregoire v. Biddle, </em>177 F.2d 579, 581 (2nd Cir.1949), <em>cert. denied, </em>339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363 (1950). The Supreme Court, therefore, has embraced the doctrines of absolute and qualified immunity for federal officials.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We have often reviewed and explained the intricacies of these immunity doctrines. We do not need to consider the scope of the narrower qualified immunity as it relates to the allegations of common law torts in this case. The FmHA officials were entitled to absolute immunity. When federal officials are charged with the commission of common-law torts, they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVz\">enjoy absolute immunity from ... liability for actions [taken] within the scope of their authority. <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959); <em>Claus v. Gyorkey, </em>674 F.2d 427 (5th Cir.1982). This absolute immunity does not hinge on a functional analysis as with constitutional torts. <em>See id. </em>at 431; <em>Evans v. Wright, </em>582 F.2d 20 (5th Cir.1978)____ All that is necessary is that \u201c \u2018the action of the federal official bear some reasonable relation to and connection with his duties and responsibilities ...,\u2019\u201d <em>Claus v. Gyorkey, </em>674 F.2d at 431, <em>quoting Scherer v. Brennan, </em>379 F.2d 609, 611 (7th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 1021, 88 S.Ct. 592, 19 L.Ed.2d 666, and that the action of the official is connected with a \u201cdiscretionary function.\u201d <em>Norton v. McShane, </em>332 F.2d 855 (5th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 981, 85 S.Ct. 1345, 14 L.Ed.2d 274 (1965). <em>Williams v. Collins, </em>728 F.2d 721, 727 (5th Cir.1984). <em>See also Lage v. Thomas, </em>585 F.Supp. 403 (N.D.Tex.1984); <em>OKC Corp. v. Williams, </em>489 F.Supp. 576 (N.D.Tex.), <em>aff'd </em>614 F.2d 58, <em>reh\u2019g denied </em>617 F.2d 1207, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 952,101 S.Ct. 357, 66 L.Ed.2d 216 (1980). Furthermore, allegations of malice on the part of the federal official are irrelevant for purposes of determining the availability of absolute immunity. <em>Barr v. Mateo, supra, </em>360 U.S. at 575, 79 S.Ct. at 1341; <em>Williams v. Collins, supra, </em>728 F.2d at 728.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">The absolute immunity doctrine has often been used to shield officials of FmHA from common-law tort liability. In <em>Poolman v. Nelson, </em>802 F.2d 304 (8th Cir.1986), the Court considered a suit by disgruntled FmHA loan applicants. The Poolmans had applied for an FmHA loan, and had made various agreements with third parties based on the promise of an FmHA County Supervisor that they would receive the loan. Their application was denied, however, and they sued. The Court reviewed the functions and duties of the FmHA County Supervisor, and concluded that the Supervisor\u2019s \u201cwide ranging authority ... over FmHA matters in the county or counties he supervises,\u201d 802 F.2d at 309, sufficed to place the conversations he held with the Poolmans \u201cwithin the outer perimeter of the official\u2019s line of duty.\u201d <em>Id. See also Carson v. Block, </em>790 F.2d 562 (7th Cir.) (holding that FmHA officials had absolute immunity in suit based on their refusal to defer loan repayments), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 107 S.Ct. 669, 93 L.Ed.2d 721 (1986); <em>Ortiz v. United States, </em>661 F.2d 826 (10th Cir.1981) (holding that FmHA officials had absolute immunity in a suit for misrepresentation and for negligent supervision of construction); <em>Owyhee Grazing Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Field, </em>637 F.2d 694 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>(9th Cir.1981) (holding that FmHA officials had absolute immunity in suit for conspiracy to defraud plaintiffs of their interest in grazing association).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Applying the doctrine of absolute immunity to the facts in this case, we hold that the acts for which appellant claims the individual appellees are liable were all committed within the scope of their authority. Appellant accuses appellee Dockins of improprieties stemming from Dockins\u2019 evaluation of appellant\u2019s loan eligibility, from his evaluation of the productive capabilities of appellant\u2019s land, from his representation of appellant\u2019s loan prospects to third parties, and from his advice to appellant concerning the disposition of appellant\u2019s assets. All of these activities are squarely within the range of duties delegated to Dockins by the Secretary of Agriculture. Those duties \u201cdictate the need for a County Supervisor to constantly interact with private individuals to further the services FmHA provides to the individuals and entities in the Supervisor\u2019s geographic area.\u201d <em>Poolman, supra, </em>802 F.2d at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The other appellees acted completely within the scope of their authority as well. Appellee Kent reviewed appellant\u2019s applications, and met with appellant concerning the loan denials. Both chores are among Kent\u2019s basic responsibilities as FmHA District Director. There are no allegations that any of the other individual appellees committed any particular acts, within or without the scope of their authority, so there is no cause for a finding that they are not completely shielded by the doctrine of absolute immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">To qualify as officials for absolute immunity, <em>Williams v. Collins, supra, </em>required both that the actions of the officials be within the bounds of their authority and that they be related to a discretionary function. The latter requirement has recently come under some criticism. <em>See, e.g., Pool-man, supra, </em>802 F.2d at 308.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We need not address the relative merits of the one-factor versus the two-factor immunity test since we have found that the acts in question in this case were authorized discretionary acts. In <em>Currie v. Guthrie, </em>749 F.2d 185 (5th Cir.1984), we held that \u201c[a] public official\u2019s action will be considered \u2018discretionary\u2019 if it is \u2018the result of a judgment or decision which it is necessary that the Government official be free to make without fear or threat of vexatious or fictitious suits and alleged personal liability.\u201d . 749 F.2d at 188, <em>quoting Norton v. McShane, </em>332 F.2d 855, 859 (5th Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.S. 981, 85 S.Ct. 1345, 14 L.Ed.2d 274 (1965). Decisions regarding the eligibility of farmers for FmHA loans are decision that require such freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Because appellees\u2019 acts were within the bounds of their authority, and because their acts were connected with discretionary functions, we affirm the granting of summary judgment in favor of the individual appellees in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">V. <em>Constitutional Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">In his pursuit of a checklist of all possible theories of recovery, appellant claims that he is the victim of unconstitutional as well as common-law tortious activity by FmHA officials. In <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Supreme Court recognized \u201cthat victims of a constitutional violation by a federal agent have an implied right of action to recover damages against the official absent any statute conferring such a right.\u201d <em>Hessbrook v. Lennon, </em>777 F.2d 999, 1001 (5th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). This implied right of action only applies against the individual appellees in their individual capacities. The United States and its officers in pursuit of their official duties remain protected by sovereign immunity. <em>Holloman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Watt, </em>708 F.2d 1399, 1401-02 (9th Cir. 1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>466 U.S. 958, 104 S.Ct. 2168, 80 L.Ed.2d 552 (1984); <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>575 F.Supp. 1180, 1183 (W.D.Ark.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Appellant claims that FmHA officials deprived him of his property without due process of law by interfering with his contracts with his landlord, by interfering with his application for a loan from another federal agency, and by confiscating crop proceeds in which FmHA had no interest. The district court found that appellant \u201chas not established that Defendants\u2019 actions rise to the level of constitutional violations, particularly in light of the nature of the federal programs involved and the substantial discretion committed to those administering them.\u201d <em>Williamson, supra </em>635 F.Supp. at 117. Thus, the court found that appellant failed to make out a colorable <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Appellees in any event claim that they are shielded from liability for appellant\u2019s accusations by the doctrine of qualified immunity. Federal officials performing discretionary tasks enjoy qualified immunity from suits for constitutional violations to the extent that their conduct does not violate clearly established law. <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In <em>Bass v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, </em>737 F.2d 1408 (5th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>742 F.2d 1453 (1984), we addressed the heightened pleading requirement necessary to sustain a <em>Bivens </em>allegation in an administrative context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">What [the plaintiff\u2019s] contention does not face is that if his view were to prevail, every case involving a discretionary administrative decision would automatically become a constitutional case merely by allegation that the law was otherwise than the decision reached. Yet the entire issue in the judicial review of administrative action always is whether the administrative decision was erroneous. The Constitution is not implicated unless the decision goes beyond mere error to an intentional or reckless disregard of the constitutional rights of the person against whom the administrative decision is made. Mere failure to make the \u201ccorrect\u201d administrative decision does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">737 F.2d at 1415. Appellant has <em>alleged </em>with no other support an intentional deprivation of his constitutional rights by FmHA. But <em>Bass </em>should not be interpreted as rejecting as inadequate mere allegations that \u201cthe law is otherwise,\u201d only to accept as adequate mere allegations that \u201cthe violation was intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The extensive record, beyond the pleadings, shows no evidence that any violation of law committed by FmHA personnel was intentional or with reckless disregard of constitutional rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The record contains 107 pages of explanation by appellees of their actions concerning appellant during the relevant time span.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> These documents conclusively demonstrate that FmHA officials acted at all times within the bounds of their authority, and in good faith that their actions were completely within the law. Appellant\u2019s affidavit, largely a repetition of his complaint, fails to put into serious dispute the motivation of appellees. <em>Cf. Bamstone v. McKeever, </em>477 F.Supp. 108, 112 (S.D.Tex.1979) (\u201cNothing factual has been offered by the Plaintiff to support his bare allegations of harassment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">In these circumstances, courts have not hesitated to dismiss claims of constitutional violations. <em>See, e.g., Bass v. United States Dept. of Agriculture, supra; Citizens Savings v. Califano, </em>480 F.Supp. 843 (D.C. D.C.1979); <em>Bamstone v. McKeever, supra. </em>We hold that the district court was correct in doing so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In any event, the record also shows that the government officials, acting in their individual capacities, were entitled to the protection of qualified immunity. They demonstrated that their actions were taken within the scope of their authority. Appellant did not counter with a showing that their actions violated clearly established law. <em>See Harlow, supra, </em>457 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. 2738; <em>Saldana v. Garza, </em>684 F.2d 1159, 1163 (5th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1012, 103 S.Ct. 1253, 75 L.Ed.2d 481 (1983). <em>Cf. Baddour, Inc. v. United States, </em>614 F.Supp. 159 (N.D.Miss.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Because appellant failed to meet the heightened pleading requirement necessary to sustain a <em>Bivens </em>action, and also because appellees demonstrated their entitlement to the protection of qualified immunity, we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing appellant\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims against the individual appellees in their individual capacities.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">VI. <em>Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Having affirmed the dismissal of all of appellant\u2019s substantive claims against appellees, we now turn to the two points of appeal raised by appellant relating to the district court\u2019s conduct of the proceedings. Appellant\u2019s first complaint is that the district court abused its discretion in staying discovery pending resolution of the government\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. That motion was converted into a motion for summary judgment upon the submission to the district court of affidavits and other matters outside the pleadings. <em>See Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 412 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 897, 102 S.Ct. 396, 70 L.Ed.2d 212 (1981). Thus, when the district court ultimately granted the motion for summary judgment, appellant had not had any opportunity to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">It hardly bears repeating that control of discovery is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its discovery rulings will be reversed only where they are arbitrary or clearly unreasonable. <em>Mayo v. Tri-Bell Industries, </em>787 F.2d 1007, 1012 (5th Cir.1986). Generally, a ruling that denies a party an adequate opportunity to discover facts to oppose a motion for summary judgment is unreasonable if summary judgment is subsequently entered against that party. <em>Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., </em>632 F.2d 539, 548 (5th Cir.1980), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>642 F.2d 1210, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 927, 102 S.Ct. 427, 70 L.Ed.2d 236 (1981). On the other hand, \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to discovery prior to a ruling on a motion for summary judgment is not unlimited, and may be cut off when the record shows that the requested discovery is not likely to produce the facts needed by plaintiff to withstand a Rule 56(e) motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Paul Kadair, Inc. v. Sony Corp. of America, </em>694 F.2d 1017, 1029-30 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">In the particular context of claims against the United States and federal officials, particular considerations weigh heavily. In <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, supra, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the protection afforded government officials by the doctrines of absolute and qualified immunity would be greatly depreciated if it did not include protection from discovery. 475 U.S. at 816-18, 102 S.Ct. at 2737-38. The Court specifically referred to <em>Halperin v. Kissinger, </em>606 F.2d 1192 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>affd in pertinent part, </em>452 U.S. 713, 101 S.Ct. 3132, 69 L.Ed.2d 367 (1981), for the proposition that close control of discovery is essential to the preservation of meaningful official immunity. 475 U.S. at 818, n. 29, 102 S.Ct. at 2738, n. 29. <em>Halperin </em>noted that uncontrolled discovery in the course of insubstantial lawsuits constitutes a form of harassment imposing an undue burden on public officials and government agencies. 606 F.2d at 1209. <em>See also Chagnon v. Bell, </em>642 F.2d 1248, 1265-66 (D.C.Cir.1980) (rejecting claim of abuse of discretion based on stay of discovery in case against federal officials), <em>cert. denied, </em>453 U.S. 911, 101 S.Ct. 3142, 69 L.Ed.2d 994 (1981). For all these reasons, the Supreme Court advised that \u201c[ujntil this threshold immunity question is resolved, discovery should not be allowed.\u201d <em>Harlow, supra, </em>475 U.S. at 818, 102 S.Ct. at 2738.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The doctrines of absolute and qualified immunity both apply to various as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>pects of this case, and, together with the doctrine of sovereign immunity, they completely shield appellees from liability for the alleged misdeeds charged. Congress\u2019 intent to shield appellees Dockins, Kent, and their supervisors from harassment and the substantial distractions of suit would be circumvented if appellant were allowed to inspect their files and their desks. The district court acted properly in staying discovery in this case pending resolution of the immunity issues. Thus we reject appellant\u2019s claim of abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">VII. <em>Affidavits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Appellant\u2019s final claim is that the district court erred in considering inadmissible evidence contained in the affidavits and documents provided by appellees. It is true that Rule 56 requires that affidavits be made on personal knowledge, and that they set out only facts that would be admissible in evidence. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). It is also true that those portions of affidavits that do not comply with these requirements are entitled to no weight. <em>Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., supra, </em>632 F.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">As an initial response to this claim, we note that appellant made no motion in the trial court to strike those portions of the affidavits not admissible as evid\u00e9nce. To reverse the district court\u2019s judgment at this stage on grounds unobjected to below would allow a party to \u201csandbag the [district] court ..., selectively opposing the points [it] chose, and on appeal claiming that the unopposed points were defectively presented and required no response.\u201d <em>In re Teltronics Services, </em>762 F.2d 185, 192 (2nd Cir.1985) (rejecting arguments that summary judgment was impermissibly based on affidavits containing inadmissible evidence). We agree with the reasoning of <em>Teltronics, </em>and reject appellant\u2019s claim on the basis of his failure to object to the admission of the affidavits in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">In any event, it is well settled that \u201con a motion for summary judgment a court will disregard only the inadmissible portions of a challenged affidavit offered in support of or opposition to the motion and will consider the admissible portions in determining whether to grant or deny the motions.\u201d <em>Lee v. National Life Assurance Co., </em>632 F.2d 524, 529 (5th Cir.1980), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>635 F.2d 516 (1981). <em>See also Prudential Ins. Co. v. Curt Bullock Builders, </em>626 F.Supp. 159, 164 (N.D.Ill.1985). In the total absence of a showing otherwise, we find that the district court did not improperly consider inadmissible portions of appellees\u2019 affidavits. We thus reject appellant\u2019s final claim that the admission of the affidavits constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">All of appellant\u2019s allegations against the United States, its agencies and its officers were properly dismissed in deference to legal implementation of the principle that government officials need room in which to exercise the discretion bestowed upon them by Congress. Congress limited its waiver of sovereign immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act in pursuit of this objective. Common law and constitutional claims against government officials are subject to absolute and qualified immunity further to implement this objective. The record is detailed and adequate enough to show that this farmer-businessman fell into deeper and deeper financial difficulty in spite of extensive loans by the federal government. When the collapse came, the attempt is made to blame the government for not going further. Sympathy for appellant\u2019s plight cannot overcome the discretionary nature of the federal program. The summary judgment of the district court in favor of appellees must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\">. The doctrine has its origins in the maxim, \"Rex non potest peccare\u201d (\"The King can do no wrong.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Nevin v. United States, </em>696 F.2d 1229, 1230 (9th Cir.) (\u201c[WJhether an act or omission falls within the exemption depends generally on whether that act or omission occurred at the planning level or the operational level of government.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 815, 104 S.Ct. 70, 78 L.Ed.2d 84 (1983); <em>Gross </em>v. <em>United States, </em>676 F.2d 295, 302 (8th Cir.1982) (\"The discretionary function exception covers only decisions made at the policy or planning level. ... Decisions made at the operational level may still be actionable even though they involve an element of discretion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">. We specifically noted in <em>Smith, supra, </em>375 F.2d at 246, that the application of \u00a7 2680(a) is \"a difficult process [that] is not aided by importation of the planning stage-operational stage standard____ Such a distinction is specious. It may be a makeweight in easy cases where of course it is not needed, but in difficult cases it proves to be another example of a distinction \u2018so finespun and capricious as to be almost incapable of being held in the mind for adequate formulation.\u2019 Mr. Justice Frankfurter for the Court in <em>Indian Towing </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>350 U.S. 61, 68, 76 S.Ct. 122, 126, 100 L.Ed. 48, 55 (1955)]. Such nonstatutory \u2018aids\u2019 to construction tend to obscure, to limit, or even to replace the standards whose meaning they are supposed to clarify.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b491-18\">. The Court went on to note that the FTCA's legislative history\u2019s \"emphasis upon protection for regulatory activities suggests an underlying basis for the inclusion of an exception for discretionary functions in the Act: Congress wished to prevent judicial \u2018second-guessing\u2019 of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social, economic, and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.\u201d 467 U.S. at 814, 104 S.Ct. at 2764-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-6\">. On appeal, the Tenth Circuit held that the Secretary of Agriculture was without discretion to withhold implementation of the FmHA loan deferral program, but did not disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Secretary exercised discretion within the program in deciding whether to defer particular loans. <em>Matzke, </em>732 F.2d at 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. <em>Teupker </em>and <em>Lathan, </em>as well as the instant case, are distinguishable from recent cases holding that FmHA\u2019s practices and regulations implementing its deferral relief program violate due process. <em>See, e.g., Curry v. Block, </em>738 F.2d 1556 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Allison v. Block, </em>723 F.2d 631 (8th Cir.1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hamrick, </em>713 F.2d 69 (4th Cir.1983). Like the Tenth Circuit\u2019s <em>Matzke </em>decision (see footnote 5, supra), these cases concern the provisions for notice and opportunity to be heard upon the denial of a loan deferral, but do not reduce the discretion of the Secretary to determine whether any particular farmer is eligible to receive such a deferral.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b492-14\">. Further support for our holding can be found in Exhibit A to appellee Dockins\u2019 affidavit, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s job description for the position of \"Agricultural Management Specialist, GS-11, County Supervisor.\u201d The description identifies as the responsibility of the County Supervisor the duty to \"make and service loans\u201d and details 10 responsibilities a supervisor discharges, most of which involve exercises of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\">. This Circuit has long applied \u00a7 2680(h) to both negligent and intentional misrepresentations. <em>See, e.g., Rey v. United States, </em>484 F.2d 45, 49 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\">. The Court concluded that Congress intended the term \"misrepresentation\u201d in \u00a7 2680(h) to be interpreted according to the traditional common law definition of the tort of misrepresentation. <em>Id., </em>460 U.S. at 296, 103 S.Ct. at 1093.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b493-10\">. In <em>Neal, </em>the FmHA breached not only its duty to use due care in conveying information, but also its duty to supervise properly the construction of the plaintiff\u2019s home. 460 U.S. at 297, 103 S.Ct. at 1094. Since government misrepresentation was not essential to plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim for failure to supervise, the Court held that the claim was not barred by \u00a7 2680(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b493-18\">. <em>See Hamre v. United States, </em>799 F.2d 455 (8th Cir. 1986) (holding that claims against a government appraiser were claims for misrepresentation, and thus barred by \u00a7 2680(h)); <em>Carolinas Cotton Growers Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 1195 (4th Cir.1986) (holding that claims against the government for improperly grading plaintiff\u2019s cotton were barred by \u00a7 2680(h)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b493-19\">. The <em>Metz </em>Court relied on <em>Kosak v. United States, supra, </em>for the proposition that the words \"arising out of\u2019 in \u00a7 2680 should be construed broadly. <em>Kosak </em>specifically dealt with \u00a7 2680(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">. Appellant claims that the contract rights referred to in \u00a7 2680(h) are limited to contracts to which the United States is a party. Appellant cites <em>United States v. Smith, </em>324 F.2d 622 (5th Cir.1963), which, in fact, establishes the opposite proposition: interference by the government with contract rights existing between the government and an FTCA plaintiff is merely breach of contract, not a tort at all. Thus, \u00a7 2680(h) only applies to contracts to which the government is not a party, because only interference with those contracts gives rise to an action sounding in tort.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b495-8\">. In the age of law and economics, there has been an assay toward explaining the doctrine of official immunity in terms of the principles of risk-aversion and profit maximization. <em>E.g. Carson v. Block, </em>790 F.2d 562, 564 (7th Cir.) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"Private firms may buy insurance for their employees, or give them bonuses or shares of the enterprise to induce them to take risks. The United States does not offer the Secretary of Agriculture a 'share of the profits\u2019 from federal programs awarding subsidies, and a system under which officials face risks of substantial liability for error without any corresponding prospect for reward for good work is doomed. Only the addled and the foolhardy would disregard these incentives, and the addled and foolhardy do not execute statutes very well.\"), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 669, 93 L.Ed.2d 721 (1986)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><em>. </em>\"We recognize that some circuit courts have adopted the discretionary function requirement as an element in determining whether a federal official is immune from a common law tort cause of action____ Yet, we feel <em>Barr </em>indicates that by allowing the degree of discretion embodied in a particular function to remain a factor\u2014 as opposed to requiring bright-line distinctions between discretionary and ministerial acts\u2014 courts can better resolve [the immunity dilemma].\u201d <em>Poolman, supra, </em>802 F.2d at 308.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b497-9\">.
