Appellants contend that their due process rights were violated because the New Hampshire Supreme Court disposed of their appeals without granting them access to an adequate trial record and a meaningful opportunity to persuade the court that their appeals should be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-15\">Appellant Bryan Colpitt was convicted of robbery following a two-day jury trial in Strafford County Superior Court. He was sentenced to serve two and one-half to five years in the state prison. Colpitt filed a timely notice of appeal in the New Hampshire Supreme Court. Colpitt\u2019s notice of appeal raised six issues, including the trial court\u2019s refusal to conduct a mid-trial hearing on his competency and its failure to strike three misstatements of the evidence allegedly made by the prosecution during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-16\">Appellant Edward Bundy was convicted of automobile theft by a jury in Cheshire County Superior Court. He was sentenced to twelve months in jail, with all but thirty days suspended. Bundy filed a notice of appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and the alleged encroachment of the trial judge into the province of the jury by virtue of his answering \u201cNo\u201d to its mid-deliberation question: \u201cDoes the law read that a person has to be driving a car to be charged with theft?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">The notices of appeal filed by Bundy and Colpitt were reviewed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court. The court disposed of their petitions for review in accordance with New Hampshire Supreme Court Rule 7(1), which provides: \u201cThe supreme court may, in its discretion, decline to accept an appeal from a lower court after a decision on the merits, or may sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>marily dispose of such an appeal as provided in rule 25.\u201d The court chose to dispose of appellants\u2019 petitions for review by issuing a \u201cdeclination of acceptance order.\u201d Such an order issues when the New Hampshire Supreme Court \u201cdoes not deem it desirable to review the issues in a case____\u201d N.H.Sup.CtR. 3. A declination of acceptance order disposes of a defendant\u2019s appeal without any implication regarding the court\u2019s views on the merits of the claim; it simply permits the decision of the lower court to stand undisturbed. The New Hampshire Supreme Court issues its declination of acceptance order on the basis of the notice of appeal. A transcript normally does not accompany the notice of appeal. <em>See </em>N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 15; Douglas, <em>Summary Disposition The New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s Innovative and Unique Approach to Appellate Case Processing, </em>27 N.H.B.J. 211, 215-16 (1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Both appellants sought reconsideration of the supreme court\u2019s declination of acceptance orders. Their motions were denied without explanation. They then sought habeas relief in the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (1982). Appellants advanced the same issues in their habeas petitions as they had raised in their notice of appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, plus an additional claim challenging the constitutionality of the declination process.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The district court ordered the State of New Hampshire to produce a transcript of both proceedings. Both appellants, after reviewing the transcripts of their respective trials, conceded that some of the issues they had pressed to the supreme court and the district court were without merit. Col-pitt, however, continued to urge that he was erroneously denied a competency hearing by the trial court. The district court, however, upheld the trial judge\u2019s refusal to hold a competency hearing, noting that this decision was \u201camply supported by record evidence.\u201d Bundy dropped his sufficiency of the evidence claim, but continued to assert that the trial court had impermissibly invaded the province of the jury by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the question of whether a defendant must be driving a stolen car to be guilty of automobile theft. Bundy argued that the judge\u2019s answer constituted a resolution of the factual issue of whether Bundy exercised sufficient control over the car to be guilty of theft. The district court held that the jury\u2019s question did not reflect any uncertainty regarding a factual issue, but was merely a request for guidance \u201cas to whether it was permissible to find [Bun-dy] guilty if he had not driven the automobile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Neither Bundy nor Colpitt succeeded in persuading the district court that New Hampshire\u2019s criminal appellate process was unconstitutional, 638 F.Supp. 1277. Both appealed the district court\u2019s denial of habe-as relief. The cases were consolidated by order of this court on September 12, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">The fundamental issue is whether the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s declination of appeals procedure comports with the strictures of due process. Appellants aver that, at a minimum, due process requires that criminal defendants whose liberty is at stake be afforded a trial transcript or sufficient substitute therefor and the right to submit a written argument to persuade the supreme court to hear their cases on the merits. Appellants contend that they cannot adequately present \u2014 nor can the supreme court fairly decide whether to accept \u2014 their appeals, without an opportunity to consult a transcript and marshal in writing the salient facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">In its appellate brief to this court, the state has conceded the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">(1) the New Hampshire Supreme Court misapplied its own rules in declining to review appellant Colpitt\u2019s conviction;</p>\n<p id=\"b243-17\">(2) due process principles apply to the court\u2019s system of discretionary appellate review;</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>(3) in certain circumstances, due process requires, upon a sufficient showing of need, that an appellant be afforded an opportunity to review and present to the court relevant portions of the transcript of his trial prior to the court\u2019s decision whether to accept the appeal;</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">(4) appellant Colpitt, with respect to the issue of the competency hearing, made such a showing of need in his notice of appeal and his motion to reconsider declination of appeal; and</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">(5) the New Hampshire Supreme Court violated appellant Colpitt\u2019s rights to due process of law when it issued its declination order.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Brief for the State at-.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The State thus concedes that the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied appellant Colpitt due process by failing to afford him access to a transcript in order to prepare and present his request for appellate review. Moreover, the State implies that there may be other circumstances in which due process would require providing criminal defendants with a transcript in order to have a meaningful opportunity to persuade the court to accept their appeals. But while the State concedes that there will be instances in which the normal operation of New Hampshire\u2019s declination of acceptance procedure will lead to due process violations, it does not share appellants\u2019 view that there is a systemic constitutional infirmity. Indeed, the State hints that the principal cause of Colpitt\u2019s due process violation was the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s \u201cmisapplication of its own rules.\u201d This is a far cry from appellants\u2019 contention that constitutional defects inhere in the regular application of those rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In short, the State has conceded only that, as applied to appellant Colpitt, New Hampshire\u2019s declination of acceptance procedure violates due process. The State has made no such concession with respect to appellant Bundy. His challenge to the constitutionality of New Hampshire\u2019s system of appeals for criminal defendants is unaffected by the State\u2019s concession. Thus, notwithstanding the State\u2019s posture toward appellant Colpitt, our inquiry must still focus on whether the New Hampshire declination of acceptance procedure, as presently administered, violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">Virtually every state in the country, as well as the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, grants felony criminal defendants an automatic right to at least one full appeal on the merits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most states provide criminal defendants with automatic review in an intermediate court of appeals. The supreme court in these states generally has discretion to accept cases after they have been reviewed by the intermediate court of appeals. States which do not have two tiers of appellate review provide criminal defendants with an appeal as of right to the state supreme court. Virginia and West Virginia are the only other states besides New Hampshire which do not provide felony criminal defendants with an automatic right to an appeal on the merits. The procedural protections afforded a criminal appellant in those states, however, underline the solitariness of the New Hampshire system. In Virginia and West Virginia, a criminal appeal cannot be rejected until an appellate court has fully examined the relevant portions of the record and the defendant has been given a chance to persuade a court of review, both orally and in writing, to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">New Hampshire is the only state in the nation which does not guarantee to all felony criminal defendants, at a minimum, access to a transcript and an opportunity for argument before disposition of their appeals. The New Hampshire Supreme Court may dispose of a criminal appeal solely on the basis of the information in the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal requires the putative appellant to set forth:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">(1) A \u201cbrief description\u201d of the nature of the case and the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(2) The statute on which the case was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">(3) The \u201cspecific questions to be raised on appeal, expressed in terms and circumstances of the case but without unnecessary detail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">(4) A list of cases supporting the mov-ant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">There may also be attached to the notice of appeal copies of pertinent pleadings, motions, legal memoranda, statutory and constitutional texts, trial court rulings, and any other relevant documents. The notice of appeal does not ask for a statement of reasons or argument on the question of why an appeal should be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Once the notice of appeal has been filed, the New Hampshire Supreme Court utilizes a screening procedure to determine whether or not to hear the case on its merits. \u201cThe standard governing the making of a declination decision is one of sound judicial discretion with respect to the desirability of our hearing and deciding the case.\u201d <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. 119, 125, 498 A.2d 1209, 1214 (1985). A single justice is assigned to review the notice of appeal and recommend whether to accept the case, decline it, or summarily dispose of it pursuant to New Hampshire Supreme Court Rule 25.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Douglas <em>The New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s Approach to Appellate Case Processing, </em>27 N.H.B.J. at 215. The other four justices on the supreme court subsequently review the recommendation of the screening justice. If the screening justice suggests that the appeal be declined, his recommendation will be upheld unless one of the other four justices disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The New Hampshire Supreme Court recently considered a challenge to the constitutionality of its own procedures for criminal appeals in <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. 119, 498 A.2d 1209. The appellants-defendants in <em>Cooper </em>claimed that the New Hampshire rules permitted the supreme court to decline appeals arbitrarily and capriciously simply by invoking a vague standard of \u201cdesirability.\u201d They also argued that the declination of acceptance procedure fostered an irrational distinction between meritorious and nonmeritorious appeals. Finally, the <em>Cooper </em>appellants asserted that the declination procedure inhibits counsel from effectively assisting criminal defendants who seek review in the New Hampshire Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The <em>Cooper </em>court stated that New Hampshire instituted a discretionary system of appellate review because the supreme court\u2019s case load had \u201cmushroomed in recent years.\u201d 127 N.H. at 126, 498 A.2d at 1214. The court correctly recognized that the Constitution does not grant a criminal defendant the right to an appeal. 127 N.H. at 122, 498 A.2d at 1212. <em>Accord Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 3312, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983); <em>Abney v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 651, 656, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 2038, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <em>McKane v. Durston, </em>153 U.S. 684, 687-88, 14 S.Ct. 913, 914-15, 38 L.Ed. 867 (1894). It also properly noted that New Hampshire\u2019s criminal appeals system must comport with the strictures of due process. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. at 122, 498 A.2d at 1212. There can be no question that a discretionary criminal appeals system is subject to the requirements of due process: \u201c[W]hen a State opts to act in a field where its action has significant discretionary elements, it must nonetheless act in accord with the dictates of the Constitution \u2014 and, in particular, in accord with the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 401, 105 S.Ct. 830, 838, 83 L.Ed.2d 821 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>After acknowledging that New Hampshire\u2019s discretionary system of criminal appeals was subject to federal due process standards, the state supreme court indicated that those standards were less rigorous when applied to New Hampshire because its system of criminal appeals is discretionary rather than automatic. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. at 123, 498 A.2d at 1213. The state supreme court cited <em>Evitts </em>and <em>Ross v. Moffit, </em>417 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974), as support for this proposition. In <em>Ross, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that due process and equal protection did not require the State of North Carolina to provide an indigent defendant with counsel in a discretionary appeal to the state supreme court. Vital to the Court\u2019s reasoning was its recognition that North Carolina did provide counsel to criminal defendants who pursued their automatic right of appeal to the state\u2019s intermediate appellate court. <em>Id. </em>at 613-16, 94 S.Ct. at 2445-47. Thus, the crucial distinction advanced in <em>Ross </em>is not between discretionary appellate <em>systems </em>and automatic appellate <em>systems. </em>Rather, the key difference considered in both <em>Evitts </em>and <em>Ross </em>concerned the nature of constitutional protections in a single system which employed both a first appeal as of right to an intermediate court, and a subsequent discretionary appeal to the state supreme court. <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. at 401-02, 105 S.Ct. at 835-36; <em>Ross v. Moffit, </em>417 U.S. at 613-16, 94 S.Ct. at 2445-47. Indeed, the distinction between a first appeal of right and subsequent discretionary appeal within the same appellate system has been made by the Court in other cases. <em>United States v. MacCollum, </em>426 U.S. 317, 324, 96 S.Ct. 2086, 2091, 48 L.Ed.2d 666 (1976); <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 356, 83 S.Ct. 814, 816, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963). The Court, however, has not drawn a line between discretionary appellate systems and automatic appellate systems for the purpose of gauging the degree of due process protection owed a criminal appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">After asserting that discretionary appellate systems are subject to a less rigorous due process standard than automatic appellate systems, the <em>Cooper </em>court defended the constitutionality of the New Hampshire system by noting that its standards for acceptance of an appeal are similar to those utilized by the state supreme courts in Illinois and Tennessee. <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. at 126-27, 498 A.2d at 1215. The New Hampshire Supreme Court, however, failed to note that both of those states provide a criminal defendant with a first appeal as of right to an intermediate court of appeals. Thus, the court again drew a conclusion regarding single-tiered discretionary appellate systems based on jurisdictions with multi-tiered appellate systems which provided criminal defendants with at least one appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">We must note our disagreement with the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that single-tiered discretionary appellate systems are subject to less rigorous due process strictures than multi-tiered appellate systems providing at least one appeal of right. The issue of whether the instant appellants are entitled to a transcript and an opportunity to persuade the state supreme court to accept their appeals does not turn on whether New Hampshire\u2019s appellate system is discretionary or automatic. The pertinent due process question is whether criminal appellants in New Hampshire are provided \u201can adequate opportunity to present their claims fairly within the adversary system.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 77, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 1094, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985) (quoting <em>Ross v. Moffit, </em>417 U.S. at 612, 94 S.Ct. at 2444). We turn now to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The fourteenth amendment\u2019s due process guarantee of fundamental fairness requires states to provide a criminal defendant with \u201cthe opportunity to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. at 76, 105 S.Ct. at 1093. The Supreme Court has stated that it is a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201caccess to the record which makes any appellate review mean-ingful____\u201d <em>Gardner v. California, </em>393 U.S. 367, 368, 89 S.Ct. 580, 581, 21 L.Ed.2d 601 (1969). Accordingly, \u201cthere can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>doubt that the State must provide an indigent defendant with a transcript when that transcript is needed for an effective defense or appeal.\u201d <em>Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. 226, 227, 92 S.Ct. 431, 433, 30 L.Ed.2d 400 (1971). <em>Accord Mayer v. City of Chicago, </em>404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971); <em>Williams v. Oklahoma City, </em>395 U.S. 458, 89 S.Ct. 1818, 23 L.Ed.2d 440 (1969); <em>Gardner v. California, </em>393 U.S. 367, 89 S.Ct. 580, 21 L.Ed.2d 601 (1969); <em>Roberts v. LaVallee, </em>389 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967); <em>Long v. District Court of Iowa, </em>385 U.S. 192, 87 S.Ct. 362, 17 L.Ed.2d 290 (1966); <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. 487, 83 S.Ct. 774, 9 L.Ed.2d 899 (1963); <em>Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board, </em>357 U.S. 214, 78 S.Ct. 1061, 2 L.Ed.2d 1269 (1958); <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956). The Court also has emphasized that the holdings in the line of cases that began with <em>Griffin, </em>involving a criminal defendant\u2019s right of access to a transcript, are rooted firmly in both the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment. <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. at 403-04,105 S.Ct. at 839-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It is clear that the Court regards access to a transcript as an essential element for ensuring that a criminal appellant has \u201can adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of a State\u2019s appellate process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 105 S.Ct. at 839. Decisions of circuit courts of appeals in this area affirm this assessment. <em>See, e.g., Byrd v. Wainwright, </em>722 F.2d 716 (11th Cir.) (criminal defendant has a constitutional right to a transcript in order to petition the state supreme court for discretionary review of his conviction), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 869, 105 S.Ct. 217, 83 L.Ed.2d 147 (1984); <em>Thompson v. Housewright, </em>741 F.2d 213 (8th Cir.1984); <em>Oliver v. Zimmerman, </em>720 F.2d 766 (3d Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1033, 104 S.Ct. 1302, 79 L.Ed.2d 701 (1984); <em>United States ex rel. Burton v. Greer, </em>643 F.2d 466 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>United States ex rel. Buford v. Henderson, </em>524 F.2d 147 (2d Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 923, 96 S.Ct. 1133, 47 L.Ed.2d 332 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Having identified the constitutional significance which the Court attaches to a criminal appellant\u2019s access to a transcript, we turn now to an evaluation of whether New Hampshire\u2019s declination of appeals procedure violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The Supreme Court has identified three distinct factors that must be considered when evaluating a claim of due process deprivation. First, the private interest that is affected by the official action. Second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation caused by the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional procedural safeguards. Third, the governmental interest at stake, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burden engendered by additional procedural requirements. <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 903, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The private interest at stake here is the appellants\u2019 \u201copportunity to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which [their] liberty is at stake.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. at 76, 105 S.Ct. at 1093. The appellants seek to guard their interest in an accurate disposition of their appeals by obtaining procedural protections that will provide them with a full and fair opportunity to present their cases for review, and thus ensure the proper functioning of the adversary system. <em>See Gardner v. California, </em>393 U.S. at 369, 89 S.Ct. at 582. The Supreme Court has recognized that such an interest is of paramount importance: \u201cThe private interest in the accuracy of a criminal proceeding that places an individual\u2019s life or liberty at risk is almost uniquely compelling.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. at 78, 105 S.Ct. at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">We note that the \u201cuniquely compelling\u201d interest at stake here carries even greater significance because appellants have only one chance, at the discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the New Hampshire Supreme Court, to obtain state appellate review of alleged errors that led to their incarceration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The risk of an erroneous deprivation of felony defendants\u2019 interests in fairly and meaningfully presenting their appeals is heightened immeasurably by the failure to afford them a transcript. A transcript is \u201cthe most basic and fundamental tool\u201d of effective appellate advocacy. <em>Hardy v. United States, </em>375 U.S. 277, 288, 84 S.Ct. 424, 431, 11 L.Ed.2d 331 (1964) (Goldberg, J., concurring). Our discussion in Section IV manifests the importance with which the Supreme Court regards access to a transcript. The Court has instructed that the due process mandate of fundamental fairness requires states to furnish criminal appellants with a trial transcript or an adequate substitute. <em>E.g., Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. at 227-30, 92 S.Ct. at 433-35; <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. at 496, 83 S.Ct. at 779; <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U.S. at 20, 76 S.Ct. at 591; <em>see also Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. at 403-05, 105 S.Ct. at 840-41 (emphasizing the due process roots of <em>Griffin </em>and its progeny). An adequate substitute for a transcript is a document which would \u201cplace before the appellate court an equivalent report of the events at trial from which the appellant\u2019s contentions arise.\u201d <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. at 495, 83 S.Ct. at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The Court\u2019s solicitude regarding the furnishing of transcripts not only stems from the necessity of granting a criminal appellant a meaningful and fair opportunity to present his appeal; it also derives from a concern with ensuring that appellate courts have a full and accurate understanding of an appellant\u2019s contentions before dispensing with his appeal. Such concern pertains here regardless of the fact that the New Hampshire Supreme Court is not bound, either by the Constitution or its own rules, to actually decide the merits of an appeal. The New Hampshire Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cright to appeal in New Hampshire is limited to the right to obtain a discretionary determination by this court as to whether it will accept the appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Cooper, </em>127 N.H. at 124, 498 A.2d at 1213. This discretionary determination, however, cannot be made without regard for the constraints of due process. <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. at 401, 105 S.Ct. at 838-39. To the extent that due process requires safeguards to assure the fair and accurate disposition of official proceedings, those safeguards must be heeded regardless of the fact that the proceedings are undertaken at the discretion of the government. <em>Id.; see also Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 262, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The facts of the instant appeals illustrate the dual justification for providing criminal appellants with transcripts. Appellant Col-pitt alleged on appeal that he was entitled to a mid-trial competency hearing. The suasive force of Colpitt\u2019s claim was undercut by his inability to point to statements made on the record which cast doubt on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>competency.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, the New Hampshire Supreme Court could not fully and accurately assess Colpitt\u2019s need for a mid-trial competency hearing without examining the evidence which called into question his mental capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Appellant Bundy\u2019s state court appeal alleged claims of insufficient evidence and improper invasion of the jury\u2019s province by the trial judge. Although Bundy later dropped his claim regarding sufficiency of the evidence, it is axiomatic that an appellant cannot meaningfully present such a claim without pointing to the specific areas where the prosecution failed to meet its evidentiary burden. As appellate court judges, we are mindful of the skepticism which is engendered by bald assertions of insufficient evidence unsupported by any citation to specific portions of the record. We realize, as already noted, that the New Hampshire Supreme Court is not bound to decide the merits of whether the evidence sufficed to convict Bundy. But the court cannot decide to decline criminal defendants a full review on the merits of their appeals \u201cwithout first granting them a \u2018record of sufficient completeness\u2019 to permit proper consideration of their claims.\u201d <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. at 499, 83 S.Ct. at 780;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>see also Coppedge v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 438, 446, 82 S.Ct. 917, 921, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962). Due process thus prohibits the New Hampshire Supreme Court from arbitrarily and capriciously deciding to decline to consider Bundy\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim. The state supreme court necessarily must make at least a rough assessment that the evidence is sufficient in order for its decision to accord with due process. We think it impossible for a reviewing court to make even a rough assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence without some reference to the trial court record. The accuracy of this rough assessment is especially important in New Hampshire for it will most likely determine the \u201cdesirability\u201d of accepting the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Bundy\u2019s other state appellate claim, which he has continued to press, involved an alleged infringement into the province of the jury by the trial judge when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to its question of whether \u201cthe law read[s] that a person has to be driving a car to be charged with theft?\u201d. Without an opportunity to make references to the record, Bundy\u2019s counsel was hard-pressed to support his assertion that the judge\u2019s answer resolved a factual question for the jury. Standing alone, the judge\u2019s answer appears to be nothing more than a correct statement of the law. The record reveals, however, that Bundy was only a passenger in the car when it was stolen and that the jury had requested another instruction regarding \u201cexercising control.\u201d In short, the record shows that the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>was struggling to resolve the factual question of whether Bundy had exercised enough control over the car to be adjudged guilty of theft. Thus, a colorable claim could be advanced that the jury regarded the judge\u2019s answer to the question as obviating further exploration of the crucial factual element in the case. The plausibility of this argument could not, however, be advanced effectively without an opportunity to make appropriate citations to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We also are of the opinion that appellants\u2019 interest in meaningfully and fairly presenting their claims was curtailed severely by New Hampshire\u2019s failure to allow felony criminal defendants an opportunity to persuade the court to accept their appeals. The New Hampshire notice of appeal form is, by its own terms, a summary document which requests only a \u201cbrief description of the case,\u201d and a recitation of the basis for the appeal \u201cwithout unnecessary detail.\u201d Thus, not only are criminal appellants unable to marshal coherently the salient facts in their case because of the lack of a transcript, but, in addition, the language of the notice of appeal form discourages them from attempting to persuade the state supreme court to hear their appeals. Yet it is that very form which serves as the basis for the court\u2019s decision to accept or refuse the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We think that the failure to provide criminal appellants with a transcript, and the perfunctory outline of the basis for the appeal required by the notice of appeal, seriously threatens the interest of criminal defendants in obtaining meaningful review in New Hampshire\u2019s appellate system. The State\u2019s concession with respect to appellant Colpitt, and the situation of appellant Bundy, illustrate the real and continuing risk of an erroneous deprivation of a defendant\u2019s due process rights inherent in the current manner of administering New Hampshire\u2019s declination of acceptance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The third due process factor identified in <em>Mathews </em>focuses on the governmental interest at stake, as well as the fiscal and administrative burden of imposing additional procedures. The State interest implicated here is the speedy and efficient disposition of New Hampshire\u2019s appellate case load. New Hampshire contends that the supreme court\u2019s growing case load prohibits it from providing criminal defendants with a transcript and an opportunity to submit a brief written statement which attempts to persuade the court to accept their appeals. This claim is seriously undermined by the fact that every other state in the union which employs a single-tiered system of appeals can manage its case load while providing criminal defendants with more opportunity for appellate review than is sought by the appellants here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">New Hampshire\u2019s interest in the speedy and efficient disposition of its appellate case load \u201cis necessarily tempered by its interest in the fair and accurate adjudication of criminal cases.\u201d <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. at 79,105 S.Ct. at 1094-95. Thus, to a significant degree, the governmental interest implicated here overlaps the private interest which is at stake. Accordingly, New Hampshire\u2019s interest in denying a criminal appellant a transcript and a brief written argument \u201cis not substantial, in light of the compelling interest of both the State and the individual in accurate dispositions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">We may wonder whether the administrative efficiency component of the State interest at stake here actually may be helped, rather than hindered, by adopting the additional procedural safeguards sought. Providing felony defendants with a transcript and an express opportunity to persuade the court to accept the appeal would reduce the need to attach a lengthy appendix composed of pleadings, motions and other documents. Thus, the New Hampshire Supreme Court would have a concise document on hand to aid its determination of whether to accept or decline an appeal. Moreover, the availability of a transcript might help reduce the court\u2019s work load by enabling counsel to eliminate seemingly colorable claims whose actual meritlessness is revealed from an examination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>record. In the instant case, both Bundy and Colpitt dropped some of their claims after consulting the transcript made available to them by the federal district court. In any event, whatever the impact on administrative efficiency, it is of no great significance when compared to the importance of the interest advanced by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In' sum, an examination of the <em>Mathews </em>factors indicates that we are faced with a \u201cuniquely compelling\u201d private interest; a relatively insubstantial state interest that might actually be advanced by adopting the additional procedures suggested here; and a serious risk of a deprivation of appellants\u2019 interest in a fair and meaningful opportunity to participate in New Hampshire\u2019s appellate process. Accordingly, we hold that the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s declination of the state court appeals brought by the instant appellants violated their due process rights, because the decision was made without giving appellants a transcript or an opportunity to persuade the court to accept their appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">As currently administered, the New Hampshire Supreme Court\u2019s declination of acceptance procedure violates the constitutional rights of felony defendants who assert appellate claims which have their basis in the record. The fundamental fairness guaranteed by the due process clause requires that such defendants be granted a transcript, or an adequate written substitute, and an opportunity to submit a brief written statement specifically focusing on why their appeals should be accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Such requirements fall far below the procedural protections afforded criminal appellants in every other state in the country. Moreover, these requirements cannot be equated with granting criminal defendants an appeal as of right. The New Hampshire Supreme Court is still free to decline to accept cases. It cannot do so, however, until criminal appellants have been afforded the procedural protections delineated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Of course, not all criminal appellants will be entitled to a transcript. Those who assert appellate claims which do not arise out of any of the events at trial will not need recourse to the record to fairly and meaningfully present arguments why their appeals should be accepted. Thus, for example, a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment or a question of statutory interpretation will not usually necessitate the production of a transcript. Every criminal defendant who has been convicted of a felony is, however, entitled to an opportunity to persuade the New Hampshire Supreme Court, via a written statement, to accept his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Even if a criminal defendant asserts an appellate claim which requires recourse to a transcript, he is not necessarily entitled to the full transcript. A defendant\u2019s right to a transcript can be satisfied by providing him with a written substitute that reports the portions of the trial which underlie his appellate contentions. <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. at 495, 83 S.Ct. at 778; <em>see also Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. at 229, 92 S.Ct. at 434; <em>Mayer v. City of Chicago, </em>404 U.S. at 194-95, 92 S.Ct. at 414-15; <em>Lugo v. Munoz, </em>682 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1982). In some cases, other types of substitutes might suffice. For instance, where a defendant appeals a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, a joint statement of facts may satisfy his right of access to the record. The threshold requirement is that a criminal appellant be provided with \u201ca record of sufficient completeness to permit proper consideration of his claims.\u201d <em>Mayer v. City of Chicago, </em>404 U.S. at 194, 92 S.Ct. at 414 (quoting <em>Draper v. Washington, </em>372 U.S. at 499, 83 S.Ct. at 780). If a criminal appellant claims he must have access to the full transcript, he does not bear the burden of demonstrating the inadequacy of alternatives proposed by the State or suggested by a court in hindsight. <em>Britt v. North Carolina, </em>404 U.S. at 230, 92 S.Ct. at 435. Instead, when the grounds of his appeal indicate \u201ca colorable claim for a complete transcript, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>is on the State to show that only a portion of the transcript or an alternative will suffice for an effective appeal on those grounds.\u201d <em>Mayer v. City of Chicago, </em>404 U.S. at 195, 92 S.Ct. at 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded to that court with directions to issue the writs of habeas corpus unless within ninety days of the date of this judgment the New Hampshire Supreme Court agrees to accept from each appellant a brief written argument as to why his appeal should be accepted. There is no need to order the State to furnish the appellants with trial transcripts in this instance because they were ordered by the district court for the habeas proceedings and have been available to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>So Ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Costs awarded to appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Summary of the right to appeal by criminal defendants in the United States, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">ALABAMA</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The right to appeal is granted by ALA.

The author of the article is a former Associate Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court and was on the court when Rule 7(1) was adopted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">. <em>See </em>Appendix for a compilation of criminal appellate review procedures in all of the states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">. The Rule 25 method of summary disposition of appeals differs from the declination of acceptance procedure in that the decision is on the merits of the case unless the supreme court lacks jurisdiction. N.H.Sup.Ct.R. 25. In <em>Smith v. Goodnow, </em>No. C83-120-L (D.N.H. Sept. 26, 1983), the District Court of New Hampshire held that it violated due process to apply the Rule 25 procedure to a criminal appeal in which a claim of insufficiency of the evidence was asserted. The court held that due process did not permit the supreme court to decide on the merits that the evidence was sufficient, when it had not actually reviewed the record. The court, however, intimated that the Constitution would not be offended if the state supreme court declined to hear the case without reaching the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">. The State attempts to disparage the importance of the interest at stake here by noting the availability of other post-conviction remedies, such as habeas corpus, to correct alleged trial errors. Such remedies have no bearing on the determination of whether New Hampshire has offered appellants \"an adequate opportunity to present [their] claims fairly within the context of the State\u2019s appellate process.\" <em>Evitts v. Lu-cey, </em>469 U.S. at 402, 105 S.Ct. at 839. Moreover, we reject the intimation that a petition for habe-as corpus can serve as a substitute for meaningful state appellate review of a defendant\u2019s conviction. We are, however, aware that the federal district court in New Hampshire has, to some degree, been transformed into a state appellate court as a result of the state supreme court\u2019s utilization of the declination of acceptance procedure. A federal district court entertaining a habeas petition brought by a state prisoner under \u00a7 2254 normally orders the production of a transcript of petitioner\u2019s trial, if one is not already available. Thus, New Hampshire state prisoners are apt to receive a fuller opportunity to present their claims for review via a habeas petition than through the state appeal process. As a state-advanced remedy for the inadequacy of its own procedures, this not only places a burden on the federal government, but is contrary to the principle that a defendant must first exhaust his state rights. We have never heard it suggested before that habeas corpus was an excuse for not protecting them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. For example, when Colpitt was asked why he was in downtown Farmington, New Hampshire (the scene of the crime), he responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">A: Everything was crazy that afternoon and that, but I had enough sense in my head that I fairly well knew what I was doing and that, and even though a lot of outer forces and that were really bothering me and that, I never could understand that town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">Q: What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">A: Very, very conflictive town. Conflicting. In every way. No matter who you are you get conflictions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b249-10\">. The criminal defendants in <em>Draper, </em>like those here, were denied a full review on the merits of their appellate claims by the state supreme court. The <em>Draper </em>petitioners had sought review by certiorari in the Supreme Court of Washington of the trial court's refusal to furnish them with a transcript of their trial so that they could pursue their appellate claims. Pursuant to Washington law, the trial court refused to provide them with a transcript because it had found their appellate contentions to be frivolous. 372 U.S. at 492-93, 83 S.Ct. at 777-78. Petitioners sought review by certiorari of the trial court\u2019s denial of their transcript applications. The Washington Supreme Court quashed the writ, affirming the trial court\u2019s finding of frivolity and thus effectively denying petitioners an opportunity for a full review on the merits of their appellate claims. <em>Washington v. Long, </em>58 Wash.2d 830, 365 P.2d 31 (1961). The United States Supreme Court ruled that \"the Washington Supreme Court could not deny petitioners\u2019 request for review of the denial of the transcript motion without a \u2018record of sufficient completeness\u2019 to permit proper consideration of their claims.\" <em>Draper, </em>372 U.S. at 499, 83 S.Ct. at 780. The court\u2019s decision in <em>Draper </em>derived from its earlier holding in <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>which, as we have already noted, was rooted in both the due process and equal protection clauses. <em>Ev-itts v.
