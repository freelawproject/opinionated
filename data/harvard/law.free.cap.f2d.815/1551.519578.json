Petitioner California Por-taphone (\u201cPortaphone\u201d) claims that the use of a lottery procedure to select licensees for the Fresno, California market was an invalid retroactive application of the procedure, since comparative applications for the Fresno market had been filed before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number>Commission adopted a lottery procedure. The remaining challengers (hereinafter collectively the \u201cfill-in appellants\u201d) object to the Commission\u2019s treatment of their applications to provide \u201cfill-in\u201d service in various markets. The Commission returned the applications, finding that they were filed out of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s retroactive application of the lottery procedure to the Fresno market; we reverse the Commission\u2019s order rejecting application of appellant La Star Cellular Telephone Company (\u201cLa Star\u201d) in the New Orleans market as untimely and affirm the Commission\u2019s orders rejecting as untimely the remaining appellants\u2019 applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-6\">Confronted with a heavy demand for cellular telephone service and a large group of firms eager to provide it, the Federal Communications Commission has sought to streamline the procedures for awarding cellular licenses. The Commission has eliminated the standard comparative hearing used to select licensees and replaced it with a simplified comparative \u201cpaper hearing\u201d for the thirty largest cellular markets and with a lottery procedure for smaller markets. The Commission also has introduced special filing procedures and cut-off dates based on the market at issue in each proceeding. <em>Cellular Communications Systems, </em>86 F.C.C.2d 469, 498-503 (1981) <em>(Cellular Order); Cellular Communications Systems, </em>89 F.C.C.2d 58, 85-94 (1982) <em>(Reconsideration Order); Cellular Communications Systems, </em>90 F.C.C.2d 571, 572-75 (1982) <em>(Further Reconsideration Order); Cellular Lottery Rulemaking, Report and Order, </em>98 F.C.C.2d 175, 202-09 (1983) <em>(Cellular Lottery </em>Order). Further details of the Commission\u2019s decisions on these procedures are discussed separately as they relate to each of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-10\">We begin with Portaphone\u2019s challenge to the validity of the Commission's decision to extend its lottery procedures to Porta-phone\u2019s previously pending comparative application. Review of retroactive agency action \u201cis in each case a question of law, resolvable by reviewing courts with no overriding obligation to the agency[\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Retail, Wholesale &amp; Dep\u2019t Store Union v. NLRB, </em>466 F.2d 380, 390 (D.C. Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-12\">The Commission receives authority to use a lottery to award licenses for certain communications systems from section 309(i) of the Communications Act. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(i) (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although this statute was in place prior to the March, 1983 cut-off date for Portaphone\u2019s Fresno application, the Commission specifically proposed to employ a lottery in markets including Fresno after the date of Porta-phone\u2019s filing. Cellular Lottery Proceeding, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 48 Fed.Reg. 51,493 (proposed Oct. 23, 1983). Portaphone argues that the Commission\u2019s adoption of this lottery proposal for the Fresno market, a lottery Portaphone ultimately lost, is an invalid retroactive application of the rule. The Commission carefully and fully considered this objection in its <em>Cellular Lottery Order, </em>98 F.C.C.2d at 182-84, 188-89. The Commission\u2019s analysis is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-14\">As the Supreme Court has explained, retroactive enforcement of a rule is improper only if \u201cthe ill effect of the retroactive application\u201d of the rule outweighs the \u201cmischief\u201d of frustrating the interests the rule promotes. <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203, 67 S.Ct. 1575, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>1580, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947); <em>see Retail, Wholesale &amp; Dep\u2019t Store Union, </em>466 F.2d at 389-90. Since we believe that the \u201cill effect\u201d on Portaphone of the lottery\u2019s retroactive effect is little or none, and that the \u201cmischief\u201d caused by prohibiting retroactive effect would be significant, we reject Portaphone\u2019s contention and uphold the Commission\u2019s application of the lottery proposal to the Fresno market.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-5\">We turn first to the series of harms alleged by Portaphone. Portaphone complains that the belated decision to implement a lottery in lieu of a comparative hearing caused it unnecessarily to incur the costs of filing a comparative application. In fact, as the Commission noted, its decision has relieved Portaphone of the much greater expense in attorneys\u2019 fees, expert witness fees and the like that a comparative hearing would require. <em>Cellular Lottery Order, </em>98 F.C.C.2d at 183, 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-6\">Moreover, before Portaphone filed its application, it was on notice that the Commission might implement a lottery for cellular licenses. <em>See Cellular Order, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 499 (use of lottery may be required if \u201c[fjuture events\u201d so dictate). Thus Porta-phone could not reasonably rely on the continued use of comparative hearings. Portaphone also complains that had it known that a lottery would be instituted and application costs thus lowered, it would have applied for cellular franchises in other markets. Such an alleged lost opportunity is wholly speculative and does not rise to the level of detrimental reliance on the absence of a lottery procedure since, as the Commission noted, the number of markets an applicant seeks is a business decision governed primarily not by the litigation costs of comparative proceedings but by the ability of the applicant to fund and construct a system in each market. 98 F.C.C.2d at 183 n. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-7\">Portaphone furthermore argues that it has been deprived of its right to a comparative hearing under <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945). The <em>Ashbacker </em>decision found no such \u201cright,\u201d but merely held that the Commission must use the same set of procedures to process the applications of all similarly situated persons who come before it seeking the same license. <em>See Multi-State Communications, Inc. v. FCC, </em>728 F.2d 1519, 1525-26 (D.C.Cir.1984). Since all persons seeking the Fresno market\u2019s license became equally subject to the lottery procedure, the Commission fully satisfied the <em>Ashbacker </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-9\">In short, since Portaphone has suffered neither the deprivation of a right nor the imposition of new and unexpected liabilities or obligations, Portaphone has not suffered any significant injury from the retroactive effect of the lottery procedure. <em>See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 295, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 1772, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-10\">On the other side of the <em>Chenery </em>balance is the question of whether retroactive application of the lottery procedure furthers the purposes underlying implementation of a lottery. We think it unquestionable that the Commission\u2019s overriding concern with efficient processing of the many applications for cellular licenses, which it explained in the <em>Cellular Lottery Order, </em>98 F.C.C.2d at 181-82, fully justifies the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>See Pappas v. FCC, </em>807 F.2d 1019, 1022 (D.C.Cir.1986) (large number of multipoint distribution service applications already on file supported Commission\u2019s decision to institute lottery). Indeed, Congress intended the Commission to have the power to impose a lottery retroactively to further the lottery statute\u2019s purpose of preventing excessive delays and costs in license decisions. <em>See 47 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 309(i)(l) (1982) (\u201c[fjf <em>there is </em>more than one application,\u201d Commission may award license by lottery (emphasis added)). This point is clearly made in the legislative history, which shows that among the factors the Commission may rely on in establishing a lottery are a large number of mutually exclusive applications for each license and the \u201cexistence of a backlog\u201d of applications \u2014 factors that could be assessed only <em>after </em>applications had been received. H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 765, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 37-38 (1982), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1982, pp. 2237, 2281-2282. In particular, the Commission\u2019s use of the lottery as an incentive to promote settlements among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>competing applicants further illustrates the beneficial effects of a lottery; indeed, after the Commission decided to use a lottery, applicants in all but two markets subsequently settled among themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-4\">We conclude that the Commission\u2019s decision to apply the lottery in the Fresno market to applications that were already filed was within its statutory authority and was fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-6\">The challenge brought by the fill-in appellants involves the reach of the procedures employed by the Commission to fix dates by geographic market on which cellular license applications would be due. Appellants assert that the deadlines established by these procedures may not validly apply to fill-in applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-7\">We hold that the deadlines may validly apply to a fill-in application unless that application was filed in response to a major amendment expanding the service area of an incumbent licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-9\">In the <em>Cellular Order, </em>the Commission determined to divide the cellular spectrum in each geographic market between two cellular licensees, one a \u201cwireline\u201d applicant, <em>i.e., </em>a telephone company providing local exchange service (such as one of the Bell operating companies) and the other a non-wireline applicant. <em>Cellular Order, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 482-83. A cellular licensee need not serve the entirety of a geographic market area. Rather, the <em>Cellular Order </em>mandated that each cellular applicant seek a license to serve a self-defined \u201cmarket\u201d called its cellular geographic service area (\u201cCGSA\u201d): The CGSA \u201cis the area defined by the applicant as the area it intends to serve.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For example, the CGSA for the successful wireline applicant in the New Orleans market included only 8.8% of that market as defined by the Census Bureau. <em>See supra </em>note 2. Each competing applicant\u2019s selection of its CGSA is crucial to the success of its application, since applications for CGSAs that materially overlap trigger a comparative evaluation of the applications by the Commission. 86 F.C.C.2d at 510.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1652-14\">A cellular fill-in application is an application for cellular service, filed after the initial award of cellular licenses, to \u201cfill in,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>serve a part of the SMSA outside the CGSAs of the initial cellular licensees. For example, if the Commission had awarded licenses in the New York SMSA to two applicants whose CGSAs comprised only the City of New York, a fill-in applicant might thereafter seek to serve a CGSA comprising only Westchester County (also a part of the New York SMSA). Appellant La Star filed its fill-in application in response to an attempt by the incumbent wireline licensee in the New Orleans market to expand its CGSA into unserved parts of that market.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The other fill-in appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>lants filed unopposed fill-in applications for areas of the Boston, Gary, Minneapolis-St. Paul and St. Louis markets that the incumbent licensees neither served nor sought to serve.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on the deadlines whose establishment is discussed below, the Commission rejected each appellant\u2019s application, filed after the pertinent cut-off date,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-4\">The fill-in appellants argue that the Commission\u2019s imposition of these procedures on fill-in applications was effected without adequate notice to appellants, without proper promulgation under the Administrative Procedure Act, and in violation of the rule established by <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC. </em>Although we hold that the Commission\u2019s notice to appellant La Star of the deadline for the New Orleans market was insufficient, we otherwise find appellants\u2019 arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-6\">To assess the challenges to the Commission\u2019s rule on fill-in applications, we cannot avoid a detailed discussion of the cellular licensing process as presented in the Commission\u2019s statements setting out its procedures for cellular applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-7\">If the CGSAs defined by two applicants overlap, then under the <em>Cellular Order </em>the applications are deemed mutually exclusive and the license is awarded by a comparative proceeding between the competing applicants. <em>Cellular Order, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 510; <em>see </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 22.31(a)(1), 22.916(a) (1986). In contrast, if an applicant seeks a license for a CGSA that does not overlap with another applicant\u2019s, the applicant will receive the license so long as it meets the Commission\u2019s basic qualification requirements. <em>See </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 501-02. But under the Commission\u2019s general rules on public notice and cut-off dates, left unchanged by the <em>Cellular Order, id. </em>at 510, a later applicant would be able to force a comparative proceeding with a previously filed application by filing a competing application for an overlapping CGSA. That is, if a person becomes aware of a pending license application and wishes to obtain the license for that area himself, he may file an application of his own for the license and obtain a comparative hearing on the license before the Commission with the prior applicant. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.31(b) (1986) (comparative consideration of mutually exclusive applications required if later application filed by earlier of (1) 60 days after date of general public notice listing first application as acceptable for filing or (2) one business day before Commission\u2019s final action on first application).</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-10\">The <em>Cellular Order </em>further amended the Commission\u2019s rules to deem any amendment proposing expansion of a cellular licensee\u2019s CGSA a \u201cmajor\u201d amendment under the rules. 86 F.C.C.2d at 509, 510, 561 (amending 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.23(c) (1986)). The Commission\u2019s general rules define a \u201cmajor\u201d amendment to a license in force as an amendment subject to the general public notice, cut-off, and comparative evaluation provisions discussed above. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.23(c) (1986). As a result, under the Commission\u2019s rules as established by the <em>Cellular Order, </em>a licensee\u2019s later attempt to expand its CGSA would also be open to challenge by anyone who filed a competing application before the applicable cut-off date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-11\">In the <em>Cellular Reconsideration Order, </em>the Commission found it necessary to alter the procedural scheme established by the</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number><em>Cellular Order. </em>Two alterations are notable for our purposes. First, the Commission limited the maximum CGSA an applicant may propose to approximately the size of the Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area that its CGSA includes. <em>Reconsideration Order, </em>89 F.C.C.2d at 86-87. Second, the Commission implemented special filing rules for cellular applications in the 30 largest SMSAs to replace the general public notice and cut-off periods retained by the <em>Cellular Order. Reconsideration Order, id. </em>at 87-94. Specifically, the Commission established a single filing date for \u201c[a]ll applications, both wireline and non-wireline, for the 30 largest\u201d SMSAs. <em>Id. </em>at 89. The Commission stated further that \u201c[applications will be accepted for these markets after the date certain only if one, or both, [of the] frequency blocks is not applied for on that date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commission subsequently extended this date-certain cut-off procedure to the 90 largest SMSAs. <em>Further Reconsideration Order, </em>90 F.C.C.2d at 572-75. In short, this second change set the deadline for filing an application using fixed dates by market area rather than through reference to each application\u2019s mutual exclusivity with a previously filed application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-5\">With this history of the Commission\u2019s procedures in mind, we consider whether any of these fill-in applications is barred as untimely by the Commission\u2019s date-certain cut-off rules for cellular applications. Appellants offer three reasons why the cut-off rules do not support rejection of their fill-in applications as untimely. First, they claim that they received inadequate notice that the cut-off rules meant to reach fill-in applications. Second, they claim that the cutoff rules were invalidly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice and comment requirements, set out in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982). Third, they claim that the Commission\u2019s rejection of their applications violates the rule of <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945). We consider each of these objections in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-8\">1. The legal standard regarding the Commission\u2019s duty to provide license applicants adequate notice of its requirements has been previously explained by this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1654-9\">It is beyond dispute that an applicant should not be placed in the position of going forward with an application without knowledge of requirements established by the Commission, and elementary fairness requires clarity of standards sufficient to apprise an applicant of what is expected. As Judge Leventhal stated in <em>Radio Athens, Inc., (WATH) v.

FCC, </em>535 F.2d 78, 82 (D.C.Cir. 1976) (citation and footnote omitted) (Commission\u2019s rejection of broadcast license application lacking required information upheld). <em>Accord Salzer v. FCC, </em>778 F.2d 869, 875 (D.C.Cir.1985) (Commission\u2019s requirement that applications be \u201cletter-perfect\u201d defeated by Commission\u2019s \u201cincomplete\u201d or \u201cambiguous\u201d instructions to applicants).</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-13\">The Commission\u2019s public pronouncements on the deadline for fill-in applications have been needlessly unclear. The Commission is able to state its position clearly, as it did in footnote 81 of the <em>Cellular Lottery </em>Order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unfortunately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1559\">*1559</page-number>the Commission offered this discussion only after the cut-off dates for the appellants before us had long passed. The Commission\u2019s earlier statements on the fill-in issue were less clear. Throughout its consideration of the award of cellular licenses, the Commission has focused on the applicant who sought to serve the core of the SMSAs, the large central urban areas most in need of cellular service. <em>See, e.g., Cellular Order, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 510 (comparative evaluation will be given to competing applicants \u201cin the same central city\u201d). Nonetheless, the consistent language used by the Commission referred broadly to applications for \u201cmarkets\u201d or \u201cSMSAs.\u201d Specifically, the Commission used this language to describe the application cut-off procedure established by the <em>Reconsideration Order:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1655-5\">[I]n our [Cellular] Order we said that cellular applicants should follow the public notice and cut-off periods generally applicable to mobile services under Part 22 of our Rules. 86 FCC2d at 510. However, after further reflection, we have decided to make special provision <em>for cellular applications in the top 30 SMSAs </em>in order to avoid unnecessary processing delays that might result from inundating the agency with a large num-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1655-9\">ber of applications filed at the same time____ Accordingly, we will accept <em>applications for the 30 largest SMSAs </em>... on the 90th day after publication of this Order in the Federal Register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1655-12\"><em>All applications, </em>both wireline and non-wireline, <em>for the 30 largest modified SMSAs </em>will fall due on a date certain as specified above. <em>Applications </em>will be accepted <em>for these markets </em>after the date certain only if one, or both, [of the] frequency blocks is not applied for on that date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1655-13\">89 F.C.C.2d at 87-89 (emphasis added). It is this language, the Commission now argues to us, that provided the fill-in appellants with notice that their ability to fill in would end at the cut-off date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1655-14\">The Commission\u2019s lack of clarity in the <em>Reconsideration Order </em>is unfortunate. Nonetheless, we find that the language quoted above sufficed, though just barely, to give notice to NITCO and other appellants similarly situated that the Commission would not accept a fill-in application filed in the first instance after the cut-off date.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s broad phrasing cannot reasonably be read to suggest that only applications for a \u201clarge area within\u201d the SMSA or for a \u201clarge part\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>SMSA would be subject to the cutoff. The Commission also in no way indicated that the deadline would cut off only applications in the relevant SMSA for CGSAs believed by the applicant to be electrically mutually exclusive, as NITCO seems to suggest. It stated rather that \u201call\u201d applications in the SMSA would be cut off, or referred without qualification to the cut-off of \u201capplications.\u201d Quite simply, the Commission\u2019s language indicated to any reasonable reader that applications to serve any territory \u201cin\u201d or \u201cfor\u201d a pertinent SMSA, 89 F.C. C.2d at 87, 89, would be cut off by the deadline. Further, the Commission has not as a general matter distinguished between fill-in and non-fill-in applicants for procedural purposes. That the Commission easily could have been completely clear by stating its position in so many words shows a regrettable and needless deficiency in drafting, but this deficient statement was nonetheless enough, we believe, to give notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-4\">La Star\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s rejection of its application requires a different result. La Star filed its fill-in application in response to a major amendment by an incumbent licensee that sought to expand its CGSA. <em>See supra </em>note 4. As noted above, the Commission\u2019s general procedures routinely permit a major amendment by a licensee to be opposed by a timely subsequent competing submission in a comparative proceeding. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 22.23, 22.27, 22.31, 22.35 (1986). The <em>Cellular Order </em>had indicated that these procedures would specifically apply to an amendment to expand a licensee\u2019s CGSA. 86 F.C.C.2d at 510 (general public notice and cut-off procedures will apply to changes in CGSA). La Star\u2019s application therefore was timely if governed by the Commission\u2019s general procedures as indicated in the <em>Cellular Order, </em>because La Star filed within the 60 days allowed after public notice of a major amendment. <em>Compare supra </em>note 4 <em>with </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.-31(b)(2) (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-7\">Nothing in the language we have quoted above and nothing elsewhere in the <em>Reconsideration Order </em>informed La Star that the <em>Reconsideration Order </em>superseded the <em>Cellular Order </em>in this respect; thus La Star had no notice that it might lose its ability to choose between filing an initial application before the cut-off for the fringe area it sought or contesting with a competing application an incumbent licensee\u2019s major amendment filed after the cut-off to serve that fringe area. The Commission has clearly indicated in its cellular pronouncements that an incumbent licensee is not barred by any cut-off from seeking expansion of its CGSA through major amendment. <em>See Cellular Lottery Order, </em>98 F.C.C.2d at 204 n. 81; <em>Cellular Order, </em>86 F.C.C.2d at 509 (countenancing applications \u201cto change the boundaries of a CGSA\u201d). But only in footnote 81 of the <em>Cellular Lottery Order, supra </em>note 7, did the Commission first indicate that such an amendment could not be challenged by a competing application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the Commission failed to provide sufficient notice to La Star of the scope of the cut-off procedure established by the <em>Reconsideration Order, </em>the Commission may not reject La Star\u2019s competing fill-in application. <em>See Ridge Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>292 F.2d 770, 773 (D.C.Cir.1961) (public notice of cut-off date must \u201cfairly advise prospective applicants of what is being cut off by the notice\u201d). Accordingly, we order the Commission to reinstate La Star\u2019s application <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1656-8\">2. NITCO next claims that the fill-in cut-off procedure was invalidly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act because the Commission failed to comply with the notice and comment requirements of substantive rulemaking set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 (1982). This argument lacks merit. The cut-off rule arguably may be understood as an \u201cinterpretative\u201d rule, a rule of agency \u201cprocedure\u201d or of agency \u201cpractice,\u201d any of which is exempt from the notice and comment requirements, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 553(b)(A). But we need not decide this issue, since we believe that the cut-off rule did receive the required notice and comment as part of the <em>Cellular Reconsideration Order. </em>Initially, the Commission released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \u201clooking toward the amendment of Parts 2 and 22 of the Commission\u2019s Rules ... concerning policies, standards and procedures for licensing and implementation of cellular communications systems.\u201d 78 F.C.C.2d 984, 984 (1980). In particular, the Notice offered for comment a proposed \u201chybrid procedure\u201d to replace the traditional comparative hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1000-01. Although this scheme proposed no date-certain cut-off deadline, the Notice also specifically sought comment on \u201cestablishment of a firm deadline for the submission of issue pleadings related to the mutually exclusive applications,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1001, sought comment on a wide range of other procedures, <em>id. </em>at 1000-02, and stated further that \u201c[i]t is not our intent that rules presently applicable\u201d to services regulated by the Commission \u201cautomatically apply to cellular service,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1002 n. 36. This Notice, we believe, provided the opportunity for notice and comment required by the APA. Publication of the <em>Cellular Order </em>and <em>Reconsideration Order </em>thus established validly promulgated Commission rules concerning the cut-off procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-5\">3. Finally, NITCO argues that <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945), requires us to conclude that the cut-off procedure violated its alleged right to a comp\u00e1rafive hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This contention need not long detain us. <em>Ashbacker </em>held that the Commission could not award a license without granting a timely competing application the comparative hearing required by its own rules. <em>Ashbacker </em>therefore simply is irrelevant to a situation where a license applicant complains that its application was not considered due to a \u201cregulation\u201d that \u201cfor orderly administration, requires an application ... to be filed within a certain date,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 333 n. 9, 66 S.Ct. at 151 n. 9 (noting that the case before the Court did not involve this situation). Indeed, this court has recognized that the <em>Ashbacker </em>decision \u201csuggested\u201d that the Commission may properly employ \u201ccut-off procedure[s].\u201d <em>Committee for Open Media v. FCC, </em>543 F.2d 861, 873 &amp; n. 79 (D.C.Cir. 1976). Only by compliance with such procedures may an application enter the ranks of <em>\u201cbona fide </em>applications\u201d protected by <em>Ashbacker, </em>326 U.S. at 333, 66 S.Ct. at 151. <em>See Reuters, Ltd. v. FCC, </em>781 F.2d 946, 951 (D.C.Cir.1986) <em>(Ashbacker </em>\u201capplies not to prospective applicants, <em>but only to parties whose applications have been declared mutually exclusive\u201d) </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-8\">The heavy demand for a new product, cellular telephone licenses, has forced the Commission to narrow drastically the procedures it routinely employs to process license requests for established services. Apart from a lack of fair notice to those applicants that seek to contest territorial expansion by incumbent licensees, we find the Commission\u2019s cut-off rules and retroactive application of its lottery process entirely reasonable and lawful. Accordingly, we order the Commission to reinstate La Star\u2019s fill-in application <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>but af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>firm the Commission\u2019s rejection of the applications from the other fill-in appellants and the Commission\u2019s use of the lottery procedure to reject Portaphone\u2019s license application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-4\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1650-7\">.

On August 17, 1983, approximately one month after the Commission granted the unopposed application of wireline carrier New Orleans CGSA, Inc. (\"NOCGSA\") to serve some 8.8% of the New Orleans SMSA, the Commission issued a public notice of NOCGSA\u2019s application to enlarge its authorized CGSA within the New Orleans market. In response to the public notice listing NOCGA\u2019s enlargement application, La Star on September 16, 1983 filed a mutually exclusive application to serve the area comprised by NOCGSA's proposed enlargement along with additional New Orleans SMSA territory. La Star\u2019s application was not mutually exclusive with any part of NOCGSA\u2019s original CGSA. The Commission's Common Carrier Bureau found that the cut-off scheme of the <em>Cellular Reconsideration Order </em>rendered La Star\u2019s petition untimely; it thus rejected La Star\u2019s application as improperly filed and granted NOCGSA\u2019s now-unopposed enlargement application.
