(\u201cSuper Fresh\u201d). This negligence action originated in the Court of Common Pleas for the County of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was removed on Super Fresh\u2019s motion to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship. The district court held that Mary Joyce was an employee of Super Fresh at the time the relevant events transpired, and, therefore, the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et seq. </em>(Pur-don 1952) provided Joyce with her exclusive remedy. <em>Joyce v. Super Fresh Food Markets, Inc., </em>640 F.Supp. 721, 725 (E.D.Pa. 1986). Because we believe that there are genuine issues of material fact concerning the relationship between Joyce and Super Fresh, we will reverse the order of the district court and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-18\">In August 1982, Super Market Services, Inc. (\u201cSMS\u201d) hired Mary Joyce to work in the Super Fresh market located in Levit-town, Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Super Fresh and SMS are both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company (\u201cA &amp; P\u201d). SMS supplies health and beauty products as well as other merchandise to Super Fresh, A &amp; P, and other stores incorporated under the A &amp; P banner. A &amp; P created SMS for labor and tax reasons. Joyce and other SMS employees are non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>union; whereas, wage-earners employed by Super Fresh are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">Though Joyce was hired by SMS, she worked exclusively in the Super Fresh Lev-ittown store. However, at work she wore an SMS uniform and badge, and her duties were confined to shelving and creating displays for SMS products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">On October 6, 1983, Joyce was performing her duties in the Levittown store. While she was transferring merchandise from shipping boxes to a cart, a large wooden pallet fell and struck Joyce on the leg and foot. As a result, she sustained serious injury, and this lawsuit ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">On the day of trial, the district judge held a pre-trial conference during which the attorneys for Super Fresh submitted a motion for summary judgment. Joyce\u2019s attorney objected to any consideration of the motion until he had an opportunity to study it and reply. The trial judge did not rule on the motion at that time and apparently represented to the parties that he would treat the motion and supporting brief as a trial brief. Indeed, there is no entry on the docket sheet indicating that a motion for summary judgment was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">The judge also stated at the pre-trial conference that he would trifurcate the trial, and that the first issue to be tried would be whether Joyce was an employee of Super Fresh. Despite the fact that Joyce\u2019s attorney made a jury demand, the judge went on to rule that the first issue would be tried without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">A few days after testimony was taken on the issue of Joyce\u2019s employment status, the trial judge, to the surprise of Joyce\u2019s attorney, entered an opinion and order granting summary judgment to Super Fresh on the ground that the suit was barred by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It is from this order that the present appeal was taken. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-10\">Appellant attacks the district court\u2019s order on two grounds. First, she claims that summary judgment was entered in violation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) which requires summary judgment motions to \u201cbe served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing.\u201d Second, appellant argues that there remains various genuine issues of material fact, and therefore the case is not ripe for summary judgment. Because we agree with appellant\u2019s second assertion, we need not and will not address the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">The district court found two bases for concluding that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act bars the appellant from recovering in negligence. First, the district court found that Super Fresh was Joyce\u2019s actual employer and therefore was immune from suit under the exclusivity provision of the Act. <em>see </em>77 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 481 (Purdon 1952) and 77 Pa.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 21 (Purdon 1952). Second, the court noted that A &amp; P had incurred all the costs of Joyce\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation benefits; thus, even if SMS was Joyce\u2019s actual employer, it would be appropriate to \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d and grant immunity to all subsidiaries of A &amp; P. We will examine the latter basis first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">The district court cited no authority for its conclusion that sibling corporations should be treated as a single employer for purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation, and Pennsylvania authority indicates that such unitary treatment is disfavored. In <em>Mohan v. Publicker Industries, Inc., </em>422 Pa. 588, 222 A.2d 876 (1966), for instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court clearly stated that a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary are separate entities for purposes of workmen\u2019s compensation. Similarly, in <em>Butera v. Western Ice &amp; Utilities Co., </em>140 Pa.Super. 329, 333, 14 A.2d 219, 221 (1940), the Superior Court said of two corporations with common stockholders and common management, \u201cAs to their relations to an employee under the compensation law each corporation must be regarded as a separate entity and the labor performed by a workman for one of them cannot be cumulated with an agreement to perform services for the other____\u201d While neither <em>Mohan </em>nor <em>Butera </em>involved two wholly owned subsidiaries of a parent corporation, we can think of no reason why the logic of these cases should not apply with full force here. The district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>rationale for piercing the corporate veil was that A &amp; P would otherwise ultimately bear the double burden of a workmen\u2019s compensation award and of any adverse tort judgment. However, under <em>Mohan, </em>this would not seem to provide a sufficient reason for piercing the corporate veil. Nor can we say that leaving the corporate veil intact would work any injustice. A &amp; P chose to construct a complex corporate family structure. Super Fresh and SMS were incorporated under different charters in different states. They have separate management and are held out to the public and their employees as separate entities. This structure has afforded the A &amp; P family various tax and labor advantages. Notably, this corporate configuration has allowed the family to keep part of its workforce \u2014 the part of which appellant was a member \u2014 non-union. While we certainly do not begrudge the A &amp; P family these fruits, we will not sympathetically listen as they complain of the other consequences. Piercing the corporate veil is appropriate when \u201cthe court must prevent fraud, illegality or injustice or when recognition of the corporate entity would defeat public policy____\u201d <em>Zubik v. Zubik, </em>384, F.2d 267 (3rd Cir.1967) cert. denied, 390 U.S. 988, 88 S.Ct. 1183, 19 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1968). Here, we see no reason to raze the walls which A &amp; P so carefully built.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">Having rejected the district court\u2019s conclusion that Super Fresh and SMS should be viewed as a single entity, we now must decide whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment on the basis of Super Fresh\u2019s assertion that it was Joyce\u2019s actual employer. Joyce claims, of course, that SMS was her employer and that her papers and pleadings raise genuine issues of material fact on the matter, and therefore the district court erred in granting summary judgment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">In determining which of two affiliated corporations is the employer of a particular employee, a court must ask which corporation has the right to control the work to be done by the employee and the manner of performing it. <em>Mohan, </em>422 Pa. at 591, 222 A.2d at 879. Thus, the test is the same as the one used when determining whether a general or a special employer is responsible for the workmen\u2019s compensation of a \u201cborrowed servant.\u201d <em>See English v. Lehigh County Auth., </em>286 Pa.Super. 312, 322-23, 428 A.2d 1343, 1349 (1981) and cases cited therein. However, when two affiliated corporations are involved, the <em>Mohan </em>case instructs us to begin our inquiry with \u201ca consideration of the functions performed by every interested party \u2014 each corporation and the injured employee____\u201d <em>Mohan, </em>422 Pa. at 592, 93, 222 A.2d at 879. In <em>Mohan, </em>the issue was whether the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was an employee of a parent corporation or of its wholly owned subsidiary. The parent corporation was in the business of producing industrial alcohol and chemicals; whereas, the subsidiary produced whiskey intended for human consumption. The plaintiffs decedent worked in the subsidiary\u2019s plant. She was carried to her death while working on a whiskey crating machine owned by the subsidiary. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled, that without regard to any other indicia of control, the plaintiff\u2019s decedent must be regarded as an employee of the subsidiary because her job was in furtherance of a function of the subsidiary. <em>Id. </em>at 593, 222 A.2d at 879. Unfortunately, a functional analysis does not provide a clear-cut answer in this case. The function of SMS is to supply various products to Super Fresh and other A &amp; P affiliated stores. The function of Super Fresh is to retail various products supplied by SMS and other wholesalers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Joyce\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>job entailed placing SMS products on Super Fresh\u2019s shelves. Thus, Joyce\u2019s job may be seen as the last leg in SMS\u2019s endeavor to supply Super Fresh with merchandise. In this respect Joyce\u2019s function was not dissimilar to that of a deliveryperson for a soft drink distributor or other wholesaler. Putting another light on the matter, however, one could observe that shelving products and creating displays are vital functions in any large retail business. Thus, in performing her job, Joyce certainly furthered Super Fresh\u2019s primary mission. In short, a functional analysis is of little aid in our query.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">We therefore turn to other indicia of the right to control. In determining which of two employers possesses the right to control an employee, Pennsylvania courts have looked at several factors including which party has the right to hire and the right to fire,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Walters v. Kaufmann Department Stores, </em>334 Pa. 233, 236, 5 A.2d 559, 560 (1939), which party has the obligation to pay wages, <em>Sweet v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Rd., </em>457 Pa. 456, 462, 322 A.2d 362, 365 (1974), which party supplies the employee with the tools of her job, <em>Mohan, </em>422 Pa. at 591, 222 A.2d at 878, and to which party the employee normally reports, <em>Walters, </em>334 Pa. at 237, 5 A.2d at 560. In deciding whether Super Fresh was the employer at the time of the accident \u201cany discrepancies in the facts would be for a jury to resolve; however, whether the facts as they are determined to exist constitute an employment relationship is strictly a question of law.\u201d <em>English, </em>286 Pa.Super. at 322, 428 A.2d at 1348. Thus, the key question on our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is whether there are material discrepancies in the record as to the existence <em>vel non </em>of the factors listed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">The district court found that Super Fresh \u201cclearly\u201d has the right to hire SMS employees such as Joyce. We find the record equivocal on the matter. Both Joyce and her coworker, Betty Dutton, testified that they were hired by Bob Mills, an employee of SMS, after filling out applications that contained the SMS logo. However, Mr. Timothy Courtney, the Vice-President of Taxes of A &amp; P, testified that though prospective SMS employees are initially interviewed by SMS officers, the manager of the Super Fresh store in which the prospective employee is to work has the final word in the hiring decision. Courtney\u2019s testimony was corroborated by John Williams, the manager of the Super Fresh store in which Joyce worked. Williams stated that he personally interviewed Joyce and upon his recommendation Joyce was formally hired by Mills.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This testimony, however, is inconsistent with that of Joyce. Both at trial and in deposition, Joyce indicated that she was interviewed only by Mills and other SMS employees. Further, she stated that during this one interview, she was given an on-the-spot offer of employment. Assuming, as we must on review of a grant of summary judgment, that the appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>version is correct, we must conclude that no Super Fresh officer was even consulted as to the decision to hire Joyce. The district court\u2019s finding on this matter was, therefore, in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">The district court also found that Super Fresh \u201cclearly\u201d has the right to remove SMS employees. Again, we find evidence to the contrary in the record, and we must conclude that the district court engaged in fact-finding that is impermissible when ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Williams, the Super Fresh store manager, admitted that the power to fire Joyce rested with Joanne Nice, a SMS supervisor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the trial, Williams stated, however, that he had the power to suspend Joyce and other SMS employees, but even this latter testimony is refuted by Williams\u2019 own deposition testimony indicating that if a disciplinary problem arose with an SMS employee, then Nice would be called in to handle it. In sum, there is little evidence supporting the district court\u2019s conclusion that Super Fresh had the power to fire Joyce, and what little evidence exists is certainly controverted in the record. As to the obligation to pay wages, the district court noted \u201cthat all employees be they SMS or Super Fresh, received their pay or salary from funds drawn on the A &amp; P payroll system.\u201d 640 F.Supp. at 723. While it may be true that A &amp; P managed the payrolls for all A &amp; P subsidiaries, Super Fresh\u2019s position is not strengthened by virtue of the fact. <em>See Mohan, </em>422 Pa. at 591, 222 A.2d at 878 (fact that parent managed payroll of subsidiary is irrelevant). As stated earlier, it is not appropriate to pierce the corporate veil in this case; therefore, the fact that A &amp; P managed SMS\u2019s payroll is not at all probative on the question whether <em>Super Fresh </em>may be considered as Joyce\u2019s employer. Further, the district court\u2019s payroll analysis obscures the uncontradicted fact that Joyce\u2019s paychecks bore the insignia of SMS (or Kwick Save; <em>see </em>note 1, <em>supra). </em>The district court also failed to mention that Super Fresh paychecks and SMS paychecks are distributed in completely different manners. Joyce and other employees getting SMS paychecks receive checks at their homes; whereas, Super Fresh paychecks are distributed on the store premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">The district court apparently did not consider which party supplied Joyce with the tools of her job. While this indicium of control is often given special prominence in Pennsylvania cases, <em>see id., Reasner v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, </em>36 Pa. Commw. 292, 387 A.2d 679 (1978); <em>Biter v. Department of Labor and Indus., </em>39 Pa.Commw. 391, 395 A.2d 669 (1978), the district court\u2019s omission is not critical. What little evidence exists on this subject indicates that both SMS and Super Fresh supplied Joyce with her tools; thus, this factor provides little guidance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">Finally, the district court stated, \u201cIt is undisputed that SMS employees, such as Joyce, reported on a daily basis to the store manager for direction as to the performance of their duties.\u201d 640 F.Supp. at 724. We find no record support for this conclusion. Indeed, Williams testified that he did not even know that Joyce had reported to work on the day of her injury. He further stated that it is not within the store manager\u2019s duties to supervise employees on a day-to-day basis, and that the only instructions he ever gave to SMS employees were where to build special displays; however, he often gave similar instructions to deliv-erypersons for independent vendors such as Tasty Cake, Pepsi Cola, and Enten-mann\u2019s. Williams also admitted that he did not have the power to set Joyce\u2019s work hours and that SMS employees \u201cmore or less set ... their own schedules.\u201d In addition, Joyce testified that her supervisor was Nice of SMS, and that she was instructed to be polite and respectful to the Super Fresh manager but not to take orders from him. Joyce further said that she received all of her training from SMS employees. In short, there is little evidence in support of the district court\u2019s finding that Joyce normally reported to the Super Fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>store manager,,and certainly it was incorrect for the court to make such a finding in the context of a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">As the foregoing discussion indicates, the district court made various findings concerning key indicia of control that were either erroneous or controverted in the record. Accordingly, we will reverse the order granting summary judgment and remand the case for trial so that the factual controversies may be resolved by a jury.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">. It is somewhat unclear whether Joyce was hired by SMS or its wholly owned subsidiary, Kwick Save, Inc. For the purposes of this Iitigation, however, it makes no difference whether Kwick Save or SMS was the actual hiring party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1042-7\">. After citing to <em>Mohan, </em>the district court offered the following functional analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-8\">It is undisputed that SMS was created for labor and tax considerations as a support organization for food stores of the parent corporation, A &amp; P, and other subsidiary corporations of the parent. It is also undisputed that the primary duty of a Super Fresh store manager is to insure that his store is operated at a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1042-12\">profit, and that the manager is responsible for all aspects of the store operation. Consequently, he has broad discretion in making decisions which affect the profitability of the store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1042-13\"><em>Joyce, </em>640 F.Supp. at 724. We do not believe that it is helpful to observe that the function of Super Fresh is to \"make a profit,\" nor do we believe that, in <em>Mohan, </em>the Pennsylvania Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>preme Court contemplated that a corporation\u2019s function should be so expansively described. However, since we do not base our decision on a functional analysis, we will not dwell on this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1043-11\">. The district court, relying on <em>Mauk v. Wright, </em>367 F.Supp. 961 (M.D.Pa.1973), indicated that the right to select and the right to remove are elements which must be proven in addition to the right to control in order to establish an employer-employee relationship. It is true that some cases indicate that the rights to select, remove, and control are three separate elements which must be proven in order to establish a master-servant relationship for purposes of making a claim on a theory of respondeat superior. <em>See, e.g., Mauk, </em>367 F.Supp. at 967; <em>McColligan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Ry. Co., </em>214 Pa. 229, 63 A.2d 792 (1906). This three part test has been used in certain other contexts. <em>See Sweet v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Rd., </em>457 Pa. 456, 322 A.2d 362 (1974) (three part test used in establishing labor bargaining unit). However, in determining which of two employers is entitled to immunity under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Pennsylvania courts use a one part \"right to control\u201d test. <em>See English, </em>286 Pa.Super. at 322, 428 A.2d at 1349. Nonetheless, in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation context, the rights to select and remove ihay be considered as indicia of the right to control. <em>See Walters, </em>334 Pa. at 236, 5 A.2d at 560.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1043-13\">. This trial testimony is apparently contradicted by Williams\u2019 own deposition testimony in which he indicated that neither Mills nor any other SMS officer participated in hiring Joyce.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1044-6\">. In his trial testimony, Williams claimed that he could dismiss an SMS employee only if he caught the employee stealing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
