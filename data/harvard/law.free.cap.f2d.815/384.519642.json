In <em>Garcia, </em>the Board of Immigration Appeals reversed a finding of deporta-bility based upon the disposition of a pos-sessory offense under the Texas Deferred Adjudication Statute because there was no final adjudication of guilt under Texas law. In <em>Garcia, </em>however, unlike our case, there was no basis for believing that Garcia was trafficking the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-27\">Congress provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(23) for the deportability of any alien who \u201cimmigration officers know or <em>have reason to believe </em>is or has been an illicit trafficker\u201d of marijuana. This statutory provision provides the basis for deportability. <em>Nunez-Payan v. I.N.S., </em>811 F.2d 264, 267 (5th Cir.1987). The Board of Immigration Appeals has consistently held that convictions are unnecessary to establish a basis of exclusion where the Immigration Judge has a reason to believe that the petitioner has \u201ctrafficked\u201d marijuana. <em>See Matter of Favela, </em>16 I &amp; N 753, 756 (BIA 1979); <em>Matter of RICO, </em>(Interim Deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sion No. 2576, April 15, 1977). If exclusion can be warranted where criminal charges are actually dismissed, <em>see Favela, </em>16 I &amp; N at 756, then exclusion is warranted where the petitioner has admitted his criminal act and is placed on probation by the State. While the admission is not a \u201cconviction\u201d under Texas law, it may form the basis for a reasonable belief under \u00a7 1182(a)(23).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Nunez-Payan\u2019s attempt to distinguish his act from trafficking is without merit. Nunez-Payan was found to be in possession of one pound of marijuana at a border traffic checkpoint. He admits that he was transporting marijuana for the use of others, not merely for his personal use. These facts provide a sufficient basis for the Immigration Judge to believe that he was an illicit \u201ctrafficker\u201d of drugs. Whether or not he was doing so for personal profit is of no consequence. <em>Matter of R... H..\u201e</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">It is therefore ordered that the petition for rehearing filed in the above entitled and numbered cause be and the same is hereby DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
