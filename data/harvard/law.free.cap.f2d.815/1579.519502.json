Specifically, on January 16, 1987, this court reversed decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency establishing an interim tolerance for the amount of the pesticide ethylene dibromide (EDB) found in imported mangoes. <em>National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides v. Thomas, </em>809 F.2d 875 (D.C.Cir.1987). EPA had determined under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(b) (1982), that the severe impact of an EDB ban on the economies of foreign mango-producing countries and the low health risk posed by EDB justified a level of 30 parts per billion (ppb) of the pesticide in the edible pulp of imported mangoes through September 30, 1987. <em>See National Coalition, </em>809 F.2d at 876-78.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We held that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously by (1) \u201crelying exclusively on concerns for foreign well-being ... without considering the factors specified as [relevant] in the FDCA and factors of for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number>eign impact related to those factors enjoying express Congressional approbation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 883; and (2) \u201creversing its position on the health risks of EDB\u201d without explaining this reversal, <em>id. </em>at 884. Rather than setting aside the orders immediately, we withheld issuance of mandate for thirty days and directed EPA in the meantime to \u201caddress the issues discussed in this opinion and to decide ... whether an interim tolerance of 30 ppb EDB (or any level other than zero) in imported mangoes is justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884. The issue now before us is whether EPA\u2019s action on remand complies with our instructions and withstands petitioners\u2019 renewed attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b1677-4\">EPA\u2019s response takes the form of an affidavit by A. James Barnes, Deputy Administrator of EPA, and several supporting documents. Mr. Barnes states that in accordance with the legal framework set out in our opinion EPA has now made the determination that \u201can interim tolerance of 30 [ppb] of EDB on mangoes until September 30, 1987, is justified, is adequate to protect the public health, and will best serve the interest of assuring an adequate and wholesome food supply.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Barnes Affidavit at 2 H 5. This determination, Mr. Barnes continues, \u201cis not based on an assertion that there has been a change in the health risk posed by [EDB] since the Agency\u2019s statement regarding those risks in January 1985.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 H 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, EPA has now concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1677-11\">[T]he very low risk posed by the consumption of mangoes with EDB residues is acceptable because such risk is outweighed by the greater risks to the wholesomeness or adequacy of the nation\u2019s food supply that would be posed by revoking the EDB tolerance between now and September 30, 1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1677-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 3 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b1677-13\">Revoking the 30 ppb tolerance of EDB now, Mr. Barnes predicts, could be seen as an unfair and unduly abrupt action by mango-producing nations, which have channeled mango revenues into developing alternatives to EDB treatment (most notably a hot water dip treatment) and which will likely have that alternative in place this year. In Mr. Barnes\u2019 judgment, revocation at this point could damage cooperative efforts that have characterized relations among the U.S. and various food-exporting nations. Since effective enforcement of food safety laws depends upon such cooperation, a ban might increase the risk that fruit and vegetables would enter the U.S. treated with unsafe levels of pesticides or infested with pests or diseases. <em>Id. </em>at 876-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b1677-14\">Petitioners maintain that EPA\u2019s action on remand does not satisfy the concerns elucidated in our prior opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, they read our opinion to foreclose consideration by EPA of the health risks occasioned by a zero EDB tolerance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>They further argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>that even if we did not preclude EPA from assessing the health impact of a ban, EPA\u2019s determination on remand that the risks associated with a zero tolerance outweighed those of an interim 30 ppb tolerance was based on conjecture. Finally, petitioners maintain that EPA is to blame for any frustration experienced by foreign countries by virtue of an EDB ban and for any consequent damage to enforcement of U.S. health laws; the agency\u2019s improper revival of the 30 ppb tolerance in February 1986 encouraged countries, unwisely, to rely on short-term continuation of a nonzero tolerance. EPA should not, in petitioners\u2019 view, now be permitted to justify its latest action in light of the difficult situation that its own conduct has in large measure brought about.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-4\">We are persuaded, upon analysis, that EPA has now approached the issue at hand with proper attention to factors relevant under the FDCA; in addition, we are satisfied that the agency has resolved the matter in a reasoned fashion. EPA has placed the public health and factors of foreign impact related to the public health at the forefront of its deliberations, in accordance with section 408(b) of the FDCA. <em>National Coalition, </em>809 F.2d 875 at 881-82. Specifically, EPA has concluded that discouraging mango-producing nations from cooperative efforts to comply with U.S. food and drug laws poses a greater health threat than continuation for approximately six months (through September 1987) of a 30 ppb tolerance. This avenue was indeed left open to the agency, for we did not, as petitioners would have it, forbid EPA to balance the health risks of a ban against those of an interim tolerance. On the contrary, we recognized that EPA\u2019s duty to establish tolerances \u201cnecessary to protect the public health\u201d might require this judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 882.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1678-9\">Moreover, EPA reasonably concluded that a ban could pose a threat to the integrity of the Nation\u2019s food supply. For one thing, a ban would remove an important source of funding for implementation of alternative treatments. For another, EPA reasonably could have inferred that diminution of cooperative efforts to ensure food safety on the part of foreign countries would flow from an on-again, off-again policy. The agency heard strong expressions of protest not only from affected countries and the State Department but also from high U.S. government officials charged with administering the food safety laws.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While it is doubtless true, as petitioners emphasize, that EPA\u2019s conduct contributed measurably to this state of affairs, this does not alter the agency\u2019s duty now to respond to the difficult situation in a principled fashion and in accordance with the statute. EPA reasonably and lawfully concluded that considerations of public health warrant following the course laid down in its decisions of February and September 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>At the same time, EPA has expressly-warned that the path the agency has temporarily taken will end shortly. Specifically, EPA has stated that it \u201cwill not be receptive to any extension of [the 30 ppb tolerance] beyond September 30,1987.\u201d 51 Fed.Reg. 34,471, J.A. II at 5; <em>see also </em>51 Fed.Reg. 28,604 (same), J.A. II at 2. This declaration clearly serves notice that, in the agency\u2019s considered view, any failure to implement an alternative to EDB treatment will not, standing alone, justify further extensions. Nor, as we understand EPA\u2019s position, will resubmission of the evidence of attendant economic dislocation that EPA has already considered at length in establishing the September 1987 termination date<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> justify in the agency\u2019s view yet another step down an otherwise long road of temporary extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-4\">In sum, we are satisfied that EPA\u2019s decision on remand to leave in place a 30 ppb tolerance for EDB in imported mangoes through September 30, 1987, is reasonable under the circumstances presented and that it is consistent with the mandate of the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1676-12\">. As we recounted in some detail in our prior opinion, EPA originally decided in January 1985 to end the 30 ppb tolerance and to establish a zero tolerance as of September 1, 1985; in fact, a zero tolerance duly went into effect on that date. <em>National Coalition, </em>809 F.2d at 876-77. Not long after the ban took effect, however, EPA proposed reviving the 30 ppb tolerance in response to entreaties from high officials in the State Department and the Department of Agriculture. <em>Id. </em>at 77. In February 1986 EPA promulgated a final rule reviving the 30 ppb level through September 1986. In September 1986, the agency further extended the interim tolerance through September 30, 1987. <em>Id. </em>at 878.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1677-5\">. As indicated in the text, the determination by EPA on remand was made by the Deputy Administrator of EPA and purports to approach anew the question of a continued EDB tolerance on imported mangoes, employing the legal framework articulated in our prior opinion and assessing recent developments, notably significant progress by Mexico and Haiti in implementing alternative treatment methods for mangoes. Prior EPA decisions on the EDB tolerance for imported mangoes, in contrast, appear to have been made at a lower level in the EPA hierarchy, namely by J.A. Moore, Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances. <em>See </em>51 Fed.Reg. 34,469, 34,472 (1986) (final rule extending 30 ppb tolerance through Sept. 1987), Joint Appendix, No. 86-1535 (\"J.A. II\u201d), at 3, 6; 51 Fed.Reg. 5682, 5684 (1986) (final rule extending tolerance through Sept. 1986), Joint Appendix, No. 86-1114 (\"J.A. I\u201d), at 178, 180; 50 Fed. Reg. 48,799, 48,800 (1985) (proposing extension of 30 ppb tolerance through Sept. 1986), J.A. I at 21, 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1677-17\">. We noted in our prior opinion, <em>National Coalition, </em>809 F.2d at 884 n. 9, that EPA has consistently calculated the increased risk of cancer to an individual consuming the average number of EDB-fumigated imported mangoes for one year as in the range of 1 x 10-6 to 1 X 10-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1677-18\">. Petitioners mount their latest challenge pursuant to this court\u2019s order of February 19, 1987, in which we further withheld issuance of mandate pending consideration of EPA's Statement Upon Remand and invited petitioners to respond to EPA\u2019s Statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1677-19\">. Petitioners rely on the passage of the panel opinion in which we stated, after concluding that EPA had reversed without explanation its position on the health risk of EDB, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>Accordingly, if EPA on remand in any respect relies on an assessment of the health risk attributable to consumption of EDB on mangoes <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that is lower than the assessment underlying its January 1985 determination, it must adduce a legally adequate explanation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1678-6\"> As opposed to the health risks attributable to elimination of the use of EDB on mangoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-7\"><em>National Coalition, </em>809 F.2d at 884 &amp; n. 11. In petitioners\u2019 view, this \"unequivocally put EPA on notice that [the court] would <em>not </em>consider arguments by EPA relating to \u2018the health risks attributable to <em>elimination </em>of the use of EDB on mangoes.\u201d\u2019 Petitioners\u2019 Opposition to EPA\u2019s Statement on Remand 8 (Feb. 27, 1987) (petitioners\u2019 emphases). As we explain, <em>infra </em>note 6 and accompanying text, petitioners misconstrue our instruction to EPA in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1678-10\">. Petitioners err in their reading of part of our previous opinion by concluding that this court forbade EPA from considering the health risks of an EDB ban. In the passage on which petitioners relied, <em>see supra </em>note 5, the court instructed the agency to explain why it had changed its view of the health risk of EDB if this view had in fact changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1678-11\">. We find EPA\u2019s consideration of the views of high officials of other government agencies particularly appropriate in the context of fixing tolerances for pesticides, in light of the fact that EPA\u2019s role in this regulatory arena is comparatively narrow. Thus, EPA's ability to make informed decisions may be enhanced by the views of those agencies with broader responsibility for ensuring disease-free, pest-free fruits and vegetables with acceptable levels of pesticides. <em>See </em>Barnes Affidavit at 4 Iff 9-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1679-9\">. <em>See </em>50 Fed.Reg. at 48,799, J.A.

Given our earlier condemnation of the agency\u2019s past record in promulgating the tolerance regulations, I feel compelled to write separately to make crystal clear that further extensions of the tolerance after September 1987 would, to me, be wholly unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-8\">As we emphasized in our previous opinion, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a (1982) \u201cclearly mandates that health factors and issues of foreign impact related to the health of U.S. consumers be at the forefront of EPA\u2019s deliberations.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Continuance of the tolerance for six months, until September 1987 when it is due to expire, is justified only because revoking the tolerance now, in the midst of the spring growing season, could cause economic dislocation in Mexico and other mango-producing countries and might adversely affect the production of \u201can adequate, wholesome, and economical food supply.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 346a(b). <em>See </em>Barnes Affidavit. Specifically, EPA justifies a continuance on the theory that revocation will give mango-producing countries less reason to cooperate with the United States\u2019 efforts to prevent pests and infested foodstuffs from crossing our borders. <em>Id. </em>112. Although the record on remand is sparse, I would agree that EPA has now established the necessary analytical link between foreign economic harm and domestic food and health concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-11\">EPA\u2019s justification for the current extension, though, loses force after the end of this growing season. In my opinion, our decision today provides foreign countries more than ample warning of the unacceptability of further extensions of the tolerance and allows those countries sufficient opportunity to plan ahead, financially and otherwise, for a transition to alternative disinfestation techniques. That such progress is possible is evident from EPA\u2019s representations that approval of alternative disinfestation techniques in Haiti is likely to occur soon and that \u201capproval of the [alternative] method for mangoes from Mexico likely will occur this year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>117. With termination of the present extension, EPA can unequivocally reaffirm its primary mandate in setting tolerance levels: protection of the health of domestic consumers.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1679-12\">. <em>National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides v.
