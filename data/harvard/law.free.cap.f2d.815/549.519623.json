In the plan amendment, the State sought authorization to begin calculating the eligibility of married Medicaid applicants for benefits under state community property law instead of under the Secretary\u2019s \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule. The State argues that the Secretary\u2019s decision to require the State to continue using the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule, in spite of the rule\u2019s inconsistency with state community property law, was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a violation of section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The Medicaid program, established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396q, as amended, is a cooperative federal-state program designed to \u201cprovid[e] federal financial assistance to States that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.\u201d <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 2680, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980). States participating in the program must develop Medicaid plans that contain \u201creasonable standards\u201d for determining Medicaid eligibility. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). These plans must comply with the Medicaid statute, Medicaid regulations, and the Secretary\u2019s own administrative rules. The Medicaid program is the primary source of public assistance for elderly persons living in nursing homes. General Accounting Office, <em>Medicaid and Nursing Home Care: Report to the Sub-comm. on Health and the Environment of the House Comm, on Energy and Commerce, </em>98th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">One of the Secretary\u2019s administrative rules is commonly referred to as the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule. It requires that a Medicaid applicant\u2019s eligibility for benefits be based on the amount of money that the applicant receives each month in his or her name. The rule does not consider what portion of a married applicant\u2019s monthly receipts belongs to the applicant\u2019s spouse under state community property law.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">In a community property state such as Washington, the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule affects the at-home spouse of an institutionalized Medicaid recipient differently depending on the at-home spouse\u2019s gender. This is because most elderly couples receive the greater part of their community income in the husband\u2019s name. <em>See generally </em>U.S. Bureau of the Census, <em>Current Population Rep., </em>Ser. P-60, No. 146, Table 37 (1985) (in the United States in 1983, the median income of men over 65 was $9,766; the median income of women over 65 was $5,599); <em>id. </em>at Table 50 (in the United States in 1983, 42.7% of men over 65 received pensions or annuity income; 20.4% of women over 65 received such income).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Consider an elderly couple that receives $1,000 per month in the husband\u2019s name, and $500 per month in the wife\u2019s name. If the wife enters a nursing home, the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule requires that her Medicaid eligibility be based on the $500 per month received in her name. This allows her husband full use of the remaining $1,000 of monthly income. If, on the other hand, the husband enters a nursing home, the rule requires that his Medicaid eligibility be based on the $1,000 per month received in his name. This leaves his wife with only $500 of usable monthly income. Even though under state community property law both spouses have monthly incomes of $750, the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule puts the husband whose wife enters a nursing home in a much better position than the wife whose husband does so.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">In December 1984, the State submitted Medicaid Plan Amendment No. 84-20 for the Secretary\u2019s approval. The State proposed to begin calculating the eligibility of married applicants for benefits under state community property law instead of under the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule. On behalf of the Secretary, the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sued a final decision disapproving the plan amendment on January 31, 1986. The State filed a timely notice of appeal. Appellate jurisdiction is based on 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1316(a)(3M5).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We will set aside the Secretary\u2019s decision if it was arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <em>Cubanski v. Heckler, </em>781 F.2d 1421, 1423-24 (9th Cir.1986), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Bowen v. Kizer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 107 S.Ct. 1282, 94 L.Ed.2d 141 (1987). We consider this question in the specific context of Washington community property law, recognizing that in Washington the amount of money that a married Medicaid applicant receives in his or her name is generally not coextensive with the applicant\u2019s personal income.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">The \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule has no explicit basis in either the Medicaid statute or Medicaid regulations. Instead, the rule represents the Secretary\u2019s administrative interpretation of Medicaid regulation 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.723. Section 435.723 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">(b) The agency must consider income ... of spouses living in the same household as available to each other, whether or not [it is] actually contributed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">(c) If both spouses apply or are eligible as aged, blind, or disabled [persons] and cease to live together, the agency must consider their income ... as available to each other for the time periods specified below. After the appropriate time period, the agency must consider only the income ... that [is] actually contributed by one spouse to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-12\">(1) If spouses cease to live together because of the institutionalization of one spouse\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-13\">(i) The agency must consider their income as available to each other through the month in which they cease to live together. Mutual consideration of income ceases with the month after the month in which separation oc-curs____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-14\">(d) If only one spouse in a couple applies or is eligible, or both spouses apply and [they] are not eligible as a couple, and they cease to live together, the agency must consider only the income ... of the ineligible spouse that [is] actually contributed to the eligible spouse beginning with the month after the month in which they cease to live together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.723(b)-(d). Thus, when a married , couple lives together, and one of the spouses applies for Medicaid benefits, the income of the applicant\u2019s spouse is deemed \u201cavailable\u201d to the applicant whether or not it is actually contributed. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.723(b). If the applicant enters a nursing home, the spouse\u2019s income continues to be deemed \u201cavailable\u201d during the first month of separation. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.723(c)(l)(i). Thereafter, mutual consideration of spousal income ceases unless the spouse\u2019s income is actually contributed. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.723(c)(l)(i), 435.723(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">The Secretary interprets section 435.723 to mean that all money received in a married applicant\u2019s name is \u201cincome\u201d attributable to the applicant even if (1) the applicant has been in a nursing home for over a month, and (2) a portion of the applicant\u2019s monthly receipts belongs to the applicant\u2019s spouse under community property law. The Secretary reads the regulation\u2019s references to \u201cincome\u201d as referring both to the applicant\u2019s income and to income of the applicant\u2019s spouse that is \u201cavailable\u201d because received in the applicant\u2019s name. The State interprets the same references as denoting only those payments or other benefits that the applicant is legally entitled to under applicable property law. \u201cAvailable income,\u201d the State argues, is a subcategory of \u201cincome,\u201d not a larger category encompassing both the applicant\u2019s income and income of the applicant\u2019s spouse received in the applicant\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation is entitled to deference. First, the Secretary is the official responsible for administering the Medicaid program. <em>See Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, </em>471 U.S. 524, 530 n. 16, 105 S.Ct. 2210, 2214 n. 16, 85 L.Ed.2d 577 (1985); <em>Schweiker v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>Hogan, </em>457 U.S. 569, 588, 102 S.Ct. 2597, 2608, 73 L.Ed.2d 227 (1982). Second, the Medicaid statute vests the Secretary with authority to prescribe regulations defining Medicaid eligibility standards. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(B). <em>See Herweg v. Ray, </em>455 U.S. 265, 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 1059, 1066, 71 L.Ed.2d 137 (1982). Under these circumstances, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his own regulation is ordinarily of controlling weight. <em>Arizona Dept. of Economic Sec. v. U.S. Dept. of Labor, </em>790 F.2d 782, 784 (9th Cir.1986). At the same time, \u201c[b]ecause the Secretary\u2019s interpretations of [his] regulations are without force of law, ... we must consider them with caution.\u201d <em>Vista Hill Found., Inc. v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 556, 559-60 (9th Cir.1985). We will not defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation if it conflicts with the Medicaid statute or Medicaid regulations. <em>Id. </em>at 560. <em>See Arizona Dept. of Economic Sec., </em>790 F.2d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The State\u2019s interpretation is also entitled to some deference. The Medicaid statute grants states freedom to devise their own \u201creasonable standards ... for determining [Medicaid] eligibility.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17). <em>See Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 36, 101 S.Ct. 2633, 2636, 69 L.Ed.2d 460 (1981). The Medicaid program, moreover, is a cooperative, federal-state program. <em>See Harris, </em>448 U.S. at 308, 100 S.Ct. at 2683; <em>Medicaid and Nursing Home Care </em>at <em>i </em>(\u201c[T]he Federal and State Governments share the responsibility for insuring that Medicaid provides adequate and efficient nursing home care to the people who need it but cannot pay for it.\u201d). We will accord some deference to the State\u2019s interpretation in this context. <em>See Dawson v. Myers, </em>622 F.2d 1304, 1307 (9th Cir.1980), <em>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Beltran v. Myers, </em>451 U.S. 625, 101 S.Ct. 1961, 68 L.Ed.2d 495 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Because the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule has no explicit statutory or regulatory basis, we evaluate its reasonableness as applied to a community property state such as Washington in terms of: (1) the language of section 435.723; (2) the language of the Medicaid statute; (3) the moratorium provision contained in section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984; and (4) preemption considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">1. <em>Section 435.723</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">The Secretary contends that the term \u201cavailable,\u201d as used in section 435.-723, expands the scope of a married applicant\u2019s \u201cincome\u201d to include income belonging to the applicant\u2019s spouse under state community property law that is received in the applicant\u2019s name after the spouses have been separated for over a month. The Secretary\u2019s contention is unsupported. As used in public assistance statutes, the term \u201cavailable\u201d typically functions as a restrictive term defining a subcategory of \u201cincome.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Heckler v. Turner, </em>470 U.S. 184, 200, 105 S.Ct. 1138, 1147, 83 L.Ed.2d 138 (1985); <em>Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. at 48, 101 S.Ct. at 2642; <em>Schrader v. Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare, </em>768 F.2d 1107, 1110 (9th Cir.1985); <em>Young v. Schweiker, </em>680 F.2d 680, 682 (9th Cir.1982). The legislative history of the Medicaid statute also indicates that \u201cavailable\u201d should be read as a limiting term. The Senate report accompanying the Medicaid legislation provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">States [are required] to take into account only such income and resources as ... are actually available to the applicant or recipient____ States [are] not [to] assume the availability of income which may not, in fact, be available or overeval-uate income and resources which are available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 78 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News pp. 1943, 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u201cincome\u201d is also unsupported. The Secretary\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the principle that, as used in federal statutes or regulations, the term should be defined under state law. <em>See United States v. Mitchell, </em>403 U.S. 190, 197, 91 S.Ct. 1763, 1768, 29 L.Ed.2d 406 (1971) (\u201cIn the determination of ownership [of income], state law controls.\u201d); <em>Poe v. Seaborn, </em>282 U.S. 101, 109-10, 51 S.Ct. 58, 75 L.Ed. 239 (1930) (the term \u201cincome of\u201d in a federal tax statute indicates ownership as defined under state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>law). <em>Cf United States v. Overman, </em>424 F.2d 1142, 1144 (9th Cir.1970) (the terms \u201cproperty\u201d and \u201crights to property\u201d in a federal tax statute should be defined under state law). Moreover, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is inconsistent with the Social Security Administration\u2019s definition of \u201cincome\u201d in the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. <em>See </em>Social Security Administration, <em>Program Operations Manual System, </em>\u201cDetermining Ownership of Income,\u201d SI 00810.130 (1984) (\u201c[T]he individual who has <em>title </em>to the proceeds of a payment ... is the one to whom any resulting income must be charged.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Most importantly, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation defeats the purpose of subsections (c)(1)\u00a9 and (d) of the regulation because it permits \u201cdeeming\u201d of spousal income to continue after an institutionalized married applicant has been separated from his or her spouse for over a month. \u201cDeeming\u201d occurs whenever \u201ca portion of the spouse\u2019s income is [deemed] \u2018available\u2019 to the applicant.\u201d <em>Herweg, </em>455 U.S. at 267, 102 S.Ct. at 1062. Subsections (c)(l)(i) and (d) are designed to limit spousal financial responsibility by putting a time limit on \u201cdeeming,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 269-70, 102 S.Ct. at 1063, thereby preventing \u201cthe economic strain that institutionalization [would] cause to the spouse who remain[ed] at home\u201d if the \u201cdeeming\u201d period were unlimited. <em>Franssen v. Juras, </em>406 F.Supp. 1375, 1378 (D.Or.1975). <em>See generally </em>S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 78 (1965), <em>reprinted in </em>1965 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 2018 (\u201cThe [Senate Finance] Committee has heard of hardships on certain individuals [caused] by requiring them to provide support and to pay for the medical care needed by relatives.\u201d); Deford, <em>The Medicaid Deeming Procedure: The Intolerable Financial Burden on the Non-Institutionalized Spouse, </em>10 Clearinghouse Rev. 12 (1976). As applied to a community property state such as Washington, the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule allows \u201cdeeming\u201d to continue unchecked, in effect if not in name, after a married Medicaid applicant has been in a nursing home for over a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">2. <em>The Medicaid Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Secretary argues that requiring states that participate in the Medicaid program to uniformly observe the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule is consistent with the \u201csame methodology\u201d provision contained in section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of the Medicaid statute. The \u201csame methodology\u201d . provision, however, \u201csimply instructs States to treat components of in<em>come </em>\u2014 e.g., interest or court-ordered support payments \u2014 similarly for both medically and categorically needy persons.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Rivera, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 91 L.Ed.2d 131 (1986). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 92-231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 4, <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News pp. 4989, 4992. It cannot reasonably be construed to require the entire Medicaid program, a cooperative federal-state venture, to match the uniformity standards of the \u201ccomparable,\u201d but purely federal, SSI program. In any case, the statute and regulations of the SSI program do not expressly define the terms \u201cincome\u201d and \u201cavailable,\u201d nor do they mention the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.101.2227.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Section 1396a(a)(17)(B) of the Medicaid statute envisions that each state that participates in the Medicaid program will develop its own <em>\u201creasonable </em>standards ... for determining eligibility.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17)(B) (emphasis added). This language evinces Congress\u2019 intent to \u201cconfer[] broad discretion on the States to adopt standards for determining the extent of medical assistance, requiring only that such standards be \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018consistent with the objectives\u2019 of the Act.\u201d <em>Beal v. Doe, </em>432 U.S. 438, 444, 97 S.Ct. 2366, 2370, 53 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977). <em>See also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 (The purpose of the Medicaid program is to \u201cenabl[e] each State, <em>as far as practicable under the conditions of such State, </em>to furnish[] medical assistance.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">3. <em>The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984</em></p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Congress barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the Secretary from disapproving, during a specified moratorium period, any state Medicaid plan \u201con account of such plan\u2019s having a standard or methodology which the Secretary interprets as being less restrictive\u201d than the Secretary\u2019s methodology. Pub.L. 98-369, Title III, \u00a7 2373(c), July 18, 1984, 98 Stat. 1112. A plan is less restrictive if it results in the institutionalized spouse receiving more Medicaid benefits than he or she would receive under the Secretary\u2019s methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The moratorium period went into effect on July 18, 1984, and was scheduled to end 18 months after the Secretary submitted a report to Congress concerning the appropriateness of applying to Medicaid methodologies used in cash assistance programs. <em>Id. </em>In response to an inquiry by this court, the Secretary acknowledged that the requisite report has not yet been submitted. We therefore conclude that the moratorium was in effect when the Secretary disapproved the State\u2019s plan amendment on January 31, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">We have held that the Secretary\u2019s disapproval of a less restrictive state plan amendment during the moratorium period violates section 2373(c). <em>Cubanski, </em>781 F.2d at 1430. We therefore must consider whether the State\u2019s plan amendment was less restrictive. If the institutionalized spouse received the larger monthly check, the plan amendment would be less restrictive, because unlike the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule, the plan amendment would transfer a part of the check to the at-home spouse. This would result in a corresponding increase in the institutionalized spouse\u2019s Medicaid benefits. On the other hand, if the at-home spouse received the larger monthly check, the plan amendment would appear to be more restrictive, because it would appear to require, again unlike the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule, that some of the at-home spouse\u2019s monthly receipts be transferred to the institutionalized spouse. This would reduce the institutionalized spouse\u2019s benefits correspondingly-</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">A recent Washington law has eliminated the plan amendment\u2019s potentially more restrictive aspect. The new law provides that whenever the community income received in the name of the at-home spouse is greater than the community income received in the name of the institutionalized spouse, the institutionalized spouse\u2019s interest in the excess must not be considered for purposes of computing his or her Medicaid eligibility. Washington Laws of 1986, ch. 220. The State\u2019s plan amendment is therefore less restrictive. The Secretary\u2019s decision to disapprove it violated section 2373(c). <em>See Cubanski, </em>781 F.2d at 1430.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">4. <em>Preemption Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">The Secretary argues that, to the extent the \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule conflicts with the State\u2019s community property law, the rule preempts Washington law. State family property law cannot be preempted by federal law, however, unless \u201cCongress has \u2018positively required [preemption] by direct enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hisquierdo v.

The preemption standard applied in this context is a stringent one: \u201cState family and family-property law must do \u2018major damage\u2019 to \u2018clear and substantial\u2019 federal interests before the Supremacy Clause will demand that state law be overridden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Yazell, </em>382 U.S. 341, 352, 86 S.Ct. 500, 506, 15 L.Ed.2d 404 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">The Medicaid statute does not expressly provide for the preemption of state family property law. Nor would the State\u2019s plan amendment do \u201cmajor damage\u201d to \u201cclear and substantial\u201d federal interests. The Secretary\u2019s contention that there is a compelling federal interest in the Medicaid program\u2019s being a unified national program based on uniform eligibility standards must be heard against the background of express language in the Medicaid statute providing that states should have flexibility in operating their Medicaid programs. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396, 1396a(a)(17). <em>See also Medicaid and Nursing Home Care </em>at 6 (\u201c[Medicaid] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>is a program characterized by State diversity and independence in determining eligibility, services provided, and reimbursement levels.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The Medicaid program exemplifies what is often referred to as \u201ccooperative federalism.\u201d <em>See Harris, </em>448 U.S. at 308, 100 S.Ct. at 2683. In programs of this sort, \u201c[w]here coordinated state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework, and in the pursuit of common purposes, the case for federal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.\u201d <em>New York Dept. of Social Services v. Dublino, </em>413 U.S. 405, 421, 93 S.Ct. 2507, 2516, 37 L.Ed.2d 688 (1973). There is also a presumption that Congress will not interfere with state family property law. <em>Operating Engineers v. Zamborsky, </em>650 F.2d 196, 199 (9th Cir.1981). As we have stated, \u201c[f]amily and property law for good reason are the province of state law.\u201d <em>Hutcheson v. Califano, </em>638 F.2d 96, 99 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The \u201cname-on-the-check\u201d rule, as applied to Washington, is inconsistent with the language of section 435.723 and with relevant language contained in the Medicaid statute. Section 435.723 is not \u201creasonably susceptible to the construction placed upon [it] by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Pacific Coast Med. Enterprises v. Harris, </em>633 F.2d 123, 131 (9th Cir.1980). The Secretary\u2019s decision to disapprove the State\u2019s plan amendment was therefore arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. <em>See Arizona Dept. of Econ. Security, </em>790 F.2d at 784. Further, the Secretary\u2019s decision violated the moratorium provision contained in section 2373(c) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, and was consequently not in accordance with law. <em>Cubanski, </em>781 F.2d at 1424. We reject the Secretary\u2019s claim that the State\u2019s community property law is preempted by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
