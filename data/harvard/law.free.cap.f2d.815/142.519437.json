Bushkin and Bushkin Associates, Inc., appeal from a directed verdict in their suit against defendant-appellee Raytheon Company. Appellants, an investment banker and his firm, originally commenced this suit in United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 1981. They sought damages from Raytheon, on theories of express and implied contract, in connection with their role in the merger of Raytheon with Beech Aircraft Corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1983, Ray-theon was granted a motion for summary judgment by the district court. <em>See </em>570 F.Supp. 596 (D.Mass.1983). We overturned that judgment and certified the case to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>decisions on choice of law and other questions. After the decision by the state court, <em>see </em>393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662 (1985), the suit again went to trial in district court. In December, 1985, upon conclusion of the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 case, the district court directed a verdict for defendant on all counts. This decision forms the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">I. SUMMARY OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">In reviewing a motion for a directed verdict, we must give the losing party \u201cthe benefit of all inferences which the evidence fairly supports, even though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn.\u201d <em>Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corp., </em>370 U.S. 690, 696, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 1499, 8 L.Ed.2d 777 (1962) (citing 5 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 2316 (2d ed. 1951)). While the parties have not engaged on appeal in much dispute over the facts, they have vigorously argued about the context in which those facts should be viewed. Our summary of the facts must present them in the light most favorable to Bushkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In May, 1974, Bushkin asked Robert L. Seaman, Raytheon\u2019s vice-president for planning, if Raytheon would be interested in acquiring a company in the field of general aviation. In July, 1974, Seaman stated that it would be unlikely that Raytheon would have such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">On January 28, 1975, Bushkin again spoke to Seaman about the same subject. Before revealing the name of the company he had in mind, Bushkin declared that \u201cit would be appropriate to settle the issue of fee first.\u201d Testimony of Merle J. Bushkin, Plaintiffs\u2019 Appendix (App.) at 194. In Bushkin\u2019s words, \u201cI set an appropriate fee on a transaction of that size which would be one percent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194-95. Seaman said</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">that if Raytheon acquired the company and if Raytheon did not have a prior commitment with regard to that company, that Raytheon would pay a one percent fee and would work through Bush-kin Associates____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 195. Neither Bushkin nor Seaman discussed a time term for this fee agreement. Bushkin then told Seaman that the company in question was Beech Aircraft. He proceeded to describe to Seaman the various conditions that Beech was setting for a takeover. Bushkin had obtained this information while researching Beech for another client. Seaman said that \u201che was very interested in Beech\u201d and that he hadn\u2019t known it was available for acquisition. Seaman told Bushkin that he would discuss Beech with Thomas L. Phillips, chief executive officer of Raytheon. Bush-kin\u2019s claim of an express contract is primarily based on this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Bushkin and Seaman had several more conversations before the presentation of Beech to Phillips. In an entry in Ray-theon\u2019s \u201cAcquisition Log,\u201d Beech was listed under the \u201cAcquisition\u201d column and Bushkin was listed under the \u201cOffered/Suggested By\u201d column. The page in the log is dated June 19, 1975; the entry is dated June 17, 1975. On June 27, 1975, Seaman made a presentation to Phillips about Beech. On June 30, Seaman spoke to Bushkin and asked him several questions that Phillips had about Beech. These questions concerned the reasons for Beech\u2019s interest in a merger. A memo from Seaman to Phillips, dated June 30, 1975, reported this conversation. The memo referred to Bushkin as \u201cour contact on this matter.\u201d On July 11,1975, Bushkin discussed with Seaman the structure of the proposed transaction and sent him a memo on the subject. On July 29, 1975, however, Seaman told Bushkin that Phillips was not interested in Beech. Phillips confirmed this lack of interest in acquiring Beech in a conversation with Bushkin on November 6, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">In September, 1976, Raytheon retained Lonsdale Enterprises, Inc. (Lonsdale), as a consultant in Raytheon\u2019s diversification program. On November 29, 1976, Phillips\u2019 office received a letter from Royal Little, a partner in Lonsdale Enterprises. The letter suggested Beech as a potential acquisition for Raytheon.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">Angus MacDonald, an independent broker working with Lonsdale, testified by deposition that he had a conversation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Phillips about Beech on December 1, 1976.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He discussed the advantages to Raytheon of a merger with Beech and gave Phillips written information about Beech. MacDonald testified that Phillips replied: \u201cIt does look very interesting, and let me think about it. Let me talk it over with our people.\u201d On February 16, 1977, Phillips telephoned Little and said that he wanted to meet Olive Beech, the chairman of Beech Aircraft, and that he was very interested in taking over the company.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">On February 28, 1977, Bushkin once again raised the subject of Beech with Phillips. According to Bushkin, Phillips \u201cdismissed it saying he had no interest in general aviation.\u201d App. at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On or shortly before March 3, 1977, Phillips authorized representatives of Lonsdale Enterprises to contact Beech. A series of meetings eventually took place in 1978 between Phillips and Frank Hedrick, Beech\u2019s president. A merger agreement was signed in November, 1979; the merger became effective in February, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The value of the Raytheon-Beech transaction was somewhere between $815 and $816 million. In connection with the transaction, Raytheon and Beech paid $7,693,138 in fees to various investment bankers and financial advisors. Raytheon paid $500,000 to Angus MacDonald, $600,000 to Lonsdale, and $2.5 million to Lazard Freres. Beech paid $3,819,171 to Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Inc., and $273,967 to other financial advis-ors.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">II. EXPRESS CONTRACT</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The district court held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to have found an express contract between Bush-kin and Raytheon, based primarily on the conversation between Bushkin and Seaman on January 28, 1975. Raytheon has objected that Seaman had no authority to bind Raytheon to agreements with investment bankers and brokers. We agree with the district court, however, that sufficient evidence was presented for the jury to have concluded that Seaman at least had apparent authority to enter into such agreements. Such evidence includes the general authority apparently vested in Seaman by Raytheon to negotiate with investment bankers and brokers, as well as specific statements made by another Raytheon vice-president to Bushkin that, Seaman would be responsible for such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The central issue in the interpretation of the contract concerns the missing time term. As we noted, neither Bushkin nor Seaman mentioned a time term during their January 28 conversation. At trial, Bushkin testified that his practice during the period in question was to ask for a time term of \u201ctwo years plus continuing negotiations.\u201d He declared that he expected the same time term for the contract with Raytheon. Bushkin acknowledged that the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201ccontinuing negotiations\u201d was somewhat unclear. He asserted, however, that by \u201ccontinuing negotiations\u201d he meant \u201ccontinuing interest\u201d: the term of the contract would be for two years, but, if the acquisition was not completed within that time, the contract would continue until the date of the acquisition provided that the company\u2019s interest arose within the two-year period. In the present case, it seems clear from Phillips\u2019 statements in July and November, 1975, that Raytheon\u2019s desire to acquire Beech, as expressed by Seaman in January, 1975, went into a period of dormancy for at least a year. For the contract to have lasted more than two years, therefore, Raytheon\u2019s interest would have had to have been reawakened before January 28,1977, and to have continued beyond that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Appellants, despite Bushkin\u2019s testimony at trial, strongly contend that the \u201ctwo years plus\u201d standard is inappropriate here. They argue, correctly, that contracts depend on objective manifestations of consent and not on uncommunicated subjective expectations. Thus, they conclude, even if we were to accept that Bushkin had an expectation of \u201ctwo years plus,\u201d this expectation would not be binding evidence on the duration of the contract. Since no time term was explicitly discussed, appellants contend that the district court should have submitted the matter to the jury based on the standard of a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Such a \u201creasonable time\u201d should have been determined on the basis of all the evidence, particularly, appellants urge, the testimony of their expert, Stanley Foster Reed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The district court, we note, did not hold that Bushkin\u2019s testimony conclusively proved a \u201ctwo years plus\u201d time term. Rather, the court held that the testimony precluded a showing, based on trade usage, of a <em>longer </em>time term. Citing <em>Caggiano v. Marchegiano, </em>327 Mass. 574, 99 N.E.2d 861 (1951), the court held that a trade usage must be universal in order to supplement the missing terms of a contract and that Bushkin\u2019s own practice and expectations showed that a period other than \u201ctwo years plus\u201d could not have been universal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">We have reservations about the district court\u2019s focus on the language in <em>Caggiano </em>as the legal standard for trade usage. First, the contract in <em>Caggiano </em>failed to specify the \u201crights and obligations of either party,\u201d <em>id. </em>99 N.E.2d at 865; the court construed the agreement as a contract which contemplated a more formal contract and was itself lacking any definite, enforceable terms. By contrast, the missing provision here was the time term. The case law is clear that, when a contract is silent as to time, the term shall be a reasonable time based on all the relevant evidence. <em>See, e.g., H. Piken &amp; Co. v. Planet Construction Co., </em>3 Mass.App.Ct. 246, 326 N.E.2d 725 (1975); <em>MacDonald &amp; Payne Machine Co. v. Metallic Arts of New England, Inc., </em>324 Mass. 353, 86 N.E.2d 516, 518 (1949). Second, we find that the standard for a showing of trade usage set forth in <em>Caggiano </em>was modified by Massachusetts\u2019 adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code, codified at Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106 (West 1958). <em>Cf. DiMarzo v. American Mutual Ins. Co., </em>389 Mass. 85, 449 N.E.2d 1189, 1201 n. 20 (1983) (noting modification of <em>Caggiano </em>by U.C.C. with regard to admissibility of evidence of trade usage). The Massachusetts Code Comment to \u00a7 1-205(3) explicitly rejects Caggiano\u2019s requirement \u201cthat the usage be old; recent usages also qualify.\u201d The Uniform Commercial Code Comment on \u00a7 1-205(2) states that \u201cfull recognition is ... available for new usages and for usages currently observed by the great majority of decent dealers, even though dissidents ready to cut corners do not agree.\u201d Rather than a strict \u201cuniversality\u201d standard, we find that the appropriate Massachusetts standard is a \u201cpractice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage are to be proved as facts.\u201d Mass.Gen.Laws Ann. ch. 106, \u00a7 1-205(3). <em>Cf. Thibeault v. Pickering, </em>2 Mass.App.Ct. 421, 313 N.E.2d 586, 588 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">While we take issue with the district court\u2019s precise formulation of the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>standard, we agree with its holding that appellants did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding of a contract lasting more than \u201ctwo years plus.\u201d Bush-kin\u2019s own testimony concerning his own practice and general usage was quite strong on this point. Moreover, Bushkin proposed a \u201ctwo years plus\u201d provision to Raytheon in connection with other potential acquisitions. Bushkin\u2019s experience and background in the field lend great weight to his testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Appellants primarily refer to two kinds of evidence to support their contention that a genuine issue remains concerning the time term. First, they argue that the testimony of their expert, Stanley Foster Reed, could have supported a finding of a five-year obligation. Reed\u2019s testimony, however, did not primarily concern the provisions of the express contract. Rather, depending on the interpretation, Reed\u2019s testimony was either focused on a contract implied in fact or a contract implied in law. <em>See infra </em>at 150. Insofar as it directly related to the express contract, Reed\u2019s testimony consisted of a hypothetical opinion, which assumed the existence of an express contract, about the reasonableness of the fee. Bushkin\u2019s attorney, in his final redirect examination of Reed, concentrated on showing that Reed\u2019s testimony was primarily directed to the quantum meruit claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Reed\u2019s only clear statement about a five-year obligation came during cross-examination by Raytheon\u2019s attorney. Neither the attorney nor Reed specified whether this \u201cobligation\u201d was for a contract implied in law or in fact or for an express contract. Reed, however, stated several times during his testimony that the overall opinion he formed about the case did not rely upon the express agreement and, indeed, was completely independent of it. We assume, therefore, that his answer concerning the five-year obligation was part of this overall view of the case. It certainly could not reasonably overcome Bushkin\u2019s clear testimony about his general practice and about the specific contract at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Second, appellants point to a Raytheon statement, made in the course of an exchange of letters with Bushkin in 1976, concerning its views on its obligations to brokers. Appellants contend . that the statement shows that Raytheon saw its obligations to brokers as lasting at least three or four years. Bushkin had suggested two companies, Cameron Iron Works and Harnischfeger, as possible acquisition candidates. Seaman wrote in response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALE\">We have a record of previous interest on Cameron Iron Works, and are obligated to another broker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">Also, we have studied and declined interest in Harnischfeger a number of times in the past years. If our interest was to be rekindled, it would be appropriate for us to check with those who have given us the previous recommendations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Raytheon\u2019s internal memos indicate that the proposals made by other brokers dated back three years for Cameron Iron Works and four years for Harnischfeger. Bush-kin, who was not aware of the nature of these other proposals, wrote back:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\">If another firm has presented Hamisch-feger to you within the past two years and you have an obligation to them, it indeed would be inappropriate for Bush-kin Associates, Inc. to become involved. However, if the most recent submission dates back four or five years, it would be unreasonable to expect that an obligation still exists \u2014 and it would be appropriate for Bushkin Associates, Inc. to act on your behalf. Given this generally accepted standard \u2014 namely, that an obligation lasts two years \u2014 please let me know if it is appropriate for me to speak <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>with Henry Harnischfeger on Raytheon\u2019s behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Raytheon did not respond to Bushkin\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">This correspondence presents the curious spectacle of Raytheon and Bushkin engaging in a disagreement in which each party takes a position opposite to the one it has taken during this litigation. It is not clear whether, as appellants contend, Bushkin\u2019s failure to do any further work on the two companies indicates that he accepted Ray-theon\u2019s position, or whether, on the contrary, Raytheon\u2019s failure to respond indicates that Raytheon accepted Bushkin\u2019s position. Either, or neither, inference may be correct. It is undisputed, however, that Bushkin had the last word. In addition, Raytheon\u2019s internal memos on the two companies are far from conclusive as to whether it viewed its relations with the other brokers as a matter of obligation or of convenience. In any case, this correspondence cannot establish a three- or four-year obligation either as a general Raytheon policy or as part of a course of dealing with Bushkin. <em>Cf. </em>Mass.Gen.L.Ann. ch. 106, \u00a7 1-205(3) (1958) (definition of \u201ccourse of dealing\u201d). These letters certainly did not present an issue for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">We conclude, therefore, that sufficient evidence was presented for a jury to have found an express contract for a term of at most two years plus \u201ccontinuing interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">III. \u201cCONTINUING INTEREST\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">As we have noted, a \u201ctwo years plus continuing interest\u201d provision would mean that the issue on the express contract claim is whether Raytheon\u2019s interest in acquiring Beech was renewed before January 28,1977. During argument, this issue was often referred to as that of \u201crekindling.\u201d The district judge held that the jury could have found that Bushkin\u2019s practice of asking for a time term of two years \u201cplus continuing negotiations\u201d could be interpreted in line with his explanation of the phrase as two years \u201cplus continuing interest.\u201d He also held, however, that appellants had not presented sufficient evidence that the rekindling had occurred during the required time.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The first dilemma facing us concerns the meaning of the term \u201ccontinuing interest.\u201d \u201cContinuing interest\u201d is not a legal term, at least as it is used here. Defining the phrase requires a factual inquiry into a business practice. The contours of the practice were outlined in the course of Bushkin\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-12\">In other words, I submit a company as an acquisition candidate to a client, and the client can\u2019t decide whether or not he\u2019s interested, but he keeps asking for information; and he says \u2014 for example, as Bill Gottwald said for that whole period of a year, I\u2019m interested in Beech aircraft, but nothing happens between the parties, there were no negotiations, but his interest was sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">When that happens, I consider that that obligation continues, and I believe the clients recognize that as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">App. at 373. Bushkin further stated that such \u201ccontinuing interest\u201d did not require any communication between the potential acquirer and the prospective acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">We think that the precise interpretation of \u201ccontinuing interest,\u201d in the context of the evidence presented in this case concerning business practices, involves the application of common sense and experience, and the evaluation of the credibility of witnesses: <em>i.e., </em>a typical inquiry for a jury. Once the jury had decided the meaning of \u201ccontinuing interest\u201d here, it could have proceeded to inquire whether such an interest existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">We review the chronology of events around the time that the two-year period was expiring. On November 29,1976, Royal Little of Lonsdale sent Phillips a letter, suggesting Beech as a possible acquisition for Raytheon. On December 1, 1976, according to deposition testimony, Angus MacDonald spoke to Phillips about the advantages to Raytheon of such a transaction. Phillips responded that the idea was \u201cvery interesting\u201d and that he would discuss it with his colleagues. On February 16, 1977, Phillips expressed his desire to meet Olive Beech and declared that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201cvery much interested in taking over Beech Aircraft.\u201d On February 28, 1977, Phillips denied a renewed interest in Beech in a conversation with Bushkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Appellants make a reasonable argument that these facts could have sustained a legitimate finding by the jury that a sufficient \u201cinterest\u201d was rekindled before January 28, 1977. They stress that Phillips\u2019 positive response to MacDonald on December 1, 1976, was clearly different than his negative statements about Beech in July and November, 1975. This difference indicates, they argue, a substantial change of heart, a renewal of interest. In addition, they point to Phillips\u2019 denial of interest in Beech on February 28, 1977, twelve days after he had expressed a desire to acquire the company. To be sure, as appellee argues, Phillips was under no obligation to inform Bushkin of any of Raytheon\u2019s activities. The jury, however, could have considered whether Phillips\u2019 disingenuous denial signified that he wished to conceal the fact that he was proceeding with Lonsdale in violation of the contract with Bushkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Appellants also point to the failure of Phillips and Seaman to recall exactly when their interest in Beech was rekindled. We do not accept appellants\u2019 contention that this claimed lack of memory raises a negative inference as a matter of law or that the burden of proof on these matters lies with Raytheon. These were factors, however, that a jury might have considered as bearing on the credibility of these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In light of the foregoing evidence, the jury might have thought that Phillips' expressed desire to acquire Beech on February 16, 1977, was sufficiently strong to indicate that it had been \u201crekindled\u201d nineteen days earlier. If that were the case, the contract with Bushkin would still have been in effect. The jury could have based such a conclusion on its judgment that one does not decide to pursue a transaction of that magnitude without a significant period of reflection. Perhaps the February 16 statement could not alone give rise to an inference about the timing of the decision; in the context of all the other facts, however, we cannot say that it would have been unreasonable for a jury to have arrived at the conclusion that the interest shown on that date was a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of interest that existed at least nineteen days previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">An evaluation of all these matters involves a consideration of the credibility and demeanor of witnesses, common sense and experience, and general knowledge of human action and motivation. These matters were within the province of the jury and well beyond the area of pure speculation or conjecture. We find that the evidence here warranted submitting to the jury the question of whether there was a sufficient renewal of \u201cinterest\u201d in Beech Aircraft by January 28, 1977, to extend the contract with Bushkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">IV. QUANTUM MERUIT</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Appellants also challenge the district court\u2019s rejection of their claim for the reasonable value of the information and services provided by Bushkin to Raytheon. Raytheon argues that appellants are barred as a matter of law from raising this claim. It contends that recovering on quasi-contractual grounds is not permitted where an enforceable express contract exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We reject appellee\u2019s contention. In the first place, the question of whether there was an express contract remains to be decided. For example, the district court held that the issue of whether Seaman had any authority, apparent or actual, to conclude the agreement with Bushkin presented a jury question. Such being the case, appellants were certainly entitled to plead in the alternative, arguing a quantum meruit theory as well as an express contract theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">More importantly, restitution on quasi-contractual grounds often enters into the remedial calculus in a contractual context. <em>See generally </em>Perillo, <em>Restitution in a Contractual Context, </em>73 Colum.L.Rev. 1208 (1973).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is well established that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>party to a contract may have the right to a quasi-contractual remedy when the other party has breached. <em>See, e.g., Salamon v. Terra, </em>394 Mass. 857, 477 N.E.2d 1029, 1032 (1985); Restatement of Restitution, \u00a7 107(1) (1936). This is particularly the case where there has not been full performance because of the breaching party\u2019s violation of the terms of the agreement. <em>See Fay, Spofford and Thorndike, Inc. v. Mas-sachussetts Port Authority, </em>7 Mass. App.Ct. 336, 387 N.E.2d 206, 209 (1979). If it had resolved the \u201crekindling\u201d issue in Bushkin\u2019s favor, the jury might have found that Raytheon\u2019s failure to work with Bush-kin on the Beech transaction constituted a violation of the January 28, 1975, agreement. This failure would have prevented Bushkin from fully providing the services implied in that agreement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The district court ruled against appellants on the quantum meruit claim because it found that they had failed to prove that Raytheon had received any benefit from the information provided by Bushkin in 1975. The court\u2019s ruling was based on testimony by Phillips and Seaman that the information provided by Bushkin was placed in a closed file.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Appellants argue that Bushkin provided several important services to Raytheon. During the January 28, 1975, conversation, Bushkin informed Seaman that Beech could be acquired; Seaman had not been aware of that fact. Bushkin also gave Seaman various pieces of information about Beech. As a result of the conversation, Seaman ordered an internal Raytheon study of Beech. During the course of the year, Bushkin provided further information about Beech and continued to advocate the acquisition of Beech by Raytheon. To be sure, Raytheon\u2019s interest in Beech lay dormant between November, 1975, and November, 1976; it does not seem appropriate, however, to direct a verdict simply on the basis of the location of the file containing Bushkin\u2019s information. A jury might reasonably have found that the interest stimulated by Bushkin and the information provided by him in 1975 prepared the groundwork for the decision by Raytheon officials to pursue Beech approximately one year later. It might also have found that Bushkin\u2019s information was significant based on the fact that, as late as February, 1977, Royal Little of Lonsdale had not learned of Beech\u2019s requirements for a takeover. All these matters should have been evaluated by the jurors in the context of their common sense and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Finally, the testimony of appellants\u2019 expert Stanley Foster Reed could have been considered by the jury on the quantum meruit claim. As we have noted, Reed\u2019s testimony was ambiguous in parts as to what legal claim it concerned. In the final redirect examination by appellants\u2019 counsel, however, Reed clearly focussed on the quantum meruit theory. He declared that the reasonable value of the information provided by Bushkin to Raytheon was one-half percent of the final transaction. We see no reason why the jury should not have been allowed to consider the testimony of Reed, along with all the other evidence, on the quantum meruit claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">V. CONTRACT IMPLIED IN FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">The district judge construed Count II of the complaint as broad enough to include a claim for a contract implied in fact as well as a contract implied in law. We think that this is at least an arguable proposition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The judge analyzed this claim in accordance with the testimony of appellants\u2019 ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>pert Reed. We have already observed that Reed\u2019s testimony could be interpreted as relating primarily either to quantum meruit or to a contract implied in fact. Appellants\u2019 attorney stressed the quantum meru-it interpretation. The district judge, however, focused on the support given by Reed\u2019s testimony for a contract implied in fact; a jury might also have interpreted it in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Reed testified that the conduct of the parties gave rise to an obligation to pay a reasonable fee for Bushkin\u2019s services. He stated that, to earn a fee, a finder need only inform a company of a potential acquisition, an activity he called \u201claying the name on them.\u201d He also stated that a \u201cgood finder\u201d not only \u201clays the name\u201d but also provides information about the advantages of the transaction. Reed discussed the information given by Bushkin to Seaman. He stressed that his finding of an implicit obligation to pay Bushkin was based on the presence of Bushkin\u2019s name in Raytheon\u2019s \u201cAcquisition Log,\u201d and the reference to Bushkin as \u201cour contact\u201d in a Raytheon internal memo. He testified that an acquisition log such as Raytheon\u2019s is maintained in order for a company to know to which broker or finder it owes an obligation. Reed testified that such an obligation lasts for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The district judge ruled that a claim of a contract implied in fact was barred by the proof presented by appellants on the express contract claim. Since appellants proved the existence of a \u201ctwo years plus\u201d express contract, the judge found that they were barred from claiming a five-year implied contract; two contradictory contracts could not have existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This appears to us to overstate the issue. Again, we note that the district court did not find that Bushkin had conclusively proven the existence of an express contract. Rather, it only decided that there was enough evidence for a jury to so find.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The jury, therefore, might have found against appellants on the express contract claim and yet have found for them on a contract implied in fact. Such an implied in fact contract would have been based on the conduct of the parties. The jury might have accepted that part of Reed\u2019s testimony establishing an implied obligation on the part of Raytheon on the basis of its conduct and its references to Bushkin in the log and the memo. It might also have accepted Reed\u2019s testimony on the duration of such an obligation; alternatively, it might have looked at the other evidence of trade practice and found a two-year or \u201ctwo years plus\u201d obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">In any case, a jury could have reasonably found an implied in fact contract and a verdict should not have been directed on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">VI. CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">Appellee argues that the directed verdict should be upheld due to the absence of a showing of efficient causation between Bushkin\u2019s efforts and the actual merger between Raytheon and Beech. We understand this contention as urging us to find an implied causation requirement in such agreements as a matter of law. This was not one of the grounds relied upon by the district court in granting the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">We decline to impose such a rule of law. We note the wide variety of agreements of this sort, variously referred to as involving \u201cbrokers,\u201d \u201cfinders\u201d and, even, \u201cmatchmakers.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Schaller v. Litton Industries, Inc., </em>307 F.Supp. 126, 127 (E.D. Wis.1969) (citing \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The distinction between these various kinds of agreements concerns the degree of involvement in the ultimate transaction required of the broker. Agreements have been upheld which required only the most minimal connection. In <em>Davidson v. Robie, </em>345 Mass. 333, 187 N.E.2d 371 (1963), the agreement provided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">at most for preliminary investigation by Davidson of possible business ventures, and a disclosure of them to Robie which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>if profitable, would give rise to compensation in the nature of a commission, or, perhaps what is sometimes called a \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d to be paid to one who brings to [the promissor] a deal out of which he makes money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><em>Id. </em>187 N.E.2d at 374 (cites omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Most of the Massachusetts case law in this field, particularly the older cases, involve \u201cbrokers,\u201d rather than \u201cfinders.\u201d The older cases often required the broker to be the efficient or predominating cause of the transaction. <em>See, e.g., Kacavas v. Diamond, </em>303 Mass. 88, 20 N.E.2d 936 (1939). More recent cases, however, such as <em>Davidson, </em>recognize that while a requirement of efficient or predominant causation may be the customary arrangement, unusual agreements may provide otherwise. <em>See Sampson v. Eaton Corp., </em>809 F.2d 156, 159-60 (1st Cir.1987). In <em>Julias Tofias &amp; Co. v. John B. Stetson Co., </em>19 Mass.App.Ct. 392, 474 N.E.2d 1162, 1165 (1985), the court summarized this trend by stating that \u201cparties are free to make the broker\u2019s right to a commission depend upon\u201d conditions other than efficient causation. The <em>Tofias </em>court evaluated the activities required of the broker on the basis of the language of the agreement and the nature of the employment. It found that the agreement at issue required only a \u201cminimal causal connection\u201d with the sale. <em>See Julias Tofias &amp; Co., </em>474 N.E.2d at 1166. <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 448, comment b (1958) (a \u201ccontract ... may provide that the agent\u2019s compensation is dependent upon the happening of an event whether or not the agent\u2019s efforts have produced it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The modern trend, in Massachusetts and in other jurisdictions, is for courts to treat as factual matters both the requirements of the specific agreement as well as the question of whether there was a showing of the requisite connection between the broker\u2019s efforts and the ultimate transaction. In <em>Simon v. Electrospace Corp., </em>28 N.Y.2d 136, 320 N.Y.S.2d 225, 269 N.E.2d 21, 24 (1971), the court found that the broker was not required to participate in negotiations between the two companies and that this did not bar recovery. The court further found that, despite a lapse of eighteen months between an initial set of negotiations and the \u201creactivation\u201d of the deal, \u201c \u2018[tjracing a connection between the two is supported by the facts and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom and is not to be rejected because of the intervening lapse of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting lower court opinion, 299 N.Y.S.2d 712, 32 A.D.2d 62 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">We do not believe that Massachusetts would adopt appellee\u2019s proposed legal rule requiring efficient causation in all cases. Based on our reading of the Massachusetts cases, we find that the appropriate determination of the connection between the final transaction and the activities of a broker or finder is a factual, rather than a legal, matter. The jury should have been allowed to find the exact nature of Bush-kin\u2019s obligations under the January 28, 1975, agreement. The basis for such a finding would have been, <em>inter alia, </em>the testimony of Bushkin and Seaman concerning that specific agreement, as well as the extensive testimony on general trade practices. After determining the exact nature of the agreement, the jury could have considered whether appellants had established the requisite connection between their efforts and the ultimate transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Finally, we note that, regardless of what the jury might have found on the causation issue, appellants could still recover if Raytheon violated the contract by working with Lonsdale. As the court stated in <em>Simon v. Electrospace Corp., </em>269 N.E.2d at 29: \u201cThe rule is well established in brokerage cases, and is analogous here, that interference with the opportunity of a broker to complete his services does not bar his right to commissions [cites omitted].\u201d If Raytheon prevented Bushkin from completing his obligations under the contract, such interference should not deprive Bushkin of a right to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-14\">. Plaintiffs also sought relief under Mass.Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 93A (West 1984). This claim was eliminated by the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Bushkin Associates, Inc. v. Raytheon, </em>393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-11\">. MacDonald\u2019s testimony was given in a pretrial deposition and was submitted to the district court as part of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reopen the evidence. Raytheon argues that this testimony, submitted after the judge had indicated he would grant a motion for a directed verdict on the express contract claim, is not properly before us. We agree that the district court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 motion to reopen. The district judge, however, examined the deposition testimony. His refusal to reopen the evidence was primarily based on a consideration of the impact of the deposition testimony on the merits of the directed verdict motion, rather than on procedural considerations. <em>See </em>App. at 1080 (\"[Tjhis testimony if it were admitted, would not change anything. So I am going to deny the motion.\u201d). <em>See generally </em>App. at 1071-80 (argument on motion to reopen). The motion to reopen, and the deposition testimony appended to it, are part of the record on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 10 (record on appeal consists of \"the original papers and exhibits filed in the district court\u2019\u2019); 9 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 1f 210.04[1] (2d ed. 1986) (Fed.R.App.P. 10 refers to any document made part of the proceedings before the district court). We stress that this is not a situation of a denial of a motion to reopen simply on the grounds that plaintiff had the opportunity to offer the evidence during the presentation of his case. The directed verdict was in part based on the district court\u2019s consideration of the substance of the deposition testimony. We must, therefore, consider that testimony in reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of the motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\">.
