Hines (homeowners), appeal the decision of the district court granting summary judgment to State Farm Fire and Casualty Company in an action to recover under an insurance policy. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-23\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">On December 20, 1984, the homeowners applied for a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm), through its Hinesville, Georgia agent, Sanford Carter. One of Carter\u2019s employees completed the application with information received from Mr. Hines. The application shows that to one question Mr. Hines answered \u201cunemployed at present.\u201d To another question, the answer showed that Morris and Templeton Agency was the most recent homeowner\u2019s insurer. Under the section entitled \u201cOther Interest on the Property,\u201d appears \u201cfireplace has been closed in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-25\">On January 14,1985, a fire destroyed the insured property. The homeowners notified State Farm of the loss the next day. On February 7, 1985, State Farm sent a letter to the homeowners advising them of their obligations under the policy\u2019s provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this letter, State Farm did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>request that the homeowners produce copies of their federal income tax returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Soon after sending the letter, State Farm hired a private investigator to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and cause of the fire. On February 11, 1985, State Farm informed the homeowners that the fire was incendiary in origin and requested that they execute a \u201cnon-waiver agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the request of State Farm, the homeowners executed an \u201cInformation Release,\u201d prepared by State Farm authorizing any \u201cbanks, savings institutions, creditors, credit bureau, mortgagees, utility companies, employers and or governmental agencies to release information and/or records pertaining\u201d to their monetary or financial transactions to State Farm. After completing the execution of the documents, State Farm informed the homeowners that the fire was incendiary in origin and that they had caused the loss. The homeowners were not represented by counsel during this period, but soon thereafter retained a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">On February 14, 1985, the homeowners\u2019 lawyer made a demand for payment under the policy claiming $86,800 for the residence and its contents. On February 19, 1985, State Farm advised the homeowners\u2019 lawyer that the fire resulted from arson and that State Farm was conducting an investigation to determine the persons responsible. State Farm rejected the demand for payment on the ground of noncompliance with the policy\u2019s requirements. As a result, the homeowners submitted a new sworn proof of loss statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">On April 29, 1985, State Farm deposed the homeowners. During the oral examination, the homeowners answered all of State Farm\u2019s questions, including those relating to their financial status and sources of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">On May 2, 1985, State Farm wrote the homeowners\u2019 lawyer to affirm an alleged prior understanding that the homeowners would furnish copies of federal income tax returns and information relating to other claims submitted to another insurer of the property. On May 13, 1985, the homeowners\u2019 lawyer wrote State Farm stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7d\">We did not agree to obtain copies of the requested income tax returns and submit them to you. It was agreed that we would make whatever information concerning Morris and Templeton Insurance Agency available to you, and as soon as the transcripts are sent to us, we will return the same to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">The lawyer also requested that State Farm cancel the previously executed form authorizing the release of financial information and called upon State Farm to \u201cplease show\u201d whether investigations into the homeowners\u2019 personal affairs were authorized under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">In light of this request, State Farm can-celled the release form executed by the homeowners, but on June 7, 1985, requested authorization to acquire the homeowners\u2019 income tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service. State Farm did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>indicate the policy provision which entitled it to conduct investigations into the homeowners\u2019 personal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">On July 3,1985, State Farm informed the homeowners that they had not received the requested authorization nor the information relating to additional claims filed with other insurers. On September 16, 1985, after receiving no response, State Farm advised the homeowners that their claim had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On December 23, 1985, the homeowners filed suit in the District Court for the Southern District of Georgia to recover under the State Farm policy. State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that the homeowners had failed to comply with certain conditions of the policy; consequently, they were banned from recovery under the policy. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Summary judgment should be granted only when evidence produced by the non-moving party, when viewed in the light most favorable to that party, fails to establish genuine issues of material fact. <em>Tippens v. Celotex Corp., </em>805 F.2d 949 (11th Cir.1986). In this case, as noted by the district court, State Farm was required to demonstrate the absence of a genuine dispute as to any material fact. <em>Dixie Stevedores, Inc. v. Marinic Maritime, Ltd., </em>778 F.2d 670 (11th Cir.1985); <em>Mercantile Bank and Trust Co., Ltd. v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., </em>750 F.2d 838 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The district court, in relying exclusively upon the recent Georgia Supreme Court decision in <em>Halcome v. Cincinnati Insurance Co., </em>254 Ga. 742, 334 S.E.2d 155 (1985), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">Faced with the <em>Halcome </em>decision which holds that an insured breaches an insurance contract if he fails to provide <em>any </em>material information reasonably called for under the policy, and plaintiffs\u2019 inability to show some legitimate excuse for their failure to produce the tax returns, the Court has no choice but to grant defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The information sought is relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 possible motive for arson. Plaintiffs inexcusably failed to comply with the conditions precedent of the policy before bringing suit. The policy was breached, making it void, and leaving no genuine issue of fact for a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s determination that the information sought by State Farm in this case, i.e., the federal income tax returns, necessarily constituted \u201cmaterial information.\u201d We interpret <em>Hal-come </em>as requiring an insured to provide any \u201cmaterial information\u201d to the insurer that the insurer is entitled to receive under the insurance policy, and, absent an excusable failure to do so, constitutes a breach of the insurance contract. <em>Halcome, </em>254 Ga. at 744, 334 S.E.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">In reaching this conclusion, we note several factors which indicate that the income tax returns did not constitute \u201cmaterial information.\u201d First, the homeowners executed an \u201cInformation Release\u201d form prepared by, and at the request of, State Farm authorizing various institutions, individuals, and governmental agencies to release financial information and records. State Farm maintained possession of the \u201cInformation Release\u201d form for approximately ninety days without attempting to obtain the requested federal income tax returns. Although State Farm argues that the release was insufficient to acquire federal income tax returns, State Farm cannot properly attack the adequacy of the release form because it prepared the form and presented it to the homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">In addition, the homeowners, at the request of State Farm, appeared for an oral examination under oath and answered all questions relating to the claim, including information regarding their financial matters and other insurers of the property. Prior to the deposition, State Farm had requested that the homeowners bring with them documents \u201cin their possession\u201d relating to other insurers of the property and their federal income tax returns for the years 1980 through 1984. When the homeowners appeared for their depositions, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>informed State Farm that all copies of their income tax returns and other requested documents had been destroyed in the fire. No evidence indicates to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">State Farm has not indicated the policy provision which entitled it to require the homeowners to produce copies of their income tax returns. Additionally, although State Farm continued to request the tax returns, it never provided the homeowners with a form which it considered adequate to obtain copies of the income tax returns. During the course of this lawsuit State Farm obtained the income tax returns. At oral argument, State Farm admitted that the information in the income tax returns did not reveal any new information.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">State Farm cites an Ohio appellate court decision, <em>Moore v. State Farm, </em>Nos. 9200 and 9376 (Court of Appeals of Montgomery County, Ohio, Dec. 3, 1985), holding that income tax returns are \u201cper se relevant\u201d in actions where the insurer raises the defense of arson as grounds for denying a claim. The district court erroneously held that the court in <em>Moore, </em>in reaching its decision, applied \u201clegal principles very similar to those adopted in this State.\u201d We do not interpret <em>Halcome </em>or any other Georgia case as creating a \u201cper se relevant\u201d rule requiring that an insured produce income tax returns in cases where the insurer suspects fraud. In fact, the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Halcome, </em>in responding to questions certified by this court and addressing the issue we now address, was presented with five specific subject areas to determine whether an insured\u2019s failure to provide any material information relating to any one of the enumerated subject areas would constitute a breach of the insurance contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Georgia Supreme Court, specifically declined to address the issue of whether an insured\u2019s failure to provide federal income tax returns would constitute a breach, and addressed only the first of the five enumerated topics holding that a refusal to provide information relating to an insured\u2019s income and sources of income would constitute a breach of the insurance contract. <em>Halcome, </em>254 Ga. at 744, 334 S.E.2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-11\">An additional issue of material fact exists which should have prevented the trial court from entering summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The <em>Halcome </em>case, after stating that \u201cif the Halcomes failed to provide <em>any </em>material information called for under \u00a7 12(d) of the policy, <em>supra, </em>they breached the insurance contract. ...\u201d, 254 Ga. 742, 744, 334 S.E.2d 155 (1985) (emphasis in the original), the court stated in the next paragraph: \u201c... Thus, there is a breach of the contract <em>unless some principle excuses the failure </em>by the Halcomes to furnish the information____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 744, 334 S.E.2d 155 (emphasis added). Here, the Hineses had testified under oath, that the income tax returns had been destroyed in the fire, and that other material sought by State Farm had been likewise destroyed. It seems clear that they had thus raised the issue of whether \u201csome principle\u201d existed that excused their failure to furnish this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">In this case, we find that the issue of whether the homeowners\u2019 federal income tax returns constituted \u201cmaterial information\u201d and the issue of whether some principle \u201cexcused the failure\u201d were factual issues genuinely disputed between the parties. Thus, these factual issues warranted resolution by a jury. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the district court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b761-14\">. 2.
