The decree ordered the Warden to implement various changes in classification procedures and daily routines in San Quentin\u2019s North Segregation unit. The decree set forth minimum requirements for housing and treatment of condemned inmates. The decree also specified various types of personal property and clothing to be made available to these inmates and set guidelines for food service and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-22\">Since entry of the consent decree, the inmates have filed four motions to hold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>Warden in contempt. All contempt motions but the last were subsequently withdrawn, after the Warden gave assurances of future compliance with the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">Significantly, a provision in the consent decree stated that in the event of a dispute over compliance with the decree, the court could establish procedures for the resolution of any such disputes. Consent Decree of Oct. 23, 1980 at 2 (N.D. Cal.1980) (No. 79-1630). Referring to this provision, the inmates filed a motion in district court on January 11, 1985 requesting appointment of a special master pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 53<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to assure compliance with the decree. Defendants objected.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1421-7\">[I]n the event of a dispute, ... with respect to whether the terms of this decree have been reasonably complied with, any party may present such dispute to this Court which will then establish procedures for the resolution of such dispute and may thereafter issue such orders as it deems necessary to assure compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1421-16\">After considering written and oral arguments from both sides, the district court found that \u201cexceptional conditions\u201d warranted the appointment of a special master.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, on March 25, 1985, Judge Weigel entered an order appointing Robert R. Riggs as \u201cMonitor,\u201d and filed an accompanying Order of Reference, detail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>ing the Monitor\u2019s responsibilities, authority and compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The Warden appealed the appointing order and this motions panel was presented with the narrow task of considering whether the court of appeals has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-6\">The issue of whether a district court\u2019s order appointing a special master to supervise compliance with a consent decree is immediately appealable presents a question of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-7\">The court of appeals does not ordinarily have jurisdiction over appeals from interlocutory decisions. However, appellate jurisdiction exists for: <em>Interlocutory orders </em>of the district courts ... or of the judges thereof, <em>granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, </em>or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions, ____ 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-9\">We must first consider whether the consent decree before us is equivalent to an injunction. Injunctions are \u201corders that are directed to a party, enforceable by contempt, and designed to accord or protect \u2018some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint\u2019 in more than preliminary fashion.\u201d 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper and E. Gressman, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction </em>\u00a7 3922, at 29 (1977) (quoting <em>International Products Corp. v. Koons, </em>325 F.2d 403, 406 (2d Cir. 1963)). <em>Accord Avery v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>762 F.2d 158, 160 (1st Cir.1985); <em>United States v. Western Electric Company, 777 </em>F.2d 23, 28 n. 12 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-19\">\u00a31] Here, the consent decree prescribes conduct for the California Department of Corrections and compels compliance. Indeed, an inmates\u2019 motion for a contempt order for the Warden\u2019s alleged partial noncompliance with the decree is pending in the district court. Accordingly, we conclude that the consent decree is \u201csufficiently injunctive in nature\u201d to be treated as an \u201cinjunction\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>See Smith v. Eggar, </em>655 F.2d 181, 184 (9th Cir.1981) (order enforcing an agreement of security).</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-20\">We must next consider whether, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), the interlocutory order appointing the Monitor is an order \u201cgranting, modifying, refusing, or dissolving\u201d the consent decree. <em>Carson v. American Brands, Inc., </em>450 U.S. 79, 84,101 S.Ct. 993, 996-97, 67 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981), set out a three-part test to apply in determining whether an appeal falls under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1): (1) does the order have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction; (2) does the order have serious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>perhaps irreparable consequences; and (3) is the order one that can be effectively challenged only by immediate appeal? The Ninth Circuit adopted this test in <em>EEOC v. Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>796 F.2d 314, 316-17 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\"><em>Gary W. v. Louisiana, </em>601 F.2d 240 (5th Cir.1979), examined the State of Louisiana\u2019s compliance with a 1976 injunctive court order protecting the rights of mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed, and other handicapped children. <em>Id. </em>at 242. In 1978 the district court appointed a special master to monitor compliance with the 1976 order; on appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that the interlocutory appointment of a special master was a modification of an injunction under section 1292(a)(1) and therefore ap-pealable. <em>Id. </em>at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-6\">We agree with the Fifth Circuit to the extent that jurisdictional analysis under section 1292(a)(1) should focus on whether the interlocutory order appointing a special master \u201cmodifies\u201d the consent decree. The inmates, however, argue that <em>Gary W. </em>is distinguishable and not controlling here. In <em>Gary W. </em>the district court had previously been requested to appoint a special master as part of the injunction and refused to do so. <em>Id. </em>Here, neither side raised the issue of a special master in shaping the consent decree. We find the decree implicitly contemplates appointment of a master by retaining authority to \u201cestablish procedures\u201d for its compliance. Therefore, unlike <em>Gary W., </em>appointment of the Monitor here is pursuant to, and not a modification of, the original consent decree. The appointing order appealed from does not have the practical effect of the grant or denial of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-7\"><em>Carson </em>also requires a showing of serious and irreparable harm from the interlocutory order and a showing of no other opportunity for its effective appeal. Here, the Warden made no showing of serious or irreparable harm from the interim appointment of a master. In addition, the Warden has not shown that the appointment of a special master cannot be effectively reviewed when the district court decides whether to adopt the Monitor\u2019s recommendations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">Furthermore, the congressional policy against piecemeal appeals is best served by deferring review. <em>Switzerland Cheese Association v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, </em>385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966). Appointment of the Monitor facilitates pretrial procedure and our review of the matter at this time would be premature. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-12\">The requirements of section 1292(a)(1) have not been met and we find that this court has no jurisdiction to hear the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-13\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1420-13\">.

With respect to the United States Constitution, plaintiffs claim that the conditions of their incarceration amount to cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the eighth amendment. The eighth amendment, applicable to the states through the fourteenth, establishes limits on the conditions that states may impose on prisoners. <em>Rhodes v. Chapman, </em>452 U.S. 337, 344-45, 'lOl S.Ct. 2392, 2397-98, 69 L.Ed.2d 59 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1420-24\">.

Subject to the specifications and limitations stated in the order, the master has and shall exercise the power to regulate all proceedings in every hearing before him and to do all acts and take all measures necessary or proper for the efficient performance of his duties under the order. He may require the production before him of evidence upon all matters embraced in the reference, including the production of all books, papers, vouchers, documents, and writings applicable thereto. He may rule upon the admissibility of evidence unless otherwise directed by the order of reference and has the authority to put witnesses on oath and may himself examine them and may call the parties to the action and examine them upon oath.
