The district court held for Fielding. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-24\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-25\">In 1982, International Harvester discharged Fielding as part of a reduction of sales personnel in its Oakland office. He was then 56 and had been a Harvester employee for over 32 years. On the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>of his age and years of service, Fielding in 1982 potentially was eligible for early retirement benefits under two sections of Harvester\u2019s plan. Under Article II, section 2 of the plan, Fielding could \u201cretire at [his] option\u201d and thereby become entitled to \u201cregular early retirement\u201d benefits. Under section 3, Fielding could be \u201cretired at the option of the Company\u201d and thereby become entitled to higher \u201cspecial early retirement\u201d benefits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After eliminating his position in Oakland, Harvester told Fielding that no other post was available to him. Fielding applied for both the regular and the special benefits. Harvester\u2019s plan administrator granted him the former but denied the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">In denying the special benefits, the administrator relied on Harvester\u2019s Summary Plan Description, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1352-5\">Special early retirement benefits are primarily reserved for employees involved in the closing of an entire Company facility and are granted at the option of the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">At trial, Harvester introduced evidence to show a consistent policy of offering such benefits only to employees discharged when an office was entirely closed and to employees who agreed to leave in 1978 during a \u201cwindow period\u201d when Harvester wanted to reduce operations generally without actually firing any workers. Fielding does not dispute that this was Harvester\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">Fielding sued for the special benefits. After a bench trial, the district court held in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6W\">An ERISA plan administrator\u2019s decisions are to be sustained unless \u201carbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, </em>654 F.2d 650, 654 (9th Cir. 1981). ERISA trustees have \u201cwide discretion \u2018short of plainly unjust measures\u2019 to decide questions of eligibility.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Montgomery Ward Trust, </em>787 F.2d 1302, 1308 (9th Cir.1986). Any \u201creasonable\u201d interpretation of the plan terms should be upheld. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-12\">To some extent this degree of deference derives from trust law rules reflecting the presupposition that trustees have no pecuniary interest in their own decisions. In many ERISA cases, however, as here, the employer administers its own plan and, in one fashion or another, may be affected financially by its decisions. As we have previously held, in such circumstances \u201c[l]ess deference should be given to the trustee's decision.\u201d <em>Jung v. FMC Corp., </em>755 F.2d 708, 712 (9th Cir.1985). Nonetheless, we preserve the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d vocabulary in these cases. And even in Jung-like situations, our review remains deferential. Provided that the plan terms at issue are ambiguous, we will uphold the employer\u2019s interpretation so long as it is reasonable and made in good faith. <em>See id. </em>at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-14\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-15\">The district court held that Harvester\u2019s denial of special benefits to Fielding was arbitrary and capricious. The judge gave three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-16\">A. <em>Plain Meaning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-17\">The district court commenced with the fact that under the plan, an employee \u201cretired at the option of the Company\u201d is entitled to special benefits. Fielding was \u201cretired at the option of the Company,\u201d the district court concluded. As the district court saw it, Harvester\u2019s position would require that \u201c \u2018retired\u2019 mean[ ] \u2018terminated <em>plus </em>unilaterally granted special benefits at the discretion of the Company.\u2019 \u201d E.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>at 26 (opinion below) (emphasis added). Any such gloss on the term \u201cretired\u201d would violate the plain meaning of the term \u201cretired,\u201d the district court concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">The flaw in this reasoning is that the issue is not what \u201cretired\u201d means. The issue in truth is what \u201cretired at the [company\u2019s] option\u201d means.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">To be \u201cretired\u201d by one\u2019s employer is, of course, a euphemism. It means discharge by one\u2019s employer accompanied by some benefits of economic worth. The mere existence, however, of a special benefits program that permits an employer to say it is \u201cretiring\u201d rather than \u201cfiring\u201d certain senior employees, does not require the employer to implement that program in a particular way each time it chooses to discharge such an employee. Such a requirement would itself go beyond \u201cplain meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-7\">The key distinction is that to \u201cdischarge\u201d an employee, even one of long service, is not the same as to \u201cretire\u201d him. While involuntary retirement involves a discharge, it also includes the offer of special, favorable conditions that render further employment less necessary. The precise nature of those special, favorable conditions cannot be determined merely by characterizing the employer\u2019s action as a retirement. It follows that \u201cretired at the [company\u2019s] option\u201d easily embraces an involuntary discharge accompanied by such benefits as the employer chooses, or has chosen, to provide. Under this interpretation both the discharge and the benefits may be \u201cat the [company\u2019s] option.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-8\">B. <em>Illusory Promise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">The district court believed that to make the benefits \u201cat the [company\u2019s] option\u201d would \u201crender the promise to supply special pension benefits illusory.\u201d E.R. at 27. The district court confused a conditional promise with a statement such as \u201cI promise to sell my car if, when, and to whom I may want to,\u201d which, of course, is no promise at all. Harvester promised to pay \u201cspecial early retirement benefits\u201d to those discharged \u201cin the closing of an entire Company facility.\u201d True, this promise was qualified by the terms \u201cprimarily\u201d and \u201cat the option of the Company.\u201d However, it is clear that this reserved power must be exercised in good faith and in accordance with past practices. The record indicates that it has been so exercised in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-11\">C. <em>Tax Provisions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-12\">Finally, the district court ruled that the prerequisites of the plan\u2019s tax-exempt status precluded the interpretation Harvester advances. This too was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-13\">The Harvester plan states that it is designed to qualify as tax-exempt under the ERISA provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Federal treasury regulations and revenue rulings require a tax-exempt pension plan to define benefits \u201cin accordance with a stipulated formula that is not subject to the discretion of the employer.\u201d Rev.Rul. 74-385, 1974-2 C.B. 130 (interpreting 26 C.F.R. 1.401-1). Fielding contends, and the district court concluded, that Harvester\u2019s interpretation of the special benefits provision fails under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-14\">The significance of tax exemption requirements in resolving an ERISA dispute is unclear. <em>Compare Craig v. Bemis Co., </em>517 F.2d 677, 686 (5th Cir.1975) (\u201cplaintiffs may not predicate their contractually-derived pension rights on the Company\u2019s tax exemptions\u201d) <em>with Dennard v. Richards Group, Inc., </em>681 F.2d 306, 316 (5th Cir. 1982) (\u201cthe fact that the [company\u2019s] interpretation of the Plan is contrary to IRS interpretations lends support to a finding of arbitrary construction\u201d). Whatever the relevance of the tax rules in a dispute on the contract, they do not dictate the result for which Fielding contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-15\">Were Treasury regulations to condemn all payment provisions tied to an ERISA employer\u2019s option, Harvester\u2019s special early retirement provision would fail even on Fielding\u2019s interpretation. Payment of these benefits would continue to depend on Harvester\u2019s exercising the option of discharging an employee. This result would not aid Fielding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-16\">More to the point, Harvester\u2019s special benefits (once awarded) <em>are </em>calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>\u201cin accordance with a stipulated formula that is not subject to the [employer\u2019s] discretion.\u201d Rev.Rul. 74-385, <em>supra. </em>It is only when determining who qualifies for benefits that Harvester exercises any discretion. And on \u201cquestions of eligibility\u201d it is settled ERISA law that \u201cwide discretion\u201d may be exercised. <em>Hancock, </em>787 F.2d at 1308. Fielding and the court below are confusing the determination of eligibility for benefits with the computation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-6\">We cannot say that Harvester acted unreasonably or with bad faith in interpreting its plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">. In Fielding's case, the regular benefits amount monthly to about $215 until the age of 65 and $175 thereafter; the special benefits would be about $490 monthly until 65 and $275 thereafter. These contested benefits are in addition to an uncontested monthly payment of $285 under the plan's contributory retirement provisions. They are, moreover, supererogatory with respect to ERISA; Harvester\u2019s plan satisfies ERISA\u2019s minimum requirements with or without the special early retirement benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
