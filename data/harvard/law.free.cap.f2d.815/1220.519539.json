We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision, and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-16\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-17\">Johnson, who was sixty years old when fired, worked since November of 1979 as a service technician for Perkins Restaurants. On February 1, 1983, while working at a Perkins Restaurant in Fridley, Minnesota, Johnson kissed a sixteen year-old waitress named Julie Hommes on the back of the head. The next day Johnson was fired for sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-18\">II. DISCUSSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-19\">Johnson argued before the district court that he was wrongfully fired based on age, and that the sexual harassment charge was merely a pretext. The court found that Johnson had made a prima facie case of discrimination because he was in a protected age group, was satisfying the normal requirements of his job when fired, and after the firing Perkins continued to seek applicants with similar qualifications. The court next examined whether Perkins had advanced a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the firing. Under the ADEA, an employer may meet this burden by showing that the firing was \u201cfor good cause,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(3), or by showing that it was \u201cbased on reasonable factors other than age,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-20\">Perkins claimed that Johnson was fired because he violated explicit company policy against sexual harassment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> set out in Perkins Human Resources Policy Memo No. 449, which considers sexual harassment as \u201cgrounds for disciplinary action, including termination.\u201d Johnson responded that in firing him, Perkins had violated Perkins Human Resources Policy Memo No. 445, which provides that \u201cdocumented progressive warnings [shall] be issued to employees in case of substandard performance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>and/or violation of company policy or procedures.\u201d The district court found, however, that under the terms of the sexual harassment policy (Memo No. 449), progressive discipline was only applicable \u201cwhen appropriate.\u201d The district court thus found reasonable Perkins\u2019 explanation that because each case was looked at individually, a sexual harassment charge might legitimately result in immediate termination pursuant to management discretion. In sum, the district court found that Johnson failed to prove that, more likely than not, Perkins improperly fired him based on age, and dismissed Johnson\u2019s complaint. Johnson then filed a motion for a new trial based on the improper introduction into evidence of a deposition, because the witness was not unavailable. This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Before this court, Johnson argues that the district court erred in forcing him to provide direct evidence of an age-related motivation for the firing, and thus failed to determine whether sexual harassment was the real reason. Johnson also argues that the district court failed to account for unre-futed evidence showing discrimination. Johnson finally argues that the district court erred in not ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">In examining these issues, we must accord substantial deference to the district court\u2019s findings and may set them aside only if clearly erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1318-6\">A finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. * * * In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district court sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues <em>de novo. </em>* * * Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyN\"><em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1511, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (citations omitted). Our review of the record, under this standard, convinces us that the district court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, nor do we discern any errors of law. Nor do we find that the court abused its discretion in denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court pursuant to 8th Cir. R. 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1317-13\">. United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The Honorable Donald J.
