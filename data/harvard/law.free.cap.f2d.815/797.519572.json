We conclude that the FLRA\u2019s order is unenforceable. A detailed discussion of both the factual and legal background is required for a proper understanding of our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-21\">Because the principal statute involved, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Act), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7135 (1982 &amp; Supp. Ill 1985), is one of fairly recent enactment, and up to now, of limited application in this circuit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we commence with a general discussion of this virgin territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-22\">I. <em>Labor-management relations in the federal service</em></p>\n<p id=\"b910-23\">The Act embodies a statutory scheme, originally conceived in a 1962 Executive Order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the establishment of a law of labor-management relations for the federal public service \u201canalogous to that of the National Labor Relations [Act] in the private sector.\u201d <em>Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Firearms v. FLRA, </em>464 U.S. 89, 92-93, 104 S.Ct. 439, 441-42, 78 L.Ed.2d 195 (1983). <em>Cf. </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 <em>et seq. </em>It thus creates an administrative agency, the FLRA, to administer the Act in a manner similar to the National Labor Relations Board. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7104, 7105. As in private industry, the Act expressly protects the rights of federal employees \u201cto form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity,\u201d \u00a7 7102, and provides mechanisms for the resolution of questions concerning representation in collective bargaining units. \u00a7\u00a7 7111, 7112.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Also as in private sector labor-management relations, the Act establishes the representation rights and duties of labor organizations accorded exclusive representation of employees, \u00a7 7114, and causes specified actions by certain Executive agencies, or by labor organizations, to be deemed unfair labor practices, \u00a7 7116,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against which the FLRA may take appropriate administrative, \u00a7 7118, and if necessary, judicial action. \u00a7 7123(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">There are, however, several significant substantive and procedural differences between the Act and the private sector labor-management stratagems which are relevant to the present appeal. In private sector labor-management relations, the establishment of grievance and arbitration procedures, although considered a mandatory subject of bargaining, <em>United Elec., Radio and Mach. Workers of America v. NLRB, </em>409 F.2d 150 (D.C.Cir.1969), is left totally dependent upon the outcome of negotiation by the parties. Thus, such procedures need not ultimately be agreed to or contained in a collective bargaining contract provided this outcome is reached in good faith. Under the present Act, however, perhaps because federal employees are prohibited from engaging in strikes and certain other forms of concerted activities, \u00a7 7116(b)(7), \u00a7 7311, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1918, it is specifically required that \u201cany collective bargaining agreement provide procedures for the settlement of grievances.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(a)(1). With the exception of certain matters not relevant here,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> those \u201cprocedures shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, paragraph (b) of \u00a7 7121 establishes certain minimum substantive and procedural matters that must be contained in \u201c[a]ny negotiated grievance procedure,\u201d and specifically requires that the contract include a provision \u201cthat any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration....\u201d \u00a7 7121(b)(3)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 7122(a) of the Act either party to the arbitration may file exceptions to the award with the FLRA, which may review the same to determine if the award is deficient \u201c(1) because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or (2) on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations.\u201d Under \u00a7 7122(b), if no exception is filed with the FLRA during \u201cthe 30-day period beginning on the date of such award, the award [becomes] final and binding,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and \u201c[the] agency shall take the actions required by [the] arbitrator\u2019s final award.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There is, of course, no equivalent procedure under the Taft-Hartley Act to that previously described, enforcement or challenge to arbitration awards being left to private action in court pursuant to Section 301(a) of that statute. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a); <em>see Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., </em>353 U.S. 448, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">An important feature of the Act, another one not present in private sector legislation, is making the failure to comply with a binding arbitration award an unfair labor practice. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7116(a)(8), <em>ante </em>at footnote 1. Violation of \u00a7 7116(a)(8) is considered \u201cinterference with, restrain[t] and coercpon] [of] employee[s] in the exercise of ... right[s] under [the Act],\u201d and thus is automatically a violation of \u00a7 7116(a)(1) thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">As in the case of the National Labor Relations Board, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160, orders of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the FLRA are not self-enforcing but require the aid of the courts of appeals. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, a party aggrieved by a final order of the FLRA can also seek review of such an order by the courts of appeals, such as has been done in the present case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The scope of review by the courts is relevant to the issues before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">... Review of the [FLRA\u2019s] order shall be on the record in accordance with section 706 of this title. No objection that has not been urged before the [FLRA], or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the [FLRA] with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If any person applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the hearing before the [FLRA], or its designee, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the [FLRA], or its designee, and to be made a part of the record____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-16\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-17\">As we all know, \u00a7 706 referred to above, which is at the heart of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551 <em>et seq., </em>provides in part that agency action shall be set aside only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.].\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-19\">We turn to the issues before us within the framework of this legal structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\">II. <em>The grievance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">The Federal Employees Metal Trades Council (Union) is the bargaining representative of the Shipyard employees. A collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the Union and the Shipyard.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">On October 2, 1981, the Union filed a grievance on behalf of the employees working on the overhaul operations of submarine SSN 674 alleging that the employees were working in a hazardous environment because of exposure to asbestos. The Union claimed this violated Article 29 of the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereafter, on October 13, a general grievance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>was filed relating to all bargaining unit employees who work on the entire overhaul of submarines in the Shipyard. The employees involved in this grievance did not work with asbestos or work in submarines during the removal of asbestos (referred to as \u201ca ripout\u201d). The remedies sought were that the employer replace all asbestos materials on board those submarines under overhaul, and compensate unit employees with environmental pay for asbestos exposure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">III. <em>The arbitration award</em></p>\n<p id=\"AM1\">On November 16, 1981, the grievance was denied. The Union then took the grievance to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">On the first issue before the arbitrator, whether the Shipyard had violated Article 29, Section 1 of the collective bargaining agreement, he ruled against the Shipyard. The arbitrator held that the Shipyard\u2019s reliance on the then prevalent OSHA standard for occupational exposure to airborne asbestos, .1 fibers/cc., was inappropriate. The arbitrator concluded that there was no such thing as a \u201csafe\u201d level of exposure to airborne asbestos fiber. He proceeded to rule that the OSHA standard was inapplicable because it was contrary to prevailing scientific evidence, which the arbitrator accepted in place of the OSHA standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Although asbestos exposure was con-cededly below the OSHA level, the arbitrator ruled that there was \u201croom for corrective action to remove potential sources of airborne asbestos fibers on submarines and make the work place safer.\u201d He then proceeded to give four <em>examples </em>of possible action that could be taken by the Shipyard to improve conditions: (1) the marking of asbestos lagging<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which was not removed, (2) more lagging removal during the ripout stages, (3) providing more durable and effective covering on the unremoved lagging, and (4) the establishment of more frequent surveillance in high risk areas. He also found that the \u201cair monitoring techniques which [were] in general use [left] something to be desired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">From the above, the arbitrator concluded that the Navy had \u201cnot made every reasonable effort to provide and maintain safe working conditions,\u201d and thus had violated Article 29, Section 1 of the collective bargaining contract. <em>See ante </em>at footnote 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-14\">The arbitrator\u2019s decision on the second issue, whether environmental pay was required under Article 20, Section 1 of the contract and Appendix J of the Federal Personnel Manual, <em>see ante </em>at footnote 11, followed suit as a consequence of the first ruling. He held that Category 16 of Appendix J \u201crequirefd] that employees receive environmental pay when \u2018protective devices and safety measures have not practically eliminated the potential for\u2019 illness or injury due to exposure to asbestos fibers,\u201d and that since the Navy had \u201cnot consistently exployed [sic] safety measures which would practically eliminate the potential for illness due to exposure to asbestos fibers,\u201d a valid grievance had been presented. The Navy was \u201cdirected to take corrective action, consistent with [this] decision, with respect to all submarine overhauls which [began] after receipt of this award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-15\">On the question of environmental pay, the arbitrator ruled in favor of a prospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>tive award. The prospective standard \u201cadopted [was] a format which <em>focuses on the efforts made </em>by the [Navy] to eliminate unnecessary exposure, or unnecessary potential exposure, to airborne asbestos, without reference to an arbitrary threshold\u201d (emphasis supplied). The arbitrator retained jurisdiction for 90 days \u201cto resolve any issue which may arise with respect to this award.\u201d The award was dated July 28, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">On September 23, 1983, the Shipyard submitted certain requests for clarifications of the award. The Shipyard asked \u201cwhat airborne asbestos levels and what degree of reduction in the potential for generating airborne asbestos [were] considered to represent a condition that [was] consistent with the outside environment.\u201d The arbitrator answered that \u201c[i]n the Award [he] ... expressly rejected the use of a standard for environmental pay based upon arbitrary exposure levels,\u201d because he found \u201c[i]t is more compatible with the wording of Appendix J to focus on the elimination of unnecessary sources, or unnecessary potential sources of exposure to airborne asbestos.\u201d The arbitrator then referred to the second and third full paragraph at page 24 and the second paragraph on page 25 of the award as the basis for this statement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">In the meantime the Union had on September 14, 1983 requested clarification on three points, two of which are relevant to this appeal: (1) whether \u201call employees assigned to work on boats without respirators [were] entitled to ... [environmental [p]ay, from July 28, 1983 [on],\u201d and (2) whether \u201c[e]nvironmental [p]ay [would] continue to be paid employees assigned to work on the boats without respirators until such time that the hazard no longer exists or a testing method is developed which ... clearly indicated that] the atmosphere in the boats [is] as asbestos fiber free or the [outside] atmosphere____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-9\">On October 26, 1983, the arbitrator ruled on the Union\u2019s clarification requests. He replied in the negative to items (1) and (2). He indicated that \u201c[t]he intent of the Award [was] that environmental pay be paid when circumstances or conditions which increase the <em>potential for exposure </em>to airborne asbestos ... [were] not corrected.\u201d (emphasis supplied). He again made reference to the third full paragraph of the award on page 24 as the basis for this statement. He also stated \u201cthat employees [were entitled to] receive environmental pay if they are exposed to conditions like those described on page 23 of the Award.\u201d Finally the arbitrator concluded that \u201c[t]he minimal increased exposure to airborne asbestos ... which is caused solely by working in submarines which contain asbestos materials does not trigger entitlement to environmental pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">IV. <em>Exceptions to the award filed before the FLRA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">While its requests for clarification were still pending before the arbitrator, the Shipyard on October 21, 1983 filed exceptions with the FLRA, which were renewed on November 9 and 25, 1983 after the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the Shipyard\u2019s clarifications. The Union also filed exceptions to the award on November 23, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-12\">Nothing was heard from the FLRA on these exceptions until June 27, 1984, when it ruled that the exceptions of both parties should be dismissed as untimely filed. <em>See Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, </em>15 F.L.R.A. 181 (1984). The FLRA concluded that the retention of jurisdiction for 90 days by the arbitrator did not extend the 30 day time limit for filing exceptions provided by \u00a7 7122(b) of the Act, <em>see ante </em>799, or Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>tion 2425.1 of the FLRA\u2019s Rules and Regulations. <em>See </em>49 Fed.Reg. 22623 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">The FLRA\u2019s conclusion in this respect was not appealed, and has become the law of the case. In any event, since we are bound to \u201cuphold reasonable and defensible constructions\u201d of the Act by its administering agency, and we cannot in good faith state that the FLRA\u2019s construction in this respect is totally \u201cinconsistent with [the] statutory mandate or that [it] frustrate^] the congressional policy underlying [the] [Act],\u201d such a ruling by the FLRA would likely be binding upon us in any event. <em>See NLRB v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S.Ct. 980, 988, 13 L.Ed.2d 839 (1965); <em>Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA, </em>775 F.2d 727, 732 (6th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">Y. <em>The unfair labor practice proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">While the FLRA was still deciding whether or not to consider the pending exceptions to the arbitrator\u2019s award, the General Counsel of the FLRA issued an unfair labor practice complaint on March 30, 1984 charging the Navy and the Shipyard with continuing violations of Sections 7116(a)(1), (5)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (8) of the Act because of their alleged failure to comply with the arbitration award. A hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ) resulted in a decision on April 29, 1985. The ALJ held that respondents had failed to comply with the award and thus had violated Section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Act. It is this decision that is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">To begin with, the AU ruled against the Shipyard\u2019s contention that it was not required to comply with the award while the exceptions were pending. He found that the award was final and binding upon the parties from the time when the period for filing exceptions to the award under Section 7122(b) expired. He also ruled that the award was not ambiguous, and that in any event, since timely objections were not filed, the respondents were barred from challenging the award in the unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">In concluding that the award had not been complied with the AU found that the award mandated four corrective actions. <em>See ante </em>at page 801. He proceeded to analyze the evidence presented with regard to each of these \u201cproblem\u201d areas as reflected in the various submarines overhauled in the Shipyard after the award became final. To summarize: the AU found that the Shipyard made efforts to correct the \u201cproblems\u201d in all of these four areas, but that the actions of respondents were not sufficiently satisfactory to have fully corrected these defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">As to the payment of the environmental differential, he found that respondents paid this differential only in cases of <em>actual </em>exposure to asbestos by an employee. To receive this pay the employee was required to follow the procedure established in Article 20 of the collective bargaining contract.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The AU found that requiring employees to follow this procedure before receiving environmental pay was a violation of the arbitration award. He also rejected the Navy\u2019s argument to the effect that the award could best be \u201cappropriately interpreted through the negotiated grievance procedure.\u201d Finally, he concluded that since the award states that the existence of \u201cthe circumstances and conditions described in items 1 through 4 on page 23 [of the award] ... necessarily increase[d] the potential for <em>exposure to airborne asbestos, </em>over that which is inherent due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>general presence of asbestos\u201d (emphasis supplied), and since respondents had not corrected these conditions to the satisfaction of the AU, there was a \u201ctriggering\u201d of the circumstances whereby employees working in those submarines were entitled to receive the environmental pay differential. As to the method of payment of this differential, \u201cthe <em>negotiated </em>grievance procedure <em>[i.e., </em>Art. 20, \u00a7 8, was rejected because it] would further complicate rather than expedite the process\u201d (emphasis supplied). The Shipyard\u2019s argument that this procedure was necessary to ensure that each recipient was exposed to the unsafe conditions was also refused because he held that \u201c[s]ince employees are entitled to [this pay] for <em>potential </em>as well as actual <em>exposure,\u201d </em>and \u201c[potential <em>exposure </em>is a continuous state,\u201d \u201c[t]his solution actually creates more problems than it solves.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In conclusion, the AU recommended that the FLRA issue an order that the Navy and the Shipyard cease and desist from failing to comply with the award and produce the records necessary to determine the back pay due to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Exceptions were filed by the Navy and the Shipyard before the FLRA, but the FLRA, with minor exceptions not relevant here, adopted the findings and recommendations of the AU and ordered the Navy and the Shipyard \u201cto fully comply with [the] ... July 28, 1983 arbitration award, including the payment of environmental differential pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">VI. <em>The appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">The Navy and the Shipyard petitioned this Court for review. The FLRA cross-petitioned for enforcement of its order, and the Union moved, and was granted, leave to intervene in the appellate proceedings. Two other labor organizations have also filed briefs as <em>amici.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The Shipyard argues that the FLRA erred in determining that the Navy committed an unfair labor practice by failing to pay the environmental differential for potential as well as actual exposure to asbestos and by dispensing with the contractual procedures for establishing environmental pay. The Shipyard contends that the FLRA has \u201crewritten the arbitrator\u2019s award, abrogated the clear provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, and improperly imposed a major monetary liability on the United States.\u201d The Shipyard submits that enforcement should be denied and that the case should be remanded for resolution through the contractual grievance procedure or to seek clarification of the award from the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The FLRA seeks enforcement of its order claiming that the Navy committed an unfair labor practice by failing to comply with the award in carrying out the corrective measures \u201cto eliminate the potential for illness due to employees\u2019 exposure to airborne asbestos,\u201d and by failing to pay the environmental differential in the absence of such corrective measures. The FLRA argues that the failure to take the corrective actions triggers the pay requirement and that no further application or action need be made by the employee for the pay under Article 20, Section 3 of the contract. The FLRA also claims this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the Shipyard\u2019s 7123(a) petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">VII. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The FLRA argues that the Shipyard\u2019s failure to file timely exceptions to the arbitration award deprives this court of jurisdiction to review the unfair labor practice order. This misstates what we are reviewing. We are reviewing the unfair labor practice order, not the arbitration award. Though the latter is binding because of the failure of the parties to file timely exceptions, the former remains subject to judicial review. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7123(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">Since it is claimed that the Navy and the Shipyard failed to comply with the arbitration award, we start by analyzing the requirements of that decision upon appellants as compared with the findings of the FLRA. Although recognizing that the Navy had \u201cdone much to eliminate exposure to airborne asbestos at the Shipyard\u201d and had complied with the OSHA standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>as required by the 1977 arbitration award, the arbitrator established a new prospective standard \u201cto substantially reduce, but not totally eliminate, [the asbestos] risk.\u201d The arbitrator, in place of a <em>measurable </em>threshold of pollution, <em>i.e., </em>one as to which appellants can be held accountable by objective criteria, \u201cadopted a format which focuses on the <em>efforts made by the [Shipyard] </em>to eliminate unnecessary exposure or unnecessary potential exposure\u201d (emphasis supplied). As previously narrated, the arbitrator gave four <em>examples </em>of corrective action that could be taken to make the work place safer: marking the asbestos lagging, removal of more asbestos during ripouts, use of better covering on unre-moved asbestos, and more frequent surveillance of high risk asbestos areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">Passing on to the decision of the AU, he found that although the Shipyard had taken steps in all the \u201cproblem\u201d areas to correct the defects signaled by the arbitrator, only in the area of increased surveillance had the Shipyard performed to his satisfaction. Thus, he concluded, the Shipyard had violated the award and committed an unfair labor practice. Yet the AU offers no guidance by which we can objectively determine whether appellants\u2019 efforts are sufficient to meet the arbitrator\u2019s award. This is particularly the case when we consider that the four actions indicated by the arbitrator were, in the arbitrator\u2019s own language, \u201cmeasures designed to substantially reduce, but not totally eliminate, [the] risk.\u201d Thus, it was contemplated that some level of asbestos would always be present, yet the Shipyard has no way of knowing what actions taken by the Shipyard will be satisfactory to the AU. In fact, since the four indicated actions are only \u201cexamples\u201d of corrective action to be taken, it could very well be argued that even if those actions were fully complied with to the satisfaction of the AU, the Shipyard would still be bound to take other, unspecified measures. As the administrative judge found, other safety measures were in fact taken by the Shipyard<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but apparently, it was given little or no credit for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">In our view, the exercise of such unbridled authority by the AU is neither contemplated by the law nor justified by the circumstances, and constitutes an abuse of discretion by the FLRA within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). <em>See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 413-16, 91 S.Ct. 814, 822-23, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1970). By transforming examples into rigid requirements, and by failing to consider the totality of the remedial actions taken by the Shipyard in response to the arbitration award, the AU severely distorted the essence of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">There are at least two additional reasons why this Court should exercise jurisdiction and decline enforcement of the FLRA\u2019s order. First, the FLRA fatally misconstrues the arbitrator\u2019s ruling and nullifies specific provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. As previously indicated, the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cclarification\u201d of the union\u2019s request was to the effect that not all employees assigned to work on boats without respirators were entitled to the environmental pay differential. <em>Ante </em>at 802. The arbitrator contemplated that asbestos could not be totally eliminated from the atmosphere, but could only be lowered to levels which would reduce or eliminate asbestos <em>illness. Id. </em>Yet the AU found that employees were entitled to environmental pay for <em>potential </em>as well as actual <em>exposure </em>to asbestos. This conclusion clearly misinterprets the award and Appendix J, which requires environmental pay for \u201cexpos[ure] of employees to <em>potential illness\u201d </em>(emphasis added), not potential <em>expo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>sure </em>of employees. Consistent with Appendix J, the arbitrator did <em>not </em>require environmental pay for mere potential exposure of employees to asbestos, but only for exposure to <em>potential illness. </em>The FLRA is thus abusing its discretion in seeking enforcement of a decision by an AU which misconstrues both the arbitrator\u2019s award and the contract. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Second, the AU has rewritten the collective bargaining agreement in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) in ruling that employees can ignore the provisions of Article 20, Section 3 of the agreement establishing the procedure for the claiming and payment of environmental pay. The AU concluded that following this procedure \u201cwould further complicate rather than expedite the process.\u201d That may be, but that procedure is what the parties bargained for. Certainly, the binding arbitration award to which the unfair labor practice charge was addressed neither required nor suggested any such shortcut. Environmental pay is a contractual creation, and an ALT can no more overlook what the parties contracted as the method of enforcing the payment of environmental pay than he can ignore the existence of the other contract provisions upon which the payment of environmental pay is based. Ail parts of the contract must be applied as contemplated by the parties to the agreement, not as envisioned by a non-contractual third party. Such action by the AU is nothing short of legislation, and is contrary to established labor relations law. <em>United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enterprise W. &amp; C. Corp., </em>363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960) (\u201cAn arbitrator ... does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">In sum, the FLRA seeks to enforce a decision by the AU which allows the AU unbridled discretion in the interpretation of the arbitration award, misinterprets and misconstrues the award and the collective bargaining contract upon which it is based, and attempts to ignore specific provisions of that agreement. Having jurisdiction under \u00a7 7123(a), we find such actions constitute an abuse of discretion by the FLRA within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The request for enforcement of the order of the FLRA is <em>denied.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">We turn next to the Shipyard\u2019s petition for review. The Shipyard concedes on appeal the clarity of the award insofar as it rejects the OSHA standard and establishes a new format for corrective action. It is thus unquestionable that the Shipyard must take the actions required by the award. \u00a7 7122(b). As to any ambiguity in the implementation of the award, the parties should resort to the negotiated grievance procedure, <em>see </em>Article 20, \u00a7 3, to determine compliance with its terms, and the method for the distribution of EDP to those employees affected. <em>Cf.

New England, Etc., </em>628 F.2d 644, 649 (1st Cir.1980) (case remanded to the original arbitration board to determine the remedy for a wrongful termination of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\"><em>The petition for review is granted.
