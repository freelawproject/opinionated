In <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, 102 S.Ct. 2858, 73 L.Ed.2d 598 (1982), the Supreme Court held that federal bankruptcy judges lacked the constitutional power to adjudicate this controversy because they \u201cdo not enjoy the protections constitutionally afforded to Art. Ill judges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 102 S.Ct. at 2866. This appeal raises a related question under Article III. It asks whether a federal bankruptcy court that is statutorily authorized to hear and determine \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceedings, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b) (1982 ed., Supp. Ill), may adjudicate a state law claim arising from a contract that 1) was made <em>after </em>B went bankrupt and 2) was made as part of B\u2019s efforts to liquidate estate assets. In our view, the matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>timing and the relation to judicial administration of the bankrupt\u2019s estate make a critical constitutional difference between <em>Marathon </em>and the present case. <em>Marathon </em>notwithstanding, the bankrupt company\u2019s legal action to collect a \u201cpost-petition\u201d debt, brought as part of efforts to liquidate the estate, is a \u201ccore\u201d proceeding that the bankruptcy court has the constitutional power to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><em>Marathon. </em>To understand the legal issue in this case, one must begin with <em>Marathon, </em>the case in which the Supreme Court held unconstitutional 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1471 (1976 ed., Supp. IV), a key jurisdictional provision of the Bankruptcy Act of 1978. The specific issue in that case was whether the bankruptcy court possessed the constitutional power to adjudicate a bankrupt\u2019s state law contract claim \u2014 a claim that arose before the filing of the bankruptcy petition. A plurality of four justices reasoned that bankruptcy courts are not Article III courts because their judges do not have life tenure or protection against salary diminution. It then reviewed the three \u201cexception[s] from the general prescription of Art. Ill\u201d \u2014 exceptions that, historically speaking, have been limited to congressional creation of \u201cterritorial courts,\u201d \u201ccourts-martial,\u201d and \u201clegislative courts and administrative agencies\u201d that \u201cadjudicate cases involving \u2018public rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marathon, </em>458 U.S. at 64-67, 102 S.Ct. at 2867-69. \u201cPublic rights\u201d were characterized as those that \u201carise \u2018between the government and others,\u2019 \u201d as contrasted with private rights, which involve \u201c \u2018the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69-70, 102 S.Ct. at 2870-71 (quoting <em>Ex parte Bakelite Corp., </em>279 U.S. 438, 451, 49 S.Ct. 411, 413, 73 L.Ed. 789 (1929) and <em>Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. 22, 51, 52 S.Ct. 285, 292, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932)). The plurality conceded that Congress might grant to non-Article III courts the power to find facts in cases involving <em>certain </em>private rights, namely congressionally created private rights. <em>See id. </em>at 80,102 S.Ct. at 2876 (\u201c[Wjhen Congress creates a substantive federal right, it possesses substantial discretion to prescribe the manner in which that right may be adjudicated \u2014 including the assignment to an adjunct of some functions historically performed by judges.\u201d). But, the plurality said, the right contested in <em>Marathon </em>was neither a \u201cpublic right\u201d nor a \u201ccongressionally created right,\u201d so Congress could not delegate the power to adjudicate that right to a bankruptcy court that lacked the attributes prescribed in Article III. Two justices agreed with the plurality\u2019s result, but on the narrower ground that the issues in the lawsuit arose \u201centirely under state law,\u201d and that no case had \u201cgone so far\u201d as to permit a non-Article III court to adjudicate a claim like Northern\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 102 S.Ct. at 2881-82, (Rehnquist, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The Supreme Court has since adopted a view of <em>Marathon </em>that resembles that of the concurring justices. In <em>Thomas v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co., </em>473 U.S. 568, 105 S.Ct. 3325, 3334, 87 L.Ed.2d 409 (1985), the Court characterized <em>Marathon </em>as a case in which it \u201cwas unable to agree on the precise scope and nature of Article Ill\u2019s limitations.\u201d It added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">The court\u2019s holding in <em>\\Marathon </em>] establishes only that Congress may not vest in a non-Article III court the power to adjudicate, render final judgment, and issue binding orders in a traditional contract action arising under state law, without consent of the litigants, and subject only to ordinary appellate review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\"><em>Id. </em>105 S.Ct. at 3334-35. This narrow view of the decision was reaffirmed last year. <em>See Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 3251, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\"><em>The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. </em>After the <em>Marathon </em>decision, Congress amended the Bankruptcy Act of 1978 in an effort to cure the constitutional defect in its jurisdictional provision. The new jurisdictional provisions distinguish between \u201ccore\u201d bankruptcy proceedings and those that are merely \u201crelated to\u201d title 11 cases. <em>See </em>Appendix. Upon referral from the district court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>bankruptcy judge has full statutory authority to \u201chear and determine ... all core proceedings____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(1). Representative Kastenmeier, one of the new law\u2019s co-sponsors, explained that core proceedings are \u201cintegral to the core bankruptcy function of restructuring debtor-creditor rights,\u201d 130 Cong. Rec. El 109 (daily ed. March 20, 1984), and that they include \u201call necessary aspects of a bankruptcy case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at E1108. The new law sets forth a nonexhaustive list of \u201ccore proceedings,\u201d including such obvious matters as \u201callowance[s] or disallowance[s] of claims,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(B), as well as matters more relevant to this case, namely: \u201cmatters concerning the administration of the estate\u201d and \u201cother proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A), (0).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Non-core proceedings, those that the statute calls \u201crelated to\u201d bankruptcy cases, concern aspects of the bankruptcy case that <em>Marathon </em>barred non-Article III judges from determining on their own. The sponsors of the 1984 Amendments that later became \u00a7 157 referred to this category of proceedings as \u201cMarathon-type suits,\u201d by which they meant claims \u201cconcerned only with State law issues that did not arise in the core bankruptcy function of adjusting debtor-creditor rights.\u201d 130 Cong.Rec. H1848 (daily ed. March 21,1984) (statement of Representative Kindness). In non-core proceedings, unless the parties consent to the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction, the bankruptcy judge has the power only to \u201csubmit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court,\u201d and the parties are entitled to de novo review of any matter to which they \u201ctimely and specifically\u201d object. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(c)(1). Moreover, the bankruptcy court may (and sometimes must) abstain from hearing non-core matters, leaving the parties to sue in state court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c) (1982 ed., Supp. III).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">In the view of \u00a7 157\u2019s sponsors, the distinction between core and non-core proceedings cured the constitutional defect in \u00a7 1471. Bankruptcy judges would \u201cdecide all core bankruptcy proceedings, subject only to traditional appellate review,\u201d 130 Cong.Rec. E1108 (daily ed. March 20, 1984) (prepared statement of Representative Kastenmeier), as <em>Marathon </em>permitted. <em>See Marathon, </em>458 U.S. at 71, 102 S.Ct. at 2871. Article III courts would retain ultimate control over \u201cMarathon-type suits.\u201d The new structure would make it possible to the extent constitutionally permissible to hear matters relating to a single bankruptcy in a single forum. <em>See </em>130 Cong.Rec. E1108 (daily ed. March 20, 1984) (prepared statement of Representative Kastenmeier).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\"><em>The Present Litigation. </em>The appellant in this case, Arnold Print Works, Inc. (Arnold), filed a petition in bankruptcy in 1981. It continued to manage its property under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act as a \u201cdebtor-in-possession.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 (1982). As part of an effort to liquidate its assets, it sold printing rollers to George Apkin and Sons (Apkin), the appellee. Apkin, believing that Arnold had misrepresented the quality of the rollers, refused to pay about $9000 of the $20,000 purchase price. In April 1985, Arnold sued Apkin in the federal bankruptcy court for the $9000. Apkin told the court that Arnold was in the wrong forum because Arnold\u2019s claim was basically a state law contract claim, which made the proceeding non-core. Apkin also pointed to the new Act\u2019s abstention provisions, asking the court to abstain pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1), and thereby to force Arnold, to sue in state court, where Apkin could insist on a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The bankruptcy court discussed legal reasons for considering the proceeding to be core, but held that district court precedent required that it find the proceeding non-core. <em>See In re Arnold Print Works, Inc., </em>54 B.R. 562, 569 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (citing <em>Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Robinson Industries, Inc., </em>46 B.R. 464, 466 (D.Mass.1985)). It chose not to abstain. It decided instead to hold a bench trial and to submit proposed findings to the district court. Apkin appealed the jurisdictional decision to the district court. The district court agreed that the proceeding to resolve Arnold\u2019s claim was non-core, but it also held that the bankruptcy court should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>abstained and required Arnold to sue in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Arnold now appeals this district court decision to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Arnold asks us to determine whether the bankruptcy proceeding to consider its claim for payment of a post-petition debt is a core proceeding that the Constitution permits the bankruptcy court to adjudicate. We conclude that it is, and that neither justice nor comity with State courts requires that the bankruptcy court abstain from hearing the case. The bankruptcy court may therefore hear and decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>Core Proceedings. </em>Assuming for the moment that the Constitution permits the bankruptcy court to adjudicate the claim, we believe that the statute\u2019s term \u201ccore\u201d covers this proceeding. The action of a debtor-in-possession to collect a post-petition debt arising from the sale of the estate\u2019s assets, unlike a suit to recover a pre-petition debt, falls within the literal wording of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(A), \u201cmatters concerning the administration of the estate,\u201d because it involves a claim that arose out of the administrative activities of a debtor-in-possession. <em>See In re L.A. Clarke &amp; Son, Inc., </em>51 B.R. 31, 33 (Bankr. D.D.C.1985). It falls within the literal wording of 28 U.S.C. 157(b)(2)(0), \u201cother proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate,\u201d because the claim arose out of the debtor\u2019s efforts to liquidate estate assets. <em>Cf. In re Franklin Computer Corp., </em>50 B.R. 620, 625-26 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1985) (noting that \u00a7 157(b)(2)(0) \u201csupports a finding that an action on an account receivable is a core proceeding\u201d). One can imagine arguments suggesting that it falls within other provisions as well. <em>See, e.g., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(E) (\u201corders to turn over property of the estate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Moreover, the vast majority of courts that have considered the status of similar post-petition claims have held that they were core proceedings. <em>See, e.g., In re Mansker, </em>60 B.R. 803 (Bankr.D.Mass.1986) (holding an action for post-petition breach of an agreement to purchase property to be a core proceeding); <em>In re L.A. Clarke, supra </em>(holding an action to recover a post-petition account receivable to be core); <em>In re Franklin Computer, supra </em>(same); <em>In re All American of Ashburn, Inc., </em>49 B.R. 926 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1985) (same). <em>But see In re Schear &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>47 B.R. 544 (Bankr.S.D.Fla.1985). The leading treatise on bankruptcy law agrees that in these post-petition cases, the \u201cbetter result is that the proceeding is core.\u201d 1 King, Collier on Bankruptcy 113.01, at 3-41 (15th ed. 1986). The precedent in this circuit upon which the district court and bankruptcy court relied, <em>Mohawk Industries, </em>does not in fact present a direct holding to the contrary, for it involved a pre-petition, not a postpetition debt; thus the <em>Mohawk Industries </em>claim did not arise out of the \u201cadministration of the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Further, the legislative history of the new statute indicates that Congress intended that \u201ccore proceedings\u201d would be interpreted broadly, close to or congruent with constitutional limits. The sponsors repeatedly said that 95 percent of the proceedings brought before bankruptcy judges would be core proceedings. <em>See </em>130 Cong. Rec. E1108-E1110 (daily ed. March 20, 1984) (statement of Representative Kasten-meier); <em>id. </em>at H1848, H1850 (daily ed. March 21, 1984) (statement of Representative Kindness). They used arguments strongly suggesting that they were pressing the notion to its constitutional bounds. They referred to the suits in the non-core category as \u201cMarathon-type\u201d cases, <em>see, e.g., id. </em>at E1108, E1109 (daily ed. March 20,1984) (prepared statement of Representative Kastenmeier); <em>id. </em>at H1848 (daily ed. March 21, 1984) (statement of Representative Kindness), which they understood to be proceedings of \u201ca very limited kind,\u201d <em>id. </em>at H1848 (daily ed. March 21,1984) (statement of Representative Kindness). Representative Kastenmeier said that \u201cjurisdiction in core bankruptcy proceedings is broader than the summary jurisdiction under pre-1978 law,\u201d 130 Cong.Rec. E1108 (daily ed. March 20, 1984), and summary jurisdiction covered post-petition claims. <em>See infra </em>pp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>169-70. We recognize that the authors of the section also spoke of \u201ccore\u201d proceedings as those \u201cintegral to the core bankruptcy function of <em>restructuring debtor-creditor rights,\u201d </em>130 Cong.Rec. E1109, but the statutory list of core proceedings, and the discussion on the floor of Congress, make clear that this last italicized phrase was not meant to restrict core proceedings to competing claims directly against the estate. Rather, it referred generally to all proceedings that are <em>\u201cnon-Marathon </em>\u201d bankruptcy matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Finally, the fact that a claim in a bankruptcy matter raises issues of state, rather than federal, law does not by itself determine that it is non-core, rather than core. A claim by a creditor for money owed by the debtor, a trustee\u2019s effort to set aside a preference, or a trustee\u2019s decision as to who has a better claim might depend entirely upon such matters of state law as the validity of a lien or an interpretation of a state recording statute. For this reason, Congress specifically provided that the \u201cdetermination that a proceeding is not a core proceeding shall not be made solely on the basis that its resolution may be affected by State law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(3). It is the nature of the proceeding \u2014 its relation to the basic function of the bankruptcy court \u2014 not the state or federal basis for the claim, that makes the difference here.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Article III. </em>We now consider whether the determination that Arnold\u2019s action is a core proceeding creates an unconstitutional interpretation of \u00a7 157(b). We believe that it does not. The Constitution permits a non-Article III bankruptcy court to adjudicate post-petition claims related to administration or liquidation of a debtor\u2019s estate because the claims are both historically and functionally distinguishable from those at issue in <em>Marathon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly turned to history and tradition to help define the type of adjudicatory proceeding that the Constitution reserves exclusively for Article III courts. In <em>Thomas, </em>for example, the majority explicitly stated that Marathon\u2019s holding applied to \u201ca <em>traditional </em>contract action arising under the state law.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>105 S.Ct. at 3335 (emphasis added); <em>see also Marathon, </em>458 U.S. at 64, 102 S.Ct. at 2867-68 (describing the history of the Article III exception for territorial courts). The Court has indicated that it will examine closely congressional attempts to control the adjudication of \u201crights [that] were <em>historically ... </em>subject to resolution by Article III courts.\u201d <em>See Schor, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3259 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">If one examines the jurisdictional history of post-petition claims of the sort in issue here, one finds that they are not \u201ctraditional contract actions\u201d; nor are they matters that \u201chistorically\u201d have been decided only in the equivalent of Article III courts. To the contrary, bankruptcy courts have adjudicated claims like this one at least since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. Indeed, they have done so in exercise of \u201csummary jurisdiction\u201d \u2014 a jurisdiction permitting the bankruptcy court to sit as a court in equity, deciding without a jury matters that a jury might have decided had a party pressed the same claim in a state court. <em>See Katchen v. Landy, </em>382 U.S. 323, 337, 86 S.Ct. 467, 477, 15 L.Ed.2d 391 (1966). Thus, <em>Collier </em>noted that under the 1898 Act, a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">court of bankruptcy has summary power over a delinquent purchaser at a sale in the bankruptcy proceedings. He may be ordered to pay the stipulated price or to pay the deficiency resulting from a resale. The jurisdiction of the court to act summarily in such a matter is the same as that of a court of equity in any judicial sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">4B King, Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 70.98, at 1202-03 (14th ed. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Similarly, in <em>In re Alan Wood Steel Co., </em>1 B.R. 167, 169 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1979), a bankruptcy case that thoroughly explains the treatment of this jurisdictional issue under the 1898 Act, the court commented that its power to hear and adjudicate summarily a receiver\u2019s action to collect a post-petition account receivable was \u201ccrystal clear.\u201d The court characterized the action as one arising out of a contract \u201cwith officers of [the] court and as such the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>tracts [were] treated as contracts with the court itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168. The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agt\">With respect to contracts made by trustees, debtors in possession and other officers of the bankruptcy court, the necessity of the court retaining exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising out of such contracts is even more pronounced than in the case of other matters arising during the administration of a bankrupt estate. The courts have therefore adopted an extreme position with respect to this and have ruled that a party contracting with an officer of the court in fact contracts with the court itself, and by such act <em>subjects himself for the purposes of the contract to the summary jurisdiction of the </em>court____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re California Eastern Airways, </em>95 F.Supp. 348, 351 (D.Del.1951)). Given potential court supervision of estate administration, the legal fiction that the debtor-in-possession is a court official and that the contract is with the court itself is a fiction that borders on the truth. It helps to distinguish the claim at issue here even on the view of Marathon\u2019s plurality: Arnold makes the kind of claim that, historically speaking, might be characterized as raising matters of \u201cpublic rights,\u201d defined as those arising between the government and others. <em>See Marathon, </em>458 U.S. at 67, 102 S.Ct. at 2869. <em>Marathon </em>found no constitutional objection to a bankruptcy court deciding this sort of claim. Quite apart from the force of the fiction, the history of bankruptcy court jurisdiction means that a post-petition contract made with a debtor-in-possession cannot be called a \u201ctraditional\u201d state contract action.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">To the extent that Article III reflects a concern for procedural fairness, <em>see Crowell v. Benson, </em>285 U.S. at 87, 52 S.Ct. at 306 (Brandeis, J., dissenting), this case again differs from <em>Marathon. </em>A party who contracts with an apparently healthy company \u2014 a company that has not filed a petition in bankruptcy \u2014 may find it unpleasantly surprising to have to defend its pre-petition contract in a bankruptcy court, without a jury or Article III protections. But it is difficult to see any unfair surprise in bringing a post-petition contract action before a bankruptcy court. Parties who contract with a bankrupt company\u2019s trustee or with a debtor-in-possession know that they are dealing with an agent responsible to a bankruptcy court; that the bankruptcy court would resolve subsequent disputes should therefore come as no surprise. <em>Cf. </em>41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601 et. seq. (1982) (establishing that parties who enter into contracts with the government subject themselves to a set of administrative procedures for resolving disputes growing out of those contracts). The risk of unfairness is therefore smaller here than in <em>Marathon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The resolution of separation of powers questions may also prove sensitive to practical considerations, such as the need to place in a single set of hands the various functions that Articles I, II, and III would otherwise keep separate. <em>See Chadha v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>634 F.2d 408, 425 (9th Cir.1980) (\u201c[C]ourts interpret separation of powers questions pragmatically, in order to preserve the essential design of the Constitution without imposing unworkable limitations.\u201d), <em>affd, </em>462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983); <em>cf. Schor, </em>106 S.Ct. at 3258 (considering whether there were practical reasons to find the CEA defective under Article III). If so, one might distinguish between a trustee in bankruptcy who <em>marshals </em>assets, as in <em>Marathon, </em>and a trustee in bankruptcy who <em>manages </em>and <em>disposes of </em>assets under bankruptcy court supervision, as in this case. One might reasonably believe that the risk of litigation in multiple forums would prove more disruptive in the latter instances than in the former. And to that extent, the need for orderly estate management, administration, and distribution would argue more strongly here than in <em>Marathon </em>for allowing adjudication by the bankruptcy court, despite its non-Article III characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The narrow interpretation that the Supreme Court has given to <em>Marathon, </em>the history of bankruptcy court jurisdiction over actions like these, and the differences between this case and <em>Marathon </em>with respect to fairness and practicality, together convince us that Arnold\u2019s claim may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>heard by a non-Article III court. For the reasons we reviewed earlier, this case falls within the statutory category of core proceedings, so the case may be decided by a bankruptcy judge. We recognize that the bankruptcy court retains the power to abstain from deciding a case for reasons of justice, comity with State courts, or respect for State law, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(c)(1), but no such reason applies here. <em>Cf. In re Franklin, </em>50 B.R. at 626 n. 8 (noting that \u201ca finding that a matter is a core proceeding weighs heavily in favor of a denial of abstention\u201d); <em>In re Pioneer Development Corp., </em>47 B.R. 624, 628 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1985) (commenting that \u201cabstention would be totally unwarranted\u201d when there has been a determination that a proceeding is core).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\n<em>The judgment of dismissal is vacated and the case is remanded to the bankruptcy court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"ASi\">TITLE 28</p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">\u00a7 157.

A determination that a proceeding is not a core proceeding shall not be made solely on the basis that its resolution may be affected by State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-26\">(4) Non-core proceedings under section 157(b)(2)(B) of title 28, United States Code, shall not be subject to the mandatory abstention provisions of section 1334(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>APPENDIX \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">(5) The district court shall order that personal injury tort and wrongful death claims shall be tried in the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending, or in the district court in the district in which the claim arose, as determined by the district court in which the bankruptcy case is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(c) (1) A bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title 11. In such proceeding, the bankruptcy judge shall submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, and any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district judge after considering the bankruptcy judge\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions and after reviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the district court, with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding, may refer a proceeding related to a case under title 11 to a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to review under section 158 of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">(d) The district court may withdraw, in whole or in part, any case or proceeding referred under this section, on its own motion or on timely motion of any party, for cause shown. The district court shall, on timely motion of a party, so withdraw a proceeding if the court determines that resolution of the proceeding requires consideration of both title 11 and other laws of the United States regulating organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce.

Any decision to abstain made under this subsection is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise. This subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay provided for by section 362 of title 11, United States Code, as such section applies to an action affecting the property of the estate in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">(d) The district court in which a case under title 11 is commenced or is pending shall have exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever located, of the debt- or as of the commencement of such case, and of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">(June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931; Nov. 6, 1978, Pub.L. 95-598, title II, \u00a7 238(a), 92 Stat. 2667; July 10, 1984, Pub.L. 98-353, title I, \u00a7 101(a), 98 Stat. 333.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
