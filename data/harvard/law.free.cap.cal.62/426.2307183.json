D. 1878, he was and still is the owner of, and he then was and still is entitled to the possession of, the following-described articles of personal property, to wit: One hundred shares of the capital stock of the Sierra Nevada Silver Mining Company; one hundred shares of the capital stock of the Caledonia Silver Mining Company; fifty shares of the capital stock of the Yellow Jacket Silver Mining Company; fifty shares of the capital stock of the Best and Belcher Mining Company; fifty shares of the capital stock of the Hale and Norcross Silver Mining Company; twenty-five shares of the capital stock of the Ken-tuck Mining Company; two hundred shares of the capital stock of the Consolidated Imperial Mining Company; one hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the Golden Chariot Mining Company; one gold pin, or brooch, set with sixteen diamonds; one pair gold earrings, set with seven diamonds each; one gold finger-ring set with nine diamonds; one gold cross set with twenty-six diamonds; one gold cross set with a single diamond; that the defendant on the said seventh day of August, 1878, was in the possession of said property; that on the same day the plaintiff demanded of the defendant the possession of the said property, and the restoration of the same to him, but the defendant wrongfully and unlawfully refused, and still does wrongfully and unlawfully refuse, to deliver or restore the same, or any part thereof, to the plaintiff, and has converted the same to his own use, and still wrongfully and unlawfully withholds and detains the same from the plaintiff; that said property was on said seventh day of August, 1878, of the value of $6,921.25 in gold coin. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant for the sum of $6,921.25 in gold coin, with legal interest thereon from the seventh day of August, 1878, or in case the said property should hereafter increase in value, then the highest market value of said property at any time between the said seventh day of August, 1878, and the verdict in this action without interest, besides his costs of suit, and for such further judgment as to this Court may seem meet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">The defendant, after denying that the plaintiff since the thirteenth day of June, A.

D. 1878, ever was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>titled to the possession, of any part of the property described in the complaint, and that the defendant had converted the property alleged. That heretofore, and on the fifteenth day of February, 1878, at said City and County of San Francisco, said defendant, at the special instance and request of plaintiff, loaned and advanced unto said plaintiff the full sum of $3,G28.50, in gold coin of the United States, and which sum plaintiff then and there undertook and promised to repay unto defendant whenever requested so to do, with interest thereon, in gold coin of the United States; and thereupon, and on said fifteenth day of February, 1878, at said city and county, plaintiff delivered to and deposited with defendant, by way of security for the payment of said sum of money so loaned unto him by defendant, all and singular the articles of personal property mentioned and described in the complaint.

That during the time said plaintiff held said articles of personal property prior to the sale thereof hereinafter mentioned, it became and was necessary for the protection of such security to advance and pay various sums of money, as and for assessments levied and assessed upon the shares of mining stock mentioned in complaint and pledged unto him, and said defendant did advance and pay such assessments, amounting to the sum of $300.50, in said gold coin. That thereafter, and on or about the sixth day of June, 1878, the defendant duly demanded of plaintiff the payment to him of said sum of money so loaned and advanced, and the sums of money as aforesaid paid, laid out, and expended by defendant for assessments upon said shares of mining stocks, and interest upon said sums. And plaintiff neglected and refused to pay said sums, or any part thereof, and thereupon, and on or about said sixth day of June, 1878, the defendant gave to plaintiff actual notice that thereafter and on the thirteenth day of June, 1878, at the hour of ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon of that day, at the auction-house of Maurice Dore &amp; Co., at No. 410 Pine street, between Montgomery and Kearny streets, in said City and County of San Francisco, he would, through H.

That such notice of the time and place at which the property pledged would be sold was actually given to and received by plaintiff, at said city and county, at such reasonable time before the sale as would enable said pledgor, to wit, said plaintiff, to attend thereat. That thereafter and on said thirteenth day of June, 1878, the plaintiff having failed and neglected to pay said indebtedness, or any part thereof, and the same being wholly due and unpaid, and amounting on said day to the sum of $4,077.50, in gold coin of the United States, at said hour of ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon of said day, at said auction-house of Maurice Dore &amp; Co., said defendant, by and through said H.

(\u00a7 3010, Civ. Code; 41 Cal. 519.) The Court erred in charging the jury that the pledgor of pledged property could not, before a sale, empower the pledgee to buy. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3010, 3513.) The Court erred in charging the jury that a consid- \u2022 eration was necessary to confirm a sale, or empower a pledgee to buy, or to waive any provision of the Code concerning the sale of pledge. The Court charged the jury in these words: \u201c I have already held, though I think the jury were absent at the time, that the pledgee can not purchase the thing pledged except by direct dealing with the pledgor. That means by something subsequent to the sale, not sub\u2014not subsequent to the sale\u2014hut it. must be something that changes the form of the original contract, and that it must be for a consideration.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2307, 2308, 3515, 3516.) The Court erred in charging the jury that a sale of pledged property, made without an observance of the provisions of the Code, is void. The Court erred in charging the jury that a waiver of any of the \u25a0requirements of the Code concerning the sale of pledged prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>erty by the pledgor is unlawful. (Sedgwick on Statutory and Const. Law, 109; 10 N. Y. 446; 3 id. 197, 511.) The Court erred in charging the jury: \u201cThe object of the law is for the purpose of guarding against the greed and rapacity of money-loaners and those who deal in securities of this character.\u201d \u201c There are very many reasons why this law is a wholesome one, independent of the rapacity and greed of creditors.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Sternly, Stoney &amp; Hayes, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">The familiar doctrine that persons holding fiduciary relations are incompetent to purchase the property held by them in trust, is a rule of universal application to all persons coming within the principle that no party can be permitted to purchase an interest where he has a duty to perform, inconsistent with the character of a purchaser. The rule rests upon grounds of public policy, is to be found alike in the Roman and common law, and is enforced without regard to the question of <em>bona fides </em>in the particular case. The case of pledgor and pledgee comes within the rule. The sale of the pledged property by Finigan to himself was contrary to the faith of the bailment, forbidden alike by the common law and the Civil Code of this State, and was, in the absence of an express, deliberate, clear, and intentional ratification by Bill, so null and void that it did not even amount to a conversion, except at the election of Hill, the pledgor. Failing such election (and none such was made), the pdssession of the stock and jewelry remaining unchanged, the bailment continued thereafter as before, until the tender on August 7th of the amount of the debt, and the demand and refusal of the return of the property pledged, which constituted the conversion on which this action is based.

They are principally cases where an agent, purporting to act with a third party on behalf of his principal, does an act beyond the scope of his authority, or without authority. In such cases, when the matter is brought to the knowledge of the principal, he owes to the third party the duty of promptly repudiating the transaction. Failing to do so, he is said to have ratified the act of his agent. But it may be questioned whether this is the proper expression to use. It would seem to be more correct to say, that by his silence, when for the protection of the third party he should have spoken, he is estopped to deny the authority of the agent. Even in cases of agency, however, this rule does not obtain between the principal and his agent, as between them mere acquiescence in order to work a ratification must have continued an unreasonable length of time. <em>(Clarke </em>v. <em>Meigs, </em>10 Bosw. 349; <em>Brass </em>v. <em>Worth, </em>40 Barb. 654.) In the two cases in the 25th Maryland and that in 4 Metcalf, cited under our first point, nearly two years elapsed' before dissent from the sale was expressed. Tested- by the above rules, it will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>found that the rulings of the Court below were erroneous only in being too favorable to appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b459-5\">Boss, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">There was some testimony tending to show that the plaintiff not only consented that the defendant might purchase the property at the sale, but requested him to do so, and some testimony tending to show a ratification of the sale by the defendant, if it admitted of ratification. Sections 3001 <em>et seq. </em>of the Civil Code provide for the sale of pledged property at public auction, and by Section 3010 it is declared: <em>\u201cA </em>pledgee or pledge-holder can not purchase the property pledged, except by direct dealing with the pledgor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The Court below instructed the jury: \u201c That means by something subsequent to the sale, not sub\u2014not subsequent to the sale, but it must be something that changes the form of the original contract, and it must be for a consideration.\u201d In effect, the Court told the jury that the \u201c direct dealing\u201d mentioned in the statute must precede the sale, must be something that changes the form of the original contract, and must have a consideration to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">In each particular the instruction is erroneous. In the first place it entirely excludes the question of ratification. There can be no doubt that a sale made by a pledgee in contravention of the provisions of the statute may be ratified by the pledgor; and it has been expressly so decided by this Court, in the case of <em>Child </em>v. <em>Hugg, </em>41 Cal. 519. In the second place the instruction exacts proof of the elements necessary to make a new contract. Obviously, such is not the meaning of the statute. The section was undoubtedly enacted for the protection of the pledgor, to the end that no unfair advantage be taken of him. It prohibits a pledgee or pledge-holder from purchasing the property pledged, \u201cexcept by direct dealing with the pledgor.\u201d By such dealing with the pledgor, the pledgee <em>may </em>purchase it. Why should it be held that by this is meant that the pledgee or pledge-holder can only purchase by taking a direct transfer from the pledgor ? The statute docs not say so, and the reason of the prohibition suggests the contrary. If the pledgor chooses to do so, we see no reason why he may not consent that the pledgee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>may buy at the public sale. In some cases it may be to his interest that this be done. Such consent may be given either at the time of making the pledge, or at any subsequent time, without changing \u201cthe form of the original contract,\u201d and without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Court below also erred\u2014particularly in view of the circumstances appearing in this case\u2014in instructing the jury as follows: \u201cThe object of the law is for the purpose of guarding against the greed and rapacity of money-lenders and those who deal in securities of this character.\u201d And again: \u201cThere are many reasons why this law is a wholesome one, independent of the rapacity and greed of creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">This was manifestly improper. No one can measure the extent of the influence upon the jury of such instructions coming from the Court. The defendant was entitled to a fair trial. He did not have it in the Court below, and we can not permit the judgment to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Morrison, C.- J., and Myrick, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b460-9\">Sharpstein, J., concurring specially:</author>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">I concur. The instruction first referred to in the opinion of Mr. Justice Boss is, in my opinion, clearly erroneous. Upon the other questions discussed in the leading opinion, I express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Thornton and McKinstry, JJ., concurred in the judgment on the first point discussed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Boss.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">McKee, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
