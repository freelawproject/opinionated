The complaint alleged that the plaintiff being about to commence separate suits against R. (defendant\u2019s testator), B., and H., for the enforcement of certain assessment liens against each of their several lots of land owned by them respectively, R. verbally promised plaintiff that in consideration that the plaintiff would not bring the suit to enforce the lien against the lot owned by him, but would \u201caltogether forbear\u201d to bring such suit, and would commence and prosecute suits against B. and H. for the enforcement of the assessments against their lots respectively, and succeed in recovering final judgments in such suits against B. and H., he, the said R., would, upon such final recovery, pay to the plaintiff the amount of the assessment against the lot owned by him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-10\"><em>Held: </em>Such agreement is not void under the provision of the Statute of Frauds requiring a writing for agreements that by their terms are not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-11\">Id.\u2014Construction of Agreement.\u2014The agreement of the plaintiff was \u201c altogether,\u201d not \u201c always,\u201d to forbear, and an agreement to refrain altogether for an indefinite time is not within the operation of the statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-12\">Id.\u2014The promise of the plaintiff was \u201caltogether\u201d to forbear to bring suit to foreclose the lien against the lot of R. until he should recover final judgments against B. and H., events which might occur within the year.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b52-13\">Id.\u2014The statute does not declare void a contract which may not be performed within a year, or which is not likely to be performed within that period.

Section 8156, Subdivision 1, Hittell\u2019s Digest, is substantially the same as Section 1624, Civil Code, which provides for different cases. \u201cAn agreement that, by its terms, is not to be performed within a year from the making thereof,\u201d must be in writing, and subscribed by party to be charged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">Said section does not provide that a contract that can not be performed, or may not or is not likely to be performed within a year, but one that by its terms is not to be performed within one year. Parsons, in his work on Contracts, vol. 3, pp. 35, 36, says the rule may be thus stated: \u201cIf the executory promise be capable of entire performance within one year, it is not within the clause of statute.\u201d The following cases from this Court are somewhat in point, and those from other States are very strong in our favor: <em>Feeny </em>v. <em>Daly, </em>8 Cal. 85, and cases cited; <em>Barringer </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>12 id. 311; <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Raney, </em>18 id. 622; <em>McLaren </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, </em>22 id. 187; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Kent, </em>62 N.

Taylor </em>and <em>Gope &amp; Boyd, </em>for Respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-8\">This agreement is void under the Statute of Frauds. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>an entire agreement. One part of it can not be separated from the other. Ail parts of it must stand or fall together. One of its covenants or stipulations is, that plaintiff shall \u201c always forbear to bring or commence any suit or proceeding to enforce said lien,\u201d and this stipulation, if valid, binds plaintiff\u2019s representatives as well as himself. (2 Pars, on Cont. 531-533; 1 id. 127 and 131.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC\">It is a continuing obligation to always forbear. The Statute of Frauds in force on the twentieth day of May, 1870, the time said agreement is alleged to have been made, provided as follows : \u201c Section 12. In the following cases, every agreement shall be void, unless such agreement or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration, be in writing, and subscribed by the party charged therewith: Every agreement that by the terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.\u201d (Statutes of 1850, p. 267; Brown on Stat. Frauds, 509.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">It will be observed that this statute is different from the English statutes, and the statutes of several of the States. Those statutes provide in effect that no action shall be brought upon any agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof. (Brown on Stat. Frauds, 503-538.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\">Our statute makes the agreement void. The statute affects the entire agreement between the parties\u2014not a part of it. If any part of it is not to be performed within a year, the entire agreement is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">This is the natural import of the language used in the statute, and the Court will not, by a forced and unnatural construction, compel the defendants to perform those stipulations of the agreement which are to be performed on their part when the stipulations of the agreement which are to be performed by the plaintiff are vitiated by the statute and can not be enforced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">If plaintiff, contrary to his agreement, had brought suit, or should hereafter bring suit, to enforce the alleged lien, defendants could not set up the agreement to always forbear to bring such suit, because it is void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\">In the case of <em>Broadwell </em>v. <em>Getman </em>(2 Denio, 87), the defendant could have performed within a year all the stipula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tions of the agreement to he performed on his part; but the plaintiff, who sought to enforce the agreement against the defendant, was not to perform all its stipulations on his part within the year, and in the opinion of the Court, at page 89, it is said: \u201cAs this agreement was made in January, 1841, and could not be completely executed until the close of the season of 1842, it was within the statute, and not being in writing and signed, was void. Upon this point it would seem difficult to raise a doubt upon the terms of the statute. An agreement is an entire thing, and where that can not be completely executed, on both sides, until more than a year has elapsed, the case falls within the express words of the enactment. It is also within the spirit.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-4\">The following authorities are applicable to the question under consideration: <em>Main </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>5 East. 10 (new ed., Vol. 3, p. 21.) (In this case the word agreement is construed to mean, \u201c that which is to show what each party is to do or perform.\u201d) <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Wakefield, 4 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 603; <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Brink, 3 </em>Johns. 215; S.

W. Brittain, and D. V. B. Henarie for the enforcement of certain assessment liens against each of three several lots of land owned by said persons respectively. Reese (on the twentieth day of May, 1870) verbally promised plaintiff, that in consideration that plaintiff would not bring the suit to enforce the lien against the lot owned by him, but would \u201c altogether forbear\u201d to bring such suit, and would commence and prosecute suits against Brittain and Henarie for the enforcement of said assessments against their lots respectively, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and succeed in recovering final judgments in said suits against Brittain and Henarie, he, the said Reese, would, upon such final recovery in said suits, pay to the plaintiff the amount of said assessment on the lot so owned by him, to wit, the sum of nine hundred and ninety-seven dollars and sixty-eight cents, and interest thereon, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The defendants demurred. The Court below sustained the demurrer, and, plaintiff declining to amend, rendered the final judgment in favor of defendants, from which plaintiff has appealed. It is claimed by respondents that the agreement set forth in the complaint is void under the statute of frauds, in force when the agreement was made. The twelfth section of the statute reads: \u201cIn the following cases every agreement shall he void, unless such agreement, or some note or memorandum thereof expressing the consideration, be in writing, and subscribed by the party to he charged therewith: 1. Every agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.\u201d (Stats. 1850, p. 267.)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">It is urged, that if any part of the agreement is not to he performed within a year, the entire agreement is void; that where, by its terms, it can not be completely performed \u201c on both sides\u201d <em>(Roadwell </em>v. <em>Getman, </em>2 Denio, 89) until more than a year has elapsed, the case falls within the express words of the enactment. And\u2014applying these principles to the case\u2014it is said one of the promises of plaintiff is, by its terms, not he performed within the year, to wit, the promise \u201c always to forbear\u201d to bring the suit. But the agreement of plaintiff was \u201c altogether,\u201d not \u201c always,\u201d to forbear, and an agreement to refrain altogether for an <em>indefinite </em>time is not within the operation of the statute. (Browne on the Statute of Frauds, 279.) As we construe the agreement, however, the promise of plaintiff was altogether to forbear to bring suit to foreclose the lien against the lot of Reese until he should recover final judgments in the actions against Brittain and Henarie\u2014events which might occur within the year. Such was the evident intent of the parties. There is nothing in their language to indicate they intended, in case Reese did not pay when final judgments should be entered against Brittain and Henarie, the plaintiff should <em>further </em>forbear. It can not be said, therefore, that by its terms the contract was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>not to be performed within the year. The statute does not declare void a contract which <em>may </em>not be performed within a year, or which is <em>not likely </em>to be performed within that period. It includes only agreements which, fairly and reasonably interpreted, do not admit of a valid execution within the year. (Browne on Stat. of Fraud, 273.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to the Court below to overrule the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Boss and McKee, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
