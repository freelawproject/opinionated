T. K. Wilson, a Superior Judge of the City and</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">County of San Francisco, to settle plaintiff\u2019s statement on motion for a new trial. When the statement was served on the attorneys for the adverse parties, and before any amendments thereto were proposed, defendants \u201c protested against the pretended statement on motion for a new trial which had been served upon them, that it is utterly insufficient and fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>to set forth any proper statement of the case. It merely amounts to a reference to the reporter\u2019s notes, without incorporating said notes in the proposed statement.\u201d The learned Judge, in denying the motion to settle the so-called statement, placed his refusal on the ground that \u201c the proposed statement is wholly insufficient, as a proposed statement on motion for a new trial, and must be disregarded.\u201d We think the motion to settle the proposed statement was properly denied. It does not set forth any of the evidence in the case, but simply refers to the reporter\u2019s notes. Its language is: \u201cAll of which\u201d (the facts in the case) \u201c will more fully appear from said statement of the facts which reads as follows (insert reporter\u2019s notes in full).\u201d Such a statement is not a proper one, and the Court may disregard it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Getty, </em>49 Cal. 584; <em>People </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>53 id. 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Application denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
