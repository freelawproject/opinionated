The findings must state the facts expressly and specially, not generally. The true test is, would they be good as a special verdict ? <em>(Breeze </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>19 id. 105; <em>Ph\u0153nix Water Co. </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>23 id. 488; <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>K. F. &amp; T. M. Co., </em>17 id. 510.) In action for divorce based on cruelty, specific facts must be alleged, and the general allegation of cruelty is insufficient. <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>7 Ired. 484; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>5 Mo. 278; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>10 Ala. 527; <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>3 Tex. 168; <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wilson, 2 </em>Dev. &amp; Bat. 377; <em>Brotun </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>R.

Hupp, </em>for Eespondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-6\">As to the sufficiency of findings the test is, would they be sufficient if presented by a jury as a special verdict? <em>(Breeze </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>19 Cal. 101.) The Court should find the ultimate facts, not state the evidence. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>42 id. 180; <em>Coveny </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>49 id. 556; <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Kinsell, </em>41 id. 514; <em>Hihn </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>30 id. 286.) \u201c Extreme cruelty \u201d is a term defined by Section 94 Civil Code, and is as follows: \u201c Extreme cruelty is the infliction of grievous bodilyinjury or grievous mental suffering upon the other by one party to the marriage.\u201d The acts of defendant produced this effect. Those acts constitute the ultimate fact expressed in the term \u201c extreme cruelty.\u201d Extreme cruelty is a fact which by no assertion or sophistry can be tortured into a conclusion of law. It is torture itself. Extreme cruelty is grievous mental suffering. It is a state of being, and not a conclusion of law. It is an ultimate condition of mind or body produced by successive acts, and not a legal and logical conclusion drawn from a major and a minor premise.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b487-7\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Plaintiff sued defendant for a divorce on the ground of extreme cruelty, alleging in his complaint various acts claimed to constitute cruelty, all of which are denied in the defendant\u2019s answer. A decree of divorce was entered in the Court below, and one of the errors assigned on this appeal is that the findings are insufficient to support the judgment. The following are the findings on the question of extreme cruelty;</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\u201c 5. That the conduct of the defendant toward the plaintiff, and her treatment of her children during the last several years, has, upon repeated occasions, been extremely cruel, and that in the month of June, 1880, without the consent or knowledge of the plaintiff, she deserted her husband and children, and went to Dusseldorf, in Germany, for the purpose, as she now claims, of perfecting herself in the art of painting, and remained absent from her said husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>children until the seventeenth day of September thence next ensuing, upon which day she returned to Los Angeles City.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\" 6. That the repeated acts of cruelty, as established by the evidence, upon the part of said defendant toward her said husband and children during the last several years, have inflicted upon the plaintiff grievous mental suffering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">It will be observed that the only fact of alleged cruelty expressly found is that the defendant deserted her husband and children and went to Dusseldorf, in Germany, for the purpose of perfecting herself in the art of painting, and was abroad from June until September, 1880. This act did not of itself constitute such cruelty as entitled the plaintiff to a divorce. (1 Bish. on Marriage and Divorce, \u00a7 738.) The sixth finding is but a conclusion of law, and does not find any fact in issue in the case. <em>(Polhemus </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>42 Cal. 386.)</p>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
