See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing and the motion for appointment of counsel, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">ORDERED that the motion for appointment of counsel be denied. Appointment of counsel is not warranted in this ease. It is</p>\n<p id=\"A_v\">FURTHER ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review be denied. Petitioner does not challenge the factual findings or legal conclusions in the Board\u2019s October 23, 2014 decision. With respect to his procedural challenges, petitioner has not shown that the Board\u2019s order continuing his hearing constitutes an amended rule triggering the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b). The order was consistent with the Board\u2019s authority under the Federal Credit Union Act (\u201cFCUA\u201d), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1751 et seq., as well as its power under the existing rules to \u201cdirect the performance of ... any act which could be done or ordered by the administrative law judge.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 747.4; Cf. Shalala v. Guernsey Mem\u2019l Hosp., 514 U.S. 87, 100, 115 S.Ct. 1232, 131 L.Ed.2d 106 (1995) (notice and comment procedures are required where an agency adopts \u201ca new position inconsistent with\u201d an existing regulation, or \u201ceffects a substantive change in the regulation\u201d). Furthermore, petitioner has failed to show that the Board\u2019s January 2, 2009 order was \u201carbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); see 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 747.29(b)(1) (providing that par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ties may move for summary disposition \u201cat any time\u201d during an adjudicatory proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
