See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b851-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed September 29, 2015, and December 2, 2015, be affirmed. The district court properly concluded that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because it cannot review decisions made by another District Judge, and because appellant\u2019s claims were patently frivolous. See <em>Hagans v. Lavine, </em>415 U.S. 528, 536-37, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 39 L.Ed.2d 577 (1974) (federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction to hear claims that are \u201cconstitutionally insubstantial,\u201d such as claims that are \u201cessentially fictitious, wholly insubstantial, obviously frivolous, [or] obviously without merit\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted); see also <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978) (judges acting in their judicial capacity are immune from suit, even when such acts are alleged to be in excess of authority, malicious or corrupt); <em>Roth v. King, </em>449 F.3d 1272, 1286 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3). See <em>Summers v. Howard, Univ., </em>374 F.3d 118, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-21\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>See Fed.
