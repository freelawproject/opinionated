See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b863-24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders denying appellants\u2019 discovery requests and granting summary judgment to appellees be affirmed. Appellants have not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying their discovery requests. See Freedom Watch v. NSA, 783 F.3d 1340, 1345 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The district court correctly concluded that the loan modification agreement was invalid because it purported to modify a contract without the consent of all of the contracting parties. See Nyhus v. Travel Mgmt. Corp., 466 F.2d 440, 445 (D.C. Cir. 1972). As for appellees\u2019 right to enforce the note, under D.C. law, the holder of a note indorsed in blank is normally entitled to enforce the instrument. Chase Plaza Condominium Ass\u2019n v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 98 A.3d 166, 169-70 (D.C. 2014); see also D.C. Code \u00a728:3-301 (holder of an instrument is entitled to enforce it); \u00a7 28:3-205. Appellants have presented no evidence capable of rebutting the district court\u2019s conclusions that appellees own the mortgage loan and hold the note, nor have they shown that any of the related documents are fraudulent. Appellants\u2019 remaining arguments fail, either because they were not raised in the opening brief and are therefore forfeited, see Fox v. Gov\u2019t of the District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 25, 29 (D.C. Cir. 2015), because they were insufficiently developed and are therefore forfeit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>ed, see Schneider v. Kissinger, 412 F.3d 190, 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005), or because appellants have proffered no evidence indicating that summary judgment was inappropriate, see Liberty Lobby, Inc. v. Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., 838 F.2d 1287, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
