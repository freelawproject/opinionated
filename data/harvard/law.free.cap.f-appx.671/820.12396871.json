On consideration thereof, and as will be explained more fully in opinions to be filed at a later date, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the order of the District Court denying the motion for a preliminary injunction be reversed. Appellants have demonstrated irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, that the balance of equities tips in their favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">FURTHER ORDERED that the United States Election Assistance Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), and anyone acting on its behalf, be enjoined from giving effect to the January 29, 2016, decisions of its Executive Director, Brian D. Newby, approving requests by Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia to add a proof of citizenship requirement to the state-specific instructions that accompany the National Mail Voter Registration Form (the \u201cFederal Form\u201d). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission take all actions necessary to restore the status quo ante, pending a determination on the merits, including promptly removing from the state-specific instructions those requirements directing voter registration applicants to submit proof of their United States citizenship, informing Kansas, Alabama, and Georgia that Federal Form applications filed since January 29, 2016 should be treated as if they did not contain the now-stricken state-specific instructions, and promptly posting on the Commission\u2019s website the modified version of the Federal Form.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-14\">Our dissenting colleague claims that a Constitutional issue \u201cwould arise if a court issued a final injunction in this case forbidding the Commission from including the states\u2019 requirements.\u201d But that issue is not presented in this case because the Leagues seek only to enjoin the Commission (or its agents) from giving effect to the January 29, 2016 decisions of Executive Director Newby. Neither this preliminary injunction nor a final judgment would forbid the Commission from including a proof-of-citizenship requirement if it determined that such a requirement was necessary to \u201ceffectuate [the States\u2019] citizenship requirement[s].\u201d <em>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2247, 2260, 186 L.Ed.2d 239 (2013). Like Arizona after <em>ITCA, </em>the States here remain free to renew their \u201crequests] that the [Commission] alter the Federal Form to include information the State[s] deem[ ] necessary to determine eligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the Commission refuses those requests (or fails to act timely), the States here (like Arizona) will have the \u201copportunity to establish in a reviewing court\u201d that their proof-of-citizenship requirements are necessary to enable them to assess eligibility. <em>Id.; </em>see 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20508(b)(1). Because they have yet to do so, our review of the agency action here presents no Constitutional issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b865-17\">Randolph, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8a\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b865-18\">I would affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction on the ground that appellants have not demonstrated irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The Supreme Court in <em>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc. </em>recognized that under Article I, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, and the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, the states\u2014not the federal\u2019 government\u2014have the power to establish \u201cvoting requirements\u201d in federal elections. - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2247, 2258-59, 186 L.Ed.2d 239 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The Court also held that it would \u201craise serious constitutional doubts\u201d if the Election Assistance Commission prevented a state from \u201cenforcing its voter qualifications\u201d and that the Commission may be \u201cunder a nondiscretionary duty to include [a state\u2019s proof of citizenship requirements] on the Federal Form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2259-60. That issue is not presented because the Commission\u2019s Executive Director granted the requests of Kansas, Georgia and Alabama to include their requirements on the Federal Form. But the issue would arise if a court issued a final injunction in this case forbidding the Commission from including the states\u2019 requirements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
