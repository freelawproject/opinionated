The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the District Court\u2019s May 18, 2015 judgment and August 5, 2015 order be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-16\">In January 2008, NBC cameraman Michael Queen met Ed Schultz in the hallways of NBC after \u2019 Schultz had finished taping a guest appearance on the television program <em>Hardball with Chris Matthews. </em>Queen, a fan of <em>The Ed Schultz Radio Show, </em>approached Schultz about the possibility of working together to develop a program starring Schultz for network television. Hoping to generate interest from media providers in the prospective program, Queen and Schultz soon thereafter began producing a promotional package. Despite Queen\u2019s urgings, however, the parties at no time executed a contractual agreement. Between late 2008 and early 2009, Schultz independently negotiated with Phil Griffin, the President of MSNBC, for the creation of <em>The Ed Show. </em>The show, which ran from 2009 to 2015, did not include Queen in either an employment or a financial capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">In May 2011, Queen initiated this suit against Schultz, alleging breach of contract, breach of implied-in-fact contract, fraud in the inducement, tortious interference with business relationships, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted summary judgment in Schultz\u2019s favor on all claims. <em>Queen v. Schultz, </em>888 F.Supp.2d 145, 149 (D.D.C. 2012). This court affirmed in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>but remanded to allow Queen to present to a jury his \u201cpartnership theory\u201d\u2014namely, that he and Schultz had entered into a business partnership together, such that Schultz had violated his duty of loyalty to Queen by cutting Queen out of Schultz\u2019s eventual deal with MSNBC. <em>Queen v. Schultz, </em>747 F.3d 879, 881-82 (D.C. Cir. 2014). After an ensuing trial, the jury found in Schultz\u2019s favor, concluding that he and Queen had never formed a partnership. <em>Queen v. Schultz, </em>310 F.R.D. 10, 12 (D.D.C. 2015). Queen moved for a new trial and for substitution of a different judge on the grounds that the district judge who presided over the trial had made a number of erroneous\u25a0and prejudicial rulings and was impermissibly biased in favor of Schultz. The district court denied those motions. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 20 n.17. Queen now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Queen first claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court improperly refused to admit approximately 1,200 e-mails Queen sent and received in his alleged role as Schultz\u2019s business partner. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Fahnbulleh, </em>752 F.3d 470, 478 (D.C. Cir. 2014). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the emails lacked the requisite \u201cindicia of trustworthiness\u201d to be admitted under the hearsay exception for business records. Trial Tr. 220 (May 1, 2015); Fed. R, Evid. 803(6)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), we look to whether \u201ctestimony of the custodian\u201d of the records demonstrates that \u201cmaking the record was a regular practice\u201d of the business (i.e., the ostensible partnership). The district court, answering that question in the negative, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">It\u2019s not clear [from Queen\u2019s testimony] whether [he] had conversations with Mr. Schultz about who [was] responsible for keeping e-mails in the course of their interchange, which e-mails were required to be sent, which.e-mails he was required to send, which e-mails he was required as part of this business activity to [retain], who was going to be a designated custodian, which e-mails were going to be considered vital or necessary elements of communications among the partners, [or] whether the e-mails were going to be relied upon in the conduct of their business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Trial Tr. 217-18. That assessment accords with Queen\u2019s own admission that his \u201cfocus was to get a television show, not to keep records exactly accurate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. In those circumstances, we cannot find that the district court abused its discretion in declining to admit the e-mails as records kept in the regular course of a business. It bears noting, moreover, that a number of the e-mails were ultimately admitted during the trial on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Queen next objects to a limiting instruction provided to the jury concerning 226 pages of e-mails exchanged between Queen and Schultz that were proffered by Queen just as he rested his case-in-chief. Queen sought to introduce those e-mails \u201cnot for the truth\u201d of the matters asserted in them, but as evidence of his \u201cstate of mind\u201d and as \u201ccircumstantial evidence of the fact that a partnership relationship existed.\u201d Trial Tr. 173, 179 (May 14, 2015). But the district court instructed the jury to consider the evidence solely \u201cto provide information about the state of mind of the plaintiff during the course of these e-mail communications.\u201d Trial Tr. 201 (May 14, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in giving that limiting instruction. As an initial matter, the distinction Queen attempts to draw between the purpose for which he sought to use the e-mails (as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>circumstantial evidence of the existence of the partnership) and the purpose for which the district court allowed the jury to use them (as evidence of state of mind) is ultimately illusory. Because the existence of a partnership under D.C. law is a question of whether two or more individuals \u201cintend to associate together to carry on as co-owners for profit,\u201d <em>Beckman v. Farmer, </em>579 A.2d 618, 627 (D.C. 1990), the e-mails provide circumstantial evidence of the partnership\u2019s existence precisely <em>because </em>they reflect the contemporaneous state of mind of the parties. The district court\u2019s decision to resolve the admissibility of the e-mails under the framework provided by Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3)\u2019s \u201cstate of mind\u201d exception was therefore within the court\u2019s discretion. And although the 226 pages of e-mails in theory could also have been admitted to show Schultz\u2019s state of mind (not just Queen\u2019s), Queen\u2019s counsel stated at trial that the e-mails should be admitted only \u201cfor the state of mind of <em>my client,\u201d </em>and Queen\u2019s briefing before this court does not appear to contradict that position. Trial Tr. 173 (May 14, 2015) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Queen further contends that the emails from Schultz should have been admitted as opposing party statements under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2). Queen, however, failed to make that argument in the district court. We therefore review the argument for plain error, <em>see United States v. Reed, </em>522 F.3d 354, 360 (D.C. Cir. 2008), and we find no plain error here. When discussing the admissibility of the emails with the district judge, Queen\u2019s counsel agreed that he was not \u201coffering them for the truth\u201d of the matters asserted in them and instead \u201cask[ed] that [the judge] give a limiting instruction\u201d-to the jury concerning their admissibility. Trial Tr. 179-80 (May 14, 2015). Those actions verge upon waiving this line of argument entirely; at the least, they indicate that the district court\u2019s eventual limiting instruction was not plainly erroneous. Furthermore, even if the court had erred in declining to allow the jury to consider the emails sent by Schultz for the truth of the matters asserted in them, Queen fails to demonstrate that the error would have affected his substantial rights, as he would need to do to satisfy the plain-error standard. <em>See Coleman-Lee v. Gov\u2019t of Dist. of Columbia, </em>788 F.3d 296, 299 (D.C. Cir. 2015). Numerous e-mails exchanged between the two had already been admitted as exhibits earlier in the trial, and the limiting instruction still permitted the jury to consider the light they shed on Queen\u2019s state of mind at the time, which is undoubtedly relevant to the ultimate inquiry of whether a partnership existed. Under the deferential plain-error standard, we are unable to award Queen a new trial based on the district court\u2019s limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Queen next contends that certain statements made by Schultz\u2019s counsel during opening and closing arguments require a new trial. Because Queen did not object to those statements in the district court, we again review for plain error. With regard to the opening argument, Queen contends that Schultz\u2019s counsel improperly referenced Queen\u2019s failure to prevail on other theories of liability in earlier stages of the litigation. Counsel observed that the district court had previously determined that Queen was not \u201cMr. Schultz\u2019s agent\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t have a contract\u201d with Schultz. Trial Tr. 41 (May 11, 2015). Those references were improper, Queen argues, because past judgments are generally considered inadmissible hearsay, and opening statements are traditionally confined to comments on evidence expected to be introduced during trial. Regardless of whether the admission of those statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>was erroneous, we find that any error did not affect Queen\u2019s substantial rights and did not seriously affect the fairness or integrity of the proceedings, as would be necessary to find plain error. <em>See Coleman-Lee, </em>788 F.3d at 299. The jury was instructed that opening arguments are not evidence, and Queen points us to no further reference to past stages of the litigation and no effort to exploit the brief references in opening arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Queen similarly fails to demonstrate plain error with regard to his argument that Schultz\u2019s counsel\u2019s two passing references to \u201cindentured servitude\u201d during closing arguments improperly inflamed the passions of the jury. Those statements did not go \u201cwell beyond the limits of legitimate advocacy,\u201d such that \u201cthe integrity or fundamental fairness of the proceedings in the trial court is called into serious question.\u201d <em>Bird v. Glacier Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1136, 1148, 1150 (9th Cir. 2001). Indeed, Queen\u2019s own counsel made statements about slavery during closing arguments. As we have explained, \u201cthe District Judge is better situated than we are to assess the impact of both sides\u2019 hyperbole upon the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. North, </em>910 F.2d 843, 895 (D.C. Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Queen next challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his pretrial spoliation motion, which alleged that Schultz had improperly deleted his e-mails after the point in time that he should have been on notice of the possibility of litigation. For his part, Schultz admits that he \u201cdidn\u2019t save any emails in relationship to this legal action until [he] found out [he] was being sued ... in April of 2009.\u201d Trial Tr. 140 (May 1, 2015). According to Schultz, his deletions prior to that time are explained by the fact that he \u201cperiodically delete[s] e-mails\u201d because he gets \u201chundreds of e-mails a day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In an attempt to undermine Schultz\u2019s account, Queen points to a number of prior e-mails exchanged between the two in which they discussed, for example, possible profit-sharing arrangements, as well as Schultz\u2019s plea to Queen to \u201cleave all that legal stuff at [water\u2019s] edge until we know what we\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Mot. Sanctions and Award Attorney\u2019s Fees 3-4 (Mar. 27, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to credit Schultz\u2019s account and to conclude that he had no obligation to preserve his e-mails until April 2009. In addition, Queen fails to show that any error in denying his spoliation motion caused him prejudice. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 61; <em>Huthnance v. District of Columbia, </em>722 F.3d 371, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2013). There is no indication that any e-mails were lost as a result of the allegedly improper deletions, as Queen evidently maintained copies of his e-mail exchanges with Schultz. The fact that Queen may have been prohibited in closing statements from telling the jury that Schultz had (allegedly improperly) deleted his e-mails falls significantly short of infringing upon his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Queen gets no further in arguing that Jeff Landa, Schultz\u2019s attorney, had also been put on notice of the possibility of litigation before April 2009. Queen simply provides no rationale for thinking that Landa, who is not a party to this case, and who may well not have been privy to many of the parties\u2019 e-mail communications, should have been on notice before Schultz himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Finally, we reject Queen\u2019s claim that the district judge was impermissibly biased against him. None of the colloquies identified by Queen \u201creveal[ed] such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Judges are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>given significant discretion in determining how to manage their courtrooms. That discretion was not exceeded in this case. We therefore deny Queen\u2019s claims that the district court should have granted his motions for a new trial and recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cm. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
