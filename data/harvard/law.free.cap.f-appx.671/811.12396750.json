See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b855-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order, entered January 15, 2016, be affirmed. Appellant sought, by means of the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, to have the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia take action he thought should have been taken by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court. But the All Writs Act \u201cis not itself a grant of jurisdiction.\u201d In re Tennant, 359 F.3d 523, 527 (D.C.Cir.2004). Nor does the All Writs Act \u201cenlarge th[e] jurisdiction\u201d of a court. Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U.S. 529, 535, 119 S.Ct. 1538, 143 L.Ed.2d 720 (1999). The district court in the District of Columbia has no jurisdiction to review a decision by a district court in Texas\u2014or any appeals therefrom\u2014or any claims by appellant stemming from those decisions. Consequently, the district court properly dismissed his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-20\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
