See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b852-22\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order, entered April 5, 2016, dismissing without prejudice appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, be affirmed. The district courts of the United States are \u201ccourts of limited jurisdiction. They possess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute.\u201d Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). The district courts have jurisdiction in \u201cfederal question\u201d eases, i.e., civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district courts also have jurisdiction in \u201cdiversity\u201d cases, i.e., civil actions between citizens of different U.S. states or between U.S. citizens and foreign citizens or foreign states, provided the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In this case, because appellant established neither federal-question jurisdiction nor diversity jurisdiction, the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-17\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
