This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Tommie Lee S\u00faber was tried by jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia and found guilty of conspiracy to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and distribution of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. That court sentenced S\u00faber to sixty-three months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. S\u00faber began serving his supervised release on August 17, 2000. On February 21, 2002, the Northern District of Georgia transferred supervision of S\u00faber to the Southern District of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On September 6, 2002, S\u00faber filed pro se: 1) a motion for order terminating supervised release; and 2) a petition for exemption from employment disability of a convicted person. The district court denied Suber\u2019s motion for early termination of supervised release and directed S\u00faber to file his petition for exemption from employment disability in the Northern District of Georgia. S\u00faber appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">On appeal, S\u00faber concedes that any issue pertaining to his petition for exemption from employment disability of a convicted person is not properly before the court. With respect to his motion for early termination of supervised release, however, S\u00faber contends on appeal that the district court erred in its determination and application of the appropriate legal criteria for judging a motion for early termination of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Suber\u2019s issues regarding his petition for exemption from employment disability of a convicted person are not reviewable on appeal. Issues that were raised in the district court, yet not raised on appeal, are considered abandoned and not reviewable on appeal. <em>Enertech Elec., Inc. v. Mahoning County Comm\u2019rs, 85 </em>F.3d 257, 259 (6th Cir.1996). S\u00faber initially argued that his prohibition from employment with a labor organization was unconstitutional and that the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio had the authority to consider his petition for exemption. Thereafter, S\u00faber conceded that any issue pertaining to his petition for exemption is not properly before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to terminate an individual\u2019s term of supervised release before the expiration of the term under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) under the narrow abuse of discretion standard. <em>Cf. United States v. Lowenstein, </em>108 F.3d 80, 85-86 (6th Cir.1997) (reviewing revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion). S\u00faber contends that the district court was obligated to consider and address each of the seven statutory factors set forth <em>in 18 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that failure to do so is reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-11\">Section 3583 is the general section instructing district courts on the parameters of supervised release. The relevant text of \u00a7 3583(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">(e) Modification of conditions or revocation. \u2014 The court may, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6)-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoa\">(1) terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the defendant released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release, pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation, if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice.... 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">The plain language of the statute illustrates that \u00a7 3583(e), in the typical case, allows a conduct-based inquiry into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>continued necessity for supervision after the individual has served one full year on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The statute, however, is not exclusively limited to considerations of conduct. The language of the statute notes that the district court \u201cmay\u201d terminate supervised release if it is satisfied that such action is warranted by the conduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice. The phrase \u201cthe interest of justice\u201d gives the district court latitude to consider a broad range of factors in addition to an individual\u2019s behavior in considering whether to terminate the supervised release period. <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282 (4th Cir.1999). The conjunction \u201cand\u201d used in the statute clearly indicates that a district court must conclude that the early termination of supervised release is warranted both by the individual\u2019s conduct and also by the interest of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion. The first two statutory factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) are \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and the need \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(B). The district court plainly considered these factors in denying Suber\u2019s motion inasmuch as the district court denied Suber\u2019s motion in light of the gravity of the underlying offenses. In effect, the court determined that the nature of Suber\u2019s heroin distribution and conspiracy to distribute heroin was sufficiently grave to warrant continued supervised release, determined that continued supervised release was necessary in Suber\u2019s case to afford adequate deterrence, and in sum, determined that the early termination of Suber\u2019s supervised release was not in the interest of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Suber\u2019s appellate argument is meritless. He contends that the district court was obligated to consider and address each of the seven statutory factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that failure to do so is reversible error. Just as a sentencing court need not recite any \u201cmagic words\u201d explaining whether and how it considered the policy statements contained in the Sentencing Guidelines or how it weighed the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, <em>see United States v. McClellan, </em>164 F.3d 308, 310 (6th Cir.1999), a court considering whether to terminate an individual\u2019s term of supervised release before the expiration of the term need not recite any \u201cmagic words.\u201d The district court\u2019s stated reason for denying S\u00faber early termination of supervised release is sufficient for informed appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. All outstanding motions are hereby denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
