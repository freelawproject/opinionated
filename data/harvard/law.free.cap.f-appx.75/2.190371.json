R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment be affirmed. A writ of mandamus is available to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361. Mandamus is appropriate where a public official has violated a \u201cministerial\u201d duty which is \u201cso plainly prescribed as to be free from doubt and equivalent to a positive command.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, Inc. v. Ashcroft, </em>286 F.3d 600, 605 (D.C.Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Wilbur v. United States, </em>281 U.S. 206, 218-19, 50 S.Ct. 320, 74 L.Ed. 809 (1929)). The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires and that his entitlement to such relief is clear and indisputable. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980). Here, appellants have failed to meet their burden of establishing that appellee had a duty to retract or nullify the designation of Lake Meredith as a federal park.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">Pursuant to D.C.Cir. Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
