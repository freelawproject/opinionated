Accordingly, he asserts his robbery conviction cannot stand, and his conviction for brandishing a firearm during the robbery cannot stand. We review these claims de novo. <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 308 (4th Cir.2002). Mann\u2019s claims are meritless. The Hobbs Act contains a jurisdictional element requiring a case-by-case determination regarding whether the defendant\u2019s conduct impacted interstate commerce. Thus, the Government must prove, as it did here, that the defendant\u2019s actions impacted interstate commerce, not that the impact was substantial. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (2000); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>342 F.3d 350 (4th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>990 F.2d 119, 125 (4th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>777 F.2d 159, 162 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 613, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000); <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 856, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 561, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). Consequently, Mann establishes no error in his convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-20\">Accordingly, we affirm Mann\u2019s convictions and sentences. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
