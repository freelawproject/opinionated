On appeal, Green\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Green has filed a pro se brief. Having considered both briefs, and following our independent review under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Specifically, we disagree with Green\u2019s contention that the government breached the plea agreement; and we conclude that, in setting the base offense level, the district court properly considered as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d Green\u2019s 1998 attempted residential burglary conviction resulting from his attempt to help his girlfriend escape from a juvenile detention facility, and his 2000 residential-burglary conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (base offense level for firearm possession after two prior felony convictions for crime of violence); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) (\u201ccrime of violence\u201d includes burglary of dwelling); <em>United States v. Sun Bear, </em>307 F.3d 747, 750, 753 (8th Cir.2002) (attempted burglary is crime of violence; attempted escape from custody is crime of violence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2275, 156 L.Ed.2d 133 (2003). Green\u2019s ineffective assistance claims should be presented in post-conviction proceedings, if at all. We find no other non-frivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Accordingly, we grant counsels\u2019 motion to withdraw and Green\u2019s motion to supplement his brief. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-29\">. The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
