We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants because Cox\u2019s conclusory allegations that defendants failed to treat his eye injury were insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989) (explaining that \u201c[a] summary judgment motion cannot be defeated by relying solely on conclusory allegations unsupported by factual data[ ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Cox\u2019s requests for appointment of counsel and an expert to assist with his case because Cox failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances. <em>See Terrell v. Brewer, </em>935 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Finally, the district court did not err by denying Cox\u2019s emergency application for injunction directing the defendants to approve cataract surgery for his left eye because the application requested additional relief based on conduct that was not alleged in the underlying complaint. <em>See 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, </em>179 F.3d 656, 665 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that district court did not err by failing to consider unpleaded claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
