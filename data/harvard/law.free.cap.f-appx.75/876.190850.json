The case has a long and tortuous procedural history with which the parties are intimately familiar and which need not be rescribed here. Judge Baylson dismissed the complaint on ripeness grounds. We think that he was correct in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-13\">Ripeness in this context is governed by <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), which stands for the proposition that in cases involving use of land and a challenge to a zoning decision, a claim will not be ripe until the plaintiff has given the local municipality the opportunity to issue a final decision on the application of its zoning ordinance to the property in question. <em>Id. </em>at 186. We have recognized that, in a Pennsylvania Municipality, the ability to render final zoning decisions is vested in the Zoning Hearing Board (\u201cZHB\u201d) pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Municipalities Planning Code. <em>Taylor Inv., Ltd. v. Upper Darby Township, </em>983 F.2d 1285, 1291-93 (3d Cir.1993). Holland argues that its claim is ripe because it appeared before the ZHB regarding Site A, and the ZHB issued a final decision regarding that site (a denial).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-15\">However, Holland appealed this decision to the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas where Judge Battle reversed the ZHB, finding that it had abused its discretion by labeling Holland\u2019s mulch business as a \u201ccollection facility\u201d rather than a \u201cprocessing facility.\u201d Judge Battle then remanded the case to the ZHB for determination of one specific issue. The municipal regulations require a \u201c150-foot setback\u201d from residential properties for facilities of this sort. There is some ambiguity as to whether the <em>facility itself </em>must be 150 feet from a residential property, or whether the <em>property on which the facility sits </em>must be 150 feet from a residential property. Holland did not renew its argument before the ZHB because, it argues, the ZHB had already decided this issue (in favor of the \u201cproperty\u201d interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">The District Court concluded that the remand essentially made the ZHB\u2019s prior \u201cfinal decision\u201d not final anymore, reasoning that, even if the ZHB had previously decided in favor of the \u201cproperty\u201d interpretation rather than the \u201cfacility location\u201d interpretation, the Court of Common Pleas\u2019 reversal of other components of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>holding might cause the ZHB to reconsider that one as well. (Perhaps if the ZHB views Holland\u2019s facility as a \u201cprocessing facility,\u201d its conclusion regarding the 150-foot setback will change.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">We think that a remand for consideration of an issue renders nonfinal any decision on that issue, in which case Holland had a duty to renew its action before the ZHB. It did not do so, which means that its claim is not ripe. The same conclusion obtains for Sites B and C, where Holland never even petitioned the ZHB for a resolution, claiming that to do so would have been futile given the perceived persecution by County Commissioners that would give rise to a futility exception to ripeness. But we have not recognized the futility exception in land use cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Holland spends a great deal of time arguing that our decision in <em>Blanche Road Corp. v. Bensalem Township, </em>57 F.3d 253 (3d Cir.1995), precludes dismissal of Holland\u2019s claims even if they are not ripe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, while this case was being briefed, <em>Blanche Road </em>was superseded. We held in <em>United Artists Theatre Circuit, Inc. v. Tonwship of Warrington, PA, </em>316 F.3d 392 (3d Cir.2003), that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998), requires that we employ a \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d standard instead of an \u201cimproper interference standard.\u201d Holland concedes that this is now the controlling case, and makes an argument that what happened in this case shocks the conscience. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\">. <em>Blanche Road </em>held that zoning ripeness was not required when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">Defendants acting in their capacity as officers of the township, deliberately and improperly interfered with the process by which the township issued permits in order to block or to delay the issuance of plaintiffs' permits, and that the defendants did so for reasons unrelated to the merits of the application for permits. Such actions, if proven, are sufficient to establish a substantive due process violation, actionable under \u00a7 1983, even if the ultimate outcome of plaintiffs\u2019 permit applications was favorable.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-8\">. Alternatively, we agree with Judge Baylson that a separate basis for granting summary judgment is that granting Holland the relief it sought (a permit) would necessarily entail setting aside the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, which instructed Holland to file a Land Use Development Plan in connection with Site B. In reversing, we would be overturning the judgment of a state court that a Land Use Development Plan was a prudent request on the part of the Commissioners, and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevents us from doing so, <em>see D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983), and <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
