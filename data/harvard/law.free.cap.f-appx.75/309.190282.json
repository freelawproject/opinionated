The district court sentenced Pinkston to the seven-year mandatory minimum for the third crime, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). Pinkston appeals this aspect of his sentence, claiming that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly conflated the meaning of \u201cbrandishing\u201d a firearm, which carries a seven-year penalty, with the meaning of \u201cusing\u201d a firearm, which carries only a five-year penalty under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">We review jury instructions under an abuse of discretion standard, affording district courts \u201csubstantial latitude,\u201d and upholding instructions that, when viewed as a whole, accurately reflect the law and issues in the case. <em>United States v. Young, </em>282 F.3d 349, 353 (5th Cir.2002). Here, the district court instructed the jury that a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) is proper when the defendant \u201cused\u201d a firearm in his crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">[T]he government must prove that the defendant actively employed the firearm in commission of [a crime].... \u201cActive employment\u201d may include brandishing, displaying, referring to, bartering, striking with, firing, or attempting to fire the firearm. Use is more than mere possession of a firearm or having it available during the crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">This instruction carefully tracks the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 148, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995); therefore, it was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-18\">In addition, the district court submitted the question of whether Pinkston \u201cbrand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ished\u201d a firearm during this offense as a special issue to the jury,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instructing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">The term \u201cbrandish\u201d means, with respect to a firearm, to display all or part of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the firearm known to another person in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm is directly visible to that person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This language mirrors the statutory definition for \u201cbrandish\u201d found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Nevertheless, Pinkston claims that the latter instruction was too broad, because it would encompass every situation in which the defendant has \u201cused\u201d a firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). We disagree. A defendant who barters a gun while committing a predicate crime has \u201cused\u201d a gun under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), <em>see Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993), yet he would not qualify as \u201cbrandishing\u201d his weapon under the definition in \u00a7 924(c)(4) because he did not display the firearm \u201cin order to intimidate\u201d another. Thus, it is not true, as Pinkston asserts, that the term \u201cbrandish\u201d has become mere surplusage by virtue of the statutory definition Congress created. We therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion with respect to this jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">. Pinkston\u2019s trial took place before the Supreme Court announced, in <em>Harris v. United States, </em>that whether a defendant \u201cbrandished\u201d a firearm under \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) is a sentencing factor that may be decided by a judge, rather than a jury. 536 U.S. 545, 568-69, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
