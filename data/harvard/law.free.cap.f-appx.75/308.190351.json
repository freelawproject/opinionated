He argues that the appellate court\u2019s actions in holding the appeal in abeyance and remanding the case to the trial court for findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of the trial court\u2019s denial of Pace\u2019s motion to suppress violated the Confrontation Clause. The trial court was required to make such factual findings under state procedural law. <em>See </em>Tex.Crim. Proc. code. Ann. art 38.22 \u00a7 6; <em>cf. Sims v. Georgia, </em>385 U.S. 538, 544, 87 S.Ct. 639, 17 L.Ed.2d 593 (1967). The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress, during which Pace was allowed to cross-examine the witnesses against him, and the court relied on that hearing in formulating its factual findings. Pace has not shown that his rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated by the state\u2019s remedial procedure. <em>See Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985). The judgment of the district court denying Pace relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-19\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
