The award stems from the second jury trial on Weathersby\u2019s claims. Unfortunately, we are precluded from ruling on appellant\u2019s appeal. Weatherby\u2019s claims before the district court also included a claim for reinstatement. The district court has yet to rule on such claim. The judgment appealed from does not resolve all of Weatherby\u2019s claims against Cooper and is not an appealable final judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1999); <em>Witherspoon v. White, </em>111 F.3d 399, 402 (5th Cir.1997). Neither does this case present us with the type of partial final judgment that might allow us to entertain this appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Unless and until the district court rules on the claim for reinstatement, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the monetary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-24\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
