Dunn argues that the district court clearly erred by increasing his offense level based on the court\u2019s finding that Dunn used the prohibited firearm in connection with an assault on his wife and that the court erroneously departed upward based on Dunn\u2019s prior unadjudicated criminal conduct. Dunn disputes the factual finding that the assault involved a firearm, but he does not suggest that the court computed his offense level incorrectly if the finding of a firearm is correct. The district court\u2019s factual finding that the assault involved a firearm is supported by the evidence. <em>United States v. Edwards, 65 </em>F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir.1995). We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to depart upward at sentencing based on the fact that Dunn\u2019s unadjudicated criminal history demonstrates a consistent pattern of incidents involving violence against women.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b994-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
