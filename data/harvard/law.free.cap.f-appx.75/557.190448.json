At sentencing, over Figueroa\u2019s objection, the district court increased his offense level by 2 levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possessing a firearm during the conspiracy, and sentenced him to 292 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, Figueroa challenges the 2-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-22\">After carefully reviewing the evidence presented by the government at sentencing, we conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Figueroa possessed a firearm during the charged conspiracy and that the it was not clearly improbable the firearm was connected to the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>310 F.3d 1105, 1112 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2121, 155 L.Ed.2d 1096 (2003). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-20\">. The Honorable Richard G.
