RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Defendant Armando Martinez-Anaya, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for sentence modification filed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Defendant pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). He was sentenced to a 120-month minimum mandatory term of imprisonment. In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, defendant argued the sentencing range applicable to his convictions had been lowered retroactively by Amendment 640 to the Guidelines and that his sentence should be reduced accordingly. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3). The district court concluded that defendant was not entitled to relief because he was given the minimum statutory sentence and therefore was not eligible for a discretionary reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) when the applicable sentencing range is lowered by the Sentencing Commission after the defendant is sentenced. However, defendant\u2019s sentence was controlled by the applicable statutory mandatory minimum. He was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months, a term of imprisonment that must be imposed when a defendant is convicted of possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u00a9; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). Amendment 640 did not amend \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(ii). The district court was correct in concluding that defendant was not eligible for a reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 542 (10th Cir.1997) (concluding defendant not entitled to reduction in sentence pursuant to Amendment 516 because original sentence was statutory minimum term of 60 months).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b768-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ax-\">. In his reply brief, defendant requests application of the safety valve provision found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. This issue was not raised before the district court and will not be considered. <em>See United States v. Arzaga, 9 </em>F.3d 91, 94 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
