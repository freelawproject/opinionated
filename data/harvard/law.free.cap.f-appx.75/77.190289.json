Denied relief by the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d), Anisovich appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Anisovich subsequently filed this petition for review, a petition that we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">A. <em>Facts and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Anisovich is a native of the Ukraine who was admitted to the United States as a refugee on September 8, 1994, and became a lawful permanent resident on October 4, 1995. On June 11,1998, Anisovich pleaded guilty to one charge of illegal use of a credit card and was sentenced to a three-year term of probation. On September 7, 1999, the INS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> initiated removal proceedings against Anisovich under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), as an alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude. An IJ found Anisovich removable on March 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-19\">Anisovich applied for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. A full merits hearing was held on April 10, 2002. Anisovich described the persecution he had suffered in the Ukraine on account of his Jewish religion and ethnicity. While the IJ found that Anisovich had suffered past persecution, he denied him relief from removal. He noted that Anisovich\u2019s testimony was credible and consistent with the written statements submitted with his application and found that Anisovich had suffered past persecution on account of his Jewish ethnicity and religion. However, the IJ also found that country conditions in the Ukraine had changed. As a result Anisovich no longer had a well-founded fear of government-condoned persecution and was not, therefore, eligible for asylum. The IJ denied him withholding of removal under the INA because, absent a well-founded fear of persecution, Anisovich could not demonstrate a clear probability that he would be persecuted. Finally, because there was no evidence that the Ukranian Government would torture or acquiesce in the torture of Anisovich, the IJ denied him withholding of removal under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-20\">The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s decision on November 5, 2002. Based on the country condition information in the record, it concluded that a preponderance of the evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that Anisovich did not have a well-founded fear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>future persecution. This petition for review followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">B. <em>Statutory Scheme</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">1. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien who demonstrates that he or she is a refugee. INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country because of a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">An applicant is eligible for asylum on the basis of past persecution if he or she can show: \u201c(1) an incident, or incidents, that rise to the level of persecution; (2) that is \u2018on account of one of the statutorily-protected grounds; and (3) is committed by the government or forces the government is either \u2018unable or unwilling\u2019 to control.\u201d <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir.2002). A showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 116, 126 (3d Cir.2002) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)). That presumption can be rebutted by the Government through the presentation of evidence that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in the country of persecution (generally referred to as \u201cchanged country conditions\u201d) such that an applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or that the alien could avoid future harm by relocating within the country. <em>Id. </em>at 126-27 (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B), 208.16(b)(1)); <em>In re N-M-A-, </em>22 I &amp; N Dec. 312 (BIA 1998). If the Government meets this burden, the alien must establish a well-founded fear of future persecution in order to be eligible for asylum. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">An applicant is eligible for asylum because of his or her fear of future persecution upon showing both that he or she possesses a genuine fear (the subjective test) and that a reasonable person would fear persecution if returned to that country (the objective test). <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272. Aliens bear the burden of supporting their asylum claims through credible testimony. <em>Id. </em>Testimony, if credible, is by itself sufficient to meet this burden. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">2. Withholding/Deferral of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">An alien is eligible for withholding of <em>removal </em>under the INA if he <em>or </em>she can provide objective evidence demonstrating that it is more likely than not that he will face persecution. <em>Chang v. INS, </em>119 F.3d 1055, 1066 (3d Cir.1997). That person also is eligible for withholding or deferral of removal under CAT if he or she can demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she will be tortured if removed.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174-75 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2))). Torture is defined as the \u201cintentional infliction of severe mental physical or physical pain and suffering by a public official, a person acting in an official capacity, or by a person acting with the consent or acquiescence of a public official.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 483 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Findings of fact made by the IJ will be upheld to the extent that they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1. Under this deferential standard, we may reverse only if we conclude \u201cthat the evidence not only <em>supports </em>[the opposite] conclusion but <em>compels </em>it.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 481 n. 1 (emphasis in text).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">It is this standard of review that dictates the outcome of this case. The BIA concluded that a preponderance of the evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that country conditions in the Ukraine had changed, making Anisovich\u2019s fear of future persecution at the hands of the Government no longer well-founded. There is evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that country conditions have changed in the Ukraine because the Government is no longer condoning anti-Semitism. As noted in the Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2000, the judiciary has begun to award religious property restitution to the Jewish community in Kiev and the Ukrainian central government actively discourages anti-Semitism by, for example, prosecuting publishers for the dissemination of anti-Semitic material.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">As the IJ pointed out in his oral opinion, there is also evidence to support Anisovich\u2019s argument that anti-Semitism is alive and well in the Ukraine: ultra-nationalist groups regularly publish anti-Semitic materials, and acts of anti-Semitism have declined in recent years but do continue to occur. Yet, as the IJ noted, there was no evidence that the Government currently tolerated the persecution of Jews. And, as publishers who do disseminate anti-Semitic materials are being prosecuted, there is no evidence that the Government is unable or unwilling to control those groups that are committing anti-Semitic acts. <em>Gao, </em>299 F.3d at 272 (persecution must occur at hands of government or by forces government is unable or unwilling to control).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Under the deferential <em>Elias-Zacarias </em>standard of review, it is not enough that there is some evidence to support Anisovich\u2019s claims. Rather, we may only reverse \u201cif a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Chang, </em>119 F.3d at 1060. We cannot say, on this record, that a reasonable fact-finder could not conclude that country conditions have changed. Nor has Anisovich met his burden of demonstrating that he has a reasonable fear of future persecution from a new source. As a result, we must affirm the decision of the BIA that Anisovich does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Inasmuch as we affirm this conclusion, we also affirm the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Anisovich is not entitled to withholding of removal either under the INA or under CAT. Thus, we dismiss Anisovich\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-13\">. As a result of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002), the INS has ceased to exist as an agency within the Department of Justice and its enforcement functions have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b109-10\">.
