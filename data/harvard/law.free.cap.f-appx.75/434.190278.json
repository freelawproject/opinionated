The parties have expressly waived oral argument. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">Julio Garcia received a social visit while he was an inmate in the Federal Correctional Institution in Memphis, Tennessee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>After the visit, corrections officers searched Garcia and found twelve small balloons in his shoe. The balloons contained 6.9 grams of cocaine and 4.3 grams of heroin. Garcia subsequently pleaded guilty to both counts of a two-count indictment. The district court arrived at Garcia\u2019s sentence, in pertinent part, by adding two points to Garcia\u2019s criminal history score pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d), and one point pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(e). The district court sentenced Garcia to twenty-four months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release. Garcia appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In his timely appeal, Garcia contends that: 1) the assessment of two criminal history points pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and one criminal history point pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(e), constitutes impermissible double counting; 2) the district court erred in not departing downward under \u00a7 4A1.3; and 3) the district court erred in not departing downward under \u00a7 5K2.0.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the application of the guidelines. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>272 F.3d 812, 815 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 756 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not err in assessing Garcia two criminal history points pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and one criminal history point pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(e). Impermissible double counting occurs when \u201cprecisely the same aspect of a defendant\u2019s conduct factors into his sentence in two separate ways.\u201d <em>United States v. Farrow, </em>198 F.3d 179, 193 (6th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>89 F.3d 303, 310 (6th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The enhancements to Garcia\u2019s criminal history score pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(d) and (e) do not derive from the same conduct. The \u00a7 4Al.l(d) increase is based on Garcia being under a criminal justice sentence at the time of the offense, and the \u00a7 4Al.l(e) increase is based on Garcia\u2019s incarceration at the time of the offense. Though imprisonment may be the typical way to serve a criminal justice sentence and is specifically enumerated in \u00a7 4Al.l(d), it is not the only way to be under a criminal justice sentence. As \u00a7 4Al.l(d) provides, a person may be under a criminal justice sentence if he is on probation, parole, supervised release, work release, or escape status. The Guidelines definition of \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d provides that there may be other ways to serve a criminal justice sentence so long as there is a certain custodial or supervisory component. USSG \u00a7 4A1.1, comment, (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Moreover, not all instances of double counting are impermissible. Double counting is permitted when \u201cit appears that Congress or the Sentencing Commission intended to attach multiple penalties to the same conduct.\u201d <em>Farrow, </em>198 F.3d at 194. The Sentencing Guidelines take the double-counting argument into account by providing for only one point under \u00a7 4Al.l(e) when two points are added under subsection (d). <em>See United States v. Frieberger, </em>28 F.3d 916, 920 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">Garcia\u2019s second and third arguments on appeal are not cognizable. He contends that the district court erred in not departing downward under \u00a7 4A1.3. and erred in not departing downward under \u00a7 5K2.0. A district court\u2019s failure to depart downward is not cognizable on appeal when the guideline range is properly computed, the court is aware of its discretion to depart downward, and the sentence does not violate the Guidelines or federal law. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>225 F.3d 637, 643 (6th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Pickett, </em>941 F.2d 411, 417 (6th Cir.1991). In the absence of ambiguous statements by the district court concerning its discretion, there is a presumption that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>was aware of the law it was called upon to apply, <em>United States v. Russell, </em>870 F.2d 18, 20 (1st Cir.1989), and it should be assumed that the court, in the exercise of its discretion, found the downward departure unwarranted. <em>See United States v. Byrd, </em>53 F.3d 144, 145 (6th Cir.1995). Nothing in the record remotely suggests that the district court incorrectly believed that it could not exercise its discretion to depart under the guidelines. In fact, the record is not ambiguous and reveals that the district court fully understood that it had the power to depart and denied the motions based on the facts and not on the ground that it lacked authority to depart. Accordingly, this court lacks jurisdiction to review these issues. <em>See Moore, </em>225 F.3d at 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
