Cisse contends that the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures do not provide a basis for judicial review. This issue is foreclosed by <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-22\">Cisse contends that his asylum application should have been granted. He argues that his fear of persecution was reasonable because he had opposed the Senegalese government and because the government knew of his opposition. Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, this court must review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). This court will uphold the IJ\u2019s determination that Cisse is not eligible for asylum if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002). The substantial evidence standard requires only that the IJ\u2019s \u201cconclusion be based upon the evidence presented and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To reverse the IJ\u2019s determination that Cisse is not eligible for asylum, \u201cthe evidence must compel a reasonable fact-finder to conclude that [he] suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir.2002). The BIA has the discretion to determine whether the evidence presented is sufficient to warrant a grant of asylum in a particular case. <em>See id.; see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-23\">After careful review of the briefs and the administrative record, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s finding that Cisse\u2019s testimony was not credible because of inconsistencies between Cisse\u2019s two asylum applications is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Cisse had failed to make an adequate showing of past perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>cution and of fear of future persecution is also supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Cisse contends that the BIA should not have cut three months from the voluntary departure period. This court lacks jurisdiction to review claims for discretionary relief, including claims regarding voluntary departure. <em>Eyoum v. INS, </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b329-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
