The Bissells contend, on appeal, that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the appellees and in denying the Bissells an adequate opportunity to take discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-20\">Grants of summary judgment, which we review de novo, are appropriate where, \u201cafter adequate time for discovery and upon motion,\u201d a party \u201cfails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The district court concluded that summary judgment was warranted here because the only evidence the Bissells have to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>their claim is their own belief, via sworn affidavits, that Jay Deist and Kim West Deist (\u201cthe Deists\u201d) were responsible for incursions against their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Summary judgment is not justified, however, where the claimants have presented direct evidence, in the form of sworn eyewitness accounts, of a central fact in dispute. <em>See McLaughlin v. Liu, </em>849 F.2d 1205, 1208 (9th Cir.1988). Although the Bissells\u2019 account of the facts may appear on its face to be unlikely, their claims are not altogether implausible, even when viewed against the direct evidence submitted by the Deists. This case presents a classic instance of disputed facts. The only way to rule in favor of the federal appellees at this stage is to disregard the eyewitness and other testimony provided by the Deists. By discounting the Bissells\u2019 direct evidence, the district court improperly weighed the evidence in favor of the appellees. <em>See Bui v. AT &amp; T, </em>310 F.3d 1143, 1153 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\u201cBroad discretion is vested in the trial court to permit or deny discovery, and its decision to deny discovery will not be disturbed except upon the clearest showing that denial of discovery results in actual and substantial prejudice to the complaining litigant.\u201d <em>Goehring v. Brophy, </em>94 F.3d 1294, 1305 (9th Cir.1996) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The Bissells have not demonstrated that any of the discovery they were denied would have tended to prove that the Deists were on the Bissells\u2019 property on the nights in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED. Appellants Maureen and Alan Bissell are awarded costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b703-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b704-7\">BREYER, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">BREYER, District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that summary judgment is inappropriate if there is genuine dispute of material fact; I simply disagree with the majority\u2019s characterization of the allegations in this case as merely \u201cunlikely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">We have repeatedly held that \u201cif the factual context makes the non-moving party\u2019s claim <em>implausible, </em>that party must come forward with more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be necessary to show that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>California Architectural Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Franciscan Ceramics, Inc., </em>818 F.2d 1466, 1468 (9th Cir.1987) (emphasis in original). I find the factual context in this case \u2014 that is, the Bissells\u2019 version of events \u2014 utterly implausible. They accuse the Deists of participating in a bizarre several months-long campaign of harassment at the Bissells\u2019 home: entering the Bissells\u2019 property in the middle of the night to shine green infrared illuminators on their home; wielding a high-powered spotlight on their driveway; and driving on their private road in the middle of the night in a car bearing a California license plate. Moreover, they have not identified any evidence that plausibly explains why these two particular Forest Service employees would engage in such strange behavior. Although the Bissells\u2019 allegations are not factually impossible, they are highly improbable; thus, in order to place this case before a jury they had to \u201cpresent more persuasive evidence than would otherwise be necessary\u201d in order to survive summary judgment. <em>California Achitectural Bldg. Prods., Inc., </em>818 F.2d at 1468; <em>see also In re Chavin, </em>150 F.3d 726, 728-29 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that the <em>Matsushita </em>rule requiring a heightened burden for implausible claims is not limited to claims of \u201cphysical impossibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>I believe that the Bissells\u2019 affidavits do not satisfy their heightened burden. All we have is the Bissells\u2019 uncorroborated assertions that they saw the Deists on their property. While such testimony might be sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact in many instances, given the utter implausibility of the Bissells\u2019 claims I do not believe it is sufficient in this case. In order to force appellees to a trial before a jury, and \u201cthe attendant ... consumption of public and private resources,\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 327, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986), the Bis-sells would at least have to offer evidence as to how they made their identifications: how they knew what the Deists looked like, the appearance of the persons they observed on their property, and how they were able to make their observations at night on their isolated property. The majority\u2019s holding may mean that a private citizen can always force any government official to trial by simply asserting that he saw the official on his property no matter how implausible the allegation. I believe that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 is not so ineffectual as to mandate such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">I also do not believe that the district court impermissibly weighed the parties\u2019 evidence. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 242-43, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (\u201c[A]t the summary judgment stage the judge\u2019s function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d). The trial court\u2019s decision rested not on whether he believed the Deists\u2019 evidence over the Bissells\u2019 evidence; rather, in light of the implausibility of the Bissells\u2019 claims (before even considering the Deists\u2019 unequivocal denials), and the paucity and quality of the evidence in support of those claims, no fair-minded jury could reasonably find in favor of the Bis-sells. <em>See id. </em>at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. To put it another way, the Bissells\u2019 uncorroborated \u201cidentification\u201d does not <em>reasonably </em>support an inference that the Deists spent several evenings terrorizing the Bissells with sophisticated high-tech equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
