We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Hernandez contends the district court erred by failing to suppress his confession as the fruit of an unlawful arrest. We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>215 F.3d 1020,1025 (9th Cir.2000). We need not reach the issue of whether Hernandez was unlawfully arrested because probable cause was independently established prior to any questioning. Accordingly, Hernandez\u2019s statement was not the fruit of an illegal arrest, and the district court did not erroneously deny the motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Manuel, </em>706 F.2d 908, 911-12 (9th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Hernandez also contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952 and 960 are unconstitutional pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Our holdings in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir.) (\u00a7 841), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1105, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.) (\u00a7 960), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1038, 123 S.Ct. 573, 154 L.Ed.2d 459 (2002) and <em>United States v. Varela</em>-Rivera, 279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 952) foreclose this argument. <em>See also United States v. Hernandez, </em>322 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002) does not overrule <em>Buckland </em>or Mendoza-Paz).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">In the alternative, Hernandez contends that the government was required to allege in the indictment, present to the grand jury, and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hernandez knew the type and quantity of controlled substance he was alleged to have imported. We rejected this contention in <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1037, 123 S.Ct. 572, 154 L.Ed.2d 458 (2002), and do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
