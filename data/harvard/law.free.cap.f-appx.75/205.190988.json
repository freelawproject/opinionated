The district court sentenced Logan to 165 months\u2019 imprisonment. The sole issue Logan raises on appeal is whether the trial court erred when it allowed testimony concerning his prior drug trafficking activities under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">We review the district court\u2019s admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997). In order to be admissible: \u201c(1) the prior-act evidence must be relevant to an issue other than character, such as intent; (2) it must be necessary to prove an element of the crime charged; (3) it must be reliable; and (4) as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 403, its probative value must not be \u2018substantially outweighed\u2019 by its prejudicial nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs and conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Travis Knight\u2019s testimony about prior drug-related conversations between Logan and him. We also find no abuse of discretion in the admission of Joe White\u2019s testimony that he had engaged in occasional drug deals with Logan over a six-month period up to February 2002. The evidence of Logan\u2019s similar, prior drug-related activities was admissible in order to prove Logan\u2019s motive and intent. Accordingly, we affirm Logan\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
