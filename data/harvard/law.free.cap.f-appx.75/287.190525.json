Rivera, Louisiana prisoner # 121787, appeals the 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, in which he alleges that a detective altered documents in order to bolster a criminal charge against him. The complaint was dismissed as frivolous and for failure to state a claim because it was time-barred. \u201cWhere it is <em>clear </em>from the face of a complaint filed <em>informa pauperis </em>that the claims asserted are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, those claims are properly dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Wyatt, </em>157 F.3d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.1998) (emphasis added). Rivera contends an action he timely filed in state court is still pending and tolled the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The applicable limitations (prescriptive period) for a \u00a7 1983 claim in Louisiana is one year. La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3492; <em>Elzy v. Roberson, </em>868 F.2d 793, 794-95 (5th Cir.1989). Rivera\u2019s action accrued when he knew, or had reason to know, of the injury or damages which forms the basis of his action. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>51 F.3d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, because Rivera\u2019s complaint states he discovered the altered documents before his release from jail on 27 August 2000, his claim accrued, at the latest, on that date. Absent tolling of the one-year limitations period, his complaint is time-barred. <em>See, e.g., Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>996 F.2d 786, 788 (5th Cir.1993) (in \u00a7 1983 action, federal courts borrow state law for tolling provisions).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">Under Louisiana law, the pendency of an action can interrupt the limitations period. <em>See New York Life Ins. Co. v. Deshotel, </em>142 F.3d 873, 883 (5th Cir.1998); La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3462 <em>&amp; </em>3463. According to Rivera, the instant action contains \u201cthe same plaintiff, the same defendants, and the same incident complained of in his state suit\u201d, which is still pending. He also claims that his state action was filed on 22 August 2001, which was less than one year from the latest date Rivera knew of the altered documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">Consequently, it is <em>not clear </em>from the face of Rivera\u2019s complaint that this action is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-17\">\n<em>VACATED; REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
