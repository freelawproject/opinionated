Mapp fears that the order will be interpreted to require him to pay restitution for the full amount of the victim\u2019s loss regardless of amounts paid by his coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The government responds to Mapp\u2019s argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-11\">Although the record of Mapp\u2019s case does not explicitly set forth that the restitution obligation was to be joint and several with his other co-defendants, it is clear from an examination of the criminal judgment entered in the co-defendant\u2019s case that it was the intent of the District Court to make Mapp\u2019s restitution obligation of $211,000 joint and several with that of his co-defendants, Nathaniel Williams, William Alan, Rhonda Kersey and Clifton Anthony Reeves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARy\">Brief for Appellee at 13. Accordingly, the government concedes that a remand for clarification of the scope of the restitution order is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">For these reasons, the judgment of the District Court is vacated insofar as it requires the appellants to pay restitution, and the case is remanded for the entry of a new order of restitution that addresses the question of joint and several liability.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
