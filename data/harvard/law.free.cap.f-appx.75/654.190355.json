The Growers also sued the Commodity Credit Corporation (\u201cCCC\u201d), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture, seeking a declaration that their liens are superior to those of the CCC. The district court granted the CCC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Growers appeal, arguing that the CCC\u2019s liens are not superior to their liens and that the CCC failed to obtain adequate assurances from the PNSC that the PNSC would pay certain amounts to the Growers. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. The parties are familiar with the facts of this case and we refer to them only as necessary in this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">1. Superiority of Liens</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that this case is governed by federal law, not state law, because the lien priority of a federal lending program is at issue. <em>See United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 726, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">This case requires us to interpret 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d) and determine whether it gives the CCC a super-priority lien on refined sugar and the proceeds from that sugar. In performing statutory interpretation, we begin with the language of the statute. <em>Duncan v. Walker, </em>533 U.S. 167, 172, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001). We must give effect to every word in the statute, if possible, so as not to treat words as surplusage. <em>Id. </em>at 174. We construe a statute to avoid an absurd re-suit. <em>In re County of Orange, </em>262 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2001). We strive to avoid interpreting a statute in such a way that renders the statute unconstitutional. <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 464, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">Using the text of the statute as our starting point, we hold that its plain meaning is dispositive in favor of the CCC. The text of \u00a7 7284(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-11\">A security interest obtained by the Commodity Credit Corporation as a result of the execution of a security agreement by the processor of sugarcane or sugar beets shall be superior to all statutory and common law liens on raw cane sugar and refined beet sugar in favor of the producers of sugarcane and sugar beets and all pri- or recorded and unrecorded liens on the crops of sugarcane and sugar beets from which the sugar was derived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d). The Growers advance many arguments to the contrary. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">The Growers first argue that the text of the statute supports their conclusion. They contend that because the word \u201cpri- or\u201d is used with only crop liens, and not with refined sugar liens, a super-priority lien is created only as to crop liens. They argue that CCC liens trump producer liens in the refined sugar only if the producer liens arise after the CCC liens. The Growers argue that to interpret the statute differently is to render the word \u201cpri- or\u201d surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Despite the Growers\u2019 argument, the word \u201cprior\u201d is not rendered surplusage. The word \u201cprior\u201d is descriptive of liens on crops, which Congress may have presumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>would typically <em>arise prior to liens in </em>refined sugar. Although the word \u201cprior\u201d does not have significant legal effect, it is not rendered completely useless. Indeed, the fact that the word \u201cprior\u201d does not add much to the statute is consistent with other language in the statute that, while descriptive, is not entirely necessary. For example, the statute refers to \u201call statutory and common law liens\u201d where it could just say \u201call liens\u201d and it refers to \u201call prior recorded and unrecorded liens\u201d where it could just say \u201call prior liens.\u201d The -use of the word \u201cprior\u201d in describing crop liens is not sufficient to support the negative inference that the Growers would have us draw from the word\u2019s absence in the description of the refined sugar liens. The Growers\u2019 textual argument effectively requires the addition of the word \u201csubsequent\u201d to the description of the CCC\u2019s liens\u2019 superiority over refined sugar liens, so that the CCC\u2019s liens would be superior only to \u201call <em>[subsequent </em>] statutory and common law liens on ... refined beet sugar in favor of the producers of ... sugar beets.\u201d But the statute does not contain the word \u201csubsequent,\u201d and we decline to add it.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Growers also argue that the CCC\u2019s super-priority lien works a hardship on them and thus conflicts with the CCC\u2019s statutory mandate to stabilize, support and protect farm income. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714. They also argue that when Congress suspended the CCC\u2019s direct price support authority for producers, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301(b)(1) (suspending 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1421 until 2002), they were left with little protection. But Congress is free to adjust this statutory scheme so as to provide greater protection to the CCC, which in turn benefits growers and processors alike because without CCC support, there is the risk that processing will cease and result in a total loss of crops. The Growers must turn to Congress to address their concerns, not the courts, as Congress is the body responsible for establishing this statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The Growers further argue that the CCC\u2019s own contracts and regulations suggest that the CCC does not have a super-priority lien on the refined sugar. The Growers point to the \u201cNotification of CCC\u2019s Security Interest,\u201d which states that where the CCC fails to obtain a lien waiver \u201cfrom a superior lienholder,\u201d it will be subject to that lien \u201cif ... the lien is established to be legally superior to CCC\u2019s interest.\u201d The Growers also focus on 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(b) (2000), which states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar pledged as collateral for a loan, the processor must obtain waivers that fully protect CCC\u2019s interest even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances shall be placed on the sugar after the loan is approved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(b) (2000). Contrary to the Growers\u2019 argument, however, the Notification and the regulation do not imply that the CCC does not have a super-priority lien. Rather, the Notification is expressly limited to situations where the CCC is determined to have an inferior interest. By its statement, the CCC is merely protecting other lienholders should a court determine that the CCC\u2019s lien is somehow inferior to that of another lien-holder. But there is no basis for holding that the CCC\u2019s liens in the present case are inferior. As for the regulation, it simply reduces the risk that the CCC will have to defend against claims from other lienholders. It also makes the collateral taken by the CCC more marketable by reducing encumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">The Growers next argue that interpreting 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d) against their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>favor will present the risk of a Fifth Amendment taking, and that we should therefore adhere to their interpretation. This argument is devoid of merit. The Growers fail to show that there is a complete taking of their property that might pose a takings problem under <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, </em>505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 (1992). The Growers\u2019 liens were not extinguished; they merely became inferior to the CCC\u2019s liens. The Growers also fail to show that there has been a substantial frustration of their reasonable investment backed expectations that might risk a takings problem under <em>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York, </em>438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). In fact, the CCC\u2019s ability to obtain a super-priority lien places it in a better position to bail out processors, which in turn will become better able to pay producers.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The parties disagree as to the helpfulness of two out-of-circuit cases in resolving the present dispute: the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Montana v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 1269 (Fed.Cir.1997), and the Fifth\u2019s Circuit decision in <em>United States v. Scottsbluff National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>902 F.2d 351 (5th Cir.1990). Neither case is on point. In <em>Montana, </em>the state\u2019s interest was acquired after the CCC\u2019s hens, not before them. 124 F.3d at 1271, 1275-76. As for <em>Scottsblujf, </em>although it predated the statute at issue in this case, a nearly identical provision, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1425(b), was in effect. Nonetheless, the <em>Scottsblujf </em>case made no mention of the statute in its opinion and consequently sheds no light on the issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Finally, the Growers argue that if we rely on the statute\u2019s plain language in recognizing super-priority hens in favor of the CCC in the refined sugar, then we must also adhere to the plain language and determine that there is no coverage for the proceeds from that sugar. They point out that 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d) does not refer to the proceeds of refined sugar. The Growers cite no authority, however, for the proposition that we are bound to use only one mode of exegesis while performing statutory interpretation. And, as the CCC correctly argues, reading the statute not to apply to the proceeds of the sugar would produce the absurd result of nullifying the value of the CCC\u2019s hens. By contrast, such a concern with an absurd result is not presented in the analysis of the superiority of the CCC\u2019s hens in the refined sugar.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">2. Adequate Assurances Requirement</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The Secretary of Agriculture is required to obtain adequate assurances from processors who receive CCC loans that they will pay certain amounts to producers. 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7272(e)(2)(A) (formerly \u00a7 7272(e)(2)) (West Supp.2003). The Growers contend that such assurances were not provided in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The language of the statute leaves the determination of adequacy to the Secretary. As the CCC points out, the regulations pertaining to CCC loans state that \u201c[n]onrecourse loan recipients shah pay ah eligible producers who have delivered or will dehver sugar beets or sugarcane to such processor for processing not less than the minimum payment levels CCC specifies.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.106(c) (2000). This being the case, the Growers\u2019 hardship is attributable to the PNSC\u2019s execution of a security interest in favor of the CCC, not the CCC\u2019s acceptance of that interest. At any rate, although we recognize the hardship suffered by the Growers, we note that if not for the CCC\u2019s loans to the PNSC, the PNSC may very well have been unable to process the Growers\u2019 crops, resulting in a complete loss of all remaining unprocessed crops.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b689-5\">BETTY B. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9OE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">I respectfully dissent. In enacting 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d) Congress intended to give priority to those security interests that the CCC <em>properly </em>perfected. Here the CCC failed to follow its own regulations in the administration of the loans it made to PNSC, as well as congressional enactments intended to protect sugar growers. Were it not for these failures, the CCC would not have made the loans at issue. No \u201csecurity interest\u201d in the sugar at issue was created for the purposes of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d), and the CCC cannot now use that provision to remedy its own deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The authority of the CCC to make loans to entities like PNSC is not absolute. In the first instance, Congress has set forth certain requirements that must be met when the CCC makes loans to sugar processors. <em>See, e.g., </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7272(e)(2) (2000). In addition, and perhaps more importantly in this case, Congress has given the CCC (through the Secretary of Agriculture) the authority to set further requirements in the administration of these loans. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7281(d) (2000). Under this authority, the CCC has issued regulations which set eligibility requirements for sugar processors seeking loans and impose a variety of other requirements on those processors once the loans are made. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1435.104\u2014 1435.106 (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of these regulations requires that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">If there are any liens or encumbrances on sugar pledged as collateral for a loan, the processor must obtain waivers that fully protect CCC\u2019s interest even though the liens or encumbrances are satisfied from the loan proceeds. No additional liens or encumbrances shall be placed on the sugar after loan approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(b) (2001). The regulations also provide that \u201c[n]o loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar has actually been processed <em>and is otherwise established as being eligible to be pledged as loan collateral. </em>\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(c) (2001) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">In this case, the CCC failed to obtain any lien waivers from the sugar growers, as required by 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(b). The district court dismissed this issue by pointing to the language of \u00a7 1435.105(b), which mandates that the processor, not the CCC obtain the lien waivers. But while the literal language of that regulation places requirements on the processor, it is the CCC\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the regulations under which it operates the sugar loan program are followed. That responsibility is made clear by the next section of the regulation, which specifies that no loan proceeds may be disbursed until the sugar is \u201cestablished as being eligible to be pledged as loan collateral.\u201d 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(c) (2001). That section places an affirmative obligation on the CCC to ensure that the waivers are obtained <em>before </em>the loans are disbursed. In the instant case, the PNSC never obtained the appropriate waivers from the growers, and the sugar was therefore never eligible as collateral. It then follows that, pursuant to its own regulations, the CCC should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>not have disbursed the loan proceeds in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"AbTA\">Under the majority\u2019s reading of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d), none of this matters, however, since any liens obtained by the CCC, whether properly or not, would have priority over all others. Congress meant to protect the CCC\u2019s liens only when they had been properly perfected. This is consistent with the language in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d) and that of the CCC\u2019s regulations. If, as the majority asserts, \u00a7 7284(d) gives priority to the CCC\u2019s liens over any and all other liens on sugar, then there is no reason for the requirement in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1435.105(b) that the CCC obtain waivers to \u201cfully protect\u201d its interest. The CCC\u2019s interest would already be completely protected by \u00a7 7284(d) under the majority\u2019s reading.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, there is a dual purpose for the regulation: first, as its own language indicates, it is meant to protect the CCC\u2019s interest in case of litigation such as the instant one; but, more importantly, the regulation serves to give notice to growers and other lien holders that, by operation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d), their liens are to be subordinated to those of the CCC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable and consistent with congressional intent. We should defer to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The CCC\u2019s failure to ensure that waivers had been obtained from prior lienholders was not its only deficiency in this case. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7272(e)(2) requires the CCC to obtain \u201csuch assurances as the Secretary considers adequate\u201d to ensure that processors would provide payments to producers that are proportional to the value of the loan received by the processor for the sugar in question. In this case, the CCC contends, in essence, that it was taking PNSC\u2019s word that it would make such payments to sugar growers. Appellee Br. at 18-19. While the statute does give the CCC substantial leeway in determining what assurances are adequate, surely Congress did not intend to let the CCC simply take processors\u2019 word that it would make such payments. Some minimum level of oversight appears to be intended by this provision, and the CCC appears to have failed the sugar growers in this additional way.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">In the end, CCC seeks \u00a7 7284(d)\u2019s protection for loans that it should not have made in the first place since it never ensured that the proper waivers had been obtained. Congress certainly meant \u00a7 7284(d) to give priority to CCC\u2019s security interests, but only to give such protection when the CCC was administering the loan program properly. Since the sugar at issue here was never eligible as collateral in the first place, I would hold that the CCC never gained a \u201csecurity interest\u201d in that sugar, and that the CCC\u2019s \u201chens\u201d at issue here are therefore not protected by \u00a7 7284(d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\">. While there was some dispute as to when the CCC loans to PNSC were actually made, the district court below assumed for purposes of its decision that all of the loans had been made between December 4, 2000 and January 16, 2001. The pertinent regulations are therefore those in effect during that time period, even though these sections have since changed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. It should be noted that the regulations discussed here were finalized by the Department of Agriculture several months after Congress had enacted \u00a7 7284(d). <em>Compare </em>Implementations of the Farm Program Provisions of the 1996 Farm Bill, 61 Fed Reg. 37,544, 37,618 (July 18, 1996) <em>with </em>Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-127, 110 Stat. 888 (enacted April 4, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b690-11\">. This analysis also explains the CCC's statements in its \"Notification of CCC\u2019s Security Interest.\u201d That document states that \u201c[i]n the event that CCC has failed to obtain a lien waiver from a superior lienholder,\u201d it will be subject to that lien if \"the lien is established to be legally superior to CCC's interest.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s reading of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 7284(d), it would appear that no lien could ever be established as legally superior to that of the CCC.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
