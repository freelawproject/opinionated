Pierre, a Louisiana prisoner (#321310), challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his application to proceed <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal. The court had dismissed Pierre\u2019s <em>pro se, </em>IFP complaint, purportedly filed under federal criminal statutes, as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). By moving to proceed IFP on appeal, Pierre is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-24\">Pierre continues to urge that the defendants, a parish district judge, an assistant district attorney, and an indigent defender, be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 for conspiring to violate his constitutional rights. He does not seek monetary damages or any other civil relief, and he disavows any intention of seeking civil-rights relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. As the magistrate judge concluded, Pierre has no right to bring a private action under federal criminal statutes. <em>See Cort v. Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 79, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975); <em>Ali v. Shabazz, </em>No. 93-2495, 1993 WL 456323 (5th Cir. Oct.28, 1993) (unpublished); 5th Cir. R. 47.5.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-25\">Pierre has failed to show that his complaint presented nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>not taken in good faith. Pierre\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Pierre is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Pierre\u2019s conclusory motion or request for \u201cimmediate protection\u201d is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">IFP DENIED; MOTION FOR \u201cIMMEDIATE PROTECTION\u201d DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; THREE-STRIKES BAR WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
