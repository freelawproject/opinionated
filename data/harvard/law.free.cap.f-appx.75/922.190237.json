By moving for IFP, Miller is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP should not be granted on appeal because his appeal presents no nonfrivolous issues. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Miller\u2019s IFP \u201cmotion must be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-22\">Miller does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith (ie., his failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to file an amended complaint). Because Miller does not provide any analysis of this issue, he waives any appeal of it. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>300 F.3d 555, 558 n. 2 (5th Cir.2002); <em>American States Ins. Co. v. Bailey, </em>133 F.3d 363, 372 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-23\">Miller has not shown that the district court erred in certifying that an appeal would not be taken in good faith. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issues. Miller\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>Miller is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>108 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Before the instant notice of appeal was filed, Miller received two strikes in <em>Miller v. Price, </em>No. 9:01-CV-0290 (E.D.Tex. Oct. 21, 2002), and <em>Miller v. Keller, </em>No. 4:02-CV-1413 (S.D. Tex. April 23, 2002). After the notice of appeal was filed in this case, Miller received another strike in <em>Miller v. Medical Staff, </em>61 Fed.Appx. 917 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also Miller v. Hawkins, </em>No. 03-20144 (two strikes). Miller is cautioned that he has now accumulated more than three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">IFP MOTION DENIED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
