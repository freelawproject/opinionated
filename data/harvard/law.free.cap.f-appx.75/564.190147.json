Hodgson (Hodgson) sued defendants under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming they violated his First Amendment rights to free speech and access to the courts, and denied him due process, by issuing \u201cno-contact\u201d orders, without a hearing, which prohibited him from contacting various individuals he alleged had deprived him of property rights. Hodgson further alleged defendants retaliated against him for seeking legal redress by destroying or altering records verifying he had received a GED, thereby blocking him from receiving pay increases at his prison work assignment. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted defendants summary judgment on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">After de novo review, <em>see Owens v. Scott County Jail, </em>328 F.3d 1026, 1026 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (standard of review), we conclude summary judgment was appropriate for the reasons set forth in the thorough report and recommendation adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-12\">. The Honorable Joan N. Ericksen, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Susan Richard Nelson, United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
