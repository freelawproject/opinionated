Mistry argues that she has established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution if she were to return to India.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the evidence in the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302-04, 306 (5th Cir.1997); Abd<em>el-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.1996). Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-34\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
