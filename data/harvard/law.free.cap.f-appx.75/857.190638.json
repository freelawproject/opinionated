Other claims by Burbank, although addressed by appellees, are not raised in this appeal and are therefore deemed abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party, we conclude that Burbank\u2019s claims were properly dismissed on defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Burbank\u2019s five failures of the Connecticut bar exam and the mixed reviews from supervisors during his work as a paralegal for the OAG were sufficient for defendants to rebut any prima facie case of age or race discrimination Burbank might make. Burbank has not produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to determine that the proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for not hiring him were a pretext for discrimination. <em>See Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.1998); <em>Meiri v. Dacon, </em>759 F.2d 989, 998 (2d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The foregoing analysis, applicable to the federal discrimination claims under <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and its progeny, also applies to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Burbank\u2019s state-law CFEPA claims. <em>See Levy v. Comm\u2019n on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 96, 671 A.2d 349, 355 (Conn.1996). Summary judgment was therefore also proper as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
