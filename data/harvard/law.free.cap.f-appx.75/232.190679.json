(\u201cBlessey Marine\u201d), seeks our review of an interlocutory 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a) order transferring this case from the Eastern District of Louisiana to the Southern District of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-23\">We open by noting that this Court has generally disclaimed immediate appellate jurisdiction over the grant or denial of a motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a). <em>Louisiana Ice Cream Distributors v. Carvel Corp., </em>821 F.2d 1031, 1033 (5th Cir.1987) (citing <em>Matter of Macon Uplands Venture, </em>624 F.2d 26 (5th Cir.1980)); <em>see also Garner v. Wolfinbarger, </em>433 F.2d 117, 120 (5th Cir.1970) (concluding that \u00a7 1292(b) review is inappropriate for challenges to a judge\u2019s discretion in granting or denying transfers under \u00a7 1404(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-24\">Clearly the transfer order in the case at hand is not a final order appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Askanase v. Livingwell, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 807, 810 (5th Cir.1993). Furthermore, the transfer order is not within the class of interlocutory orders in admiralty cases subject to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(3). <em>See Francis ex rel. Francis v. Forest Oil Corp., </em>798 F.2d 147, 149-50 (5th Cir.1986). In addition - and contrary to Blessey Marine\u2019s eontentionthe transfer order is not appealable pursuant to the collateral order doctrine. <em>See Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 517-18 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Louisiana Ice Cream Distributors, </em>821 F.2d at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>This Circuit has, in some cases, recognized the availability of mandamus as a limited means to test the district court\u2019s discretion in issuing transfer orders. <em>See In re Horseshoe Entertainment, </em>337 F.3d 429 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Garner, </em>433 F.2d at 120. However, Blessey Marine has not requested that we treat its notice of appeal as anything other than what it is. <em>Coastal (Bermuda) Ltd. v. E.W. Saybolt &amp; Co., Inc., </em>761 F.2d 198, 203 (5th Cir.1985). We reserve writs of mandamus only for the most egregious of discretionary abuses, and where other avenues of relief have been traversed without success. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Other avenues of relief exist -including, significantly, the district court to which this case has been transferredvia which Blessey Marine can challenge the \u00a7 1404(a) transfer. Although circumstances under which a petition for mandamus might properly be filed and considered may yet develop, we currently lack jurisdiction over this appeal and it is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-18\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
