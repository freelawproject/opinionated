Baljit was sentenced to 24 months incarceration, three years of supervised release, $100 special assessment and restitution of $3,328,532.54. On appeal, Baljit challenges the factual basis for the jury\u2019s conviction and the propriety of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">In reviewing a challenge to a jury conviction based on insufficiency of the evidence, we must affirm the conviction if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that, from the inferences reasonably drawn, <em>\u201c\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>ed States v. Best, </em>219 F.3d 192, 200 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in <em>Jackson)). </em>\u201cIn reviewing a sentence imposed under the Guidelines, we may not overturn the district court\u2019s findings of fact \u2018unless they are clearly erroneous,\u2019 and we must give \u2018due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>334 F.3d 170, 188 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Baljit argues that the evidence against him was insufficient to support a finding of the requisite intent under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 501 and 502, because each piece of evidence, considered individually, was subject to an innocent explanation. Nevertheless, \u2018Viewing the evidence in its totality and in the light most favorable to the Government,\u201d <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>312 F.3d 58, 69 (2d Cir.2002), it is clear that a reasonable jury could infer that Baljit possessed the requisite criminal intent to commit postage meter fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Under this standard, the evidence showed that Baljit had reason to know that the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) was not being paid for the postage dispensed by the malfunctioning postage meters. For example, the evidence showed that Baljit was employed as a meter room supervisor for American Presort, Inc. (\u201cAPI\u201d), a bulk mail company, where he was responsible for tracking the postage dispensed by all of the meters. Baljit\u2019s supervisor, Leonard Taylor, testified that Baljit informed him, in an \u201c[ejxcited\u201d manner, that one of the postage meters had malfunctioned and was dispensing free postage. Taylor further testified that, per his instruction, Baljit created and maintained a separate account of the free postage generated by the malfunctioning meter in order to bill customers for the \u201cfree dollar\u201d of postage. Moreover, Baljit worked the night shift, when the bulk of API\u2019s mail was metered. Postal Inspector Joseph McGinley testified that following the malfunctioning of one of the meters, the amount of mail processed on that meter increased dramatically from 76,000 to 600,000 pieces. On these facts, a reasonable jury could infer that Baljit knew that the machines were dispensing \u201cfree\u201d postage and that the USPS was not compensated for the postage dispensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Baljit argues that the district court erred in sentencing him to pay restitution for the loss accrued on both the day and night shifts when he worked only on the night shift. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B), a district court may consider the extent of the jointly undertaken criminal activity and the reasonable foreseeability of conduct undertaken by the defendant. Here, Baljit was responsible on a daily basis for reviewing and balancing the data entered into the logs tracking the postage dispensed by the malfunctioning meters during both the day and night shifts. He provided those logs to API\u2019s billing department so that customers could be billed for the \u201cfree\u201d postage. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Baljit was responsible for the entire loss of the malfunctioning meter at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Baljit\u2019s argument that the district court erred in increasing his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2)(A), requiring a two-level enhancement where an offense involves \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d is also unpersuasive. \u201c\u2018More than minimal planning1 is deemed present in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\u201d <em>United States v. Walsh, </em>119 F.3d 115, 119 (2d Cir.1997). On these facts, we do not find error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>district court\u2019s determination that a two-level enhancement was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
