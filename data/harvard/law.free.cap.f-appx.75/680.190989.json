We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">Petitioner\u2019s counsel was not deficient in failing to move for recusal of the trial judge. <em>See Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (setting forth two-part test for determining whether petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel). Counsel made a reasoned and reasonable tactical decision in advising Petitioner to have a bench trial and to do so before this judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Additionally, even if counsel\u2019s performance was somehow deficient, Petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice, the second part of the <em>Strickland </em>test. A recusal motion probably would not have been successful. The knowledge of Petitioner\u2019s initial wish to plead guilty was acquired in the judge\u2019s judicial capacity. <em>See United States v. Monaco, </em>852 F.2d 1143, 1147 (9th Cir.1988) (noting that a party cannot attack a judge\u2019s impartiality based on information learned while acting in the judge\u2019s official capacity). Moreover, there is no evidence of a deep-seated antagonism that would have made fair judgment impossible. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b711-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
