For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-28\">Inasmuch as we are writing only for the parties who are familiar with the factual and procedural background of this case, we need not reiterate the facts except as may be helpful to our brief discussion. Polanco argues that the district court erred in sentencing him more severely than his equally culpable female partner and the district court\u2019s sentencing therefore constituted sex discrimination in violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-29\">The district court disagreed with Polanco\u2019s attempt to characterize himself and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>codefendant Burgos as equal partners with equal culpability and indistinguishable sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Although the district court conceded that Burgos and Polanco were partners, the court noted that it was Polanco who had access to the source of supply and who controlled the other persons involved in the conspiracy, including codefendant Bur-gos. The court stated, \u201cthis man is at the top ... everybody else worked for him.\u201d App. 136. The court noted that the codefendant \u201cwas an administrative leader here, but not sort of a chief executive officer. That\u2019s Mr. Polanco.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. Because of Polanco\u2019s position at the top of the conspiracy and his access to the illegal drugs that the conspiracy was selling, the court concluded that the conspiracy could not have existed without him. It may, however, have been able to exist without Burgos. Polanco \u201cwas a key to this conspiracy. [Burgos] was pretty helpful, but may be fungible.\u201d Defense counsel did not disagree with that assessment. On the contrary, counsel indicated his agreement with the court\u2019s factual conclusion during the sentencing procedures. Moreover, even now counsel does not seriously argue that the court erred in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Inasmuch as the court\u2019s conclusions adequately supported the difference in the sentences of Polanco and codefendant Bur-gos, and since that factual distinction was not clearly erroneous, it is clear that Polanco\u2019s belated attempt to hang an appeal on the constitutional hook of the Fifth Amendment is without merit. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
