His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asserting trial counsel was ineffective at sentencing for failing to object to prior criminal history used to classify Hill as a career offender; the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to Hill\u2019s base offense level for Hill\u2019s role as a leader and organizer in the conspiracy pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (2000); and the district court erred in sentencing Hill as a career offender pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. Hill was notified by his attorney of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief and has elected to do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-25\">We first address Hill\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>88 F.3d 1350, 1363 (4th Cir.1996). Unless ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cconclusively appears\u201d on the record, such claims should be raised collater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>ally and not on direct appeal. <em>Id. </em>We find that because ineffectiveness of counsel does not conclusively appear on the record, Hill\u2019s claims are more appropriately addressed in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion filed in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Next, we find no merit in Hill\u2019s claim that the district court erred in finding him to be a leader or organizer in the conspiracy pursuant to USSG \u00a7 BBl.l(a). We review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Perkins, </em>108 F.3d 512, 518 (4th Cir.1997). We conclude that the sentencing court did not err in adopting the presentence report\u2019s findings and denying Hill\u2019s arguments relating to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Finally, we are not persuaded by Hill\u2019s argument that he was improperly sentenced as a career offender. Since Hill did not object at sentencing, we review this claim for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We find that Hill meets all the criteria of USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 and was properly sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Hill\u2019s conviction and sentence. We reject the claims raised in Hill\u2019s pro se supplemental brief as meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
