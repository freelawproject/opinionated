He asserts that the district court erred in imposing restitution in a lump-sum amount reflecting the total amount of compensation benefits received by Bailey when the bill of information charged only that on or about August 2, 1998, he filed a false claim for which he received compensation benefits of less than $1000. He also contends that the district court plainly erred in imposing a special assessment greater than the $25 mandated by statute for class A misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Government concedes error in the amount of restitution. <em>See Hughey v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 411, 421, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990); <em>United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 437-38 (5th Cir.1998). The Government concedes plain error in the amount of the special assessment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013(a)(l)(A)(iii); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Because the sentence must be vacated and remanded for further proceedings on the amount of the restitution and for imposition of the correct special assessment, it is unnecessary to consider whether the district court erred in ordering a lump-sum restitution payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
