Thompson raises four issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Thompson first argues that the district court erred by admitting into evidence the recorded conversation between himself and attorney Bill May because it was obtained (1) in violation of the attorney-client privilege and (2) by outrageous government conduct. The district court found that Thompson did not meet his burden of establishing that the conversation between Thompson and May was privileged, since Thompson did not prove that he communicated with May in confidence or that his primary purpose was to obtain legal advice. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>121 F.3d 971, 974 (5th Cir.1997). This conclusion was not clearly erroneous. We also find that the government\u2019s conduct did not approach a level sufficiently \u201coutrageous\u201d so as to violate Thompson\u2019s rights, especially in light of Thompson\u2019s active participation in the crime. <em>See United States v. Arteaga, </em>807 F.2d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.1986). Thus, we hold that the recorded conversation between Thompson and May was properly admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">Second, Thompson contends that there was insufficient evidence to permit a rational jury to find that he was predisposed to commit the crimes of which he was accused, and that, consequently, the district court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, see <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>247 F.3d 593, 596 (5th Cir.2001), we find that there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that Thompson was predisposed to commit the crimes of which he was convicted. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Thompson\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-11\">Third, Thompson argues that the district court should have given the jury an instruction on positional predisposition, as laid out in <em>United States v. Hollingsworth, </em>27 F.3d 1196 (7th Cir.1994). We need not decide whether we are persuaded by <em>Hollingsworth, </em>because assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we are, Thompson, an IRS agent, was clearly in a position to accept a bribe. <em>See Hollingsworth, </em>27 F.3d at 1200. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on positional predisposition. <em>See United States v. Reyes, </em>239 F.3d 722, 742 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-12\">Finally, Thompson claims that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(2) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a)(2) set out mutually exclusive offenses so that Thompson could not logically be convicted under both statutes. We join the Second Circuit in holding, however, that these statutes are not mutually exclusive. <em>See United States v. Umans, </em>368 F.2d 725, 728-29 (2d Cir.1966). Therefore, Thompson was properly convicted under both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(2) and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7214(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the defendant\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b974-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
