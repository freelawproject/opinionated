Leis-er contends on appeal that the district judge misapplied the governing law as to each of his claims; however, we see no error, and we therefore affirm for substantially the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Opinion and Order dated June 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
