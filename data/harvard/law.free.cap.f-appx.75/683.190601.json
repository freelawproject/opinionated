Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1992). The ALJ rejected Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s conclusions in his 1996 decision, as well as his conclusions in his 1998 decision, for several reasons described in her opinion and summarized in the district court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">We accept the district court\u2019s analysis of the weight to be accorded Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">Dr. Kurlycheck offered no rebuttal to the ALJ\u2019s conclusions that Thrush\u2019s extensive work history demonstrated he was not disabled and had not experienced episodes of decompensation and that the test scores did not support a finding of marked impairment in attention and concentration.... [T]he Appeals Council found no error in the ALJ\u2019s conclusions concerning Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s opinion [when the matter was first before them.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">^ &amp; \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">In his decision after remand, the ALJ gave another extensive and persuasive rationale for rejecting Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s conclusions. TR 26-38. He adopted the reasons he had articulated in his first written decision. TR 28-30. He demonstrated through clear evidence on the record that Thrush significantly exaggerated his medical history when describing it to Dr. Kurlychek. A physician\u2019s opinion of disability \u201cpremised to a large extent upon the claimant\u2019s own accounts of his symptoms and limitations may be disregarded when those complaints have been properly discounted.\u201d <em>Flaten v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>44 F.3d 1453, 1463-64 (9th Cir.1995).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">The ALJ gave a credible basis for believing Thrush overstated his present symptoms, as well, noting that Thrush complained of significant symptoms only when being examined by consultants in relation to benefits claims, but did not seek treatment for those symptoms or report them to treating sources. The ALJ pointed out the absence of any new objective findings to support Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s addition of pain syndrome to his diagnosis. He demonstrated that Thrush\u2019s record of intermittent conservative treatment did not support the presence of any significant pain syndrome, contrary to Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s finding. TR 26-38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">I find that the foregoing are specific, legitimate, clear and convincing reasons which are supported by substantial evidence in the record. The limitations stated in the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity determination fairly describe conclusions that reasonably can be drawn from Dr. Kurlychek\u2019s opinion in light of the record as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">ER 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">We also accept the district court\u2019s determination of the adequacy of the vocational testimony set forth in its opinion. ER 227-228. Appellant argues that the descriptions of occupations described by the vocational expert in the <em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles </em>(\u201cDOT\u201d) require frequent reaching, handling and fingering and that he cannot perform these tasks because of the limitations in his hands, and because he often experiences deficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace resulting in a failure to complete tasks in a timely manner. We are satisfied that the ALJ\u2019s vocational hypothetical accounted for such limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Appellant had the burden of establishing her entitlement to Social Security disability benefits. <em>Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1999). We review the decision of the district court <em>de novo </em>to ensure that there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Commissioner and that the decision is free of legal error. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Meanel, </em>172 F.3d at 1113. Substantial evidence \u201c\u2018means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). It is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance, <em>Jamerson v. Chater, </em>112 F.3d 1064, 1066 (9th Cir.1997), and \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence,\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). If the evidence can reasonably support either confirming or reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.1999). The Commissioner\u2019s findings must be upheld if they are supported by inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the record. <em>Gallant v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1450, 1452-1453 (9th Cir.1984). Even if the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion must be upheld. <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). If there is not evidence of malingering, and a claimant produces objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which would reasonably be expected to produce some degree of pain or other symptoms, the ALJ may reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of the alleged pain or other symptoms \u201cby offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281-1282 (citing <em>Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407-1408 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam)). \u201c \u2018The ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and for resolving\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.1995)); <em>Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>Allen v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 577, 580 n. 1 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Measuring this appeal with the foregoing legal precepts, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination and that the ALJ committed no legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">We have considered all the contentions presented by the parties and conclude that no further discussion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b713-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided for by Ninth Cir.
