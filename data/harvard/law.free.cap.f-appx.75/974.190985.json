Kang appeals the district court\u2019s grant of Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his employment discrimination and hostile work environment claims. For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">Since 1986, Kang has worked as a professor in the Department of Agronomy at Louisiana State University (\u201cLSU\u201d). In 1996, Kang filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), alleging that LSU had discriminated against him when it rejected his application to become Department Head of the Department of Agronomy. LSU selected another faculty member, a white man, for the position, and Kang believed he had been overlooked because he was of East Indian descent. On September 30, 1997, Kang filed a second claim with the EEOC, alleging that LSU retaliated against him after the filing of his first claim of discrimination. Shortly thereafter, he filed his first suit in district court, raising claims of discrimination and retaliation, but this suit was subsequently dismissed on summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-20\">On December 4, 2000, Kang filed the instant suit in district court. Kang claimed that he had been subjected to additional retaliation, complaining of five specific acts. First, in April 1999, he received a poor performance evaluation from Freddie Martin, the Head of the Department of Agronomy. Second, while he was out of the country on a lecturing assignment, he was \u201cwritten up\u201d by Appellee for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>\u201cunacceptable conditions\u201d in one of Ms research areas. Third, he received a less-than-average pay raise of 3% in July, 1999, making him the lowest paid professor in the department. Fourth, Appellee failed to nominate him for a teaching award, even though he had been nominated in previous years. Finally, the Department Head \u201cunfairly and unjustly\u201d criticized him at a faculty meeting on January 14, 2000 in front of his peers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">The district court concluded that Kang could not make out a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and granted summary judgment for Appellee because none of the acts Kang complained of constituted \u201cultimate employment acts.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find no fault in the district court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">To state a claim of retaliation under Title VII, plaintiff must demonstrate: \u201c(1) that she engaged in activity protected by Title VII, (2) that an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) that a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>we concluded that only \u201cultimate employment decisions\u201d \u2014 decisions relating to \u201chiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating\u201d \u2014 satisfy the second prong of this test.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To satisfy this standard, the action complained of must \u201chave more than a \u2018mere tangential effect on a possible future ultimate employment decision.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c \u2018interlocutory or mediate\u2019 decision[s] which can lead to an ultimate decision\u201d are insufficient to support a prima facie case of retaliation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">Under this standard, none of the actions that Appellant complains of, even if true,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> qualify as \u201cultimate employment decisions.\u201d Our decisions reject the proposition that Ms first complaint \u2014 that he received a poor performance evaluation\u2014 qualifies as an adverse employment decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, the other actions allegedly taken by Appellee \u2014 failing to nominate him for a teaching award, unjustly criticizing him in front of his peers at a faculty meeting, and writing him up for not keeping his research area clean \u2014 do not \u201cconstitute \u2018adverse employment actions\u2019 because of their lack of consequence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">Kang\u2019s final allegation, however, is a closer question. Kang claims that, in July 1999, he was given a less-than-average pay raise, causing him to be the lowest paid professor in his department. In <em>Fierros v. Texas Department of Health, </em>we explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>that a denial of a pay increase can be an \u201cultimate employment action,\u201d despite our suggestion in <em>Mattem </em>to the contrary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the present case, however, it is undisputed that Appellant did receive a pay raise and that his raise was both substantial and larger than that received by some of his colleagues.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although we have never explained precisely when denials of pay raises constitute ultimate employment decisions, under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that Kang has suffered an adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Appellant candidly admits that our prior decisions compel this conclusion. He argues, however, that our approach to Title VII retaliation cases is unduly restrictive and asks that we endorse the broader rule adopted in some other circuits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, we have ourselves noted that \u201cthe continuing vitality of the \u2018ultimate employment decision\u2019 doctrine is questionable in the light of\u2019 recent Supreme Court decisions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nonetheless, \u201c[i]t is well-established in this circuit that one panel of this Court may not overrule another\u201d unless the prior decision \u201c \u2018is overruled, expressly or implicitly, by either the United States Supreme Court or by the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we decline Kang\u2019s invitation to alter our approach to Title VII retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">In addition to his claim of retaliation, Kang contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claim that Appellee\u2019s actions created a \u201chostile work environment.\u201d To satisfy the requirements of a claim for hostile work environment, however, a plaintiff must demonstrate that an employer\u2019s discriminatory actions were \u201csufficiently severe or pervasive that they ... alter[ed] the conditions of employment and ... create[d] an abusive working environment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The actions that Kang complains of, while potentially inappropriate, do not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-13\">Because none of the actions on which Kang bases his retaliation claim rises to the level of an \u201cultimate employment decision,\u201d he has faded to make a prima facie showing of retaliation. He has also failed to demonstrate that the Appellee\u2019s actions were pervasive or severe enough to create a hostile work environment. For these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>reasons, the judgment of the district court below is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
