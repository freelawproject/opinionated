She also maintains \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that the district court abused its discretion by denying a minor-role reduction based on a personal, fixed policy of <em>always </em>denying such reductions to drug couriers. Insofar as Garcia directly challenges the denial of the reduction, the district court did not clearly err. <em>See United States v. Leal-Mendoza, </em>281 F.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir.2002). The court\u2019s having noted that Garcia was transporting a large quantity of drugs and that she had done so before were sufficient to support the denial. <em>See, e.g., id.; United States v. Marmolejo, </em>106 F.3d 1213, 1217 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Garcia\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s reliance on a personal \u201cfixed policy\u201d of denying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) reductions to all drag couriers is renewable for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The district court judge in the instant case stated he has \u201calways\u201d denied the reduction to drug couriers and \u201calways will continue to deny it.\u201d It is at least arguable that the district judge\u2019s explicit reliance on a personal policy of denying the minor-role reduction to all drug couriers is an improper abdication of the his judicial responsibility to address the individualized record of each defendant when imposing sentence. <em>See United States v. Hartford, </em>489 F.2d 652, 655 (5th Cir.1974); <em>United States v. Clements, </em>634 F.2d 183, 186-87 (5th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>33 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994). Nonetheless, under the plain-error standard, Garcia has established neither that any such error was \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d nor that her \u201csubstantial rights\u201d were affected thereby. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734 (substantial rights are affected only if error \u201caffects the outcome of the proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">For the first time on appeal, Garcia also maintains that the sentencing scheme of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As Garcia concedes, her argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Slaughter, </em>238 F.3d 580, 582 (5th Cir.2000). She raises the issue only to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
