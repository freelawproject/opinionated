He was sentenced to 192 months in prison. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In January 2002, four letters were mailed to various individuals in the Charleston, West Virginia, area. The addressees included a state circuit judge, the governor, and a federal district judge. A fifth letter was mailed to President Bush. The envelopes contained a white, powdery substance, cigarette butts, and a threatening letter. The return address area on the envelope contained the name \u201cGloria Fields.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Officers who interviewed Ms. Fields learned that she had sent Edward Lee Lewis some letters as she was ending a brief relationship with him. It appeared that the person who had sent the letters containing the powder had cut words from one or more letters that Fields had sent Lewis and photocopied them onto blank stationery of the type on which Fields\u2019 letters to Lewis were written.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Postal inspectors obtained an arrest warrant for Lewis. They executed the warrant and arrested him. Following the arrest, a postal inspector looked through the windows of Lewis\u2019 pickup truck, which was parked in the driveway of the residence where he was arrested. The postal inspector saw cigarette butts, a copy of the threatening letter that had been mailed, blue pages (government listings) from a telephone book, and a typewriter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">A search warrant for the truck was issued and executed. Officers retrieved from the truck two typewriters, an original letter that Fields had sent Lewis, with words cut out of it, matching stationery with the words, \u201cIf I were you I\u2019d change my attitude\u201d pasted on it, copies of that letter, a twelve-gauge shotgun, ammunition, and other incriminating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Prior to trial, Lewis moved to suppress the evidence seized from the truck. The district court denied the motion. A jury convicted him on all six counts, and he was sentenced as an armed career criminal to 192 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">Lewis first claims that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. We review the district court\u2019s factual findings on this issue for clear error and its legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). If a suppression motion was denied, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Here, we conclude that the postal inspector\u2019s observation of incriminating items through the windows of Lewis\u2019 truck did not constitute a \u201csearch\u201d protected by the Fourth Amendment. \u201c[A] \u2018search\u2019 occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable is infringed.\u201d <em>United States v. Breza, </em>308 F.3d 430, 433 (4th Cir.2002). The central question is whether the defendant \u201c \u2018manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search\u2019 and whether \u2018society [is] willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>90 F.3d 903, 908 (4th Cir.1996) <em>(quoting California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986)). In <em>Taylor, </em>we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-14\">[W]hat a person knowingly exposes to the public ... is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection____Thus, a law enforcement officer\u2019s observations from a public vantage point where he has a right to be and from which the activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>or objects he observes are clearly visible do not constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\"><em>Taylor, </em>90 F.3d at 908 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Here, Lewis\u2019 truck was parked feet from a public road, and anyone who walked into the driveway could have observed the contents of the truck. There had been no attempt to conceal the truck or its contents. The postal inspectors had a right to be on the property. We conclude that the observation of unobscured items through the window of Lewis\u2019 pickup truck did not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment. Thus, the district court properly denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Lewis contends that he was erroneously sentenced as an armed career criminal. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). He concedes that he pleaded guilty in 1999 to three counts of daytime burglary. The offenses occurred on different days and involved different residences and victims. Thus, we reject his claim that the three convictions should have been treated as a single offense. <em>See United States v. Hobbs, </em>136 F.3d 384, 387-89 (4th Cir.1998). Furthermore, the definition of daytime burglary in West Virginia, <em>see </em>W. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 61 \u2014 3 \u2014 11(a)\u2014(b) (Michie 2000), satisfies the generic definition of burglary because it has as elements the unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building with the intent to commit a crime. As such, the burglaries qualify as violent felonies for armed career criminal status. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599-602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Because Lewis had three previous convictions for violent felonies, we find that he was properly sentenced under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">We therefore affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
