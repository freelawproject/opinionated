Smith asserts that this term of incarceration exceeds the statutory maximum established by the classification of his offense. Finding no error, we affirm. Smith pled guilty in 1999 to aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute of an unspecified quantify of cocaine base and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000). The district court imposed a thirty-seven month custodial sentence followed by four years of supervised release. However, following Smith\u2019s initial release in 2001, he violated the terms of that supervised release, for which the district court imposed a term of thirty-six months\u2019 incarceration. Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Smith alleges the thirty-six months\u2019 incarceration the district court imposed exceeds the maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment authorized for violations of a term of supervised release imposed as punishment for a Class C felony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Smith\u2019s challenge incorrectly asserts he was originally sentenced for committing a Class C felony. Because the count of Smith\u2019s indictment to which he pled guilty did not charge quantity, Smith contends that only a sentence in accordance with \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which is a Class C felony, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (2000), was proper. Smith\u2019s written plea agreement, however, clearly contemplated his sentencing for the Class B felony described in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), as it noted a potential term of incarceration of five to forty years and a supervised release term of five years. Further, the presentence report, to which no objections were filed, indicates a sufficient factual basis to support a sentence in accordance with \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Hence, because felonies are classified by the relevant statutory maximum rather than the actual sentence imposed, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>922 F.2d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir.1991), and Smith\u2019s guilty plea subjected him to a potential sentence of five to forty years\u2019 incarceration, the district court\u2019s imposition of a thirty-six-month sentence following Smith\u2019s revocation of his supervised release was proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b950-7\"> Further, although we do not decide the issue today, we note several recent decisions indicating that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to the revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greene, </em>206 F.Supp.2d 811, 813-14 (S.D.W.Va.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
