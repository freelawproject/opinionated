Neal sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, both compensatory and punitive, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for alleged violations of his constitutional rights and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) of 2000, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l et seq. He argues that the prison denied him access to the following religious publications: <em>The United States and Britain in Bible Prophecy; Judah\u2019s Sceptre and Joseph\u2019s Birthright; God\u2019s Covenant People; The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number><em>Lost Chapter of Acts of the Apostles; God\u2019s Law; Heirs of the Promise; The Restitution of All Things; The Iron Curtain over America; Eve: Did She or Didn\u2019t She?; The Abrahamic Covenant; Standing on the Shoulders of Giants; Mark of the Beast, Part One; Mark of the Beast, Part Two; Spiritual Israel; The Sacred Names of God; Could You be an Israelite and not Know it?; Yah\u2019s Laws: Are They for Today: </em>and <em>Baptism by the Scriptures.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Prisoners retain those First Amendment rights that are consistent with their status as prisoners or with the legitimate penological objectives of the prison. <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 523, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). A prison regulation may validly restrict, however, material advocating racial hatred on-the basis that it causes a serious danger of violence. <em>Chriceol v. Phillips, </em>169 F.3d 313, 316 (5th Cir.1999). The RLUIPA declares that institutions receiving federal financial assistance may not \u201cimpose a substantial burden on the religious exercise\u201d of an institutionalized person unless it is the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of furthering \u201ca compelling governmental interest.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">As Neal is no longer in the Denton County Jail, his claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001). Neal\u2019s claims for monetary relief remain, however, and, on this record, it appears that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Neal\u2019s claims was premature because the court did not consider whether the prison had a regulation restricting Neal\u2019s access to all or some religious publications and whether the prison regulation, as applied to the particular publications sought by Neal, violated either Neal\u2019s constitutional rights and/or RLUIPA. <em>See Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 419, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989) (affirming remand to district court for an examination of prison restrictions on inmates\u2019 receipt of publications as applied to specific publications).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part, and this case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Neal\u2019s motion to supplement the record with the above-noted publications is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
