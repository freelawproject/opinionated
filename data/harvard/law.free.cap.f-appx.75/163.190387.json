We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See McKinnon v. Pendergraph, </em>No. CA-00-620-3 (W.D.N.C. Dec. 18, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
