His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon review, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-23\">An Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that Ervin had a severe impairment that consisted of \u201cresidual pain secondary to a cervical and lumbar strain.\u201d The ALJ found that he could not perform his past work, even though his condition was not equal to any of the impairments that are listed in Appendix 1 of the regulations. However, the ALJ also found that Ervin could still perform a full range of sedentary work. Thus, the ALJ determined that Ervin was not disabled by relying directly on the medical-vocational guidelines that are found at 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, Rule 201.21. This opinion became the final decision of the Commissioner on October 2, 2001, when the Appeals Council declined further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-24\">A magistrate judge subsequently recommended that the Commissioner\u2019s decision be affirmed. The district court adopted this recommendation over Ervin\u2019s objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tions, and dismissed the case on January 6, 2003. It is from this judgment that he now appeals.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">Judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s decision is limited to determining whether the Secretary\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence and whether the Secretary employed the proper legal standards in reaching her conclusion. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla of evidence but less than a preponderance and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. The scope of our review is limited to an examination of the record only. We do not review the evidence <em>de novo, </em>make credibility determinations nor weigh the evidence.... [T]his court can remand for further consideration of [new] evidence only where the party seeking remand shows that the new evidence is material and that there was good cause for not presenting the evidence in a prior proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\"><em>Brainard v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>889 F.2d 679, 681 (6th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). The Commissioner\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we might have decided the case differently based on substantial evidence to the contrary. <em>See Bogle v. Sullivan, </em>998 F.2d 342, 347 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Ervin was able to perform a full range of sedentary work is amply supported by Dr. Saghafi\u2019s report, which indicates that he could perform the rigorous demands of heavy work. <em>See Hardaway v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>823 F.2d 922, 927 (6th Cir.1987). It is also supported by Ervin\u2019s activities, which include childcare, shopping, housecleaning, paying bills, and driving a school bus. <em>See Bogle, </em>998 F.2d at 348. Thus, the ALJ properly determined that Ervin was not disabled by relying directly on the medical-vocational guidelines. <em>See Atterberry v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>871 F.2d 567, 572 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Erwin now argues that \u201cMedical Professionals\u201d are concealing his true condition, but he has not cited any evidence to support this assertion. He also argues that he has more information regarding his condition and that the ALJ should have considered other evidence that arose prior to his application for benefits. However, Ervin has not specifically identified any material evidence that is not already in the record, and he has not presented sufficient grounds to justify a remand of his case. <em>See Cline v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>96 F.3d 146, 149 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
