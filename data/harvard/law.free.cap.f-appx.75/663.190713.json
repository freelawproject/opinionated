R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">John Calvert challenges his 270-month sentence after re-sentencing following a conviction for conspiracy to retaliate against a witness, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1513(b) and 371, felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924, and use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because appellant raises this issue for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error, <em>see United States v. Vences, </em>169 F.3d 611, 613 (9th Cir.1999), and we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Appellant contends that the district court erred in imposing a sentence above the applicable minimum guideline, and that in applying United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5G1.2, which provides for consecutive sentences in order to achieve total punishment, the district court is required to impose a sentence at the low end of appellant\u2019s guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument has merit. This court previously described \u201ctotal punishment\u201d found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 as the \u201cminimum sentence in the guideline range for the total offense level for all counts.\u201d <em>See United States v. Archdale, </em>229 F.3d 861, 870 (9th Cir.2000). Because appellant\u2019s sentence exceeds the low end of his guideline range, we find error. We conclude that because appellant would have received 30 months less in his sentence, Calvert\u2019s substantial rights were affected by the error, and that the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>See Vences, </em>169 F.3d at 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Accordingly, we vacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing consistent with this court\u2019s precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">. We decline to consider appellant\u2019s July 31, 2003 request for new counsel, as it is more appropriate for the district court's consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
