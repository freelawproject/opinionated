Castellano challenges his jury-trial conviction and 300-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>United States v. Angelone, </em>894 F.2d 1129, 1130 (9th Cir.1990), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Castellano contends that trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to obtain the trial testimony of a material witness, and contest the court\u2019s erroneous jury instructions. The district court did not err in its conclusion that the witness issue could not be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion because it had previously been raised and rejected at trial and on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Castellano, </em>232 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2000) (unpublished disposition) (affirming Castellano\u2019s conviction, and rejecting this contention in Castellano\u2019s direct appeal); <em>United States v. Redd, </em>759 F.2d 699, 701 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cSince these challenges would all have been meritless, [defendant] cannot claim that his counsel's failure to raise them constituted ineffective assistance\u201d). Because Castellano failed to raise the jury instruction issue in the district court, we decline to consider it. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>988 F.2d 941, 945 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Castellano also contends that counsel was ineffective due to a complete communication breakdown, and that the district court failed to perform an adequate hearing prior to refusing to substitute counsel during trial and forcing Castellano to proceed pro se. After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the district court did not err in its finding that counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Again, because Castellano failed to raise the substitution of counsel issue in the district court, we decline to consider it. <em>See Johnson, </em>988 F.2d at 945</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b659-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
