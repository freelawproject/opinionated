On May 2, 2001, Arnette, pursuant to a written plea agreement, pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). She was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Arnette\u2019s plea agreement specifically stated that the Government retained \u201csole discretion\u201d over whether it would file a 35(b) motion on her behalf to reduce her sentence for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Where the government retains its discretion regarding whether it will make a substantial assistance motion, there is \u201cno enforceable promise\u201d because the plea agreement \u201cexplicitly reserved] discretion rather than promising anything.\u201d <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>22 F.3d 84, 87 (4th Cir.1994). Because the government had the discretion to choose whether to make the motion, the district court could only review the government\u2019s failure to make the motion if the decision was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>Wallace, </em>22 F.3d at 87. To necessitate the court\u2019s review, Arnette was required to make a substantial threshold showing that transcended a mere recitation of the assistance she provided. <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840. Neither a claim that the defendant merely provided substantial assistance nor additional but generalized allegations of improper motive would entitle her to a remedy or to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">We have reviewed the record in the instant case and conclude Arnette has failed to make a substantial threshold showing that the Government\u2019s exercise of discretion under the plea agreement was unconstitutional. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to compel the Government to file a Rule 35(b) motion on her behalf. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
