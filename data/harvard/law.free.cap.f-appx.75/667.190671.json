Pool\u2019s decision to deny Steuer\u2019s benefits under the Medical Plan is therefore reviewed for abuse of discretion, unless Steuer provides material, probative evidence, beyond the mere fact of the apparent conflict of interest inherent in a self-funded plan, tending to show that self-interest caused a breach of the administrator\u2019s fiduciary obligations to Steuer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Atwood v. Newmont Gold Co., Inc., </em>45 F.3d 1317, 1323 (9th Cir.1995). In that case, the administrator\u2019s decision is reviewed de novo, unless Pool can prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the conflict did not taint the administrator\u2019s decision to deny Steuer\u2019s benefits. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We need not decide which standard of review is applicable in this case, however, because we conclude that Pool abused its discretion in denying Steuer\u2019s Medical Plan benefits. <em>See Schikore v. BankAmerica Supplemental Ret. Plan, </em>269 F.3d 956, 961 (9th Cir.2001). The administrator\u2019s decision was not based upon a reasonable interpretation of the Medical Plan\u2019s terms. <em>See McDaniel v. Chevron Corp., </em>203 F.3d 1099, 1113 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">Pool\u2019s conclusion that Steuer was \u201cintoxicated\u201d within the meaning of the Medical Plan was unsupported by its own investigation and the testimony of its decision-makers. Pool\u2019s investigation of Steuer\u2019s accident was limited to its expert toxicologist\u2019s review of Steuer\u2019s hospital records. Pool\u2019s expert concluded that at the time of the accident, Steuer was \u201cimpaired.\u201d Pool\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources testified at deposition that if Steuer had been administered a blood-alcohol test by police at the scene of the accident, and if he had passed it, Pool would have granted Steuer\u2019s Medical Plan benefits. Yet despite the fact that Pool\u2019s toxicology expert concluded that Steuer\u2019s blood-alcohol level at the time of the accident was below the level qualifying as \u201cintoxication\u201d under Alaska law, the benefits were denied. Pool had no fixed standard for determining \u201cintoxication\u201d in the absence of a finding by its expert. After its toxicologist failed to establish that Steuer was legally intoxicated, Pool\u2019s decision-makers inconsistently and subjectively defined \u201cintoxication,\u201d with definitions ranging from the legal limit of 0.10% to 0.04%. Separate Pool directors variously stated that intoxication was worse than impairment and that impairment was worse than intoxication. Furthermore, Pool could not identify a single past incident where benefits were denied to an employee whose blood alcohol level was below the legal limit at the time of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Pool argues that its decision to deny Steuer\u2019s benefits under its Short Term Disability Income Plan (\u201cDisability Plan\u201d) should be upheld.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject its argument on both the ground previously stated and the plan administrator\u2019s failure to find that Steuer\u2019s intoxication was the \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of the accident, as required by the Disability Plan\u2019s proximate cause standard. Pool\u2019s finding that alcohol was the proximate cause was unreasonable in the absence of evidence suggesting that the cause of the accident was something other than the placement of an unexpected roadblock in Steuer\u2019s path. Pool ignored the statements of three eyewitnesses who insisted that Steuer\u2019s accident was unrelated to the alcohol he had consumed earlier in the evening. It did so despite the fact that it had no evidence to the contrary. Pool\u2019s failure to develop any meaningful factual record upon which to make a determination of causation was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\">. We review de novo the district court\u2019s choice and application of the standard of review applicable to decisions of plan administrators in the ERISA context. <em>See Lang v. Long Term Disability Plan, </em>125 F.3d 794, 797 (9th Cir.1997). Our Circuit has not yet definitively stated which standard of review applies to the district court\u2019s findings of fact when the district court\u2019s bench tried of an ERISA claim is limited to the administrative record. <em>Compare Kearney v. Standard Ins. Co., </em>175 F.3d 1084, 1095 &amp; n. 6 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (Kleinfeld, J., plurality opinion) (stating that the clearly erroneous standard applies); <em>with id. </em>at 1099 (Reinhardt, J., concurring) (stating that if district court findings are based solely on the administrative record, review should be de novo); <em>see also Friedrich v. Intel Corp., </em>181 F.3d 1105, 1109 (9th Cir.1999) (reviewing the district court's findings of fact for clear error where the court admitted evidence beyond the administrative record). After reviewing the facts of this case, we see no reason to depart from the findings of the district court. Thus, whether we review for clear error or de novo the district court\u2019s findings, our result would be the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. The district court assessed Pool's denial of Steuer\u2019s Disability Plan benefits as a breach of contract claim under Alaska law. Pool does not challenge this ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
