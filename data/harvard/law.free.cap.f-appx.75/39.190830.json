Underhill, <em>Judge) </em>of the defendant\u2019s request to have two paragraphs stricken from his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). On appeal, Brickhouse argues that the District Court erred by refusing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to strike the allegedly inflammatory and irrelevant paragraphs from his PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">On October 9, 2001, defendant pled guilty to federal gun and drug offenses. On January 24, 2002, the defendant was sentenced to 132 months in prison. Following his guilty plea, a United States probation officer prepared a PSR which described the defendant\u2019s conduct, criminal history, potential sentence, and other background information. Under a section labeled \u201cOther Criminal Conduct,\u201d the PSR contains the following paragraphs describing a double homicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-5\">25. On September 12, 1996, Rhonda Jackson, age 18, and her six month old son, Coran Johnson, were found shot to death in Stamford, Connecticut in a 1988 Toyota Camry. Ms. Johnson was found slumped over the steering wheel with a .25 caliber bullet wound to the head. Her son was found in the back seat of the car, strapped in an infant\u2019s car seat, with two .25 caliber bullet wounds to the head. The defendant became a subject of the investigation. On October 1, 1997, he testified before a federal grand jury sitting in Bridgeport, Connecticut. On December 8, 2000, he voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination conducted by an FBI agent, the results of which let [sic] the examiner to opine that the responses were indicative of deception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-6\">26. After being advised of his rights, he admitted to selling what he believed was the murder weapon to Andre Messam for $150 in August 1996. He admitted to lying about this to the grand jury in 1997 because he feared that Messam and his brother, Adrienne, would have killed him. He said that Adrienne Messam paid him $100 after his testimony, and that Andre Messam had offered to pay for his legal fees before his testimony. He stated that prior to his testimony, Andre Messam had contacted him and told him not to come to court, and not to say anything about selling Messam the gun. A second polygraph examination on April 4, 2001 subsequent to the statements, found these statements were indicative of deception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Paragraph 68 of the PSR states that the allegations in the above paragraphs make Brickhouse \u201cirreversibly connected\u201d to the double homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">At sentencing, the defendant objected to paragraphs 25 and 26 and requested their deletion. The court denied the objection and further stated its decision \u201cnot to rely upon those two paragraphs in any respect.\u201d The court said that the two paragraphs \u201cappear to be factually accurate in what they say, and just as there may be other paragraphs in the PSR that are factually accurate but don\u2019t factor into sentencing, that isn\u2019t necessarily a reason to take them out of the PSR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">On February 1, 2002, the defendant timely filed an appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s decision. The District Court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>320 F.3d 334, 342 (2d Cir.2003), and its decisions as to procedures needed in sentencing are reviewed for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Slevin, </em>106 F.3d 1086, 1091 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">The material which can appear in a PSR is extremely broad. Title 18, section 3661 of the United States Code provides that \u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661. Furthermore, the Second Circuit has stated that the PSR \u201cnormally contains information from a variety of sources,\u201d including \u201cinformation bearing no relationship to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>for which the defendant is to be sentenced.\u201d <em>United States v. Charmer Indus., Inc., </em>711 F.2d 1164, 1170-71 (2d Cir.1983) (citing <em>Gregg v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 489, 492, 89 S.Ct. 1134, 22 L.Ed.2d 442 (1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">As to the allegedly inflammatory nature of the objected-to material, the Second Circuit has stated that \u201c[wjhether the decision to disregard disputed statements is made with or without benefit of an evidentiary hearing, the court usually will note its nonreliance but will not cause the inaccurate statements to be deleted from the presentence report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1172. Thus, the general rule is that disregarded statements, even if inaccurate, are usually not deleted. If inaccurate statements are generally not deleted, accurate, though allegedly inflammatory statements, ought also not be deleted. <em>See United States v. Beatty, </em>9 F.3d 686, 689 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that it was not error to refuse to delete from a PSR an accurate statement that \u201cdefendant was identified as a main [murder] suspect but was never arrested nor formally charged,\u201d noting that \u201c[n]either due process nor Rule 32 requires a district court judge to be an editor as well as an arbiter of justice\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Legrano, </em>659 F.2d 17, 18-19 (4th Cir.1981) (denying defendant\u2019s request to delete from a PSR statements that defendant had been involved for several years in a bootlegging conspiracy, where the sentencing judge stated that he would not consider the disputed information in sentencing and noted that defendant could \u201cchallenge the contents of his presentence report through administrative avenues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Moreover, while <em>Charmer </em>spoke of the non-deletion of inaccurate statements, the District Court stated that the material in paragraphs 25 and 26 \u201cappear[s] to be factually accurate.\u201d The court also found at least some of the material relevant stating that \u201c[t]here is information in those paragraphs that is potentially pertinent for the Bureau of Prisons to know. The fact that the defendant sold a gun or stated he sold a gun, the fact that he admitted making false statements; that type of information may in fact be pertinent for the Bureau of Prisons at some point.\u201d In addition, at sentencing, the defendant seemed to concede the factual, if misleading, nature of the paragraphs. Therefore, the defendant is not entitled to have the objected-to material deleted from his PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">A footnote to the defendant\u2019s brief states that \u201c[t]he record is silent as to whether the district court appended its findings to Brickhouse\u2019s PSR. At the very least, if the district court did not append its findings, Brickhouse respectfully requests that the Court remand this case with instructions for the district court to do so.\u201d Having made only passing reference to this request in a footnote, without citing any legal authority, the defendant has not properly presented the issue to the court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Restrepo, </em>986 F.2d 1462, 1463 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cWe do not consider an argument mentioned only in a footnote to be adequately raised or preserved for appellate review.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Furthermore, even if the issue had been properly raised, it is by no means clear that the District Court failed to comply with its obligations. The District Court\u2019s \u201cStatement of Reasons for Imposing Sentence\u201d was appended to the defendant\u2019s PSR. Therein, the court stated its determination not to delete the disputed material \u201cbecause the information is factually accurate, and important for the consideration of the BOP and probation office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
