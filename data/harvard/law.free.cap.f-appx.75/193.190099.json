After finding that Taylor was a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2002), the district court sentenced Taylor to 152 months imprisonment. Taylor contests his career offender status, arguing that his predicate convictions were not alleged in the indictment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-22\">Taylor contends that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), facts that increase the sentencing guideline range must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the fact at issue is the existence or validity of a prior conviction, <em>see id. </em>at 490, or when the sentencing court makes factual findings that increase the sentencing guideline range but the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum, <em>see Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 557-58, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). The statutory maximum for Taylor\u2019s offense is 240 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000). Thus, <em>Apprendi </em>is inapplicable to Taylor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
