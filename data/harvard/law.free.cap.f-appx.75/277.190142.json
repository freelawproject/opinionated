In dismissing the petition, the district court determined that Young\u2019s motion to quash his indictment based on the racial composition of the grand jury was untimely filed, and that Young otherwise waived his grand jury challenge by failing to pursue a ruling on the motion at his jury trial. On appeal, Young focuses on the latter theory of dismissal, arguing that he expressly reserved the right to raise his equal protection claim in post-conviction proceedings. The Respondent relies on the theory of dismissal finding Young\u2019s motion untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-22\">This court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of federal habeas relief based on a state procedural ground. <em>Martin v. Maxey, </em>98 F.3d 844, 847 (5th Cir.1996). Federal courts \u201cwill not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). \u201c[A] federal district court may, in the exercise of its discretion, raise a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural default <em>sua sponte </em>and then apply that default as a bar to further litigation of petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d <em>Magouirk v. Phillips, </em>144 F.3d 348, 358 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-23\">We hold that the district court did not err in dismissing Young\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as procedurally barred since Young failed to file his motion to quash in a timely manner under Louisiana law. <em>See State v. Hampton, </em>687 So.2d 505, 508 (La.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Ct.App.1996); La.Code Crim. P. art. 521 &amp; 535D. Young does not renew his cause and prejudice argument on appeal; therefore, he fails to overcome the procedural bar. <em>Smith v. Johnson, </em>216 F.3d 521, 524 (5th Cir.2000). Since we affirm on the timeliness issue, we need not address whether Young\u2019s failure to pursue a trial court ruling on the motion to quash constituted a waiver of his equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
