For the first time on appeal, Collier argues that the district court\u2019s application of the two level sentencing enhancement found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C)(i) was plainly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The Government concedes that the district court committed plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Ordinarily, a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Stevenson, </em>126 F.3d 662, 664 (5th Cir.1997). However, we apply a plain-error analysis \u25a0with respect to guideline issues to which the defendant failed to object in the district court. <em>United States v. Mora, </em>994 F.2d 1129, 1141-42 (5th Cir.1993). \u201cUnder the plain error standard, forfeited errors are subject to review only where the errors are \u2018obvious,\u2019 \u2018clear,\u2019 or \u2018readily apparent,\u2019 and they affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>172 F.3d 347, 351 (5th Cir.1999) (citation omitted). \u201cWe will not exercise our discretion to correct the forfeited errors, however, unless they \u2018seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">If the sentencing court determines that use of the version of the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, the version of the guidelines in effect on the date the offense of conviction was committed should be used. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(l). Section 2Fl.l(b)(5)(c)(i) was added to the guidelines by Amendment 596, which went into effect November 1, 2000. U.S.S.G. Supp. to App. C, Amend. 596. Section 2F1.1 in the 1998 version of the guidelines, which was the version in effect at the time Collier committed his offense of conviction, does not contain a specific offense characteristic applicable if the offense involved the unauthorized use of another person\u2019s social security number in order to produce another means of identification. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2F1.1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The district court\u2019s use of the incorrect version of the guidelines is clear and obvious from the record. Without the addition of two offense levels pursuant to \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(5)(C)(i), Collier\u2019s total offense level would have been 13, thereby resulting in a recommended guideline range of imprisonment of 15 to 21 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch.5, Pt. A. The error therefore substantially affected Collier\u2019s rights, as it resulted in Collier receiving a sentence which exceeded the maximum limit of the appropriate guideline imprisonment range by three months. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1996). Because Collier\u2019s sentence was erroneously lengthened, the fairness of this judicial proceeding was seriously affected. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Collier\u2019s sentence is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
