That claim was denied and not appealed. In 1996 and 1997, Najmi-Nejad filed new applications for SSI and DIB, alleging a disability due to renal disease, high blood pressure, temporomandibular joint disease, musculoskeletal pain, a vision impairment, hearing loss, status post hernia surgeries, and weight loss. After those applications were denied by the Commissioner, Najmi-Nejad requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). The ALJ considered the medical opinions of a number of physicians, including Najmi-Nejad\u2019s treating psychiatrist, Dr. Judith Navarro, M.D., received counseled testimony from Najmi-Nejad, and consulted a Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d). The ALJ then denied benefits. After her request for review by the Appeals Counsel was denied, Najmi-Nejad filed a complaint in the District Court. Both parties cross-moved for summary judgment, and the Court granted judgment in favor of the Commissioner. Najmi-Nejad appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We review the Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same deferential standard as the District Court, that is, whether the ALJ\u2019s finding are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Podedworny v. Harris, </em>745 F.2d 210, 217 (3d Cir.1984); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.\u201d <em>Ventura v. Shalala, </em>55 F.3d 900, 901 (3d Cir.1995). It is \u201cless than a preponderance of the evidence, but more than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Jesurum v. Sec\u2019y of the U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>48 F.3d 114, 117 (3d Cir.1995). In making this determination \u201cwe are not permitted to weigh the evidence or substitute our own conclusions for that of the fact-finder.\u201d Bu<em>rns v. Barnhart, </em>312 F.3d 113, 118 (3d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Williams v. Sullivan, </em>970 F.2d 1178, 1182 (3d Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In order to qualify for SSI or DIB, a person must be disabled as that term is defined by the Social Security Act and accompanying regulations. <em>Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 118. Disability is defined in the Act as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment with can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A) (2002). In evaluating Najmi-Nejad\u2019s claim for benefits, the ALJ applied the familiar five-step analysis, finding at steps one through three that Najmi-Nejad was not currently employed, and that her back disorders, depression, and hypertension were severe impairments, but that they did not meet or equal any of the impairments listed in Appendix 1 to Subpart P of Part 404 (\u201cListing of Impairments\u201d). 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(d), 404.1520(d). In finding that her depression did not meet Listing 12.04, the ALJ refused to give controlling weight to Dr. Navarro\u2019s opinion that Najmi-Nejad\u2019s depression met the severity requirements, even though Dr. Navarro was Najmi-Nejad\u2019s treating physician, because the ALJ determined that the other documentary medical reports and evidence did not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The ALJ then moved on to step four, and found that Najmi-Nejad did not retain the residual functional capacity to perform her past work but that she could handle the exertional demands of sedentary work. Finally, at step five, the ALJ consulted a VE, to whom the ALJ posed the following hypothetical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">Assume a person of the claimant\u2019s age, education, and vocational profile. Assume that person can lift 5 pounds frequently and 10 pounds occasionally. Assume further limitations of no climbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>or bending, occasionally pushing or pulling, the requirement of a sii/stand option, occasional standing and walking, no complex instructions or work assignments and limited exposure to dust, chemical and other pollutants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Given this hypothetical, the VE testified that Najmi-Nejad could work at the sedentary exertional level as a cashier, of which there are 66,000 jobs nationally, or assembler, of which there exist 48,000 jobs nationally.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On appeal, Najmi-Nejad argues that the ALJ\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence because 1) Dr. Navarro\u2019s opinion that Najmi-Nejad\u2019s depression met Listing 12.04 should have been given controlling weight, and 2) the hypothetical posed to the VE did not include all of her relevant mental limitations. She also claims that her 1993 DIB application was \u201cde facto\u201d reopened and should be addressed. Because we find that the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits is supported by substantial evidence, and that her 1993 application was not reopened, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Najmi-Nejad\u2019s first argument is that the opinion of her treating psychiatrist, Dr. Navarro, that she suffered from disabling depression should have been given controlling weight. As the District Court noted, treating physicians\u2019 findings and opinions are generally given great weight, however, \u201cthe medical judgment of the treating physician can be rejected on the basis of contradictory medical evidence.\u201d <em>Frankenfield v. Bowen, </em>861 F.2d 405, 408 (3d Cir.1988) (citing <em>Rossi v. Califano, </em>602 F.2d 55, 57 (3d. Cir.1979)). If substantial evidence in the record supports a conclusion contrary to that of the treating physician, the ALJ may reject the treating physician\u2019s findings. <em>Frankenfield, </em>861 F.2d at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Here, the ALJ rejected Dr. Navarro\u2019s conclusion that Najmi-Nejad\u2019s depression met the criteria of Listing 12.04 because that conclusion was contradicted by the other documentary evidence. (\u201cExcept for Dr. Judith Navarro, no treating or examining physician has mentioned findings equivalent in severity to the criteria of any listed impairment.\u201d) The ALJ accepted that Najmi-Nejad met part \u201cA\u201d of the Listing, which requires persistent depressive symptoms, but found that she did not meet part \u201cB\u201d because she did not have the required restrictions in daily living activities, difficulties in maintaining social functioning, concentration, persistence, or pace, or repeated episodes of decompensation. 20 C.F.R., Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.04A.1., B.l. The ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by Najmi-Nejad\u2019s own testimony, in which she conceded she was capable of \u201cminimal housekeeping,\u201d \u201clight cooking,\u201d going to the \u201cshops with neighbors,\u201d using public transportation, and attending church, Dr. Navarro\u2019s own notes indicating that until September of 1998, Najmi-Nejad denied all symptoms of depression outside of depressed mood and disturbed sleep, the opinion of Dr. Carl Herman, a consultative psychologist, who stated that as of July 1997, Najmi-Nejad did not have a psychiatric disorder, and a lack of any objective evidence that Najmi-Nejad decompensated repeatedly for extended durations. The record thus contained substantial evidence upon which the ALJ could reject Dr. Navarro\u2019s opinion and conclude instead that Najmi-Nejad did not meet Listing 12.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Najmi-Nejad next challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding at step five that there exist alternate jobs in the national economy that can be performed by someone with her limitations. Specifically, Najmi-Nejad claims that the testimony of the VE that she could work as a cashier or assembler did not constitute substantial evidence because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>the hypothetical question upon which the VE\u2019s opinion was based did not include her relevant mental limitations. The testimony of a VE constitutes substantial evidence where a hypothetical question considers all of a claimant\u2019s impairments that are supported by the medical record. <em>Chrupcala v. Heckler, </em>829 F.2d 1269, 1276 (3d Cir.1987). Hypothetical questions are only required to include those factors that are supported by objective medical evidence contained in the record and need not include limitations supported solely by subjective testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 1271.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">In the Psychiatric Review Technique Form (\u201cPRTF\u201d) section in which the ALJ set down his evaluation of whether Najmi-Nejad met Listing 12.04 Part B, the ALJ noted that she \u201coften\u201d had \u201cdeficiencies of concentration, persistence, or pace.\u201d Najmi-Nejad argues that the hypothetical question posed to the VE should have included these noted deficiencies. However, because these limitations were not supported by objective medical evidence in the record, the ALJ was not required to specifically include them in the hypothetical. Dr. Navarro only mentioned that Najmi-Nejad had difficulties in concentration, persistence and pace one time, when she became extremely anxious about her upcoming administrative hearing. But, one week prior, Dr. Navarro noted that Najmi-Nejad was feeling better. In addition, Najmi-Nejad\u2019s own testimony that she was able to attend psychotherapy sessions and other doctor appointments several times per month, and that she is able to shop and to socialize with friends contravenes her contention that she has difficulties in concentration, persistence, and pace. Furthermore, the ALJ did include in the hypothetical a limitation to simple routine work, which sufficiently accounted for any of Najmi-Nejad\u2019s deficiencies. <em>See Burns, </em>312 F.3d at 123 (noting that the phrase \u201csimple, routine, repetitive work\u201d would account for \u201cdeficiencies in concentration, persistence [and] pace\u201d). Thus, the hypothetical adequately reflected Najmi-Nejad\u2019s impairments, and therefore the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting a finding of no disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Finally, Najmi-Nejad argues that there has been a \u201cde facto\u201d reopening of her 1993 DIB claim by virtue of the ALJ\u2019s statement that the claim could be reopened \u201cif we need to\u201d and his consideration of evidence of disability back to the alleged 1988 onset date. She thus appears to be arguing that the ALJ, had he awarded benefits, should have awarded them going back to 1993. <em>See, e.g., Coup v. Heckler, </em>834 F.2d 313, 317-18 (3rd Cir.1987) (finding that application had been \u201cde facto\u201d reopened where ALJ considered and relied extensively on prior evidence of disability and holding that claimant was properly entitled to benefits going back to earlier application). However, because we will affirm summary judgment denying Najmi-Nejad\u2019s claim, we need not address her contention that the ALJ de facto reopened her earlier application.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Accordingly, we will affirm the order of the District Court granting summary judgment to the Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-15\">. The District Court had jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), and we exercise jurisdiction over the Court\u2019s final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-5\">. The cases relied upon by Najmi-Nejad in her Reply Brief for the proposition that the ALJ was required to include the limitations noted in the PRTF in his hypothetical to the VE, <em>Williams v. Apfel, </em>98 F.Supp.2d 625 (E.D.Pa.2000), and <em>Brachtel v. Apfel, </em>132 F.3d 417 (8th Cir.1997), do not alter our conclusion, as in neither case did the court actually so hold.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
