Treeee, filed October 16, 2001, and denying plaintiffs motion for leave to file a second amended complaint adding a claim under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). Familiarity with the facts is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">The central question before us is whether the lower court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, where such a claim would be precluded by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Garcia v. S.U.N.Y. Health Sciences Center, </em>280 F.3d 98 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">Given the posture of this case, our review is limited. The plaintiff did not attempt to distinguish <em>Garcia </em>below based on the time the plaintiffs claims accrued. We thus decline to address the question of when the state might first have knowingly waived sovereign immunity. We are, of course, bound by previous panel decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
