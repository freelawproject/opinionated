We apply the transitional rules under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, and we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F.3d 1218, 1222-23 (9th Cir.2002). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>Abassi v. INS, 305 F.3d </em>1028, 1030 (9th Cir.2002), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the Alayeds\u2019 motion to reopen because they did not demonstrate that \u201cit is \u2018more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed\u2019 to [Jordan].\u201d <em>Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 966 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Abassi, 305 F.3d </em>at 1030, and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.16(c)(2)(4) &amp; 208.18(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>We lack jurisdiction to review the Alayeds\u2019 contention on appeal that conditions in Jordan have recently deteriorated because this claim was not brought before the BIA. <em>See Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987). For the same reason, we do not review the claim that the Attorney General has discretion to terminate deportation proceedings and reinstate them as removal proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">We do not review the Alayeds\u2019 remaining contentions because those contentions were rejected in their previous petition before this court. <em>See Al Ayed v. INS, </em>No. 98-70142, 201 F.3d 443, 1999 WL 851452 (9th Cir. Oct. 8, 1999) (unpublished decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b671-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
