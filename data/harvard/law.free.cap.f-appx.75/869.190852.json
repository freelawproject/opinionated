Brown was dismissed from her managerial position in the Credit Collections Department at Reed Elsevier Inc., New Providence, New Jersey (\u201cRENP\u201d). Brown then filed a complaint in New Jersey Superior Court, asserting claims against RENP and two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>its senior managers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2601 <em>et seq., </em>the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (\u201cNJLAD\u201d), N.J. Stat. Ann. 10:5-1 <em>et seq., </em>and the New Jersey Conscientious Employee Protection Act (\u201cNJCEPA\u201d), N.J.S.A. 34:19-2, as well as claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful discharge, and misrepresentation. Brown\u2019s complaint focused on the purportedly poor performance of an employee in the Credit Collections Department whom Brown had hired in August 2000 and who was terminated along with Brown in January 2000. Brown claimed that RENP\u2019s failure to sanction or dismiss this employee at an earlier point had led to \u201cadditional work burdens [being] unnecessarily placed upon [Brown] directly impacting on the condition of her physical and mental health.\u201d Brown further claimed that \u201c[a]s a result of work-related stress and anxiety imposed by [RENP] ... [she] developed coronary disease and [was] treated by a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression.\u201d On RENP\u2019s motion, Brown\u2019s complaint was removed to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The District Court granted RENP\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all counts. Addressing Brown\u2019s NJLAD claim that she had been terminated because of handicap, the Court noted that \u201cthe exact basis of [Brown\u2019s] alleged handicap \u2014 whether workplace stress or the complex of symptoms flowing from that stress \u2014 remains largely indecipherable from [Brown\u2019s] complaint, arguments and presented evidence.\u201d However, the Court granted summary judgment against Brown on that claim on the ground that Brown had \u201cnot pointed to any evidence raising a genuine issue about [RENP\u2019s] articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reason [for Brown\u2019s dismissal].\u201d The Court granted summary judgment on the remaining claims on grounds not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">On appeal, Brown argues that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on her NJLAD claim because there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether her termination was pretextual. Brown further contends that the District Court erred when it denied her motion for reconsideration in the face of previously overlooked evidence showing that RENP\u2019s explanation was a mere pretext that masked a discriminatory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Both the standard for granting summary judgment and the burden-shifting framework of <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which applies under the NJLAD, <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., Inc., </em>117 N.J. 539, 569 A2d 793, 798-99 (1990), are familiar and need not be restated. Brown\u2019s argument in this appeal centers on the final step at which the plaintiff must point to evidence that raises a genuine issue as to whether the employer\u2019s asserted reason for the adverse action was the real reason. The District Court, as noted, held that the evidence on which Brown relied was insufficient under this standard, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">RENP claimed that Brown was terminated as a legitimate cost-cutting measure. RENP offered evidence that the decision to terminate Brown resulted from the reduction in revenue, over a three year period, in three of its divisions. RENP offered further evidence that the majority of Brown\u2019s work was related to the division that had experienced the big<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>gest drop in revenue; that the number of employees supervised by Brown had dropped from 14 to 9; that, with the exception of her manager, Brown was the highest paid member of the Credit Collections Department; and that, following Brown\u2019s dismissal, her duties were performed by other, remaining group members.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">In view of this evidence, the evidence on which Brown relies is insufficient to show pretext. For example, Brown points to data showing that accounts receivable increased, but accounts receivable are not the same as revenue, and in the face of the evidence in the record about revenue, these data are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. Brown also points to a memo stating that \u201crevenue and profit goals were exceeded,\u201d but this memo did not refer to the division for which Brown performed almost all of her duties, and it is insufficient standing alone in light of the other financial information in the record. Considering the summary judgment record as a whole, we must agree with the District Court that Brown did not raise a genuine issue as to pretext.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">As a general matter, we review the District Court\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Koshatka v. Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 329, 333 (3d Cir.1985). However, \u201c[wjhere a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is based upon the interpretation of legal precepts ... our review of the lower court\u2019s decision is plenary. But, to the extent that the district court\u2019s order was based on a factual conclusion, we review under a \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>North River Ins. Co. v. CIGNA Reins., Co., </em>52 F.3d 1194, 1203 (3d Cir.1995). Under the District Court\u2019s Local Rule 7.1(g), a motion for reconsideration \u201cmay be granted if: (1) an intervening change in the controlling law has occurred; (2) evidence not previously available has become available; or (3) it is necessary to correct a clear error of law or prevent manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1218. \u201cThe purpose of a motion for reconsideration is to correct manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Harsco Corp. v. Zlotnicki </em>779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Brown argues that the District Court overlooked evidence that demonstrated that the supposedly legitimate business reason proffered by RENP was a mere pretext that masked a discriminatory purpose. Brown is incorrect. In her motion for reconsideration, Brown merely offered evidence that was already before the Court and reiterated her claim that the reason offered by RENP was a mere pretext. Brown did not demonstrate that there had been \u201can intervening change in the controlling law,\u201d that \u201cevidence not previously available ha[d] become available,\u201d or that the District Court\u2019s decision was based on \u201ca clear error of law\u201d or resulted in \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d <em>North River Insurance Co., </em>52 F.3d at 1218. On the contrary, as noted, the decision was sound. We thus conclude that the District Court did not err in denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">In sum, we have considered all of Brown\u2019s arguments and see no basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>reversal. The judgment of the District Court is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-6\">. The complaint named Brown\u2019s former supervisor, John G. Wolfe, the senior manager in charge of the Credit Collections Department, and RENP\u2019s Vice President of Human Resources, Eileen Purelis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. Because we hold that the District Court did not err in its determination that Brown failed to discredit RENP's explanation that her dismissal was a legitimate cost-cutting measure, we do not need to consider whether Brown\u2019s claim that she was handicapped as a result of workplace stress established an element of a prima facie claim under the NJLAD. Similarly, we do not need to consider Brown\u2019s argument that the District Court impermissibly asked her for additional information after she had established a prima facie case of employment discrimination.
