The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plan administrator\u2019s decision denying long term disability benefits to Professor Haluk Bekiroglu. The district court concluded that while the decision was debatable it was not arbitrary or capricious. In support of that conclusion, the district court held that the medical and surveillance evidence in the record supported the decision that Professor Bekiroglu was capable of the light duty work required by his position as Business Division Director and Professor of Management and Business at Becker College. We affirm essentially for the reasons given by the district court in the memorandum and order dated October 16, 2002, adding only the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-14\">In a non-jury case, when, as here, the parties submit cross motions for judgment on an agreed record, the case is deemed to be submitted as stated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Garcia-Ayala v. Lederle Parenterals, Inc., </em>212 F.3d 638, 643-44 (1st Cir.2000). Instead of drawing inferences in favor of each non-moving party, as would ordinarily be done in considering cross motions for summary judgment, the court must determine the appropriate inferences to be drawn from the factual record. <em>Id. </em>Professor Bekiroglu can prevail on appeal \u201conly if he shows that the district court\u2019s factual determinations are clearly erroneous or if the district court made an error of law.\u201d <em>Watson v. Deaconess Waltham Hosp., </em>298 F.3d 102, 108 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">It is undisputed that the deferential ERISA standard applies. The plan administrator\u2019s decision will be reversed only if the \u201celigibility determination was unreasonable in light of the information available to it.\u201d <em>Cook v. Liberty Life Assurance Co., </em>320 F.3d 11, 19 (1st Cir.2003). The eligibility determination must be upheld \u201cif it was within [the insurer\u2019s] authority, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir.1998). \u201cThe existence of contrary evidence does not necessarily render [the insurer\u2019s] decision arbitrary.\u201d <em>Boardman v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>337 F.3d 9, 15 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">Professor Bekiroglu contends that the district court erred in evaluating the record evidence and, in particular, he urges a different interpretation of his treating physician\u2019s opinion. He concedes that Dr. Johnson checked the \u201cyes\u201d box in question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>seven of the attending physician\u2019s statement, indicating that he was released for work in his occupation. He argues, however, that marking the \u201cyes\u201d box was a mistake and that Dr. Johnson intended to support his application for long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Professor Bekiroglu points to Dr. Johnson\u2019s statement, confirmed in her treating notes, that she would be happy to fill out medical forms for his disability application. He contends that Dr. Johnson\u2019s statement demonstrates that she intended to help his application so that her responses on the attending physician\u2019s statement should be construed in his favor. Professor Bekiroglu also points to Dr. Johnson\u2019s narrative answer to the remainder of question seven, following the \u201cyes\u201d box, which asked her to explain her patient\u2019s restrictions if he were medically unable to work at that time. Dr. Johnson wrote that certain symptoms made it very difficult for Professor Bekiroglu to \u201cfunction at a full level.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Taken as a whole, Dr. Johnson\u2019s opinion consistently indicated that Professor Bekiroglu was able to work at his occupation, albeit at a somewhat reduced exertional level. Whether Dr. Johnson \u201chappily\u201d agreed to complete forms in support of his application carries little persuasive weight. Dr. Johnson\u2019s specificity about Professor Bekiroglu\u2019s condition reveals that although she thought he would have difficulty performing at a full level, he would only have a slight limitation in his physical activity. The surveillance conducted by Paul Revere confirms that conclusion, as does Dr. Poliak\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">While the record evidence is open to different interpretations, as the district court noted, given the deferential standard of review Professor Bekiroglu has not shown that the district court\u2019s factual determinations were clearly erroneous. Even if the appeal were reviewed de novo, we would come to the same result. Therefore, the summary judgment granted by the district court in favor of Paul Revere is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-13\">.
