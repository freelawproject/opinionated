We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Wolde failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Wolde seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Wolde\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-31, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Wolde fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
