He asks us to vacate his conviction and sentence, reform the judgment to reflect a conviction only under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and remand his case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-24\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the enhanced penalties in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are sentencing provisions, not elements of separate offenses. The Court further held that the sentencing provisions do not violate the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 239-47. Gutierrez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>but asserts that the decision has been cast into doubt by <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He seeks to preserve his argument for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-25\"><em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Gutierrez\u2019s conviction and sentence are therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-26\">The Government concedes that the judgment incorrectly reflects conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(2), which requires deportation subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony. Both parties agree that the offense of conviction was illegal reentry following deportation subsequent to conviction for a felony, not an aggravated felony, and that the statutory basis is 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) &amp; (b)(1). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>remand is appropriate pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 36 for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment to reflect the appropriate statutory basis. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, </em>588 F.2d 961, 964 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">REMANDED FOR LIMITED PURPOSE OF CORRECTING CLERICAL ERROR IN JUDGMENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b261-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
