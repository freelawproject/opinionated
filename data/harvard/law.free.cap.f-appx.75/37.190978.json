The petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">The BIA may summarily affirm a decision by an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) if the decision \u201ccontains sufficient reasoning and evidence to enable [the Court] to determine that the requisite factors were considered.\u201d <em>Arango-Aradondo v. INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 613 (2d Cir.1994). Here the IJ\u2019s decision contains sufficient reasoning and evidence to permit review of its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-13\">We uphold factual findings concerning asylum eligibility if supported by substantial evidence. <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 312-13 (2d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citation omitted). The scope of our review is thus \u201cexceedingly narrow.\u201d <em>Melgar de Torres, </em>191 F.3d at 313 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). And we defer to an IJ\u2019s credibility findings. <em>Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 146 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003). Here, the IJ found numerous evidentiary inconsistencies involving, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) documents submitted to establish Zhao\u2019s identity (including her birth and marriage certificates); testimony concerning the circumstances of her alleged forced sterilization and (3) the origin of her \u201chousehold book\u201d \u2014 the only document referring to her children. These evidentiary inconsistencies went to the heart of her asylum application. The IJ\u2019s refusal to credit Zhao\u2019s testimony based on these inconsistencies was reasonable, and his denial of her application was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
