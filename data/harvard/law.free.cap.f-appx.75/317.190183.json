By moving for IFP status, Lucas is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that IFP status should not be granted on appeal because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Lucas states only that the district court dismissed his actions as \u201cdocket management strategy.\u201d His brief contains no argument that the district court erred in dismissing claims in each of his actions on the ground that they were frivolous or failed to state a claim, nor does the brief provide any argument that the district court erred in dismissing his actions as malicious. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Even a <em>pro se </em>appellant must brief an issue to preserve it for appellate review. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Lucas\u2019 request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lucas\u2019 claims and actions under \u00a7 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous also counts as a strike. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Lucas is WARNED that if he accumulates a third strike he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
