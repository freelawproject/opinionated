He was sentenced to 33 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Wendler challenges his sentence in two respects. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">First, he contends that the district court erred by denying an additional level of downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The district court\u2019s decision to withhold an additional one-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b) is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruelas-Arreguin, </em>219 F.3d 1056, 1059 (9th Cir.2000). The district court did not clearly err when it denied Wendler an additional one-point reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Wendler entered a guilty plea after he had already been tried on some of the charges once, and only four days before his scheduled retrial. \u201c[A] defendant who pleads guilty on the eve of trial is not entitled to the reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility under subsection (b)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Kimple, </em>27 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1994). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s guilty plea must come early enough in the proceedings to preclude the Government from preparing for trial and to enable the court to avoid unnecessarily expending judicial resources.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Second, Wendler argues that the district court erred in imposing a 6-level enhancement for his participation in a common scheme resulting in a loss of $65,745.56 which, although not included in the charges brought against him, was nevertheless determined to be \u201crelevant conduct\u201d related to Wendler\u2019s Social Security fraud. We also review the district court\u2019s determination that uncharged conduct is relevant for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) for clear error. <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>960 F.2d 903, 907 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The district court did not clearly err. In <em>Hahn, </em>this Court established the test for determining when conduct should be considered \u201crelevant\u201d for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2): \u201cAs we have indicated, this requires a showing of similarity, regularity, and temporal proximity in sufficient proportions so that a sentence may fairly take into account conduct extraneous to the events immediately underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 911. Here, the government has met this burden in showing the similarity, regularity, and temporal proximity between Wendler\u2019s Social Security fraud and the losses incurred as a result of the criminal conduct of Michelle Devine, Matilda Smith-Williams, Cleveland Moses Walker, and Steven Hoover Wesley.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b619-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
