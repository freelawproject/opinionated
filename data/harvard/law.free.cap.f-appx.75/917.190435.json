Although we initially dismissed this appeal on the ground that Isaacs failed to meet the standard for the issuance of a certificate of appealability, we granted Isaacs\u2019s rehearing petition and have now considered the appeal on the merits. Based on our review of the record, however, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Isaacs, </em>Nos. CR-98-356; CA-01-2230-2-18 (D.S.C. filed July 8, 2002 <em>&amp; </em>entered July 11, 2002; filed Sept. 3, 2002 &amp; entered Sept. 5, 2002); <em>see also Muth v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (declining to consider claim raised for the first time on appeal). We deny Isaacs\u2019s motion for judicial notice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-27\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
