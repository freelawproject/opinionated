(collectively \u201cHobson\u201d) appeal the dismissal of their claims against Appellees Paul Raymond Robinson (\u201cRobinson\u201d), James Robert McDaniels (\u201cMcDaniels\u201d), Joe Chrestman and John Chrestman on the grounds that their state law claims for fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract, which were removed to federal court, were preempted by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). We affirm the dismissal as to John Chrestman for all claims and as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>Robinson,' McDaniels and Joe Chrestman for the breach of contract claims, but reverse and remand the dismissal of the fraud and misrepresentation claims against Robinson, McDaniels, and Joe Chrestman.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Background and Nature of the Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The following facts are as alleged by Hobson. Brett Hobson, Blake Hobson\u2019s brother, was employed by his brother\u2019s company, Master Finishes, Inc. (\u201cMaster Finishes\u201d), a small business in Tupelo, Mississippi, and acted as the company\u2019s contact person for obtaining insurance coverage for Master Finishes\u2019s employees. Joe Chrestman, sales manager for Business Partners, Inc. (\u201cBusiness Partners\u201d), approached Master Finishes about health insurance and other benefits acting as an agent of Business Partners subject to the supervision and control of the owners of Business Partners, Paul Raymond and James McDaniels. Joe Chrestman advised Hobson that he could provide comparable health insurance coverage for Master Finishes at rates much lower than Master Finishes\u2019s current insurance plan with Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Joe Chrestman represented to Hobson that he was selling health insurance and never informed him that he was offering a self-funded ERISA plan that had little or no assets. Master Finishes cancelled its Blue Cross/Blue Shield policy to purchase what it believed was health insurance from Chrestman and Business Partners. No insurance policy was ever procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Blake Hobson subsequently incurred approximately $15,000 in medical bills. He and other employees of Master Finishes attempted to make claims on the insurance policy. Hobson contacted John Chrestman concerning his claims, who consistently represented that someone from Business Partners would return his call regarding the policy. No payment was ever made and plaintiffs brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Master Finishes and Hobson sued Robinson, McDaniels and Joe and John Chrestman for fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract in Mississippi state court. Nine days after filing the state claims, the plaintiffs filed a separate action for unpaid benefits under ERISA in federal court. The defendants removed the state action to federal district court, asserting that the claims were preempted by ERISA. The defendants also moved for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss after determining ERISA preempted Hobson\u2019s state law claims for fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. Although the original complaint did not contain allegations of wrongful conduct on the part of John Chrestman, the plaintiffs sought to amend their complaint to allege that John Chrestman made misrepresentations to Hobson in connection with Hobson\u2019s submitted claims and that John Chrestman failed to communicate with Hobson about those claims. The district court, however, found that the proposed amendments did not contain any claims that would not be preempted by ERISA, and denied the motion as moot. Accordingly, the district court dismissed the case in its entirety. The plaintiffs timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal as an appeal from a final judgment pursuant to section 1291 of title 28. The standard of review for an ERISA preemption is <em>de novo. See Roark v. Humana, Inc., </em>307 F.3d 298, 305 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Whether ERISA Preempts Hobson\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Relying on <em>Pilot Life Insurance Company v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 57, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987), the district court held that \u201cstate law claims for fraud and gross negligence dealing with an ERISA policy are an area of exclusive federal concern.\u201d <em>Pilot Life </em>involved state law claims for common law tort and contract actions asserting improper processing of a claim. <em>Pilot Life, </em>481 U.S. at 43. We agree that under <em>Pilot Life, </em>all of Hobson\u2019s claims for breach of contract are preempted because those claims involve the interpretation of the ERISA policy. <em>See Mem\u2019l Hosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d 236, 250 (5th Cir.1990). <em>Pilot Life </em>is inapposite, however, to the claims for fraud and misrepresentation because the underlying conduct occurred in the inducement of an ERISA policy, not in its administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">ERISA\u2019s preemption clause states that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employer benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a) (expressly excepting two situations not applicable here). A state cause of action relates to an employee benefit plan whenever it has \u201ca connection with or reference to such plan.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Assoc., </em>42 F.3d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Despite its broad construction of ERISA\u2019s supersedure language, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that it will not extend the \u201crelate to\u201d language to its outer limit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[s]ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law \u2018relates to\u2019 the plan.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 100 n. 21. We must, therefore, determine whether a state law claim for fraud and misrepresentation \u201crelates to\u201d a plan and is thus encompassed in ERISA\u2019s preemptive sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">The Supreme Court has acknowledged the expansive scope of ERISA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Courts have noted, however, that \u201cthis observation provides little aid in actually determining whether ERISA supersedes state law.\u201d <em>Woodworker\u2019s Supply, </em>170 F.3d at 989 (citing <em>N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield v. Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. 645, 655, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995)). The Supreme Court suggests, however, \u201c[w]e simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of state law that Congress understood would survive.\u201d <em>Traveler\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>514 U.S. at 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Congress enacted ERISA to \u201cprotect ... the interests of participants in employee benefits plans and their beneficiaries ... by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b). State law preemption \u201caffords employers the advantages of a uniform set of regulations governing plan fiduciary responsibilities and governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>procedures for processing claims and paying benefits\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to minimize \u201cthe administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or between states and the federal government.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">In determining whether a claim is preempted by ERISA, this Court applies a two-prong test; that is, this Court asks: (1) whether the claim addresses areas of exclusive federal concern and not of traditional state authority, such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA plan, and (2) whether the claim directly affects the relationship among traditional ERISA entities \u2014 the employer, the plan and its fiduciaries,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the participants and beneficiaries.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After considering these questions, we find Hobson\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation against Robinson, McDaniels and Joe Chrestman are not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">The gravamen of Hobson\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation arise from Joe Chrestman\u2019s alleged conduct inducing Hobson to give up Master Finishes\u2019s Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan and to procure a plan with Business Partners. In Hobson\u2019s proposed amended complaint, he imputes Joe Chrestman\u2019s conduct to Robinson and McDaniels.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, if the claims against Joe Chrestman are not preempted, the claims against Robinson and McDaniels as Business Partners\u2019 principals also cannot be preempted at this stage. We agree, however, that the claims against John Chrestman, an employee of Business Partners with no alleged involvement in the fraudulent inducement claim, are preempted by ERISA. Thus, the primary legal question in this case is whether ERISA preempts Hobson\u2019s claims for fraudulently inducing him to surrender his insurance coverage in order to procure coverage from Business Partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">Hobson argues that under <em>Perkins v. Time Insurance Company, </em>898 F.2d 470 (5th Cir.1990), Hobson\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation do not relate to a particular ERISA plan, rather they relate to fraud in the procurement before the plan came into existence and thus are not preempted. In <em>Perkins, </em>we held that a state law claim for fraud in the procure<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ment against an independent insurance agent was not preempted by ERISA. <em>See Perkins, </em>898 F.2d at 473.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the instant case, the district court distinguished <em>Perkins </em>in that the agent in <em>Perkins </em>was an independent agent while Joe Chrestman was an employee/and or agent of Business Partners and thus an ERISA fiduciary. In <em>Perkins, </em>however, the agent\u2019s status as an independent agent was not the dispositive factor in the analysis. Rather, the critical determination was whether the claim itself created a relationship between the plaintiff and defendant that is so intertwined with an ERISA plan that it cannot be separated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the timing of plan formation is not the crucial factor in ERISA preemption. Rather, the extent the claim itself relates to an ERISA plan guides our determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In <em>Perkins, </em>we relied in part on <em>Sommers Drug Stores Company Employee Profit Sharing Trust v. Corrigan Enterprises, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Sommers Drug Stores, </em>we determined the plaintiffs claim for common law breach of corporate fiduciary duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>was not preempted by ERISA, despite the fact that the corporate director was also a plan fiduciary and that the plaintiffs were both shareholders and plan beneficiaries. <em>See Sommers, </em>793 F.2d at 1468. In other words, the defendant corporate director was an ERISA fiduciary in regards to some claims, but not in regards to others.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The critical determination was the relationship between the plaintiffs and defendants and what duty the law imposed upon that relationship. Thus, the fact that the agent in <em>Perkins </em>was an independent agent and not an employee of Time (the ERISA entity) simply bolsters the point that the duty imposed upon the relationship between Perkins and the agent did not derive from ERISA. The agent could never have been an ERISA entity and Time could never have been responsible for the agent\u2019s conduct because of the agent\u2019s independent status. If the agent in Time had been an employee of Time, then Time could have been liable for its agent\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Our decisions since <em>Perkins </em>have reaffirmed that the important factor in ERISA preemption is the relationship between the parties involved in the claim itself and whether that claim is intricately bound \u25a0with an ERISA plan. For example, in <em>Hubbard, </em>the plaintiff brought state law claims against the Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Association for both fraudulent inducement under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act and for \u201csecret coverage guidelines.\u201d <em>Hubbard, </em>42 F.3d at 944. We held that a state law claim for \u201csecret coverage guidelines\u201d was preempted by ERISA because it required interpretation and administration of the plan, but that the claim for deceptive trade practices (fraudulent inducement) was not preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 946-47. Both claims were against the same entity, the Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Association, yet both claims were not preempted. The critical factor was that the fraudulent inducement claim did not require interpretation and administration of the ERISA policy as did the \u201csecret coverage guidelines\u201d claim. The ERISA policy defined the duty as between the entities for the \u201csecret coverage guidelines claim,\u201d but not for the fraudulent inducement claim. Likewise, Hobson\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation do not require interpretation or administration of the ERISA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">We reached a consistent determination in <em>Smith v. Texas Children\u2019s Hospital. </em>In <em>Smith, </em>Plaintiff Smith sued Texas Children\u2019s Hospital seeking damages for a state law claim of fraudulent-inducement and seeking disability benefits under an ERISA plan. <em>See Smith, </em>84 F.3d at 155. Smith alleged Texas Children\u2019s promised her that if she relinquished her job and benefits at St. Lukes and came to work for Texas Children\u2019s, Texas Children\u2019s would offer her the same benefits. <em>See Smith, </em>84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>F.3d at 155. We held that Smith\u2019s state law claim for fraudulent inducement was not preempted by ERISA while her claim for disability benefits was preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See id. Smith </em>confirms the law in this circuit that a state law claim for fraudulent inducement is not preempted by ERISA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As in <em>Smith, </em>Hobson\u2019s claims are based upon benefits given up for purposes of ERISA and thus are not preempted by ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">These decisions demonstrate why Hob-son\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation fail both prongs of the preemption test. Joe Chrestman, like the agent in <em>Perkins </em>and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in <em>Smith, </em>allegedly fraudulently induced Hobson to surrender his pre-existing insurance coverage in order to obtain an ERISA plan. Joe Chrestman\u2019s underlying conduct relates only indirectly to the ERISA plan. As such, the relationship between Hobson and Joe Chrestman derives from state common-law claims, not the ERISA plan. Moreover, this conclusion does not contradict Congress\u2019s intent in enacting ERISA-the simplification of plan interpretation and administration-because Hobson\u2019s claims do not require either plan interpretation or administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">As a result, Hobson\u2019s state law claims for breach of contract and all claims against John Chrestman are preempted, and Hobson\u2019s state law claims for fraud and misrepresentation against Joe Chrestman, Robinson and McDaniels are not preempted. Consequently, we therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of defendant John Chrestman for all of Hobson\u2019s claims and of Joe Chrestman, Robinson and McDaniels for Hobson\u2019s breach of contract claims. We REVERSE the entry of judgment in favor or defendant Joe Chrestman, Robinson and McDaniels for Hobson\u2019s claims for fraud and misrepresentation. Accordingly, we REMAND this case for reconsideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint in light of this Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b982-6\">. <em>See Sommers Drug Stores Co.

While ERISA clearly preempts claims of bad faith as against insurance companies for improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan and while ERISA plans cannot be modified by oral representations, we are not persuaded that this logic should extend to immunize agents from personal liability for their solicitation of potential participants in an ERISA plan pri- or to its formation. Giving the ERISA \"relates to\u201d preemption standard its commonsense meaning, we conclude that a claim that an insurance agent fraudulently induced an insured to surrender coverage under an existing policy, to participate in an ERISA plan which did not provide the promised coverage, \"relates to\u201d that plan only indirectly.

Similarly, the shareholder\u2019s rights against the corporate director arise solely from his status as shareholder. That in a case such as ours the director happens also to be a plan fiduciary and the shareholder a benefit plan has nothing to do with the duty owed by the director to the shareholder. The state law and ERISA duties are parallel but independent: as director, the individual owes a duty, defined by state law, to the corporation\u2019s shareholders, including the plan; as fiduciary, the individual owes a duty, defined by ERISA, to the plan and its beneficiaries. Thus, the state law does not affect relations between the ERISA fiduciary and the plan or plan beneficiaries as such; it affects them in their separate capacities as corporate director and shareholder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-11\"><em>Sommers, </em>793 F.2d at 1468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b986-5\">.
