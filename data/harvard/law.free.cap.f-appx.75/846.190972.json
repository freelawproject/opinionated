He additionally alleges that, after repeatedly complaining about these issues and telling the hospital\u2019s counsel in an interview for another employee\u2019s discrimination lawsuit that he believed that the lawsuit was justified, the hospital and individual defendant in this case retaliated against him by revoking a promised promotion and subjecting him to a hostile work environment that ultimately forced him to resign.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-15\">Plaintiff originally alleged state and federal disparate pay, failure to promote, retaliation, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge claims. In the August 15, 2000 ruling, the district court dismissed plaintiffs entire failure to promote, hostile work environment, and constructive discharge claims, as well as his federal retaliation claim, either as time-barred or for failure to state a claim. In the September 27, 2002 ruling, the district court found that a portion of the disparate pay claims were also time-barred, but simultaneously granted summary judgment to defendants on the merits of these claims as well as on plaintiffs remaining state law retaliation claim. We review the district court\u2019s rulings <em>de novo </em>and, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the claims were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-16\">Addressing the district court\u2019s August 15, 2000 rulings, we agree that plaintiffs federal failure to promote and retaliation claims were properly dismissed. Because the allegedly retaliatory conduct central to both claims \u2014 revocation of a promised promotion \u2014 occurred more than 300 days before plaintiff filed his EEOC complaint, the district court correctly held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>that his claims were time-barred. <em>See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 105, 113-14, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (holding that \u201cdiscrete\u201d acts of discrimination and retaliation, such as failures to promote, are time-barred when they occur outside the applicable filing period, even when they relate to acts for which charges are timely filed). Further, we agree that the remainder of plaintiffs federal retaliation claim fails to allege an \u201cadverse\u201d employment action for substantially the same reasons articulated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs state failure to promote claim based on its determination (discussed further <em>infra </em>with respect to plaintiffs state law retaliation claim) that plaintiff had failed to allege that the position plaintiff sought was one that remained open and for which the hospital continued to seek applicants.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Additionally, the district court correctly dismissed plaintiffs hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims. Plaintiff complains that he was \u201cshunned, kept away from meetings he usually attended, and his authority was undermined\u201d after he made negative comments about defendant hospital at an interview in connection with another employee\u2019s lawsuit. (Br. for Appellant at 26.) None of these allegations constitute either a pervasive \u201cdiscriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (quoting <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)), or working conditions that were \u201cso difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person in the employee\u2019s shoes would have felt compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Stetson v. NYNEX Serv. Co., </em>995 F.2d 355, 361 (2d Cir.1993) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">Addressing the district court\u2019s September 27, 2002 decision, we need not reach plaintiffs arguments that his untimely disparate pay allegations can be salvaged under the \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d doctrine because plaintiffs evidence failed to establish a prima facie disparate pay claim. The unanalyzed statistical evidence that plaintiff proffers to show that black managers were, on average, paid less than white managers and disproportionately affected by layoffs is of little probative value because it wholly fails to account for any number of nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparities, rendering it \u201cso incomplete as to be inadmissable as irrelevant.\u201d <em>Bickerstaff v. Vassar College, </em>196 F.3d 435, 449-50 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Bazemore v. Friday, </em>478 U.S. 385, 400 n. 10, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986) (Brennan, <em>J., </em>joined by all other members of the Court, concurring in part) and upholding a district court\u2019s exclusion of statistical evidence as irrelevant because it failed to account for nondiscriminatory explanations for racial disparities).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Plaintiff also failed to present any evidence to suggest that he was similarly situated with respect to the specific white managers to whom he seeks to compare his salary and raises. Moreover, the evidence establishes that plaintiffs salary was the highest of the four \u201cDirectors\u201d in his department for the majority of his tenure, that he received several above-average raises, that he consistently earned one of the highest director-level salaries among the hospital\u2019s non-physician managers, and that his salary was above-average among comparable local and national health care employees. Finally, plaintiff cannot validate his claims and comparisons merely by asserting that he assumed responsibilities beyond his stated title and unofficially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>served as an \u201cAssistant Vice President\u201d for his department. For these reasons, we agree with the district court that the evidence does not allow for a reasonable inference of discrimination beyond mere speculation or conjecture. <em>Cf. Bickerstaff, </em>196 F.3d at 448 (noting that courts must \u201ccarefully distinguish between evidence that allows for a reasonable inference of discrimination and evidence that gives rise to mere speculation or conjecture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Lastly, plaintiffs state law retaliation claim was correctly dismissed because plaintiff cannot show that he suffered an adverse retaliatory action, as there is no evidence that the higher position that he alleges was promised but subsequently revoked ever existed or remained open after his departure. Specifically, plaintiff concedes that no such position ever existed in his department, and it is undisputed that his successor was hired to his same former position at the same salary. While the successor was promoted to \u201cDirector of Human Resources\u201d two years later, her uneontroverted testimony was that, rather than ascending to an open position, she took on added responsibilities following the departure of another director. These added responsibilities did not include supervision of other directors, which plaintiff claims would have been part of the position he was allegedly promised, and did include tasks that plaintiff concedes were beyond his alleged supervisory responsibilities pri- or to his departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
