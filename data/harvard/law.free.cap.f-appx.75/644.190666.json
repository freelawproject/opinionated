Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Kalaw, </em>133 F.3d at 1151, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-18\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Jdahim is statutorily ineligible for an adjustment of status because his activities in support of an alien-smuggling operation make him inadmissible to the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(E)(i); <em>Choe v. INS, </em>11 F.3d 925, 928 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Jdahim is precluded from showing good moral character because he was involved in alien smuggling, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(3); <em>Khourassany v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 1096, 1101 (9th Cir.2000), and testified falsely at his hearing, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(f)(6); <em>Bernal v. INS, 154 </em>F.3d 1020, 1022 (9th Cir.1998), rendering him ineligible for suspension of deportation. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Jdahim contends for the first time before this court that he should have been given the opportunity to apply for a waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(i), (allowing for admission of immigrant who has misrepresented a material fact if he is the spouse of a United States citizen who would suffer extreme hardship upon his deportation. We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument because he did not raise it before the BIA.) <em>See Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-08 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"A0X\"> \u2019j'jjjg disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
