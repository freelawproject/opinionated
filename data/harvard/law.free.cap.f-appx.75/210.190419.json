We vacated and remanded a previous order, finding the district court erred by summarily denying Stephen\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Upon remand, the district court held an evidentiary hearing and again denied relief. We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Stephen has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
