They contend that the district court erroneously concluded that their convictions fell within the Mandatory Detention Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2), and that they failed to show exceptional reasons why they nevertheless should not be detained under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3145(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Defendants were three of seven federal correctional officers charged in a superseding indictment with ten counts of violating the civil rights of inmates incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary at Florence, Colorado. These three defendants were each convicted by a jury of one count charging a substantive offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, and defendants Schultz and La Vallee were also convicted of one count charging conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. Defendants were found \u201cnot guilty\u201d on all other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The district court determined that \u00a7 242 is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B), triggering for all three defendants the mandatory detention provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(a)(2), read in conjunction with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(f)(1). The court further determined that defendants did not show that they were substantially likely to succeed on a motion for acquittal or for a new trial to meet the exception to detention in \u00a7 3143(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, and did not show exceptional reasons why they nevertheless should not be detained to meet the exception in \u00a7 3145(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">On appeal, defendants argue that a charge under \u00a7 242 does not, by its nature, pose a substantial risk of physical force and, so, is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B). In addition, they assert that they showed the following exceptional reasons why they should not be detained under \u00a7 3145(c): (1) the jury returned sixteen \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts on counts charging excessive force, including some \u201cnot guilty\u201d verdicts as to these defendants; (2) the Mandatory Detention Act does not define the critical terms \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and \u201cexceptional reasons\u201d; (3) there was disparate treatment between these defendants, who were ordered detained, and other defendants who pleaded guilty to charges under \u00a7 242 and who were not detained pending sentencing; (4) the trial court\u2019s application of the Mandatory Detention Act to these defendants was unconstitutional; (5) the jury returned a statement that the climate of abuse at Florence should be taken into account when defendants are sentenced; and (6) defendants had no prior record and showed exemplary conduct since they were charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">The question whether a charge under \u00a7 242 constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B) is a legal question that we review de novo. <em>See United States v. Vigil, </em>334 F.3d 1215, 1218 (10th Cir.2003) (considering similar definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2). We also review de novo the determination that defendants showed no exceptional reasons why they nevertheless should not be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tained under \u00a7 3145(e). <em>United States v. Kinslow, </em>105 F.3d 555, 557 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Under \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B), an offense is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d if it is a felony and, \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d When we determine the nature of the offense under \u00a7 242 charged against these defendants, we consider only the statutory elements of the offense and not the evidence adduced at trial. <em>See United States v. Zamora, </em>222 F.3d 756, 764 (10th Cir.2000) (considering definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2); <em>United States v. Reyes-Castro, </em>13 F.3d 377, 379 (10th Cir.1993) (considering definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 identical to that under \u00a7 3156(a)(4)). If there is any ambiguity, we may \u201clook beyond the statute to certain records ..., such as the charging documents, the judgment, any plea thereto, and findings by the court.\u201d <em>Zamora, </em>222 F.3d at 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the three clauses of \u00a7 242 define separate offenses with different elements. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>343 F.3d 423, 433 (5th Cir.2003). Defendants concede that they were charged with violating the offense defined by the second clause, that is, with violating inmates\u2019 constitutional rights in a manner that resulted in bodily injury. Aplt. Verbickas\u2019 Br. at 6. We have no trouble concluding that the offense defined by \u00a7 242 that includes the element of bodily injury involves a substantial risk that physical force will be used in the commission of the offense, and is therefore a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 3156(a)(4)(B). <em>Accord Williams, </em>343 F.3d at 432 (considering identical definition for \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)). Defendants\u2019 argument that not all scenarios that result in bodily injury include a risk of physical force violates the requirement that we examine the nature of the offense in the abstract, and not the theoretical possibilities of individual cases. <em>See Zamora, </em>222 F.3d at 764-65. We hold that the district court did not err in concluding that defendants\u2019 convictions under \u00a7 242 triggered the mandatory detention provision in \u00a7 3143(a)(2), read in conjunction with \u00a7 3142(f)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">We also agree with the district court that defendants failed to show exceptional reasons that they nevertheless should not be detained under \u00a7 3145(c). Included among defendants\u2019 arguments to support exceptional <em>reasons </em>which would justify their release is the argument that other defendants convicted of \u00a7 242 violations were released. This disparate treatment argument does not establish an exceptional reason warranting defendants\u2019 release. Whether the court erred in the <em>release of other </em>defendants <em>does not provide </em>a basis for release of these defendants, or result in our concluding that the detention of the defendants is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
