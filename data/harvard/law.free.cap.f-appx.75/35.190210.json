We affirm for substantially the reasons stated on the record by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">1. The Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13981, is unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">2. As to the retaliation claim and the state law-toxic tort claim: we review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>drawing all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Kavowras v. New York, </em>328 F.3d 50, 54 (2d Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Although Calderon asserts that defendants \u201cblacklisted\u201d her from obtaining further employment in retaliation for filing a Title VII claim, she proffered no evidence to refute defendants\u2019 affidavit stating that they never notified any prospective employers about Calderon. Nor has Calderon provided any evidence linking her breast lumps to asbestos exposure. \u201c[M]ere conclusory allegations, speculation or conjecture will not avail a party resisting summary judgment.\u201d <em>Conroy v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Servs., </em>333 F.3d 88, 94 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In addition, any failure to apprise Calderon of the consequences of not responding to a motion for summary judgment was harmless in light of Calderon\u2019s acknowledgment that she understood the nature and consequences of such a motion. <em>M.B. v. Reish, </em>119 F.3d 230, 232 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">3. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, taking all facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all inferences in favor of the plaintiff. <em>Sweet v. Sheahan, </em>235 F.3d 80, 83 (2d Cir.2000). The district court gave plaintiff multiple opportunities to amend her complaint in order to avoid dismissal. But plaintiff has failed to allege facts necessary to state her remaining claims brought under federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">4. As to the claim under the Connecticut Human Rights Law Preventing Deprivation of Property, Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 46a-58(a), it appears that the district court exercised its discretion to forego the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction. That was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
