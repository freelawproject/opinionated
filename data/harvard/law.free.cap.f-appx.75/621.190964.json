We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a habeas petition as time-barred, <em>Biggs v. Duncan, </em>No. 01-15917, 2003 WL 21911087 (9th Cir. Aug. 12, 2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Funches is not entitled to statutory tolling for the two-and-a-half-year period between the California Superior Court\u2019s denial of his first habeas corpus petition and the filing of his second petition in that same court. <em>See Delhomme v. Ramirez, </em>No. 00-56148, 2003 WL 21947183 at *3 (9th Cir. Aug. 14, 2003) (per curiam) (\u201c[E]aeh time a petitioner files a new habeas petition at the same or lower level, ... the subsequent petition has no effect on the already pending application, but triggers an entirely separate round of review.\u201d); <em>Biggs, supra, </em>(concluding that there is no \u201cpending\u201d application between separate rounds of collateral review in California courts). Because the statute of limitations expired during this period, both of Funches\u2019 subsequent federal petitions were untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In addition, because Funches has not demonstrated that any extraordinary circumstances beyond his control made it impossible for him to file his federal petition on time, he is not entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The district court therefore properly dismissed Funches\u2019 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b651-35\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">.
