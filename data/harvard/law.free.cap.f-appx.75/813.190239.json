We affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-21\">1. Roth argues that he suffered prejudice by reason of the district court\u2019s failure to admit into evidence a document characterizing the testimony of a coconspirator. Evidentiary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Tocco, </em>135 F.3d 116, 127 (2d Cir.1998). A witness may not be charged with a third party\u2019s characterization of his pretrial statements unless the witness has subscribed to them. <em>United States v. Rubin, </em>609 F.2d 51, 62 (2d Cir.1979). And such characterizations may not be used for impeachment purposes. <em>United States v. Leonardi, </em>623 F.2d 746, 756-57 (2d Cir.1980). Here there was no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>Waldman had even reviewed Agent Trigg\u2019s notes. We see no abuse of discretion in the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Roth also contends he was prejudiced by the failure of Agent Trigg to testify as to Waldman\u2019s prior statements. We see no merit to this because, as the district court observed, there was no inconsistency between Waldman\u2019s testimony and his prior statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\"><em>2. </em>Roth has failed to show any prosecutorial misconduct. First, Roth fails to show that Agent O\u2019Grady, co-defendant Waldman or Shaya Dov committed perjury, let alone that the prosecution suborned it. Nor has Roth succeeded in showing that the Government improperly introduced prejudicial evidence at the suppression hearing; assuming such conduct could justify relief on appeal, we conclude that the district court admitted the challenged evidence as relevant to the issue of whether Roth was tricked into speaking with Agent O\u2019Grady.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In addition, defense counsel failed to object at trial to the Government\u2019s argument in summation that codefendant Waldman lacked the incentive to falsely implicate Roth during a proffer session, and this claim is subject to plain error review. <em>See United States v. Canniff, </em>521 F.2d 565, 572 (2d Cir.1975). Even if we were to assume that there was misconduct, it could not rise to the level of \u201cegregious misconduct\u201d required to demonstrate a due process violation. <em>United States v. Shareef, </em>190 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">3. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Roth\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 motion substantially for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Roth, </em>01 CR. 401(JFK), 2003 WL 289615 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 10, 2003).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
