The career offender provision increases the criminal history category and offense level (and thus the imprisonment range) of defendants who commit certain offenses after having been convicted of two felony controlled substance offenses or \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), (b), which include any offense that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2). Hamilton insists that his escape \u2014 which involved his failure to return to the Milwaukee House of Correction after being released for a half-day work detail in the kitchen of a county jail \u2014 posed no serious risk of injury to others and asks that we overrule <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>310 F.3d 550, 551 (7th Cir.2002), where we held that \u201cthe crime of escape, as a category,\u201d qualifies as a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-22\">But overruling <em>Bryant </em>would create a conflict among the circuits, seven of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>have held that escapes are inherently risky and thus always constitute a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>United States v. Luster, </em>305 F.3d 199, 202 (3d Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1773, 155 L.Ed.2d 528 (2003); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>285 F.3d 909, 915-16 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 895, 123 S.Ct. 180, 154 L.Ed.2d 163 (2002); <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 954 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Nation, </em>243 F.3d 467, 472 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>180 F.3d 675, 677 n. 7 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>165 F.3d 1062, 1068 (6th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>77 F.3d 774, 777 (4th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Jackson, </em>301 F.3d 59, 63 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that escapes are categorically risky in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2629, 156 L.Ed.2d 644 (2003). <em>But see United States v. Thomas, </em>333 F.3d 280, 282-83 (D.C.Cir.2003) (declining to adopt categorical approach but holding that \u201cescape from the person of an officer\u201d is inherently risky).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Moreover, Hamilton offers no arguments that we overlooked in our earlier decision, only arguments we expressly rejected. He insists, for example, that escapes are not inherently risky and so must be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than treated categorically, but we rejected precisely this argument in Bryant\u2014 which, like this case, involved a halfway-house inmate who \u201cescaped\u201d by failing to return from a work assignment, <em>see Bryant, </em>310 F.3d at 551-54-and in <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>302 F.3d 722, 723-25 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1095, 123 S.Ct. 708, 154 L.Ed.2d 644 (2002), a case interpreting the same \u201cserious potential risk\u201d language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We noted in <em>Franklin </em>that all escapes \u2014 even nonconfrontational escapes \u201cby stealth\u201d \u2014 involve a serious risk of injury to others because escapees are likely to go to great lengths to evade detection and resist capture. <em>Id. </em>at 724. Hamilton disagrees with our assessment, but we indicated in <em>Franklin </em>that we would reconsider our position only if presented with <em>evidence </em>that we had overestimated the risk, <em>see id., </em>and Hamilton offers none. Finally, Hamilton argues that the rule of lenity applies because the catchall provision is \u201cambiguous,\u201d but we have rejected that argument as well. <em>See United States v. Mrazek, </em>998 F.2d 453, 455 (7th Cir.1993) (rule of lenity does not apply to interpretation of sentencing guidelines); <em>United States v. White, </em>888 F.2d 490, 497-98 (7th Cir.1989) (same). None of Hamilton\u2019s arguments persuade us to reconsider <em>Bryant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
