After a bench trial, the court ruled that K&amp;B had engaged in an unlawfulemployment practice, refused injunctive relief, and ordered each side to bear its own costs and attorney\u2019s fees. K&amp;B appeals on various grounds, including its assertion that there was no direct evidence of discrimination; K&amp;B also seeks fees and costs. The EEOC cross-appeals the decision not to award injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">We have read the briefs and pertinent portions of the record and have heard the arguments of counsel, and have consulted the applicable caselaw. We find no reversible error. There was certainly direct evidence of sex-based discrimination, including an admission by K&amp;B\u2019s manager that he preferred to hire men for a particular post. Consequently, the EEOC did not have to prove that Williams was qualified. The district court was well within its discretion in declining injunctive relief. The court\u2019s refusal to shift costs or attorneys fees is a fair resolution of this matter, which badly needs to be put to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
