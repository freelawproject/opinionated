On appeal, D\u2019Agastino argues that the district court erred in its application of the doctrine of qualified immunity by deciding that the force used by Officer Kovach was reasonable and therefore no constitutional violation had occurred. Because we conclude that a reasonable fact-finder viewing the facts in a light most favorable to D\u2019Agastino could conclude that the force used by Kovach was not objectively reasonable, we will reverse the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AS4\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">This case arises from the defendant\u2019s forceful arrest of D\u2019Agastino on June 14, 2000, and the injuries D\u2019Agastino suffered incident to that arrest. D\u2019Agastino brought a two-count complaint against Kovach and the City of Warren; the first count, brought under section 1983, claimed that Officer Kovach used excessive and unreasonable force to arrest him, which caused him severe mental, emotional, and physical injuries; the second count raised the state law claim that Officer Kovach maliciously assaulted and battered him through the use of excessive force without legal justification. Officer Kovach and the City of Warren both moved for summary judgment on both counts. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion as to the section 1983 claim, noting that D\u2019Agastino had conceded that he had no evidence to support a finding of liability on the part of the City. The district court granted the City\u2019s motion as to the state law claim on grounds of state law immunity. Finding no issues of material fact, the district court granted summary judgment to Officer Kovach on the section 1983 claim because his use of force during the arrest was objectively reasonable and therefore did not violate the Constitution; the court granted Kovach\u2019s motion on the state law claim because Kovach\u2019s actions during the arrest were not reckless, wanton or malicious, or taken in bad faith, and Kovach was therefore entitled to immunity under state law. D\u2019Agastino timely appealed to this court, challenging the grant of summary judgment to Officer Kovach on both the section 1983 and the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">\n<em>Factual History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-9\">Officer Kovach\u2019s arrest of D\u2019Agastino at approximately 9:00 p.m. on June 14, 2000, for disorderly conduct while intoxicated was the culmination of several events that occurred throughout the day. That morning, D\u2019Agastino had been involved in a three-car accident in the City of Niles. He was taken to Trumbull Memorial Hospital where, complaining of pain in his neck and back, he was given a CAT scan, MRI, and blood tests, and released around 4:00 p.m. Immediately upon his release, the county sheriff arrested and booked him for failing to appear in court for a required hearing stemming from a previous incident in Niles. He posted bail and proceeded directly to Joe and Kay\u2019s bar in Warren to begin \u2014 in his own words \u2014 drinking \u201cenough to kill somebody\u201d in less than an hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">While still at Joe and Kay\u2019s bar, D\u2019Agastino began making \u201csuggestions\u201d to \u201ceverybody in the bar\u201d about his desire to commit suicide; he then pulled out a Bowie knife and began shaving his forearm. Leaving the bar, he started back to Trumbull Memorial Hospital in order to admit himself, but turned around and entered another bar, where he told the bartender that he wanted an ambulance. Emergency Medical Services and the police arrived and took D\u2019Agastino back to Trumbull Memorial Hospital, where, as he was being processed in the emergency room, he was apparently told to strip down to his underwear and turn over his valuables. According to D\u2019Agastino, he stood around in the emergency room lobby in his underwear for twenty minutes before deciding \u201cto hell with it,\u201d and running out of the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">D\u2019Agastino admits to running into the street, disrupting traffic, and forcing one driver to swerve his vehicle to avoid hitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>him. The police received reports of this activity from both the hospital and the driver of the vehicle, whereupon the police dispatcher sent two messages about D\u2019Agastino to the officers on patrol. The first dispatch advised the officers that a white male in his fifties and wearing only green underwear had escaped from Trumbull Memorial Hospital. The second advised that a citizen had called and complained that this same man had attempted to get inside of the caller\u2019s truck by pounding on the window. The dispatcher also told the officers that the subject was HIV positive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Officer Kovach was the first one to arrive at the scene. At this point in the story, D\u2019Agastino\u2019s version of events differs somewhat from Officer Kovach\u2019s. After spotting D\u2019Agastino, Officer Kovach claims that he got out of his marked cruiser and told D\u2019Agastino to stop, and that D\u2019Agastino began running towards him and yelling that he wanted to die. D\u2019Agastino, however, claims he began running away from Officer Kovach. Regardless, both agree that the two met in the middle of the road where Officer Kovach hit D\u2019Agastino once in the leg with a police baton, and D\u2019Agastino fell face-forward toward the ground. According to D\u2019Agastino, he broke his fall with one outstretched arm and Officer Kovach repeatedly slammed his face into the pavement, Knocking out his teeth and fracturing his jaw. D\u2019Agastino admits to accidentally spitting blood at Kovach, but only after the ambulance arrived and the medical personnel had helped him to his feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Officer Kovach, on the other hand, claims that before D\u2019Agastino fell, Kovach hit him for a second time with the baton, this time in the shoulder area, causing D\u2019Agastino to become limp and fall face-first onto the pavement, injuring his face and jaw. Officer Kovach claims he handcuffed D\u2019Agastino without any difficulty, but then the plaintiff began spitting blood at Officer Kovach and saying he wanted to die. Moments later, a patrol car from the Braceville police department arrived on the scene and used its overhead lights to alert the other cars driving in the vicinity of the plaintiff and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">D\u2019Agastino was eventually taken to Trumbull Memorial Hospital, where he was diagnosed with a compound comminuted alveolar fracture of the maxilla, a compound comminuted fracture of the left side of the mandible, a compound fracture of the symphysis of the mandible, a displaced fracture of the left mandibular condyle, a probable fracture of the right mandible condyle, a four to five centimeter laceration of the chin through and through, four one to two centimeter lacerations of the lateral borders of the tongue, and multiple teeth fractures and upper teeth crushed into his sinuses. D\u2019Agastino\u2019s lawsuit seeks compensation for these injuries, which he claims Officer Kovach caused by his repeated use of excessive force once D\u2019Agastino had been knocked to the ground. The plaintiff concedes that the use of the police baton was reasonable under the circumstances that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A9J\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard under Rule 56(c) used by the district court, <em>Williams v. Mehra, </em>186 F.3d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1999) (en banc), and we consider the record as it stood before the district court at the time of its ruling. <em>Niecko v. Emro Marketing </em>Co., 973 F.2d 1296, 1303 (6th Cir.1992). Summary judgment is proper if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We view the evidence, all facts, and any inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). To withstand summary judgment, the non-movant must present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Klepper v. First Am. Bank, </em>916 F.2d 337, 342 (6th Cir.1990). A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient; \u201cthere must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Entry of summary judgment is appropriate \u201cagainst a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">\n<em>Qualified Immunity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Qualified immunity, which the Supreme Court has deemed \u201cthe best attainable accommodation of [the] competing values\u201d of deterring abuse of power by government officials and vindicating constitutional guarantees on the one hand, and protecting government officials from frivolous suits that may dampen the ardor with which they carry out their jobs on the other, <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 813-14, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), is an affirmative defense that shields government officials \u201cfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not -violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">A court in this circuit undertaking a qualified immunity analysis must first determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutionally protected right; if so, the court must examine whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). The right allegedly violated cannot be asserted at a high level of generality, but, instead, \u201cmust have been \u2018clearly established\u2019 in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 639-40, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). As the Court in <em>Harlow </em>explained, the \u201creasonable person,\u201d in this instance, is a \u201creasonably competent public official [who] should know the law governing his conduct.\u201d <em>Harlow, </em>457 U.S. at 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727. To overcome qualified immunity, the right allegedly violated must be so clear that any reasonable public official in the defendant\u2019s position would understand that his conduct violated the right: \u201cif officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue, immunity should be recognized.\u201d <em>Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">We have established that there are two ways in which a plaintiff seeking to overcome the bar of qualified immunity can show that a right was clearly established in the law at the time the alleged violation occurred. First, \u201ca district court within this circuit must \u2018find binding precedent from the Supreme Court, the Sixth Circuit, or ... itself\u2019 that directly establishes the conduct in question as a violation of the plaintiffs rights. <em>Summar v. Bennett, </em>157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>F.3d 1054, 1058 (6th Cir.1998). If no binding precedent is \u201cdirectly on point,\u201d the court may still find a clearly established right if it can discern a generally applicable principle from either binding or persuasive authorities whose \u201cspecific application to the relevant controversy\u201d is \u201cso clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct was unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id.; accord Cagle v. Gilley, </em>957 F.2d 1347, 1348 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\">\n<em>Excessive Force</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">The essential question before this court is whether-from the facts provided in plaintiff\u2019s deposition and shaped by the other evidence-a reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Officer Kovach used excessive force when arresting D\u2019Agastino. The Supreme Court has stressed the importance of beginning the qualified immunity analysis in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case thus: \u201cA court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider, then, this threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). To determine if a constitutional violation has occurred, we must analyze the claim of excessive force under the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cobjective reasonableness\u201d standard based on \u201cthe facts and circumstances of each particular case, including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205,121 S.Ct. 2151 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The district court found insufficient evidence to support D\u2019Agastino\u2019s claim of excessive force. In particular, the district court relied upon the police dispatcher call records, which show that Officer Kovach and the plaintiff were alone for approximately one and a half minutes, and the fact that D\u2019Agastino admits he tried to get up after being knocked to the pavement. The court concluded that D\u2019Agastino\u2019s version of events did not show that Kovach used excessive force, and that, accepting that version of the events, a reasonable officer on the scene would have used a similar degree of force. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">For purposes of summary judgment, we must take the plaintiffs version of events as true, and we must determine \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505. This case, although strong from the defendant\u2019s perspective, is not so one-sided. Here, D\u2019Agastino testified in his deposition that Kovach repeatedly slammed his face into the pavement. The extent of his injuries, which is not disputed, is not inconsistent with D\u2019Agastino\u2019s testimony. We recognize that the credibility of this testimony may be questionable, particularly in light of D\u2019Agastino\u2019s undisputed blood alcohol level of .26 that night. Credibility, however, is an issue for the jury, and a jury certainly would be entitled to credit that testimony. But nothing in the district court\u2019s opinion indicates that the court credited D\u2019Agastino\u2019s testimony that Officer Kovach forcefully and repeatedly slammed his face into the pavement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">The issue before the court, then, is whether, under <em>Saucier\u2019s, </em>standard of objective reasonableness, if D\u2019Agastino\u2019s allegations were established, Officer Kovach\u2019s use of force against him was excessive and violated the constitution. More specifically, the question is whether an officer who, after taking a subject to the ground-even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>if that suspect is attempting to get to his feet and to evade the officer\u2019s attempts to handcuff him-repeatedly slams the subject\u2019s face into the pavement, uses force that exceeds that which is reasonably necessary to accomplish the arrest. We do not think that under the circumstances described by D\u2019Agastino, a reasonable officer would believe that slamming the subject\u2019s face into the pavement was an objectively reasonable use of force, and we do not read the district court\u2019s opinion as holding that such a use of force would be reasonable. Rather, we hold that the district court erred by failing to view the facts in the light most favorable to D\u2019Agastino in reaching its conclusion that no constitutional violation occurred. Further, we hold that the material facts remain in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">The district court ended its qualified immunity inquiry before reaching the next sequential step in the analysis mandated by the Court in <em>Saucier. </em>Because we have held that the material facts surrounding this incident are genuinely in dispute, we further hold that a determination with regard to the claim of qualified immunity is not appropriate at this stage in the proceedings but the qualified immunity defense may again be raised by the defendant at trial. We therefore reverse the judgment as to the section 1983 claim and remand the matter for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">\n<em>Assault and Battery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">\u201cIf an officer uses more force than is necessary to make an arrest and protect himself from injury, he is liable for assault and battery____\u201d <em>City of Cincinnati v. Nelson, </em>No. C-74321, 1975 Ohio App. LEXIS 7443, *5 (May 5, 1975) (citing 5 O Jur (2d) ARREST \u00a7\u00a7 50) (unpublished); <em>see also Schweder v. Baratko, </em>103 Ohio App. 399, 403, 143 N.E.2d 486 (1957) (\u201cForce when used lawfully in making an arrest is in the exercise of a government function, and only in cases where excessive force is used, that is, force going clearly beyond that which is reasonably necessary to make the arrest, can such force be claimed an assault and battery by the person arrested.\u201d). An officer, acting in his official capacity, is immune from liability for injury unless his actions were \u201cmanifestly outside the scope\u201d of his responsibilities, or the officer acted \u201cwith malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d O.R.C. \u00a7 2744.03(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">The district court, relying upon its determination that Officer Kovach\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable for the purposes of section 1983, found that the defendant\u2019s use of force was not malicious or undertaken in bad faith or in a wanton or reckless manner, and held that Officer Kovach was entitled to immunity under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2744.03. Having reversed the district court\u2019s finding of reasonableness for the excessive force claim, we also reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the state law assault and battery claim. We again stress that our holding proceeds from the requirement that the district court view all the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiff in this case. Because the facts in this record are sufficiently in dispute to require that they be submitted to a jury, it will be up to the jury to determine what exactly happened on the evening in question and then decide whether to hold Officer Kovach responsible for D\u2019Agastino\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">For the reasons set forth above, we REVERSE the decision of the district court and REMAND for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">.
