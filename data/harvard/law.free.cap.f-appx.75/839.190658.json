Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claims against defendantsappellees under \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k, 77o, for lack of standing. <em>See In Re WRT Energy Securities Litigation, </em>1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14009 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 9,1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-22\">Plaintiffs asserted standing on the basis of having purchased notes and preferred stock that were \u201cissued pursuant to, or traceable to\u201d the public offerings. The district court concluded that they lacked standing because they purchased the securities in the aftermarket rather than in an initial public offering. <em>See In re WRT, </em>1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *17. While this appeal was pending, this Court issued an opinion in <em>Demaria v. Andersen, </em>318 F.3d 170 (2d Cir.2003), which held that \u201caftermarket purchasers who can trace their shares to an allegedly misleading registration statement have standing to sue under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>\u00a7 11 of the 1933 Act.\u201d <em>Demaria, </em>318 F.3d at 178. In light of this holding, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations may be sufficient to confer standing to raise the enumerated claims under \u00a7\u00a7 11 and 15 of the Securities Act. We therefore remand this case to the district court to consider those claims on the merits. We do not foreclose further consideration of standing, based on the particular facts of this case, in light of <em>Demaria; </em>we do not consider or decide any other issues raised by defendants-appellees as alternative grounds for deciding this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby VACATED and the case is REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
