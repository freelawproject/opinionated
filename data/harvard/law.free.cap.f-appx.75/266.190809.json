Her conviction was the result of a scheme to defraud her employer of money by false data entry of payments received. She argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a two-level increase to her sentence pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.3 for abusing a position of trust. For the following reasons, Roberts\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00a7 3B1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines allows an increase by two levels if \u201cthe defendant abused a position of public or private trust, or used a special skill, in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense. ...\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commentary to \u00a7 3B1.3 notes that a position of public or private trust involves \u201csubstantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court judge\u2019s application of \u00a7 3B1.3 \u201cis a sophisticated factual determination that will be affirmed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOu\">Roberts argues that the district erred by classifying her as occupying a position of trust. Relying on the commentary to \u00a7 3B1.3, she claims that she is tantamount to a simple bank teller to which \u00a7 3B1.3 does not apply.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court rejected this argument, accepting instead the probation officer\u2019s presentence report, to which there was no rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">The evidence in this case established that Roberts, employed by Metrocall as an accounts receivable data entry clerk, was given special access to the company\u2019s data base which enabled her to commit the offense and conceal it from detection. Roberts\u2019 position gave her the authority to receive checks in the mail, tally the checks, enter the amounts into the data base, and fax the information to Metrocall\u2019s main office. Roberts\u2019 position enabled her to alter the totals that she provided to the main office. In addition, Roberts credited the stolen payment to the customer\u2019s account as though the payment had been received at a Metrocall lock-box location, thereby, making it appear that the checks were stolen from the lock-box location, and not necessarily by a Metrocall employee. Therefore, Roberts\u2019 position went beyond that of an average bank teller, and she abused a position of trust when she committed the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">Considering our precedent, the district court did not clearly err in applying the \u00a7 3B1.3 increase.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even a regular teller \u201cmay engage in other activities in the course of her job that [involve] aspects of trust which may be exploited to facilitate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>crime.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Roberts did so here. Metrocall placed Roberts in a position with special access to the company\u2019s data base, with the power to receive, deposit and record substantial sums of money, and with the authority to relay the updated account information to the company\u2019s headquarters. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Roberts occupied a position of trust and in applying \u00a7 3B1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
