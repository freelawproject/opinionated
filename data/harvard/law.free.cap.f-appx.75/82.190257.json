D\u2019Ambrosia was indicted for racketeering conspiracy. On April 5, 2001, he was granted bail pending trial on the condition that he post a $250,000 bond secured by property and that he be placed under house arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-24\">On August 30, 2001, pursuant to a motion filed by the government, a bail revocation hearing was held. The District Court found that D\u2019Ambrosia had violated the conditions of his home confinement, revoked his bail, and committed him to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement. D\u2019Ambrosia was the incarcerated, pending trial, at the Hudson County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-25\">On November 13, 2001, D\u2019Ambrosia moved to have the conditions of house arrest reinstated. On that date, the District Court permitted home confinement under strict conditions, including visual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>and electronic surveillance. On November 30, D\u2019Ambrosia pled guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). He admitted to advancing money to Joseph Servidio with reasonable grounds to believe that the money would be used to make an extortionate extension of credit to Thomas Caruso. He also admitted to conducting an illegal sports bookmaking operation. D\u2019Ambrosia\u2019s home detention was continued until sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On June 26, 2002, at sentencing, D\u2019Ambrosia moved for credit towards his sentence for home confinement. The District Court denied the motion on the ground that it was outside its authority to extend such a credit. D\u2019Ambrosia was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 30 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The District Court did not have jurisdiction to hear D\u2019Ambrosia\u2019s application for credit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585 because D\u2019Ambrosia had not exhausted his administrative remedies. <em>See United States v. Brann, </em>990 F.2d 98 (3d Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Checchini, </em>967 F.2d 348 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>65 F.3d 814 (10th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>931 F.2d 761 (11th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. McGee, </em>60 F.3d 1266 (7th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">The replacement of \u00a7 3568 by \u00a7 3585 did not change the Attorney General\u2019s delegation to the Bureau of Prisons of the authority to determine credit for time served in custody. Pursuant to this authority, the Bureau\u2019s regulations set forth the procedures that the prisoner must pursue prior to seeking relief in the district court. <em>United States v. Lucas, </em>898 F.2d 1554 (11th Cir.1990). In <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992), the Supreme Court held that \u201c \u00a7 3585(b) does not authorize a district court to compute the credit at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 112 S.Ct. 1351; <em>accord Brann, </em>990 F.2d at 103-104. Rather, the Attorney General, acting through the Bureau of Prisons, has the authority to determine prior custody credit in the first instance. <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. at 334-335, 112 S.Ct. 1351; <em>accord Brann, </em>990 F.2d at 104. Therefore, D\u2019Ambrosia must exhaust his administrative remedies with the Bureau of Prisons before he may seek review of sentencing credit in the district court. <em>Brann, </em>990 F.2d at 103-104 (concluding that, because \u201c[t]he issue of whether there has been proper credit of any prior custody to the term of [defendant\u2019s] sentence is not ripe[,] ... [defendant] must first exhaust his administrative remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
