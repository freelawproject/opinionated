He challenges the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-17\">Lozano\u2019s presence at certain places and times supports the jury\u2019s finding that he was a member of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>319 F.3d 716, 721 (5th Cir.) (mere presence will not alone support an inference of conspiracy; however, this factor may be considered in finding conspiratorial activity), <em>cert. de</em>nied, \u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1939, 155 L.Ed.2d 857 (2003); <em>United States v. Paul, </em>142 F.3d 836, 840 (5th Cir.1998) (jury may find participation from defendant\u2019s presence when presence would be unreasonable for anyone other than a knowledgeable participant). In addition, Benjamin Haro, a co-defendant, testified that Lozano and another codefendant were \u201cworking for the bosses\u201d and \u201cin charge\u201d. Because Haro\u2019s testimony was not \u201cfactually insubstantial or incredible\u201d, it is sufficient evidence to support Lozano\u2019s conspiracy conviction. <em>United States v. Westbrook, </em>119 F.3d 1176, 1190 (5th Cir.1997). In sum, \u201ca reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>226 F.3d 340, 343 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">Lozano\u2019s brief lists the sufficiency of evidence supporting his possession with intent to distribute conviction as an issue on appeal, but he does not discuss the issue in his brief. Because he has failed to brief this issue, it is abandoned. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>e.g., Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224 (5th Cir.1993) (failure to specifically brief issue results in its abandonment).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
