In rejecting Swatti\u2019s appeal, the BIA adopted the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) findings that Swatti was not a credible witness and that his claims of persecution were not worthy of belief. Contrary to Swatti\u2019s argument, the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision did not constitute error. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">This court will not disturb BIA decisions based purely on an IJ\u2019s assessment of the alien\u2019s credibility. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Swat-ti\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
