Murungi, <em>pro se, </em>initiated an action in federal district court in August 2000 against Theodore Pudhorodsky, Kerry Grant, David Robins, Thomas Wisnieski, and Delores Anzalone, who had supervised the plaintiffs employment as a pharmacist at the Veterans\u2019 Authority Medical Centers in Buffalo and Canandaigua, New York. Murungi\u2019s complaint claimed that defendants discriminated against him on the basis of his race, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint also alleged tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, assault, battery, false imprisonment, and destruction of personal property. The plaintiff sought monetary damages against each of the defendants in his or her individual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-19\">The district court ruled against Murungi\u2019s various claims on an assortment of different grounds, dismissing some under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) and granting summary judgment on others. We have no more to add to the court\u2019s careful treatment of the issues, and so, for substantially the reasons stated by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-15\">. Murungi's earlier Title VII suit against the VA for terminating him and creating a hostile working environment on the basis of his race, resulted in a summary judgment ruling for the defendant. <em>See Murungi v. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>136 F.Supp.2d 154 (W.D.N.Y.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>20 Fed.Appx. 63, 2001 WL 1182801 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
