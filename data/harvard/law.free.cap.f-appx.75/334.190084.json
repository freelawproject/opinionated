Defendant now appeals, claiming that the police violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they stopped a vehicle in which he was a passenger, and that evidence obtained as a result of that stop should have been suppressed. For the reasons set forth below, we reject these arguments and AFFIRM Jones\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">On February 14, 2001, police in Flint, Michigan sent an informant to a residence at 1502 Illinois Street to make a controlled purchase of illegal narcotics. The informant did not purchase the drugs because the target seller was not at the residence. Another person at the residence advised the informant that the target was at Old Frank\u2019s Bar at 2012 Lewis Street, attempting to obtain illegal narcotics to sell. The informant told police that the target was a stocky black man in an old, light green Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">Police then began a surveillance of Old Frank\u2019s Bar and observed the Defendants Appellant, Shantae Monique Jones, near and inside a silver Cadillac in the parking lot of Old Frank\u2019s Bar. Jones fit the physical description provided by the informant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Police also saw Jones\u2019s sister in the Cadillac.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Beginning at around 7:00 p.m. on February 14, 2001, police began following the Cadillac. The vehicle stopped twice at Jones\u2019s home, 1826 Walcott, once at the home of Jones\u2019s paramour, at the parking lot of a Chi Chi\u2019s restaurant, and at a Best Buy store. Police testified at Jones\u2019s trial that the Chi Chi\u2019s and Best Buy are located in an area known for drug trafficking. At the two residences and at the restaurant, Jones left the car and returned several minutes later. In the restaurant parking lot, Jones entered and exited a white Jeep Cherokee. Officer Marcus Mahan of the Flint Police Department testified that each time Jones returned to the car, \u201che would reach down between his legs.\u201d J.A. at 117. Officer Mahan stated that \u201cthere was definitely something on the floorboard that he was dealing with.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Officer Mahan told his supervisor, Sergeant Harold Payer, what he had seen. At Sergeant Payer\u2019s command, the ear was stopped at 9:40 p.m. Sergeant Payer testified that based on his twelve years\u2019 experience as a narcotics investigator, what he and his fellow officers observed that night made him suspicious of drug activity. It was Sergeant Payer\u2019s suspicion, together with the informant\u2019s information, that led Police to stop the Cadillac.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The officers approached the vehicle and, according to Sergeant Payer, sought permission to search the vehicle. Jones claims that his sister did not consent to the search of the Cadillac, which she was driving at the time it was pulled over. The government contends that Jones\u2019s sister consented to a search of the vehicle, and Sergeant Payer testified to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Police searched the ear and found a binocular bag containing the firearm upon which the first count of the indictment was based. Police arrested Jones for carrying a concealed weapon in a motor vehicle, in violation of state law, and took him to an interrogation room at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">At 11:28 p.m. on February 14, 2001, Jones was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Jones waived those rights and was interviewed by Sergeant Payer. Jones initially gave conflicting accounts of where he lived, so police used a key that they had taken from Jones at the police station to turn the lock at 1826 Walcott and thus verify that it was Jones\u2019s residence. The police did not enter the residence at that time. Sergeant Payer testified that he requested, and Jones gave, permission for police to enter his home and seize three firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Sergeant Payer testified that, while looking for the weapons, police found what was later verified to be cocaine residue in plain view. The officers inside Jones\u2019s residence informed Sergeant Payer that cocaine was believed to have been found, at which point Sergeant Payer asked, and Jones gave, permission to search the entire house. Police found roughly 220 grams of crack cocaine and $7,000. Police never obtained a warrant to search Jones\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">During the course of his interview with Sergeant Payer, Jones made inculpatory statements. Jones made additional inculpatory statements in a separate interview conducted by Drug Enforcement Administration Task Force Agent Cedric Kendall between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. on February 15, 2001. Kendall testified that he does not think he read Jones the <em>Miranda </em>warnings before that interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Jones was indicted on one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(k), and one count of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). An evidentiary hearing was held on April 10, 2001. After that hearing, the defense filed a motion to suppress evidence seized from Jones\u2019s person, vehicle, and residence, as well all derivative evidence, resulting from searches conducted on February 14, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In an opinion and order dated May 18, 2001, the district court granted in part and denied in part the motion to suppress evidence. The district court ordered suppressed certain inculpatory statements made by Jones in an interview that took place on February 15, 2001. The district court held that the statements were obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), because Jones was not read his <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to the interview on February 15. The district court denied the motion to suppress with respect to all of the other challenged evidence. The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found Jones guilty on both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Jones filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, Jones argues that the district court erred in refusing to suppress evidence obtained after police stopped a car in which he was riding. Jones contends that the stop was illegal because the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, that criminal activity was afoot. Jones further contends that the subsequent search of the automobile, the seizure of a binocular bag containing a firearm, his arrest, his statement to police, and the search of his residence all resulted from the initial, illegal stop, and that any evidence obtained after and because of the illegal stop must be excluded under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>289 F.3d 392, 396 (6th Cir.2002). Conclusions of law, including determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id. </em>(citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">\n<em>B. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by the Government. U.S. Const. Amend. IV. Its protections extend to brief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 9, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The Supreme Court has held that in such cases, the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the police officer\u2019s action is supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot. <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989). In evaluating whether an officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, reviewing courts must look at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d to see whether the detaining officer has a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002) (citing <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417-18, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). \u201cThis process allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The likelihood of criminal activity \u201cneed not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In this case, the district court concluded that the officers\u2019 stop of Jones\u2019s Cadillac was supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The district court noted that police followed Jones and his sister around Flint for nearly three hours before pulling them over. During that time, the police were able to corroborate all but one of the verifiable details of the informant\u2019s tip.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, police observed what the district court characterized as \u201cconduct ... consistent with the behavior of a drug dealer seeking to resupply his inventory.\u201d J.A. at 67. The district court also credited Sergeant Payer\u2019s testimony that the Chi Chi\u2019s parking lot where Jones stopped was a known haven for drug activity. The district court concluded that the corroboration of the informant\u2019s tip and the behavior observed by the police during their surveillance of Jones were sufficient to create reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">We agree that the officers\u2019 actions in this case were supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The officers\u2019 reasonable suspicion was based on several factors. First, when their informant went to Jones\u2019s residence, he was advised that Jones, a black male with a stocky build, had gone to Old Frank\u2019s Bar in an old Cadillac to acquire additional cocaine to sell. Second, police saw a man matching the informant\u2019s description in an old Cadillac outside of Old Frank\u2019s Bar. Third, police followed Jones and his sister around Flint as they made a series of brief stops, including one at a restaurant parking lot notorious for drug activity. Fourth, each time Jones returned to the vehicle, he reached down between his legs, \u201cdealing with ... something on the floorboard,\u201d according to the officer who observed this behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">It is true that some of the actions just described, if viewed in isolation, may not give rise to reasonable suspicion. As the district court noted, \u201cthere is nothing criminal or suspect about being a stocky black man in an old Cadillac at Old Frank\u2019s Bar at a specific time.\u201d J.A. at 66. Furthermore, reaching down between one\u2019s legs after getting into a car is not nec\u00e9ssarily suspicious behavior: a person driving around town distributing fliers might do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-11\">However, the Supreme Court has stated that a series of actions may give rise to reasonable suspicion even though each action was \u201cperhaps innocent in itself.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868. We believe that based on the totality of the circumstances of this case, the officers had a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. Based on information provided by an informant, police were looking for a stocky, black male who, they were told, had gone to Old Frank\u2019s Bar in a Cadillac to purchase drugs. The officers went to Old Frank\u2019s Bar and found a stocky, black male in a Cadillac. They followed him as he made a series of brief stops, after each of which he would manipulate objects on the floor of the car. The officers, drawing \u201con then-own experience and specialized training,\u201d including their knowledge that one of Jones\u2019s stops was at a place known for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>drug activity, reasonably suspected that Jones was involved in drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Moreover, several of Jones\u2019s actions are difficult to characterize as innocent. For example, the brief of the appellant states that \u201c[tjhere is certainly nothing unusual about an individual talking to another individual in the parking lot of a restaurant, even one in an area where know narcotics trafficking has occurred.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 20-21. However, in this case, what was observed at the Chi Chi\u2019s was not merely \u201can individual talking to another individual.\u201d Police saw Jones enter and exit a white Jeep Cherokee, and when Jones returned to the Cadillac, he was seen manipulating something between his legs on the floor of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Jones argues that much of the evidence against him should have been suppressed because it flowed from the allegedly unconstitutional stop of the Cadillac. Jones accurately recites both the Exclusionary Rule and the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. However, neither principle applies in this case to render the evidence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits illegally seized evidence from being used against an accused. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Unless a defendant has standing to challenge a search and seizure, the evidence obtained will not be suppressed. <em>See United States v. Salvucci </em>448 U.S. 83, 100 S.Ct. 2547, 65 L.Ed.2d 619 (1980). Specifically, a defendant must show that (1) he manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search, and (2) society is prepared to recognize that expectation as legitimate. <em>California v. Ciraolo, </em>476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In this case, Jones has not shown that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in either his sister\u2019s car or the binocular bag in which the firearm was found. A passenger in a car has no reasonable expectation of privacy that would permit him to challenge a search of the car on Fourth Amendment grounds, <em>United States v. Twilley, </em>222 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Eylicio-Montoya, </em>70 F.3d 1158, 1162 (10th Cir.1995), and Jones has introduced <em>no </em>evidence that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the binocular bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The other evidence used to convict Jones was obtained when police searched his home. The Government claims that Jones consented to a search of his home. Jones apparently does not deny that he gave police permission to enter his home. Instead, Jones argued in the district court that any consent given was involuntary. As the district court explained, Jones failed to show that his consent was involuntary. On appeal, Jones has again failed to produce any evidence that his consent was involuntarily given. Rather, he merely resurrects arguments that the district court properly rejected. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pro Se Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4 (\u201cNo consent to search form was used.... \u201d). For these reasons, the searches of the Cadillac, the binocular bag, and Jones\u2019s residence were all legal, and evidence obtained during these searches was properly allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Jones also argues that the evidence obtained in the various searches must be excluded under the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine. Evidence obtained through the exploitation of police illegality is inadmissible. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). Jones argues that all of the evidence used against him flowed directly from the allegedly illegal stop of the Cadillac on February 14, 2001. We agree, and the Government does not dispute, that the evidence obtained during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>searches of the Cadillac and Jones\u2019s residence is traceable to the initial stop. However, the initial stop of the Cadillac on February 14, 2001 was not illegal. Therefore, we must reject Jones\u2019s \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">For these reasons, the defendant\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">. We now know that the Cadillac belongs to Jones\u2019s sister.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">.
