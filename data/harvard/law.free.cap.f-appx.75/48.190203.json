Shaffer brought suit against defendant SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories (\u201cSmith-Kline\u201d) in February 1998, alleging that, in 1990, SmithKline negligently failed to diagnose a tissue sample from a malignant legion in her leg and that the misdiagnosis caused her to suffer from a metastic malignant melanoma in her groin in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In March 2002, the District Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the case proceeded to trial. At trial, both sides were represented by counsel, and both sides presented expert testimony regarding whether SmithKline\u2019s failure to diagnosis the malignant legion in Shaffer\u2019s leg in 1990 caused the melanoma in her groin seven years later. At the close of evidence, both parties moved for a directed verdict, and both motions were denied. On June 20, 2002, the jury returned a verdict in favor of SmithKline. The jury found that (1) SmithKline was negligent in failing to diagnose Shaffer\u2019s 1990 legion as a malignant melanoma, but that (2) this negligence was not \u201ca substantial factor in causing [Shaffer\u2019s] latter melanoma.\u201d Trial Tr. at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Shaffer\u2019s counsel moved to set aside the verdict pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 on the ground that it was \u201cabsolutely contrary to the weight of credible evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568. In a memorandum and order dated July 11, 2002, the District Court denied the motion, stating that \u201cthe jury could have reasonably decided to credit [the defense\u2019s expert witness\u2019s] opinion, and [to] reject the opinion of [the plaintiffs experts].\u201d On July 18, 2002, judgment was entered in favor of SmithKline, and Shaffer timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">On appeal, Shaffer (now proceeding <em>pro </em>se) argues that the evidence presented at trial did not support the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the defendants. We have previously held, however, that \u201ca trial court\u2019s ruling assessing the weight of the evidence\u201d under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 is not reviewable on appeal. <em>See Stonewall Ins. Co. v. Asbestos Claims Management Corp., </em>73 F.3d 1178, 1199 (2d Cir.1995). Instead, a plaintiffs \u201conly appellate recourse is to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence\u201d presented at trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">Generally, an appellant may not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal unless she filed a motion for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 following the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See, e.g., Varda, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>45 F.3d 634, 638 (2d Cir.1995). Because Shaffer failed to comply with this requirement, her sufficiency-of-the-evidenee claims are only reviewable on appeal if \u201c[the] jury\u2019s verdict is wholly without legal support\u201d and, therefore, a new trial is necessary \u201cto prevent a manifest injustice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sojak v. Hudson Waterways Corp., </em>590 F.2d 53, 54 (2d Cir.1978) (per curiam)). In this case, the jury chose to credit Smith-Kline\u2019s experts rather than Shaffer\u2019s experts. This credibility determination was not \u201cwholly without legal support.\u201d Accordingly, Shaffer\u2019s suffieiency-of-the-evidence claim is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">We have considered all of the Shaffer\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
