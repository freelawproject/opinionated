Illinois Tool Works, Inc. et al. (ITW) oppose and move to dismiss Independent Ink\u2019s appeal. Independent Ink replies.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-24\">Independent Ink timely filed a notice of appeal with this court from the order of the United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissing Independent Ink\u2019s complaint alleging federal and state false advertising claims against ITW. Independent Ink now concedes that its \u201ccomplaint did not in any way, shape or form involve claims\u201d over which this court would have jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1292(c), (d), and 1295. ITW agrees, but argues that the interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>of justice do not warrant transfer and this court should dismiss the appeal as \u201cclearly-doomed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We decline ITW\u2019s invitation to review the merits of a matter not within our subject matter jurisdiction. Any challenge to the merits of Independent Ink\u2019s appeal should be made in the Ninth Circuit.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">(1) Independent Ink\u2019s motion is granted and this case shall be transferred to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">(2) ITW\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b785-19\"> We reject ITW\u2019s contention that Independent Ink\u2019s failure to file a brief provides an \u201cadditional reason to deny [the] motion to transfer.\u201d Pursuant to Fed. Cir. R. 31(c), the motion to transfer suspended the briefing schedule.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
