We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual determinations concerning a petitioner\u2019s eligibility for asylum, and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>uphold them unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 <em>&amp; </em>n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Romero Contreras contends he was persecuted on account of his sexual orientation because police called him \u201cimmoral\u201d and extorted money from him, thieves robbed him, calling him \u201cgay,\u201d and a group of men beat him, calling him a \u201cfaggot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Contrary to the government\u2019s contention, Romero Contreras did raise the issue of his membership in a particular social group before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Nevertheless, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum because the harm suffered by Romero Contreras, although unfortunate, does not does rise to the level of persecution. <em>Cf. Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that gay man was persecuted where he was attacked by a mob and twice raped by Mexican police); <em>see Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995) (distinguishing between persecution and harassment or discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Romero Contreras, in failing to qualify for asylum, necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b721-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
