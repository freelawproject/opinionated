The only issue on appeal is whether Steele was entitled to the additional one-level reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">A sentencing court\u2019s determination regarding whether defendant is entitled to an adjustment to his base offense level for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l) is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Champion, </em>234 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">Steele\u2019s co-conspirator, Michael Robinson, made arrangements to buy six kilograms of cocaine from a confidential informant in March 2002. To do so, Robinson hired Steele to drive a rented van from Buffalo to Manhattan. Although over $160,000 was seized from the rental van, Steele admitted to knowing about only $30,000, which was sufficient to purchase between one and two kilograms of cocaine. In calculating Steele\u2019s offense level, the district court concluded, however, that it is \u201c[m]ore probable than not\u201d that appellant entered into an agreement involving more than five kilograms, as was charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">Steele argues that because the district court found he admitted every element of the charged offense and granted him a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a), he is entitled to the additional one point under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l). This argument is contrary to the plain language of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-19\">The additional one-level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l) is improper given that Steele did not \u201ctimely provid[e] complete information to the government concerning his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>own involvement in the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(l). The Guidelines\u2019 plain language requires that Steele\u2019s admission be complete; however, by not admitting the quantity of drugs the district court found attributable to him by a preponderance of the evidence, he did not provide complete information even though he sufficiently admitted his involvement in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court\u2019s determination here was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
