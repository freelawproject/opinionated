Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence. <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002). We grant the petition and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Minor discrepancies cited in Singh\u2019s testimony regarding the date of his arrest, and if or why Singh was not wearing a turban at his initial appearance, do not relate to his alleged fear of persecution, and cannot form the basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>See Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 655, 660 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Nor was a note provided by Singh\u2019s doctor in India describing \u201cgrievous injuries on several parts of his body,\u201d inconsistent with Singh\u2019s testimony simply because it failed to mention a chest injury. <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cA mere omission of one detail included in Singh\u2019s oral testimony does not make the letter logically inconsistent or incompatible.\u201d). Moreover, Singh showed a scar on his chest at his deportation hearing, thereby corroborating his claim of torture. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s observations regarding Singh\u2019s religious beliefs, Singh\u2019s participation in the Sikh nationalist movement, and the political situation in India, appear to be based on conjecture which \u201ccannot be substituted for objective and substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence, we remand for a determination of whether Singh\u2019s testimony qualifies him for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 17-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to <em>or by </em>the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
