We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Francisco testified that his father refused to allow the Guatemalan military and a guerilla group to forcibly recruit Francisco for military service when he was a boy. The evidence presented does not establish that the recruitment attempts were on account of Francisco\u2019s real or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that Francisco was persecuted or reasonably fears persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1490 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-18\">As Francisco has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he has necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960-61 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b719-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
