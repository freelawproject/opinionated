Mejia argues that she established past persecution on account of her political commitment to the plight of the indigenous and on account of her membership in the group of non-indigenous Hondurans who are politically active on behalf of the indigenous.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-22\">When, as in this case, the BIA adopts without opinion the IJ\u2019s decision, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. I.N.S., </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Here, the IJ\u2019s determination that Mejia was ineligible for asylum because Mejia had not shown past persecution on account of any protected ground was supported by substantial evidence, and the evidence presented does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>303 F.3d 341, 350 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Girma v. I.N.S., </em>283 F.3d 664, 669 (5th Cir.2002). Consequently, Mejia has also not made the requisite showing for withholding of removal. <em>Girma, </em>283 F.3d at 666-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Based on the foregoing, Mejia\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
