In 1989, she allegedly became pregnant again. Zou asserted that Chinese officials forced her to abort this pregnancy and that she fled China four years later in order to escape persecution for violating China\u2019s family planning policy. Zou claimed that she had two more children after her arrival in the United States, and that all four of her children now live in China. She also conceded that, in 1994, she obtained a Chinese passport and returned to China for a period of time in order to visit her ailing mother and that she had no trouble with the Chinese authorities during this visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">On May 1, 1998, an immigration judge (\u201cU\u201d) issued an oral decision in which she found that Zou was not credible, denied her applications for asylum and for withholding of removal, and ordered her removed from the United States. On May 31, 2001, the BIA dismissed Zou\u2019s appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>from the IJ\u2019s order in a one sentence, per curiam opinion, thereby rendering the IJ\u2019s opinion the final agency determination. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.1(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that she was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of, <em>inter alia, </em>her political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1101(a)(42); <em>see also Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 284 (2d Cir.2000). An applicant for withholding of removal bears the even greater burden of establishing that her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [the] country because of [her] ... political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). For purposes of asylum and withholding, \u201ca person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization ... shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,\u201d and \u201ca person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Accordingly, Zou would be eligible for asylum if she had established that she was forced to have an abortion by Chinese officials or that she is likely to be forcibly sterilized or persecuted for refusing sterilization upon her return to China.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">When reviewing the denial of an application for asylum, federal courts defer to the immigration court\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287; <em>see also INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir.2001). In other words, where a party challenges the factual findings of the immigration court, we will disturb that court\u2019s decision only if, on the evidence presented, \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find ... past persecution or fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 287. The scope of our review of the immigration court\u2019s factual findings is therefore \u201cexceedingly narrow.\u201d <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). Further, we give \u201cparticular deference to the credibility determinations of the IJ.\u201d <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">We hold that \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d existed to support the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Zou had not been persecuted and that she did not have a well-founded fear of persecution if removed to China. The immigration judge found \u201cserious inconsistencies\u201d in Zou\u2019s testimony regarding the events surrounding her alleged forced abortion. Oral Decision of the Immigration Judge, May 1, 1998, at 8. For example, in her written application Zou stated that Chinese officials noticed that she was pregnant with her third child and then came to her house take her for an abortion. However, according to her testimony at the hearing, the officials simply came to take her for a routine checkup and discovered her pregnancy during the examination. The immigration judge also determined that Zou\u2019s testimony was \u201cextremely vague and lacking in specific detail except regarding the induced labor,\u201d and the judge declined to accept Zou\u2019s contention that this vagueness was attributable to memory loss she suffered as a result of a car accident in 1997. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The immigration judge declined to credit the testimony of Zou\u2019s cousin, who claimed to have been an eyewitness to the events surrounding Zou\u2019s forced abortion. The immigration judge explained that \u201cthe witness\u2019 testimony was extremely hesitant, evasive, and unresponsive and at times the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>witness contradicted herself, particularly regarding where the applicant lived and where this incident occurred, at one point indicating it happened at the applicant\u2019s house and at another point indicating it happened at the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. The immigration judge also cited the 1998 State Department Report on country conditions in China, which indicated that consular officials did not find any evidence of forced abortions in the province of China where Zou lived and that they were unaware of any \u201cabortion certificates\u201d resembling the one presented to the immigration court by Zou. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">These findings adequately support the immigration judge\u2019s decision to discredit the testimony given by Zou and her cousin as well as the documentary evidence Zou presented. Accordingly, substantial evidence existed to support the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Zou \u201cfailed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution or past persecution ... if returned to China,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, and that Zou is therefore ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is hereby denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-10\">. Because the deportation proceedings began prior to April 1, 1997 and the BIA\u2019s decision was issued after October 30, 1996, this Court has jurisdiction to consider Zou\u2019s petition for review under the transitional provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (''IIRIRA\u201d) \u00a7 309(c)(4), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-626. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 282 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
