Rakoff, <em>Judge), </em>dismissing with prejudice Ortiz\u2019s petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, the All Writs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-24\">This case has a convoluted procedural history that begins in New York State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Supreme Court, Bronx County, in 1982, with Ortiz pleading guilty to Criminal Sale of a Controlled Substance in the Fifth Degree (New York Penal Law \u00a7 220.81). Ortiz was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation and he did not, at that time, appeal (or otherwise challenge) his state court conviction. He apparently completed his term of probation without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In 1990, however, Ortiz was convicted, after a jury trial, of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 2.1 kilograms of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. <em>See Ortiz v. United States, </em>No. 92 Civ. 2491, 1995 WL 130516, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. March 24, 1995). Based on the 1982 state court conviction, the District Court (Nicholas Tsoucalas, <em>Judge, </em>sitting by designation) sentenced Ortiz as a career criminal principally to 600 months\u2019 incarceration and he is currently serving that sentence. <em>See id. </em>at *3. Ortiz\u2019s appeal of that conviction, challenging only the scope of the government\u2019s cross-examination of him at trial, was denied. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Beginning in March 1992, Ortiz filed several unsuccessful motions in federal court, challenging his federal conviction and sentence, which did not raise any issues about the validity of his state court conviction (the argument that he now asserts). His first motion- \u2014 to vacate his federal sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u2014 argued, <em>inter alia, </em>ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See id. </em>On March 24, 1995, the District Court (Sonia Sotomayor, Judge) denied that motion on the merits, <em>see id. </em>at *2, and, on appeal, we affirmed, <em>see Ortiz v. United States, </em>No. 95-2584, 1996 WL 498136 (2d Cir. Sept. 3, 1996) (table). And on February 27, 1996, Judge Tsoucalas, who had originally sentenced Ortiz, denied Ortiz\u2019s petition to reduce his sentence, on grounds different irom those presented here, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Ortiz v. United States, </em>Nos. 89 Cr. 810, 92 Civ. 2491, 1996 WL 82349, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In the meantime, in 1993, Ortiz filed in the district court a \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his 1982 state court conviction. This petition was denied without prejudice because of Ortiz\u2019s failure to exhaust available state remedies. In October 1993, we dismissed Ortiz\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Between February and November 1998, Ortiz filed three motions in New York state court to vacate the 1982 judgment pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10. These motions were each denied and the Appellate Division, First Department, in all three cases, denied Ortiz leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">On January 31, 2000, Ortiz filed another \u00a7 2255 motion challenging the use of an allegedly tainted state conviction to enhance his federal sentence. The District Court (Thomas P. Griesa, <em>then-Chief Judge) </em>transferred Ortiz\u2019s motion to this Court, construing it as a second or successive motion. This Court treated the motion as an application to file a successive petition and denied the application on May 22, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">In July 2000, Ortiz filed the instant petition, styled as a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651, in which he argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that his 1982 conviction violated his due process rights because \u201cthe plea was induced by the court\u2019s promise that if the petitioner entered a plea of guilty he would receive probation.\u201d Soon thereafter, in December 2000, Ortiz filed a \u00a7 2254 petition (his second), arguing that his due process rights were violated when the state court judge took an active role in the plea bargaining that led to his 1982 conviction. Both the <em>coram nobis </em>petition and the \u00a7 2254 petition were assigned by the District Court (Jed S. Rakoff, <em>Judge) </em>to a magistrate judge (James C. Francis, <em>Magistrate Judge).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>On October 9, 2001, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the district court dismiss Ortiz\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition because, <em>inter alia, </em>(i) the petition was untimely filed; and (ii) the claim could not be reviewed because Ortiz was challenging a state conviction for which his sentence had expired but which had formed the basis for enhancing a federal sentence that he was. then serving, and, under <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 380-82, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001), absent rare circumstances, such state convictions are conclusively presumed valid. By its order dated January 25, 2002, and over Ortiz\u2019s objection, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s findings and denied Ortiz\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. In January 2003, we dismissed Ortiz\u2019s appeal, affirming the District Court\u2019s holding that his habeas petition was untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">In October 2001, after issuing a Report and Recommendation concerning Ortiz\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, the Magistrate Judge issued an order directing Ortiz to submit an affidavit stating why his <em>coram nobis </em>petition should not be dismissed on the same grounds. Ortiz failed to respond to this order and, on November 16, 2001, the Magistrate Judge recommended that the <em>coram nobis </em>petition be dismissed. The District Court adopted this recommendation, dismissing Ortiz\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>petition with prejudice for the reasons stated in the October 9, 2001 Report and Recommendation. Judgment was entered on May 21, 2002, and Ortiz timely filed his notice of appeal on May 27, 2002. The District Court subsequently denied Ortiz\u2019s application for a Certificate of Appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On appeal, Ortiz argues that the District Court improperly applied the \u00a7 2254 time limitations and standard of review to his <em>coram nobis </em>petition. The State argues, however, that Ortiz\u2019s petition was properly construed as a \u00a7 2254 petition and that we should dismiss Ortiz\u2019s appeal because he has not received the requisite Certificate of Appealability. In the alternative, the State asserts that Ortiz should not be afforded the \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d of <em>co-ram nobis </em>because he has not alleged any constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Ortiz is correct that federal courts have the authority to grant a writ of error <em>co-ram nobis </em>under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954); <em>Fleming v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 88, 89 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam). In more recent decisions, however, the Supreme Court has clarified that \u201c \u2018[t]he All Writs Act is a <em>residual </em>source of authority to issue writs that are <em>not otherwise covered by statute. </em>Where a statute specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 429, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (emphasis added) (refusing to grant writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>where Rule 29 governed particular issue in question) (quoting <em>Penn. Bureau of Corr. v. United States Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985) (refusing to invoke ad hoe authority under All Writs Act where remedy sought was, in essence, a writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>habeas corpus <em>ad testificandum </em>governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243)).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">In this ease, Ortiz asserts that a prior, invalid state conviction was improperly used to enhance his current federal sentence. The relief sought by Ortiz-a reduction in the federal sentence that he is currently serving \u2014 is \u201ccovered by\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that Ortiz cannot actually obtain relief under this statute, <em>see infra, </em>does not change the result mandated by <em>Carlisle, </em>particularly where, as here, his reliance on <em>coram nobis </em>is merely a transparent attempt to circumvent the procedural obstacles that barred his \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201cPrisoners bringing actions that fall within the scope of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 may not evade the restrictions on such actions by seeking a writ of coram nobis.\u201d <em>United States v. McCrory, </em>No. 01-3008, 2001 WL 936382, at *1 (D.C.Cir. July 19, 2001) (unpublished per curiam); <em>see also Godoski v. United States, </em>304 F.3d 761, 763 (7th Cir.2002) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1304, 154 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2003); <em>United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188, 189-90 (3d Cir.2000) (same). Accordingly, under the <em>Car-lisle </em>rule, the District Court properly denied Ortiz\u2019s petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">As noted above, even if Ortiz had properly characterized his petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, he would not preval\u00ed. He has already attempted to challenge his state conviction in the \u00a7 2255 motion that he filed on January 31, 2000. That motion was dismissed by the District Court because Ortiz had not obtained permission to file a second and successive petition, and we subsequently denied Ortiz\u2019s application for such permission. (Because Ortiz is merely leveling the same arguments, we need not reconsider the denial of that application.) As such, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to consider Ortiz\u2019s application as a \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order denying Ortiz\u2019s petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-5\">. It is not clear, under Second Circuit case-law, whether <em>coram nobis </em>can be used in federal court to attack a state court judgment. In a recent opinion, the Third Circuit joined four other circuits in holding that a defendant \"can seek coram nobis relief [for a state court conviction] only in state court.\u201d <em>See Obado v. New Jersey, </em>328 F.3d 716, 718 (3d Cir.2003) (collecting cases from the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and Tenth Circuits). Because we find, for other reasons, that the relief Ortiz seeks is unavailable, we need not resolve this question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\"><em>. </em>Ortiz concedes that he cannot bring a \u00a7 2254 petition because he is no longer in state custody. <em>See Lackawanna County Dist. Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 401, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001) (explaining that defendant is not in state custody under \u00a7 2254 merely because his prior state conviction was used to enhance his current sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">. Even if Ortiz\u2019s petition were cognizable as a <em>coram nobis </em>petition, it would lack merit. In reviewing a petition for a writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>a federal court must \u201cpresume the proceedings were correct.\u201d <em>Nicks v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 161, 167 (2d Cir.1992). \"[RJelief under the writ is strictly limited to those cases in which errors ... of the most fundamental character have rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.\u201d <em>Foont v. United States, </em>93 F.3d 76, 78 (2d Cir.1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Ortiz has failed to demonstrate that the \"extraordinary remedy\u201d of <em>coram nobis </em>would be appropriate in this instance. <em>Fleming, </em>146 F.3d at 90, 91 (quoting <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. at 511). He does not provide so much as a scintilla of documentation that his state <em>court </em>conviction was illegal or unjust, or that sound reasons exist for his failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-13\">. Although we need not reach these issues, the District Court also properly determined that, even if construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion, Ortiz\u2019s application is time-barred and merit-less. In <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001), the Supreme Court held that a petitioner in Ortiz\u2019s position-who objects to the use of a prior state conviction to enhance his federal sentence-\"may not collaterally attack his pri- or conviction through a motion under \u00a7 2255\u201d because \u201d[t]he presumption of validity that attached to the prior conviction at the time of sentencing is conclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382. The only possible exception to this rule, according to the <em>Daniels </em>Court, might arise in a case where the defendant alleged that the prior conviction was \"the product of a <em>Gideon [v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)] violation.\" <em>Id.; cf. United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (granting relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>under \u00a7 2255 to petitioner whose federal sentence was enhanced based on prior state convictions where petitioner had not been represented by counsel in violation of Gideon). Ortiz makes no such allegation and, as such, his \u00a7 2255 motion would fail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
