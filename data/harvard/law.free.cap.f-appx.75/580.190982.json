The district. court\u2019s voluntariness determination is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. Sherwood, </em>98 F.3d 402, 403 (9th Cir.1996). Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s statement was spontaneous and not the result of interrogation, and therefore its admission did not violate her <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). Nor was the statement coerced in any way, which satisfies the Fifth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Bautista-Avila, </em>6 F.3d 1360, 1364 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-21\">Second, we review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to exclude under Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(d)(2) the testimony of Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s expert accountant as a sanction for Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(b)(1)(C). <em>See United States v. Mandel, </em>914 F.2d 1215, 1219 (9th Cir.1990). The district court had evidence before it from which it could reasonably conclude that Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s discovery violation was willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage. <em>See United States v. Finley, </em>301 F.3d 1000, 1018 (9th Cir.2002). Therefore we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-22\">Third, we review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s motion to sever her trial. <em>See United States v. Sarkisian, </em>197 F.3d 966, 975 (9th Cir.1999). Because Asensio-Boyadzyhan has not met her burden of showing that a manifest injustice resulted from the joint trial, the denial of her motion stands. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Finally, we review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of Asensio-Boyadzhyan\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal based upon insufficient evidence of intent. <em>See United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 767 (9th Cir.2000). After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Asensio-Boyadzhyan knowingly participated in the crimes of which she was charged. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
