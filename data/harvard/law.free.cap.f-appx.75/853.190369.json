Hunt Transport Inc. (\u201cHunt\u201d) $175,157.65 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses and Hunt cross-appeals the district court\u2019s order denying recovery for two categories of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">On February 8, 2001, the district court granted summary judgment for Hunt and denied the EEOC\u2019s summary judgment motion. <em>EEOC v. Hunt, </em>128 F.Supp.2d 117, 135-36 (N.D.N.Y.2001). In the underlying enforcement action, the EEOC alleged that Hunt violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq., </em>by discriminating against a class of applicants. The district court held that the EEOC failed to show that the claimants were actually disabled or perceived as disabled within the meaning of the ADA. 128 F.Supp.2d at 126. On February 5, 2003, this court, in a divided opinion, affirmed the district court\u2019s summary judgment order on different grounds. <em>EEOC v. Hunt, </em>321 F.3d 69, 71 (2d Cir.2003). On February 22, 2001, while the EEOC\u2019s appeal of the summary judgment order was pending, Hunt filed a motion to recover attorney\u2019s fees and expenses for $299,342.19. On September 27, 2001, the district court granted Hunt\u2019s motion in part and denied it in part by ordering the EEOC to pay Hunt $175,157.65 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. <em>EEOC v. Hunt, </em>No. 97-CV-1553, 2001 WL 1217201, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Sept.27, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The ADA permits the court in its discretion to allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses and costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (2003). In <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>the Supreme Court, in setting forth standards to guide the district court\u2019s discretion, held that fees are recoverable \u201cupon a finding that the plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">A determination of whether the prevailing defendant is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees \u201cis not a purely factual inquiry ... [but instead] requires an evaluation of the allegations and the proof in light of the controlling principles of substantive law. Thus, such a determination is ordinarily reviewed not for clear error but rather for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, </em>143 F.3d 765, 770 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Here, the district court abused its discretion in ordering the EEOC to pay attorney\u2019s fees. Irrespective of whether the EEOC\u2019s case regarding the applicants\u2019 disabilities is ultimately correct as a matter of law, the inquiry here is far more limited and asks only whether the EEOC\u2019s case was frivolous or unreasonable. We conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to the merits. This Court affirmed the dismissal, but we did so on grounds less expansive than those on which the district court had ruled \u2014 and even so, it is telling that the panel was divided. While the district court faulted the EEOC for failing to identify the precise nature of each applicant\u2019s disability or perceived disability, 128 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>F.Supp.2d at 126-27, 128, the majority of this Court held only that the evidence in this case was insufficient to support a finding that Hunt regarded the rejected applicants as disabled because Hunt\u2019s driving jobs were different from other truck driving jobs. <em>EEOC v. Hunt, </em>821 F.3d at 75. Unlike the district court, the majority did not find that the EEOC\u2019s failure to identify a disability was fatal to its claim; the majority affirmed the <em>summary </em>dismissal without ruling on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The dissenting judge stated that the summary judgment should be reversed because the EEOC had submitted substantial evidence showing that the applicants were discriminated against based on Hunt\u2019s perception of them as disabled. <em>Id. </em>at 88. This opinion should all but preclude a finding that the EEOC\u2019s claim was unreasonable or frivolous on that ground. <em>See Busby v. City of Orlando, </em>931 F.2d 764, 787 (11th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">In sum, because the EEOC\u2019s case was not unreasonable, frivolous or groundless, the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees was an abuse of its discretion. Accordingly, the court hereby REVERSES the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Hunt. <em>A fortiori, </em>we must dismiss Hunt\u2019s cross appeal seeking to increase the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
