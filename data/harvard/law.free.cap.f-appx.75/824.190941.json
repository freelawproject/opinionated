(\u201cSchoeller-USA\u201d), appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York (Howard G. Munson, <em>Judge), </em>dismissing Great Northern\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction over Defendant-Appellee Constab Polymer-Chemie GmbH <em>&amp; </em>Co. (\u201cConstab\u201d) under New York\u2019s long-arm statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a). <em>See Great Northern Ins. Co. v. Constab Polymer-Chemie GMBH &amp; Co., </em>2002 WL 31084727 (N.D.N.Y. Sept.17, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Constab is a German corporation with its principal place of business in Germany. In 1993, Constab entered into an agreement with Schoeller-USA\u2019s German parent company, Felix Schoeller GmbH &amp; Co. KG (\u201cSchoeller-Germany\u201d), to \u201cregularly suppl[y] products for the production of photo papers\u201d to four of Schoeller-Germany\u2019s plants \u2014 including a plant located in Pulaski, New York.* The underlying claims in this action arise from Constab\u2019s alleged sale, distribution, and shipment to New York of a defective quantity of Masterbatch UV 1032 LD (\u201cMasterbatch\u201d), a chemical used in the manufacture of photographic papers. Schoeller-USA contends that the defective chemical caused its photographic paper to be commercially useless and that one of its major customers rejected its photographic paper as a result. Great Northern settled the customer\u2019s claims and subsequently brought this action as Schoeller\u2019s subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">Prior <em>to </em>discovery, Constab moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The District Court granted the motion, concluding that Schoeller-USA had not alleged a <em>prima facie </em>case of jurisdiction under either N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1) or \u00a7 302(a)(3)(ii). <em>See Great Northern Ins. Co., </em>2002 WL 31084727 at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>3-5, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-16\">We review the District Court\u2019s dismissal for want of personal jurisdiction <em>de novo. See Bank Brussels Lambert v. Fiddler Gonzalez &amp; Rodriguez, </em>305 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.2002). Because we conclude that Schoeller-USA has alleged a <em>prima facie </em>case of jurisdiction under the \u201ccontract[ing] ... to supply goods or services\u201d prong of N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1), we vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings to determine if the exercise of jurisdiction comports with federal due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-17\">New York\u2019s long-arm statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1), authorizes personal jurisdiction over any defendant who: \u201c[1] transacts any business within the state or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>[2] contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state\u201d if the cause of action arises from these in-state activities. In this case, Schoeller-USA alleges that Con-stab shipped defective chemicals to New York pursuant to a supply contract which expressly provides for the regular delivery of products to a New York plant. Moreover, it appears that Schoeller-USA sent two purchase orders for Masterbatch to Constab, and that Constab sent the invoice for these orders directly to New York. As Schoeller-USA claims that \u201cthere was a contract to ship goods to New York ... and goods were shipped under that contract,\u201d it has alleged a prima facie case of jurisdiction under the \u201ccontracting to supply goods\u201d prong of C.P.L.R. \u00a7 802(a)(1).<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> <em>Mario Valente Collezioni, Ltd. v. Confezioni Semeraro Paolo, S.R.L., </em>264 F.3d 32, 37 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see also Anderson Dev. Corp. v. Isoreg Corp., </em>154 A.D.2d 859, 546 N.Y.S.2d 720, 722 (3d Dep\u2019t 1989) (where \u201c[plaintiffs purchase contract and defendant\u2019s sales order and bill of lading all provide for shipment to New York,\u201d establishing defendant\u2019s knowledge that its equipment \u201cwas destined for New York,\u201d jurisdiction was proper under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1)); <em>Alan Lupton Assocs. v. Northeast Plastics, Inc., </em>105 A.D.2d 3, 482 N.Y.S.2d 647, 651 (4th Dep\u2019t 1984) (concluding that a single shipment of buttons to New York was sufficient to confer jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1) where \u201cthe clear import of [the contract\u2019s] terms indicate[d] that performance was contemplated in New York\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Despite the shipment of Masterbatch into New York pursuant to the supply contract, Constab argues that the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that the contract was executed in Germany by two German corporations and the absence of any other direct ties to New York precludes the exercise of jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1). While courts may conduct this type of fact-specific inquiry in analyzing whether jurisdiction is proper under the \u201ctransacting business\u201d prong of C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1), <em>see Agency Rent A Car Sys., Inc. v. Grand Rent A Car Corp., </em>98 F.3d 25, 29 (2d Cir.1996), such weighing is unnecessary under the more specific \u201ccontracting to supply goods\u201d prong where there is an express contract to ship goods to New York, <em>see, e.g, Mario Valente Collezioni, </em>264 F.3d at 37, as such a contract falls squarely within the statutory grant of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>****</footnotemark> <em>See Cavalier Label Co. v. Polytam, Ltd., </em>687 F.Supp. 872, 877 (S.D.N.Y.1988). We therefore find that Schoeller-USA has adequately alleged a <em>p\u00f1ma facie </em>case of jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Because the District Court determined that it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over Constab pursuant to C.P.L.R. \u00a7 302, it did not analyze whether the exercise of such jurisdiction would comport with federal due process. <em>See Mario Valente Collezioni, </em>264 F.3d at 37-38. Due to the absence of relevant findings and the lack of a full factual record, we remand to allow the District Court to undertake the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>necessary due process analysis. <em>See id. </em>at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is VACATED and the matter REMANDED to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-11\"> The other three plants were located in Germany.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b855-12\"> The District Court also dismissed all claims against defendant Ciba Spezialitatenchemie Lampertheim GmbH (\"Ciba\u201d) for lack of personal jurisdiction. <em>See Great Northern Ins. Co., 2002 </em>WL 31084727 at *2. Schoeller-USA is not appealing from that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b856-4\"> Constab argues that \u00a7 302(a)(1) does not apply, because Schoeller-USA was not a party to the underlying supply contract. However, \"[t]he plaintiff need not ... be in privity with the defendant in order to take advantage of the supply-of-goods-or-services prong of CPLR 302(a)(1).\u201d Vincent C. Alexander, <em>Practice Commentaries, </em>7B McKinney\u2019s Con-sol.
