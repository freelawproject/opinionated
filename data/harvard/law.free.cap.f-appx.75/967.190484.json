The Prisoner Litigation Reform Act does not apply to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 cases. <em>Carson v. Johnson, </em>112 F.3d 818, 820 (5th Cir.1997). Once the district court determined that Gray could proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal, there was no need to assess a partial filing fee or payment schedule for the appellate filing fees. Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Gray may proceed in his 2254 action without paying a filing fee. Furthermore, Gray fails to show that there is any money in his release account or that funds therein can be used to pay appellate filing fees. <em>See </em>Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 501.015(b). Gray\u2019s instant appeal is without arguable merit and dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. 42.2. His motion for relief from the district court order denying payment from his prison funds is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.
