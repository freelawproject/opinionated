Ward\u2019s violations occurred in connection with sales of securities known as \u201cinverse floaters\u201d to League City, Texas and Bryan, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-25\">\u201cWe uphold an agency\u2019s decision unless it is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u2019\u201d <em>Meadows v. SEC, </em>119 F.3d 1219, 1224 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A); <em>Hawkins v. Agric. Mktg. Serv., </em>10 F.3d 1125, 1128 (5th Cir.1993)). Section 25 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00a7 78y(a)(4) (2000), and \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(E) (2000), mandate that the Commission\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. Further, this court defines \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion,\u201d and \u201cmore than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Meadows, </em>119 F.3d at 1224 (quoting <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The administrative law judge ruled that Ward did not contravene the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Her decision was based on several credibility determinations. She found that Ward\u2019s testimony (that he fully disclosed the risks of the securities) was credible and that the contrary testimony of the city officials was not credible. Reviewing the ALJ\u2019s decision dismissing the proceedings against Ward, the Commission rejected the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations and found that Ward had failed to inform the city officials about the risks of investing in inverse floaters.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201c[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In addition, when an agency \u201cdoes not accept the findings of the administrative law judge, the Court of Appeals has an obligation to examine the evidence and findings of the [agency] more critically than it would if the [agency] and the ALJ were in agreement.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Fla. Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>576 F.2d 666, 674 (5th Cir.1978). \u201cAlthough this heightened scrutiny does not alter the substantial evidence standard of review, it does require us to apply it with a particularly keen eye, especially when credibility determinations are in issue____\u201d <em>Garcia v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, </em>10 F.3d 276, 280 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Even though the Commission reached different conclusions than the ALJ about the credibility of several witnesses, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commission\u2019s findings of fact. The Commission\u2019s careful and comprehensive opinion details significant documentary evidence that bolsters its credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b350-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
