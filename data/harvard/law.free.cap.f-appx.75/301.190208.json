They assert that they are eligible for voluntary departure under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">We note, as Ashcroft contends, that Petitioners did not challenge \u2014 either on appeal or in their motion to reconsider \u2014 the IJ\u2019s specific basis for denying voluntary departure. They did, however, alternatively request voluntary departure, both at the conclusion of their appellate brief and in their motion. Even if Petitioners\u2019 general requests for voluntary departure were otherwise sufficient to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, see <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 453 (5th Cir.2001), it would avail them nothing. We lack jurisdiction over their petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Section 1229e(f) provides that \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction over an appeal from [the] denial of a request for an order of voluntary departure under subsection (b) [which permits an IJ to grant voluntary departure at the conclusion of removal proceedings].... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). Thus, denials of requests for voluntary departure are not subject to judicial review by any court. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. I.N.S., </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Sofinet v. I.N.S., </em>196 F.3d 742, 748 (7th Cir.1999); <em>see also Eyoum v. I.N.S., </em>125 F.3d 889, 891 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) precludes this court\u2019s jurisdiction over denials of voluntary departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">To the extent that Petitioners challenge the summary affirmance procedure employed by the BIA, their argument is without merit. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832 (5th Cir.2003). For these reasons, their petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
