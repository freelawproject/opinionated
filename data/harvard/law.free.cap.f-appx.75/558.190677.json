After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a stay, because Cross-land did not identify the discovery he was lacking and how a continuance would have enabled him to obtain needed discovery. <em>See Alexander v. Pathfinder, Inc., </em>189 <em>F.3d 735, 744 </em>(8th Cir.1999). We also conclude summary judgment was proper because the government presented unrebutted evidence of probable cause, and Crossland failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the money represented proceeds from a legitimate business. <em>See United States v. Premises Known as 7725 Unity Ave. N., Brooklyn Park, Minn., </em>294 F.3d 954, 958 (8th Cir.2002). Finally, the forfeiture action was timely filed. <em>See United States v. Twenty-Seven Parcels of Real Prop. Located in Sikeston, Mo., </em>236 F.3d 438, 440 (8th Cir.2001) (statute of limitations).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b588-26\"> The Honorable Robert T.
