Bustillo argues that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution based on her political affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">When, as in this case, the Board of Immigration Appeals adopts without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s decision, this court reviews the immigration judge\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Here, the immigration judge\u2019s determination that Bustillo had not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to El Salvador was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, 78 F.3d </em>194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Bustillo's petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AG9\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir.
