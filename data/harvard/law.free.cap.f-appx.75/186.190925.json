She contends that she qualifies for relief even assuming that her claim of rape is false and maintains that the rape was not central to her claim. She further asserts that the credibility determination was in error because the IJ failed to take cultural considerations into account, she provided a reasonable explanation for the discrepancy on the rape claim, and the evidence in fact supports her rape claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-23\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record in light of the IJ\u2019s findings and conclude that Mohamed\u2019s assertions are without merit. As the negative credibility determination is supported by the record and is entitled to deference, Mohamed does not qualify for the relief sought. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2000); <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 323 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Matter of S-A-, </em>Int.

Dec. 1106, 1998 WL 99553 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
