McMillan argues that his claims were not barred by the statute of limitations and that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-24\">McMillan does not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s findings that his pleadings were all nonsensical and that they failed to state a cognizable cause of action. Although <em>pro se </em>briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even <em>pro se </em>litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because McMillan does <em>not </em>address the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim, he has abandoned this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-25\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that McMillan stated a cognizable 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against the defendants, his claim is prescribed. The actions underlying McMillan\u2019s complaint began in the early 1980s and continued until sometime in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1986. Thus, McMillan had two years, until 1988, to file a timely 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against the defendants for alleged violations of his civil rights. <em>See Owens v. Okure, </em>488 U.S. 235, 250, 109 S.Ct. 573, 102 L.Ed.2d 594 (1989); Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a) (West 2003). McMillan has not demonstrated that he is entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period. <em>See Holmes v. Texas A &amp; M Univ., </em>145 F.3d 681, 684-85 (5th 1998); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.001 (West 2003). Therefore, McMillan\u2019s complaint, which was filed in February 2002, is barred by the statute of limitations. Because McMillan can \u201cprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,\u201d the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284-85 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">In connection with his appeal, McMillian has filed a motion for authorization to file an out-of-time reply brief. In light of the disposition of his appeal, McMillan\u2019s motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
