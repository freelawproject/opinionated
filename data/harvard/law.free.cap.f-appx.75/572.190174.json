Because the transitional rules apply, <em>see Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gonzalez v. INS, </em>82 F.3d 903, 907-908 (9th Cir.1996), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-23\">Mysuria, represented by counsel, failed to raise in his opening brief any arguments challenging the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he was not eligible for asylum and withholding of deportation because he was likely involved in the persecution of Muslims for their religious beliefs, and because he has the option to resettle elsewhere in India to escape persecution. Moreover, Mysuria did not reply to the government\u2019s brief, in which it argued waiver. Therefore, Mysuria has waived his right to challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>(9th Cir.1996) (issue not argued in opening brief deemed waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b602-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
