After conducting thorough Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquies, the district court found each of the three Defendants guilty and subsequently sentenced them, respectively, to 235 months, 292 months, and 87 months of imprisonment, and five years of supervised release each.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">On appeal, Patterson challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of her criminal history points, denial of a one-point reduction for being a minor participant in the offense as well as denial of a downward departure for substantial assistance, and determination of drug weights attributable to her. We review Patterson\u2019s claims for plain error, as these objections are made for the first time on appeal, <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993), and find them to have no merit. First, the district court\u2019s determination that Patterson was a criminal history category IV is amply supported by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Patterson\u2019s claim that as a transporter of drugs she should have been given a reduction for being a minor participant fails. <em>United States v. Withers, </em>100 F.3d 1142, 1147 (4th Cir.1997). Her assertion that the district court should have granted her a reduction for substantial assistance is without merit because nothing in the record would support a finding that she earned a Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Finally, we reject Patterson\u2019s claim relative to drug weight. The evidence amply demonstrated that Patterson personally transported in excess of one kilogram of cocaine from Texas to South Carolina, which was then converted into \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d and distributed. While the basis for Patterson\u2019s challenge on appeal is that she was unaware the cocaine was being cooked into crack cocaine, her express admission to the district court at sentencing of this very fact belies this claim. We find the district court correctly held Patterson accountable for the multi-kilogram quantities of crack cocaine that were distributed by her co-conspirators. <em>United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1012-13 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Counsel for Blakely and James has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming sentencing errors, but concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Blakely has filed a supplemental brief; James has not, despite notification of her right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">We find to be meritless Blakely\u2019s specific claims on appeal. The district court did not plainly err in setting Blakely\u2019s base offense level at thirty-eight pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court properly applied a two-level enhancement to Blakely\u2019s offense level because he used a firearm in some of his drug transactions, and there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>was ample evidence presented that Blakely supervised a criminal conspiracy with more than five participants, warranting enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We review James\u2019 sole claim on appeal, made pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>for plain error,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and find that her allegation that she should have received a sentence of less than 87 months is not supported by the record. James pled guilty to possessing the cocaine and has admitted her involvement in the conspiracy. She received all downward departures for which she was eligible.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record as to Blakely and James and find no meritorious issues for appeal relative to either Appellant. There were no irregularities in the plea process, and we find that both Blakely and James were sentenced upon a proper application of the guidelines and consistent with statutory and constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Based upon the foregoing, we affirm the convictions and sentences of Patterson, Blakely, and James. In cases filed pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Patterson\u2019s claim is correct that she did not join the conspiracy until January 2001, because she joined within two years of her release from imprisonment, she qualified for an additional criminal history point under USSG \u00a7 4A1.1, and the sentence imposed by the district court falls within the sentencing range as otherwise calculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. Blakely\u2019s failure to object to any of these issues below requires us to review the claims on appeal for plain error. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-25\">. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-36.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
