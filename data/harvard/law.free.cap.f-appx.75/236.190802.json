She contends: (1) her conviction should be reversed because the prosecutor made an improper remark during closing argument (concerning jury\u2019s doing something about drug use in community); and (2) her sentence should be vacated because the district court erred by not granting her a two-level reduction in her total offense level due to her minor role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-16\">The claimed prosecutorial misconduct is reviewed under a two-step process by which we determine: (1) whether the comment was improper; and (2) whether it prejudiced Salvatierras substantive rights. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lankford, </em>196 F.3d 563, 574 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>529 U.S. 1119, 120 S.Ct. 1984, 146 L.Ed.2d 812 (2000). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the comment was improper, there was ample evidence for the jury to convict Salvatierra in the absence of the prosecutor\u2019s comment; therefore, she has not demonstrated that it prejudiced her substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Duffaut, </em>314 F.3d 203, 210-11 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Casilla, </em>20 F.3d 600, 606 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 892, 115 S.Ct. 240, 130 L.Ed.2d 163 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">A district court\u2019s determination that a defendant played more than a \u201cminor\u201d role for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 is reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001). Salvatierra\u2019s sentence was based on the conduct in which she was directly involved, namely the transportation of drugs across the border. Because her role in the offense was co-extensive with the conduct for which she was held accountable, the district court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>clearly err in denying the reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
