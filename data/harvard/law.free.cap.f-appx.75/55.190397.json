Reuter, President of the New York City Transit Authority (\u201cNYCTA\u201d), and two managers of NYCTA\u2019s Employee Assistance Program, Ronnie Sue Jaffe and Robert Finch. We affirm for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">Under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, \u201c[government enforcement of laws or policies that substantially burden the exercise of sincerely held religious beliefs is subject to strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>Fifth Ave. Presbyterian Church v. City of New York, </em>293 F.3d 570, 574 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, </em>508 U.S. 520, 546, 113 S.Ct. 2217, 124 L.Ed.2d 472 (1993)). Kreuter argues that an extended period of recheck testing imposed by NYCTA because of her refusal to acknowledge a lack of control over alcohol substantially burdens her religious beliefs. She does not, however, indicate why this acknowledgment requires her \u201cto profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.\u201d <em>Torcaso v. Watkins, </em>367 U.S. 488, 495, 81 S.Ct. 1680, 6 L.Ed.2d 982 (1961) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\">Assuming that plaintiff has a conscientious belief that she can control her conduct, the acknowledgment required is not to the contrary. Obviously, it is assumed that an alcoholic who acknowledges the challenge can overcome it; otherwise it must be assumed that NYCTA allows uncontrolled alcoholics to work in safety-sensitive posts. The plaintiff tries to argue that the inability to control alcoholism implies a need to involve a higher power in achieving abstention; but that is not expressed or necessarily implied in the required acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-18\">Kreuter also claims that NYCTA\u2019s conduct violates her right to \u201cself-conception\u201d but points to no case construing the 14th Amendment to identify this putative right. We have considered Kreuter\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
