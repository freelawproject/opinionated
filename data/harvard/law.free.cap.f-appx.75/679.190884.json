See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">The only question raised in this appeal is whether \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exist to warrant equitable tolling of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.8, the Department of Labor\u2019s ten-business day limitation period to file a petition for review of an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s recommended decision. Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we recount them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">\u201cExtraordinary circumstances\u201d is a very high standard that is only met where even the exercise of diligence would not have resulted in timely filing. <em>See, e.g., Stoll v. Runyon, </em>165 F.3d 1238, 1242 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201ccomplete psychiatric disability\u201d during the entirety of the limitations period); <em>Alvarez-Machain v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 696 (9th Cir.1996) (incarceration in a foreign country for the entirety of the limitations period). \u201cExtraordinary circumstances\u201d does not extend to excusable neglect. <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">While Mr. McGuigan\u2019s situation may amount to excusable neglect, it does not constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests that McGuigan was incapable of performing legal work during the limitations period. He was coming into the office, made at least one court appearance, and completed several summary judgment motions during that time. We therefore find that extraordinary circumstances did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Aon\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
