Dus\u00e9, <em>pro se, </em>appeals from an order and judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Arterton, J.), granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Dus\u00e9\u2019s action. Dus\u00e9 brought suit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), seeking to set aside a judgment in a prior case for fraud upon the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Dus\u00e9 primarily contends on appeal that the district court erred in concluding that his action was barred because he had raised the fraud claim in the underlying action. Dus\u00e9 argues that, although he raised the factual circumstances surrounding his claim in the underlying action, he did not actually raise the fraud upon the court claim itself. Thus, Dus\u00e9 argues, this claim was not fully litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">This Court \u201creview[s] a district court\u2019s dismissal of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Manning v. New York Univ., </em>299 F.3d 156, 162 (2d Cir.2002). Substantially for the reasons stated by the district court, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Duse v. IBM Corp., </em>212 F.R.D. 58 (D.Conn.2002). Although Dus\u00e9 now claims that he did not fully litigate this claim, Dus\u00e9 acknowledges that he disclosed the alleged fraud during the underlying lawsuit in opposition to IBM\u2019s summary judgment motion. Thus, the district court correctly found that the independent action was barred since Dus\u00e9 previously raised, or could have raised, the same fraud claim in the prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Dus\u00e9 raises several additional arguments on appeal which we have considered, and find to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIR1VIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
