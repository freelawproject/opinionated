Chapa argues that he has a protectable interest in his custodial classification because there has been an atypical, significant deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Although he alleges the existence of extraordinary circumstances, he has not shown any, and Chapa\u2019s placement in administrative segregation, without more, does not constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest. <em>See Lukin v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Chapa also argues that the district court\u2019s decision is not supported by evidence because he did not sign the self-admission form and that the district court erred in considering certain photographs. \u201cBecause [Chapa] relies on a legally nonexistent interest, any alleged due process or other constitutional violation arising from his classification is indisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Finally, Chapa\u2019s argument that the district court improperly denied him the opportunity to bring witnesses lacks merit. The district court sufficiently developed the facts. <em>See Parker v. Carpenter, </em>978 F.2d 190, 192 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1993). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-15\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Chapa\u2019s complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Chapa is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-16\">AFFIRMED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
