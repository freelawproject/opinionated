On appeal, he raises one issue: whether the district court erred by declining his proffered jury instruction regarding whether he knowingly possessed the ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">We do not find that the district court abused its discretion by declining to issue the disputed instruction. <em>United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 513 (4th Cir.1996). The instruction the district court used was adequate and accurate, <em>United States v. Pupo, </em>841 F.2d 1235, 1240 (4th Cir.1988), and its decision to deny the instruction did not constitute reversible error. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32-33 (4th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
