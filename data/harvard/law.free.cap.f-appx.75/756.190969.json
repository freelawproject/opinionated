Thomas E. Tierney, Jr. responds.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-22\">Tierney, an attorney, represented the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1917 (AFGE), in an arbitration proceeding with INS concerning the demotion of Florine Drummond. AFGE prevailed on the merits, but the arbitrator denied its request for attorney fees. Tierney filed a petition for review in his own name seeking review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision denying AFGE\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-24\">Our review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision is governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(a)(1), which states that \u201c[a]ny employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved\u201d may seek judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121, 7703(a)(1). Tierney is not an employee or applicant for employment and, as such, cannot seek review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision on his own behalf. <em>See Reid v. Department of Commerce, </em>793 F.2d 277 (Fed.Cir.1986) (only an individual employee or applicant for employment may seek review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-25\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b786-26\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b786-27\">(1) INS\u2019 motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-28\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
