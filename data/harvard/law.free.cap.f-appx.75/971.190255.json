Hopper argues that the nonpayment of his benefits violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). We disagree. The Commissioner\u2019s nonpayment of benefits to Hopper pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x) does not fall within 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a)\u2019s anti-attachment provisions. <em>See Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Services v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em>537 U.S. 371, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 1024-26, 154 L.Ed.2d 972 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-19\">Hopper asserts that the benefits are his property and that the nonpayment of those benefits is a seizure and should fall under the criminal forfeiture statutes. He fails to include his reasons for this conclusion or citations to relevant authority. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Accordingly, Hopper has abandoned this issue on appeal by failing to brief it adequately. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
