The order affirmed, without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying Tanjoh\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Tanjoh first claims that the Board abdicated its responsibility to provide a reasoned opinion in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Tanjoh\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit. <em>See Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003); <em>cf. Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a retroactivity challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-14\">Next, the immigration judge found that Tanjoh\u2019s asylum claim was untimely and that she failed to offer any explanation to demonstrate a change in circumstances or extraordinary circumstances excusing the late filing of her application for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4), (5) (2003). Tanjoh has failed to challenge this ruling in her opening brief. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the immigration judge\u2019s ruling pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir.2003); Moli<em>na-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fahim v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-15\">Finally, while we do not have jurisdiction to consider the denial of Tanjoh\u2019s asylum claim as untimely, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of Tanjoh\u2019s request for withholding of removal as it is not subject to the one-year time limitation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-16\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [she] faces a clear probability of persecution because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) <em>(citing INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). The immigration judge denied Tanjoh\u2019s request for withholding of removal on the grounds of lack of credibility and an absence of critical corroboration. Based on our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>record and the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying relief, we find that the immigration judge did not err in finding that Tanjoh failed to show a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d if returned to Cameroon. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [she] faces a clear probability of persecution because of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Accordingly, we deny Tanjoh\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b215-11\"> Tanjoh's three children make no independent claim separate from hers; thus, all references we make to petitioners will name only Tanjoh.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
