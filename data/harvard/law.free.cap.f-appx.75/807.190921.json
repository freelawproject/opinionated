Plaintiff-Appellant State Street Houses, Inc. (\u201cHouses\u201d) is the legal title holder of that property. Plaintiff-Appellant Lanny A. Horwitz is president of Houses, and managing partner of Mathematical Bridge LLC, Associates\u2019 general partner. Defendant-Appellees New York State Urban Development Corporation (UDC), New York State Mortgage Loan Enforcement and Administration Corporation (MLC), and Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) are public benefit corporations whose primary function is to fund real estate and development projects undertaken by qualified private entities in New York. Defendant-Appellee New York State Project Finance Agency (PFA) is a state governmental agency with a similar brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In January 1972, Houses and Associates entered into a mortgage loan agreement with defendant-appellee UDC. That mortgage, in turn, was subsidized by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pursuant to an agreement between HUD, plaintiffs and UDC. In 1983, Associates, UDC, MLC, and PFA, along with other property owners and interest-holders, filed suit against Dow Chemical Company, alleging failure of a \u201cSarabond\u201d mortar additive, which had been utilized in the construction of Kennedy Plaza. The complaint sought compensatory and punitive damages. <em>New York State Urban Development Corp. et al. v. Dow Chemical Company, Inc., et al., </em>83 CV 4327(VLB) (Broderick, <em>J.). </em>During the course of the litigation, in 1985, Associates granted power of attorney to UDC to negotiate and approve a settlement on Associates\u2019 behalf. At approximately the same time, Associates and Houses entered a Loan Restructuring Agreement with UDC, PFA, and MLC. That Agreement, according to plaintiffs, set forth a distribution scheme for any settlement proceeds which might accrue from the Sarabond Action, and provided that a portion of the monies would be paid, on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, to HUD in satisfaction of a HUD Flexible Subsidy Loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">In 1991, UDC, using its acquired power of attorney, entered a Settlement Agreement with Dow before Judge Broderick. The settlement provided for $20 million in compensatory damages and a waiver of all Sarabond plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Dow, except as they related to enforcement of the agreement. The agreement originally included a provision allocating approximately 35 percent of the settlement proceeds to Houses, Associates, and Horwitz. That particular provision was literally crossed out of the final Settlement Agreement, dated April 10, 1991.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the final agreement, the Sarabond Action plaintiffs \u2014 including the plaintiffs and defendants in the case before us \u2014 released each other from all claims related to that litigation, except for the obligations of each to \u201cperform the terms of (i)[the] Settlement Agreement and (ii) the various documents and agreements setting forth Plaintiffs\u2019 respective rights regarding the distribution of the funds payable under this Settlement Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">On the basis of that agreement, Judge Broderick \u201cso ordered\u201d the Stipulation and Order of Dismissal in the Sarabond action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>His Order dismissed all claims with prejudice, and reserved jurisdiction only for limited purposes: \u201cThe Court shall retain jurisdiction of this action and of the parties solely with respect to enforcement of the terms of the written Settlement Agreement executed by the parties simultaneously herewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">After entry of the order, Judge Broderick rejected the State Street parties\u2019 motion to vacate the settlement and to release the Sarabond plaintiffs to pursue their claims. Plaintiffs appealed the denial of their motion to vacate to this Court. Prior to submission, in July 1992, plaintiffs reached a settlement with UDC, PFA, and MLC, and the appeal was withdrawn with prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That second settlement consisted primarily of an amendment to the 1985 Loan Restructuring Agreement. The amendment made payment of the $2 million HUD Flexible Subsidy Loan the first obligation of the defendants before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Plaintiffs assert that UDC never made the HUD Flexible Loan Subsidy payment. As a result, they off-set the cost of that payment against their mortgage debt. And in April 2002, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, /.), alleging a variety of claims \u2014 \u25a0 including equitable reformation, fraud in the inducement, rescission, and breach of contract \u2014 in an effort to enforce the amended 1992 Loan Restructuring Agreement. They also sought a preliminary injunction, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65, against foreclosure of the Kennedy Plaza property. Defendants cross-moved to dismiss the complaint under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and (b)(6), arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the claims were all time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The district court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Pauley noted that the Order dismissing the Sara-bond action had retained jurisdiction only as to the terms of the original Sarabond Settlement Agreement. He further found that the alleged payment obligation plaintiffs sought to enforce was not covered by that agreement, but rather by the separate loan restructuring accord consummated after the dismissal order was entered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Since the Sarabond court had not retained jurisdiction over subsequent agreements by the parties, relevant Supreme Court precedent barred the court from exercising ancillary jurisdiction. <em>See Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America, </em>511 U.S. 375, 380-81, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994). On appeal, plaintiffs both (a) challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over the 1992 amended Loan Restructuring Agreement, and hence lacked ancillary jurisdiction over the alleged payment obligations deriving from that agreement, and (b) assert the existence of incidental and supplemental jurisdiction with respect to these payment obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>In assessing a district court\u2019s judgment on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. See, e.g., Luckett v. Bure, </em>290 F.3d 493, 496 (2d Cir.2002). Having done so, we affirm, substantially for the reasons given by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">It is well settled in this circuit that, under <em>Kokkonen, </em>the district court can exercise ancillary jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement <em>only </em>if the dismissal order expressly retained jurisdiction over that particular agreement, or incorporated it into the order. <em>See, e.g., Herrick Co. v. SCS Communications, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 315, 327 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Scelsa v. City University of New York, </em>76 F.3d 37, 41 (2d Cir.1996). It is undisputed that Judge Broderick did not incorporate any agreement into his dismissal order. Thus, the only question is whether he retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a subsequent agreement \u2014 the 1992 amendment to the 1985 Loan Restructuring Agreement relating to allocation of settlement proceeds\u2014 between plaintiffs and defendants. He did not. The dismissal order \u201cretain[ed] jurisdiction ... <em>solely </em>with respect to enforcement of the terms of the written Settlement Agreement executed by the parties <em>simultaneously </em>herewith\u201d (emphasis added). Plaintiffs do not dispute that allocation of settlement funds was not a term of the written Settlement Agreement executed on April 10, 1991; indeed, they admit that a clause concerning distribution was crossed out of that agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Moreover, the April 10 agreement conceived of the \u201cvarious documents and agreements ... regarding the distribution of the funds payable under this Settlement Agreement\u201d as distinct from the \u201cwritten Settlement Agreement\u201d over which the district court retained jurisdiction. One of those separate \u201cdocuments and agreements\u201d was the Loan Restructuring Agreement, as amended in 1992, a year following the entry of the original dismissal order. It is a breach of <em>that </em>later agreement which forms the basis of plaintiffs\u2019 relevant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">We find that the Order of Dismissal, by its terms, did not retain jurisdiction over that agreement, and therefore, per <em>Kokonnen </em>and its progeny, the district court lacks ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate claims arising under it. <em>See Kokonnen, </em>511 U.S. at 381, 114 S.Ct. 1673 (holding that violation of an agreement is not a breach of a district court\u2019s order unless the court has specifically retained jurisdiction to enforce that particular agreement); <em>cf. Hester Indus., Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 911, 917 n. 2 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201c[T]he text of the dismissal order ... did not clearly communicate an intention of the parties and of the district court\u201d to retain jurisdiction over the agreement in question.).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Plaintiffs additionally urge this court to find supplemental and incidental jurisdiction over the 1992 Loan Restructuring Agreement and claims arising under it. Their arguments in this regard do not avail. Supplemental jurisdiction as to some claims exists only when the court is empowered to exercise original jurisdiction over other claims presented in the same suit. <em>See Cicio v. Does, </em>321 F.3d 83, 97 (2d Cir.2003) (noting that a district court has supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims \u201c \u2018that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tion\u2019 \u201d that they \u201c \u2018derive from a common nucleus of operative fact\u2019\u201d) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) and <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966)). Here, none of plaintiffs\u2019 claims properly invokes the district court\u2019s original jurisdiction, and therefore supplemental jurisdiction does not lie.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arise from an alleged breach of the 1992 amendment to the Loan Restructuring Agreement. These claims constitute \u201cmore than just a continuation or renewal of the dismissed suit ... hence [they] require [their] own basis for jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kokonnen, </em>511 U.S. at 378, 114 S.Ct. 1673. Plaintiffs cannot invoke diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332 because there is not complete diversity (Plaintiff Associates is a citizen of New York, as are all of the defendants). Nor do plaintiffs allege any federal claims under \u00a7 1331. It follows that no independent basis for jurisdiction exists. We therefore conclude that plaintiffs have asserted nothing more than a breach of contract between private parties, and must pursue their claims in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We have considered all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims and find them meritless. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-5\">. Plaintiffs assert that they objected to the settlement because they sought to pursue their punitive damages claims, and therefore rejected the allocation proposed in the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">. The Stipulation Withdrawing Appeal so ordered by this court did not retain jurisdiction or incorporate the terms of the 1992 settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. One of the claims \u2014 fraud in the inducement \u2014 did not fail on jurisdictional grounds. Because it was an attack on the underlying settlement, the district court instead dismissed that cause of action for failure to state a colorable claim of fraud under New York law. Plaintiffs do not challenge this aspect of Judge Pauley's ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">. Judge Pauley found that the Settlement Agreement \"evidences that neither the parties nor the Court intended for distribution of the settlement funds to be an issue addressed by the settlement agreement\u201d and therefore \"a breach of the loan structuring agreement does not constitute a breach of the settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. This express omission indicates that both Judge Broderick and the parties were aware that distribution would be determined by agreements independent of the Settlement Agreement. Nevertheless, the court retained jurisdiction only over the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. For their incidental jurisdiction argument, plaintiffs rely on <em>Woodbury v. Andrew Jergens Co., </em>69 F.2d 49 (2d Cir.1934). But <em>Woodbury, </em>though it also used the term \"incidental jurisdiction,\u201d was in fact an ancillary jurisdiction case, and simply held that the district court can exercise jurisdiction to settle an attorneys\u2019 fee dispute arising from an abandoned suit. <em>See id. </em>at 49-50; <em>see also Stamford Bd. of Educ. v. Stamford Educ. Assoc., </em>697 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.1982) (similarly using both terms).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
