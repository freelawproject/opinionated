He was sentenced to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Sims\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), discussing the propriety of Sims\u2019 status as a career offender, but concluding that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Sims was notified of his right to file an additional brief, which he failed to do. In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">By counsel, Sims challenged his classification as a career offender pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Sims satisfied the criteria <em>for </em>enhancement under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1, as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In addition, our review of the record and transcripts in this case reveal that the district court complied fully with the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11. The record reflects that Sims\u2019 plea was knowing and voluntarily entered into. There were no irregularities in the plea process, and we find that Sims was sentenced upon a proper application of the guidelines and consistent with statutory and constitutional law. Accordingly, we affirm Sims\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
