Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Frank D. Carter\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for summary affirmance of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 order denying Carter\u2019s motion for a full court decision. Carter opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-31\">Carter appeals from an October 24, 2002 order of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims denying his motion for full court review of a July 10, 2002 single judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>decision. The July 2002 decision affirmed a Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision that rejected Carter\u2019s allegation of clear and unmistakeable error in an earlier Board decision and declined to grant a 20 percent disability rating for asthma. Citing U.S. Vet.App. R. 35(c), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims noted that \u201c[mjotions for full Court decision are not favored. Ordinarily they will not be granted unless such action is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of the Court\u2019s decisions or to resolve a question of exceptional importance.\u201d Upon consideration of the record, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that full court review was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Carter\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 order denying full court review did not address or otherwise depend on any issue of validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation, nor did Carter raise any argument concerning the validity or interpretation of any such provision. Further, Carter fails to raise any clear or genuine constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In his informal brief and response to the Secretary\u2019s motion, Carter states that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is biased against him and a single judge decision \u201cis a bad faith unreasonable prohibition against full-court review ... and denial of access to the appeals court.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The bulk of Carter\u2019s remaining arguments concerns his alleged wrongful conviction by a state court, and he asserts that he is \u201ca member of a racially discriminated against group.\u201d To the extent Carter attempts to raise constitutional issues on appeal, his conclusory allegations are without factual support and are, therefore, \u201cconstitutional in name only.\u201d <em>Helfer v. West, </em>174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed.Cir.1999). \u201cThe characterization of [a] question as constitutional in nature does not confer upon us jurisdiction that we otherwise lack.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the denial of a request for full court review does not of itself violate due process. <em>See Arnesen v. Principi </em>300 F.3d 1353, 1360-61 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">In this case, the Court of Appeals for Veterans claims merely applied the law governing full court review to the facts and circumstances of Carter\u2019s case. The jurisdiction of this court does not extend to \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Carter\u2019s appeal is, therefore, not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b788-11\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-12\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-13\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s alternative motion for summary affirmance is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-14\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\"> Carter also asks this court to \"exercise its jurisdiction to include the rule of law and interpretation of the fraudulent exclusion of VBA folder No. 27937 which supports claimant\u2019s position.\u201d Carter did not raise this issue in his \"Motion for Full Court Decision\u201d and there is no indication that it was relevant to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision to deny full court review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
