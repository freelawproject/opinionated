She contends that she was indigent and could not afford the $5 filing fee, that her family had sent the funds, that the court should have removed the funds from her prison account, and that the court denied her due process by dismissing the case without holding a hearing. Davis has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing her habeas petition. <em>See Martinez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.1997). Consequently, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
