Pederson appeals his conviction and 12-month sentence following his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>guilty plea to presenting a fictitious U.S. Treasury instrument, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 514(a)(2), and three counts of attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Pederson\u2019s counsel has submitted a brief stating that he has found no meritorious issues for review. No supplemental pro se brief has been filed. The government did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Because Pederson knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cGenerally, courts will enforce a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal if (1) the language of the waiver encompasses the defendant\u2019s right to appeal on the grounds claimed on appeal, and (2) the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b653-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
