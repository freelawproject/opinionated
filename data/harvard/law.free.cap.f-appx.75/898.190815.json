In 1998, FedEx executive management had asked all divisions to reduce their fixed staff by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>12%. Rosemarie Bullock\u2019s position as a secretary in the engineering department was one of those to be eliminated. Between August 18, 1999 and April 2000, Bullock unsuccessfully applied for several vacant positions within FedEx. FedEx then considered Bullock to have voluntarily resigned after her 90-day leave of absence had expired on May 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Subsequently, Bullock filed suit in the Essex County Superior Court, claiming wrongful and constructive discharge, discrimination, hostile work environment, misrepresentation, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Fedex removed the action to the United States District Court. On June 6, 2002, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The Bullocks appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The standard of review of the District Court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment on each of the Plaintiffs claims is plenary review. <em>Assaf v. Fields, </em>178 F.3d 170, 171 (3d. Cir.1999). In reviewing the lower court\u2019s decision, we must, upon reviewing the record as a whole, \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party\u201d without weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, </em>530 U.S. 133, 150, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). If there appears that \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law,\u201d then we must affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Fed.R.Civ.P. </em>56(c) (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">We have reviewed all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims: that Rosemary Bullock was constructively discharged, that Fedex\u2019s reasons for its employment decisions were pretextual, that Rosemary Bullock was subjected to a hostile work environment because of her race and sex, that Fedex retaliated against her because she complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that she was terminated in violation of ERISA to prevent her pension rights from vesting, that defendants subjected her to intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that Lloyd Bullock is entitled to damages for loss of Rosemary\u2019s services and consortium. After reviewing all the material facts, and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Bullocks, we conclude that a reasonable fact finder could not conclude that the Bullocks have established a <em>prima facie </em>case on any of Rosemary Bullock\u2019s claims or that Fedex\u2019s treatment of her amounted to extreme and outrageous conduct; nor then can Lloyd Bullock recover on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">We will, therefore, affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
