The United States appealed, arguing that the district court erred in denying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice and finding that Hudson was entitled to a reduction of his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We reversed \u201cthe district court\u2019s failure to apply the obstruction of justice enhancement and its grant of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Hudson, </em>272 F.3d 260, 264 (4th Cir.2001). We remanded for resentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">At resentencing, the district court enhanced Hudson\u2019s offense level for obstruction of justice and did not reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Hudson\u2019s resulting offense level was 36, and his criminal history category was III, resulting in a guideline range of 235-293 months. He received a 235-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Hudson now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), claiming that venue was improper in the Western District of North Carolina but stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Hudson has filed a pro se brief in which he asserts improper venue as well as miscalculation of his criminal history category. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">Under the mandate rule, consideration of the propriety of venue and the calculation of Hudson\u2019s criminal history category is foreclosed because these issues were not raised in the original appeal and are not reasonably within the scope of the mandate. <em>See United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993). We accordingly decline to address these issues because they are not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">We therefore affirm. We have, as required by <em>Anders, </em>reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Hudson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
