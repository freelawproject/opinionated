Because we hold, as a matter of law, that the lessee could not so justifiably rely, we reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court's judgment in favor of the petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Red Crest Trust owns about 40,000 acres of non-contiguous mineral interests throughout the Eagle Ford Shale. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acts as its trustee. Phillip Mettham, an employee of JPMorgan, was responsible for leasing the trust's Eagle Ford interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2010, Mettham leased fifteen of the trust's Eagle Ford tracts in DeWitt and Gonzales counties to GeoSouthern Energy Corporation. Comprising more than 1,800 acres, the GeoSouthern deal was one of the largest Mettham negotiated for the trust. Notably, GeoSouthern did not record its leases in the counties' property records until six months after closing the deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Also in 2010, Lawrence Berry, an experienced oil-and-gas businessman, formed Orca Assets, G.P., L.L.C. The specific purpose of establishing Orca was to acquire promising unleased acreage in the Eagle Ford Shale. And it quickly set its sights on the trust's holdings in Karnes and DeWitt counties. Orca's team included Berry; its vice president, John Ellis; landmen Tony Villalon and Joan Stewart, and a collection of additional landmen. All were experienced in leasing oil-and-gas properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 11, 2010, Mettham met with Ellis and Stewart to discuss Orca leasing some of the trust's tracts. Berry also attended part but not all of the meeting. Orca's team brought maps showing the tracts it desired to lease. Ellis asked Mettham whether the indicated acreage \"was open and not leased.\" Each of Orca's representatives at the meeting remembered Mettham's reply somewhat differently. Ellis believes Mettham answered, \"[Y]es, but I'll have to-I'll have to check.\" Stewart remembers him saying, \"I'm not sure of that. I'll have to check.\" Berry recalls Mettham unequivocally representing that the acreage was \"open,\" meaning unleased. However, Berry also concedes that he was in the meeting for only a brief time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trust requires that all leases of its tracts contain a clause negating any warranty of title. The standard lease form that JPMorgan usually uses when dealing with the trust's properties includes such a clause: \"This Lease is made without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.\" Orca was familiar with that language as it had twice before leased acreage from the trust using the standard lease form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But shortly after the parties' initial meeting, Mettham notified Orca that any lease deal it made with the trust would not employ the standard negation-of-warranty provision. Instead, JPMorgan would require new language expressly shifting the risk of title failure to the lessee. Mettham explained that the high volume of leasing activity in the region necessitated the change because lessees were quickly pursuing opportunities without thoroughly examining title. The new clause would read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Negation of Warranty.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   This lease is made without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, and without recourse against Lessor in the event of a failure of title, not even for the return of the bonus consideration paid for the granting of the lease or for any rental, royalty, shut-in payment, or any other payment now or hereafter made by Lessee to Lessor under the terms of this lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mettham's request to include this new lengthier clause incited concerns among Orca's team. To Ellis, the provision \"raised a red flag.\" It was a \"curveball\"-something he had never \"seen before in any lease.\" Because the new warranty provision gave the lessee the responsibility \"to make absolutely sure that [the t]rust owned the minerals,\" Ellis believed Orca should obtain \"a solid outside legal opinion\" as to title. And when asked if Orca would rely on JPMorgan \"to confirm whether or not it had title to these mineral interests,\" Ellis responded: \"We would never-that I would never look to JPMorgan to tell me whether or not [the t]rust owned the minerals that were in question.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Similarly, Villalon, Orca's landman and a former practicing attorney, conceded that without a warranty, Orca could purchase only \"whatever it was that the Red Crest Trust had to sell,\" which \"might be nothing at all.\" He also acknowledged that if the trust's properties had already been leased, it could not convey those minerals to Orca. In general, he did not find a disclaimer of warranty out of the ordinary. But he regarded the wording of this particular provision as unusually explicit. So he advised Ellis: \"I think we need to accept the language, but we also need to give the title another review before we close.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 6, the parties signed a letter of intent acknowledging the trust's agreement to lease the tracts to Orca. In the letter, neither the trust nor JPMorgan made any representation about the trust's title or whether the acreage was available to lease. Instead, the letter provided that Orca had \"caused a search to be made of the records of Karnes and DeWitt [c]ounties and has preliminarily determined that Red Crest Trust is the owner and holder of the mineral estate underlying\" the tracts at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The letter also quoted the new negation-of-warranty clause on which the parties had agreed. And the letter noted that Orca had requested and received a thirty-day option period in exchange for accepting the new language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ORCA has accepted the counteroffer of RED CREST TRUST proposing to modify paragraph 18[,] ... but, in light of such requested modification to the lease form[, Orca] has requested, and RED CREST TRUST has agreed to, a delay of up to 30 calendar days in the closing of the proposed transaction to allow ORCA the opportunity to re-examine its title work upon which its determination of ownership is based ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The letter further provided that the parties could close the transaction \"on a piecemeal basis\" over the thirty-day option period. As \"the title to the individual tracts is examined and approved,\" the trust would execute a lease to that tract upon Orca tendering consideration of $3,500 per acre. And if Orca's \"re-examination of title should reveal [previously unknown] information ... that brings into question the ownership\" of one or more of the tracts, then Orca \"may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to not take a lease on such tract or tracts.\" Finally, the letter precluded the trust or JPMorgan from leasing the tracts or granting an option to acquire a lease to any third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before signing the letter of intent, Orca had been checking the property records on an almost daily basis. But it did not continue\n   to do so during the thirty-day option period. And it was just three days into the option period, on December 9, that GeoSouthern finally recorded the leases it had obtained from the trust six months earlier. The tracts the letter of intent covered included much of the acreage GeoSouthern had already leased. Any title search Orca had commissioned after December 9-a search that one of Orca's landmen estimated would have cost between $600 and $800-would have revealed GeoSouthern's leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Orca contends it conducted no searches after signing the letter of intent because (1) its earlier searches had revealed no title issues, (2) Mettham had represented that the acreage was unleased, and (3) the letter precluded JPMorgan from leasing any of the tracts during the option period. The purpose of the thirty days, Orca argues, was to re-evaluate the title review it had already performed. Orca feared defects in title going backward in time, not forward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ultimately, Orca decided to move forward on just the tracts in DeWitt County-919 of the 1,680 acres covered in the letter of intent. On January 5, 2011, Orca sent Mettham six leases covering those tracts. Each lease contained the new negation-of-warranty language providing that it was \"without warranties\" and \"without recourse\" for failure of title. Six days later, Orca sent Stewart to close the deal. As Stewart handed Mettham bonus checks amounting to $3,217,585, she asked him again if he was \"sure these are all open.\" A colleague attending the closing with Stewart interjected: \"Well, they better be for that kind of money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mettham allegedly responded to Stewart by saying, \"[L]et me check.\" Then, after he \"looked at something below his desk,\" as well as \"at his computer\" and the maps Orca had provided, he said, \"We're good to go. They're open.\" Orca recorded the leases in the DeWitt County property records the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Two weeks later, GeoSouthern contacted Mettham. It had discovered Orca's leases in the property records-leases of acreage GeoSouthern had already leased. Mettham immediately informed Orca of the title defect. And on February 18, JPMorgan sent Orca a check refunding the $3.2 million in bonus payments, though it maintained it was not obligated to do so under the leases' negation-of-warranty provisions. But Orca rejected the tender. And on February 24, it sued JPMorgan and Mettham for $400,000,000 in lost profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Orca's causes of action against JPMorgan and Mettham included breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation. Following a pre-trial conference, the trial court issued an order under Rule 166(g) disposing of all of Orca's claims. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166(g). It concluded that the unambiguous terms of the letter of intent and the leases precluded Orca's contract claim. And it ruled as a matter of law that Orca could not establish the justifiable-reliance element of its fraud and negligent-misrepresentation claims. The order amounted to a final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's contract ruling, but it reversed on fraud and negligent misrepresentation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656005\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/591/\">\n    542 S.W.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204736786\">\n    2015 WL 4736786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Dallas 2015). The negation-of-warranty provision, the court opined, did not clearly and unequivocally disclaim reliance on prior representations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204736786\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ----. For that reason, the court continued, the provision could not preclude justifiable reliance as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 603 (relying on\n   <em>\n    Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v.

Turning to JPMorgan's next argument, the court of appeals concluded\n   that the contractual provisions did not directly contradict the extra-contractual representations so as to preclude justifiable reliance as a matter of law. It based this decision on the clause's failure to explicitly refer to the existence, or lack thereof, of prior leases. And in its view, the clause's breadth hindered its ability to plainly correct and contradict the oral representations. This Court granted JPMorgan and Mettham's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court entered judgment against Orca following a pre-trial conference it convened under Rule 166.

Subsection (g) of the rule provides that at the conference, the trial court may consider \"[t]he identification of legal matters to be ruled on or decided by the court.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 166(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 166(g) authorizes trial courts to decide matters that, though ordinarily fact questions, have become questions of law because \"reasonable minds cannot differ on the outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden v.

(We will refer to the two defendants collectively as \"JPMorgan\" except when it becomes necessary to refer to Mettham separately.) Indeed, at this point, JPMorgan opposes just one essential element shared by Orca's two remaining causes of action: justifiable reliance. So our only question is this: Could Orca have justifiably relied on Mettham's representation concerning the availability of the tracts?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Justifiable reliance usually presents a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prize Energy Res., L.P. v.

The record also reflects that its employee, Mettham, was heavily experienced in oil-and-gas transactions.

In 2010, Mettham executed between fifty and one hundred leases for the trust and other clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   And though Orca was a newly founded company, its key players were also sophisticated oil-and-gas businesspeople. Berry and Ellis were both richly experienced in negotiating and acquiring oil-and-gas leases. Villalon had practiced law and worked as a landman for many years. And Orca had at its disposal a passel of other experienced landmen, including Stewart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Both JPMorgan and Orca are sophisticated business entities, composed of knowledgeable, skilled, and experienced people who were more than capable of overseeing the negotiation and execution of the oil-and-gas deal at issue in this case. And the transaction at the heart of this case was no small deal. The six leases Orca ultimately received, after weeks of intense, detail-oriented negotiation, covered 919 acres and came at a cost of $3.2 million.

Orca describes the letter of intent as an implicit representation that the trust held good title to the tracts. But the letter's explicit terms show otherwise. The only indication in the letter that the trust holds title provides: \"Orca has caused a search to be made of [the county] records ... and has preliminarily determined that [the trust] is the owner and holder of the mineral estate ....\" JPMorgan made no assurance in the letter of intent that the trust had title.

One of Orca's landmen, Ellis, regarded the clause as a \"curveball\" that \"raised a red flag\"-something he had never \"seen before in any lease.\" Because of the clause, Ellis advised Orca \"to make absolutely sure that [the trust] owned the minerals\" by obtaining \"a solid outside legal opinion.\" He later stated: \"\n   <em>\n    We would never\n   </em>\n   -that I\n   <em>\n    would never look to JPMorgan to tell me\n   </em>\n   whether or not [the trust] owned the minerals.\" (emphasis added).

And the parties' negation-of-warranty clause spoke to Orca's lack of recourse \"for failure of title.\" Moreover, the warranties the clause negated were warranties of title. A warranty clause is \"[a] provision in an oil-and-gas lease by which the lessor guarantees that title is without defect and agrees to defend it.\"\n   <em>\n    Warranty Clause\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014). It stands to reason that a negation-of-warranty clause is just the opposite: a provision in the lease by which the lessor disavows any \"guarantee[ ] that title is without defect.\" For Orca to rely on Mettham's statement that the trust had title, it would have to ignore an express contractual provision explaining that JPMorgan and the trust make no guarantees pertaining to title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   By their own testimony, the members of Orca's team acknowledged that the letter of intent left Orca responsible for verifying title to the tracts-and that Orca could obtain only whatever the trust had to convey. The sophisticated oil-and-gas businesspeople Orca employs understood the implications of the language in the letter of intent. They negotiated the letter's terms at arm's length-terms that assigned Orca the risk of a failure of title. It's true that the negation-of-warranty clause did not include the specific terms \"leased,\" \"open,\" or \"unleased\"-but it didn't need to. If Mettham's earlier representation amounts to a guarantee of title, as Orca contends, the negation of warranty was exactly the opposite. And as no reasonable, sophisticated entity could read the latter and plausibly believe the former, they are in direct contradiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grant Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7326425\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/314/913/#p923\">\n    314 S.W.3d at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defining the justifiable reliance inquiry as one that accounts for \"whether, 'given a fraud plaintiff's individual characteristics, abilities, and appreciation of facts and circumstances at or before the time of the alleged fraud[,] it is extremely unlikely that there is actual reliance on the plaintiff's part' \" (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Haralson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1245100\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/919/1014/#p1026\">\n    919 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1026 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Viewed in context with the numerous \"red flags,\" Orca's sophistication in the oil-and-gas industry, and the direct contradiction between the representation and the letter of intent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Orca cannot maintain its claim of justifiable reliance. Orca, composed of experienced and knowledgeable businesspeople, negotiated an arm's-length transaction and then placed millions of dollars in jeopardy-all while operating under circumstances that similarly situated parties would have regarded as imminently risky. Orca needed to protect its own interests through the exercise of ordinary care and reasonable diligence rather than blindly relying upon another party's vague assurances. Its failure to do so precludes its claim of justifiable reliance as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Justifiable reliance is an essential element of each of Orca's remaining causes of action.

Nevertheless, JPMorgan does not contend that justifiable reliance fails as a matter of law because the parties disclaimed fraud causes of action. Indeed, in its briefing JPMorgan carefully and persuasively distinguishes contractual terms that negate justifiable reliance because they directly contradict an oral representation from\n    <em>\n     Italian Cowboy\n    </em>\n    -type contractual clauses that expressly waive fraud causes of action.
