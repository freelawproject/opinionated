Neal McBrayer, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal concerns the dismissal of a health care liability action for noncompliance with the Health Care Liability Act, specifically Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121 (Supp. 2017). Before filing this action, the plaintiff gave timely written pre-suit notice of her health care liability claim, including the required medical authorizations, to all potential defendants. But when she filed her complaint, the plaintiff failed to provide copies of the medical authorizations as required by statute. Both defendants filed motions to dismiss based on the missing documents. The trial court determined that the plaintiff had substantially complied with the statute and that the defendants were not prejudiced by the omission. Even so, the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice after\n   concluding that strict compliance with the statute was required when the defendant was a governmental entity. Upon review, we conclude that substantial compliance with the documentation requirement in Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121(b) is sufficient even when the defendant is a governmental entity. Thus, we reverse the dismissal of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 15, 2015, Sandra Kay Clary was admitted to the intensive care unit at Cookeville Regional Medical Center (\"CRMC\") with a diagnosis of \"sepsis related to community acquired pneumonia, acute renal failure, and hyponatremia.\" According to Ms. Clary, a nurse at CRMC, Deidra Miller, negligently administered a Lovenox injection, causing complications that necessitated extensive medical treatment and resulted in pain and suffering and permanent disfigurement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 4, 2015, Ms. Clary provided written notice of her health care liability claim to both CRMC and Ms. Miller, along with a HIPAA-compliant medical authorization.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-121\">\n    Tenn.

On January 20, 2016, Ms. Clary filed this health care liability action against CRMC and Ms. Miller (collectively, \"Defendants\") in the Circuit Court for Putnam County, Tennessee. Ms. Clary also submitted a certificate of good faith and an affidavit certifying that pre-suit notice, including HIPAA-compliant medical authorizations, was served on Defendants as required by statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2029-26-121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 29-26-121(a)(4), -122 (2012 &amp; Supp. 2017).

The court determined that Ms. Clary only substantially complied with the statute and that she failed to demonstrate extraordinary cause for her noncompliance. The court found that Defendants were not prejudiced by Ms. Clary's substantial compliance but held that strict compliance was required because CRMC was a governmental entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ms. Clary contends that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint with prejudice in light of her substantial compliance with Tennessee Code Annotated \u00a7 29-26-121. \"Every application of a text to particular circumstances entails interpretation.\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A.

Contrary to CRMC's position, we find no indication in the Act that the Legislature intended for courts to apply its provisions differently based on whether the health care provider was a governmental entity or not.
