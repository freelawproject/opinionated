Eugene's brother, Johnny Sanchez, also was shot, but he could not identify who shot him. The indictment in this case does not charge appellant with shooting Johnny Sanchez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury found appellant guilty of murder and assessed punishment at forty years' confinement. Following a hearing on appellant's motion for new trial, the trial court denied the motion. On appeal, appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the jury's verdict. Instead, appellant complains (1) trial counsel failed to call certain defense witnesses during the guilt-innocence phase of trial; (2) two of his family members were excluded from the courtroom during voir dire; (3) the trial court erred by denying the admission into evidence of prior inconsistent statements of two jurors during the hearing on appellant's motion for new trial; (4) the jurors improperly discussed parole law during punishment deliberations; and (5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   the trial court erred by not allowing him to return to the courtroom after he was removed during the punishment phase of trial.

An appellant complaining about trial counsel's failure to call witnesses must show the witnesses were available and he would have benefitted from their testimony.\n   <em>\n    King v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9925727\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/649/42/#p44\">\n    649 S.W.2d 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 (Tex. Crim.

App.-San Antonio 1999, pet. ref'd).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At trial, appellant's defense was that he did not shoot and kill Sanchez and, instead, Edward Morales fired the fatal shots. During the guilt-innocence phase of trial, the defense called seven witnesses who testified either that Morales was the person who fired the shots or Morales had the gun. One of these witnesses stated he saw a man-presumably Morales-fire a gun into the air and then straight ahead, after which Eugene Sanchez fell to the ground. Three of these witnesses said they heard Morales yell, \"stop or I'll shoot\" or \"Hey everyone f- stop,\" and they saw Morales fire the gun into the air and then point the gun forward and shoot one or more times. Appellant testified in his own behalf and stated he heard gunshots from behind him, and then he heard Morales say, \"I got them. I got both of them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the new trial hearing, appellant's nephew, Brandon Monreal, testified he saw Edward Morales run away from the scene of the shooting, shouting that he had shot Sanchez. Brandon testified at the new trial hearing that he was inside his grandmother's house and, although he did not hear any gunshots, he heard \"a bunch of yelling.\" When he heard the yelling, he ran outside and saw Edward Morales running away from where the shooting happened and he was holding a pistol. Brandon said Morales looked happy and he was jumping up and down and yelling, \"I shot that mother-\" and \"I got that n-.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In Brandon's affidavit attached to appellant's motion for new trial, Brandon stated he would have been available to testify at trial. Edward Morales did not testify at the new trial hearing, and there is no evidence he was available to testify at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellant's trial counsel, Fernando Cortes, testified at the new trial hearing indicating he was the second attorney to represent appellant, and he was substituted as retained counsel about one month before jury selection commenced. He said he had tried only one murder trial prior to appellant's case, but he had tried over 215 criminal trials all over the State of Texas. He considered himself an experienced trial attorney, and he could recall only one ineffective assistance claim against him in the past. Cortes stated he was not able to obtain appellant's file from the first defense attorney, and he received discovery about two weeks before trial started. In the days following jury selection, he also received the gunshot residue report and\n   the autopsy. Cortes stated he was unprepared for trial in this case that had been pending for almost three years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to Brandon Monreal's testimony, Cortes testified he did not remember what Brandon's testimony would have been because \"there were just so many people that were brought to [his] attention for the first time [during trial]. They weren't listed anywhere.\" He did not request a copy of the State's witness list and he had no strategy for not doing so. He said he was surprised by some of the State's witnesses, and he could have done more. Cortes stated he did not recall trying to find Brandon once the significance of Brandon's testimony became evident during trial. He said he had no strategic reason for not trying to interview Brandon during trial. Regarding Edward Morales's testimony, Cortes testified he did not realize the significance of Morales's testimony until trial, but because of the late date, he had no way to find Morales. When asked if he had requested a continuance from the trial court to try to locate Morales, Cortes responded that he had asked the court to appoint an investigator to help him locate the witness. Cortes said he had no strategic reason for not requesting a continuance or for not trying to interview Morales during trial. On cross-examination, Cortes admitted he called John Monreal, Richard Harrington, Matthew Woodson, Gino Rodriguez, and Michael Reyes-all of whom testified either that Edward Morales was the shooter or that they saw Morales with the gun. Most of these witnesses were wearing orange jail jumpsuits when they testified, which Cortes thought presented a credibility problem for the jury. When asked whether Brandon Monreal would have added anything not already introduced at trial, Cortes responded\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I don't know if I ever had anybody-any of the witnesses testify that they heard Edward [Morales] specifically make the admission that he had shot them [the two victims] the way Brandon had indicated in his affidavit. I don't think I had such a witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Cortes was then asked, \"Well, you had even better testimony than that because you had witnesses that said they saw Edward shoot.\" To which counsel responded, \"That's correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We conclude appellant did not establish trial counsel was ineffective for not calling Morales as a witness because there is no showing Morales would have been available to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9925727\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/649/42/#p44\">\n    649 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   44 ;\n   <em>\n    Cantu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11673518\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/993/712/#p719\">\n    993 S.W.2d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Brandon Monreal, however, said he would have been available to testify that he saw Edward Morales run away from the scene of the shooting, shouting that he had shot Sanchez. Even if it could be argued the failure to call Brandon Monreal at trial was ineffective assistance, there must also be a showing of prejudice under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . Seven defense witnesses stated they either saw Morales fire the fatal shots or they saw him with the gun. Appellant testified he heard Morales say, \"I got them. I got both of them.\" Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , appellant had the burden to show \"whether it is 'reasonably likely' the result [of the trial] would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S. at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The likelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just conceivable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On this record, given the number of defense witnesses who testified Morales, and not appellant, was the person who either had a gun or fired the fatal shots, we cannot conclude appellant has shown his defense was prejudiced by the lack of the same testimony from Brandon Monreal. Also, the jury, as the factfinder, was entitled to judge the credibility of the witnesses and could choose to believe all, some, or none of the testimony presented by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Queeman v.

Because appellant has not shown his attorney's deficient performance deprived him of a fair trial, we hold the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for new trial on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Family Excluded From Courtroom\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Appellant next asserts two of his family members were barred from the courtroom during voir dire in violation of his right to a public trial. During oral arguments, appellate counsel insisted he raised this complaint as both a stand-alone issue and a complaint in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel did not object to the courtroom being closed to the public when he realized appellant's family members were not allowed in the courtroom during jury selection. The State argued, however, that appellant raised the closed-courtroom argument only in the context of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. We will liberally construe appellant's brief as raising both arguments. We first address his argument that counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the closed courtroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Appellant's two sisters testified at the new trial hearing that they arrived early at the courthouse to watch jury selection, but they were not allowed into the courtroom. Both sisters stated a courthouse bailiff told them they could not enter the courtroom. They stated they watched jury selection through the windows of the closed courtroom doors. One of appellant's sisters admitted she wore a T-shirt that said \"Free Billy.\" The other sister denied wearing such a T-shirt. According to his sisters, they were allowed into the courtroom when the defense began its voir dire after lunch. One of appellant's sisters testified that the Wednesday before jury selection, at a pretrial hearing, her nephew and a member of the victim's family got into an altercation in the hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The bailiff testified over 100 venire members were present, an unusually large number for a trial in Medina County. He said his first concern when he saw appellant's family was that he did not want a repeat of the altercation that occurred the previous Wednesday because there was a large number of people present in the courtroom. He stated he did not tell appellant's sisters they could not enter the courtroom. Instead, he said he asked them to give him time for room inside the courtroom to become available after venire members were excused based on various exemptions or disqualifications. He said when additional seating became available inside the courtroom, the sisters came into the courtroom before voir dire began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   When asked about appellant's family not being allowed in the courtroom, Cortes testified he remembered being told during a break in trial, but he did not approach the trial court because he \"was just so overwhelmed with the voir dire.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   An accused has a right to a public trial under the federal and state constitutions, as well as under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.

Although [Weaver's] mother and her minister were indeed excluded from the courtroom for two days during jury selection, [Weaver's] trial was not conducted in secret or in a remote place. ... The closure was limited to the jury voir dire; the courtroom remained open during the evidentiary phase of the trial; the closure decision apparently was made by court officers rather than the judge; there were many members of the venire who did not become jurors but who did observe the proceedings; and there was a record made of the proceedings that does not indicate any basis for concern, other than the closure itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   There has been no showing, furthermore, that the potential harms flowing from a courtroom closure came to pass in this case. For example, there is no suggestion that any juror lied during voir dire; no suggestion of misbehavior by the prosecutor, judge, or any other party; and no suggestion that any of the participants failed to approach their duties with the neutrality and serious purpose that our system demands.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   It is true that this case comes here on the assumption that the closure was a Sixth Amendment violation.

However, the testimony provides for two different scenarios as to when his sisters entered the courtroom: (1) before commencement of voir dire or (2) after the State completed its voir dire but before the defense began its voir dire. The qualification of the potential jurors and the State's voir dire were not conducted in secret. The courtroom was open for the remainder of trial beginning, at the latest, with the defense's voir dire.

G.M. stated that, during deliberations, some jurors wanted to assess punishment at less than forty years and others at more than forty years. G.M. said she brought up parole and then another juror said, \"they usually only serve half their\n   sentence.\" But, she said it was a casual statement and, on cross-examination, she agreed with the State that no one ever said, \"this is parole law\" or \"this is what the law says as a fact.\" G.M. stated the \"law was not discussed,\" and deliberations were based on the evidence presented at trial. G.M. said that because appellant was so young, \"he really had to have some hope,\" therefore, the possibility he could serve a shorter sentence made it easier for her to vote to give him the longer sentence of forty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At the new trial hearing, juror P.F. also testified she was present during deliberations and she was interviewed by an investigator. P.F. said she did not recall the topic of parole arising during deliberations, she denied telling the investigator that jurors agreed on forty years as long as appellant served half that time, she did not recall anyone saying appellant would only serve half his time, and she denied telling the investigator that if appellant \"does good, he can go in front of parole. He will get half. That would be 20 years.\" Instead, she said she \"didn't say it in those words,\" and she told the investigator the jurors could not take parole into consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Stephen Fuchs, the investigator, testified he interviewed G.M. and P.F. and he recorded both conversations. At this point, appellant's attorney asked to admit the recordings into evidence for impeachment purposes as prior inconsistent statements. The State objected that the recordings were not proper impeachment under Texas Rule of Evidence 613. The trial court sustained the objection. Fuchs then testified about his conversations with each juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, M.R., the jury foreman, testified he did not recall any juror stating the law on parole, stating he or she was an expert on parole law, or anyone changing their mind about punishment because of parole. However, he said he heard someone mention appellant would be eligible for parole at some point, but because no one knew the specifics about parole law, \"it was not given any weight ... in the final decision about sentencing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    A.
