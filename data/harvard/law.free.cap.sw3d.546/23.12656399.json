Mignone filed suit against the Department in December 2012. She alleged that she had been the victim of sexual harassment in her employment in violation of the Missouri Human Rights Act (or \"MHRA\"), \u00a7 213.010, RSMo\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Mignone also alleged that Department employees had retaliated against her for complaining about the sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Following a five-day trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the Department on Mignone's sexual harassment claim. The jury found in Mignone's favor, however, on her two claims of retaliation. The jury awarded her $100,000 in compensatory damages, and $1 million in punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Department appeals. We affirm, and remand the case to the circuit court for it to award Mignone her reasonable attorney's fees and expenses on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From September 2008 to April 2013, Mignone worked for the Department of Corrections at the Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron. At the time of the events giving rise to this lawsuit, Mignone was employed as a Corrections Officer I in Housing Unit 6. Sergeant James Nuckols was Mignone's direct supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2010 or early 2011, Mignone began working with Kevin Fagan, another Corrections Officer I, in Unit 6. Mignone and Fagan initially got along, and she and Fagan had once gone out to dinner with their respective spouses. Their relationship changed, however, in the last six-to-nine months that they worked together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Mignone's testimony, by May 2011 Fagan had become obsessed with her. He called her nicknames, including \"babe\" and \"Italian girl,\" and told inmates not to bother \"my Mignone.\" Fagan would follow Mignone to her car in the parking lot and clean her windows; inmates also told Mignone that Fagan stared at her. Fagan offered her motorcycle rides late at night, telling her that \"[n]obody needs to know about it.\" Mignone asked Fagan to stop because she was feeling uncomfortable, but his familiar and flirtatious behavior continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mignone first reported Fagan's conduct to Sgt. Nuckols in October or November 2011, and told Nuckols that she wanted Fagan's conduct to stop. Nuckols testified that he addressed the issue with Fagan, but the behavior continued. Mignone did not make a written complaint at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In December 2011 and January 2012, a series of incidents occurred involving Mignone's use of a single-person bathroom in an area of the prison known as \"the bubble.\" The bathroom had a dead-bolt on the inside which the occupant could lock, but the door could be unlocked from the outside with a key. In December 2011, on two different occasions, someone unlocked the bathroom door from the outside while Mignone was using the bathroom. She yelled \"stop\" on both occasions, and no one\n   opened the door or entered. Mignone did not know who it was. On both occasions she asked co-workers who witnessed the incidents for the identity of the perpetrator, and on both occasions her colleagues identified Fagan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A similar incident occurred on January 15, 2012. As Mignone entered the bathroom three male employees were present, including Fagan and Nuckols. As Mignone was urinating, the bathroom door unlocked and began to open. Mignone lurched for the doorknob, grabbed it, and pulled the door shut, screaming, \"Don't! Stop!\" In reaching for the doorknob, Mignone urinated on her clothes. As she exited the bathroom, Nuckols laughed and spun around in his chair to avoid facing her. Mignone said that it was not funny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nuckols admitted witnessing Fagan unlock the bathroom door on January 15, 2012. He also admitted that a few days prior to this incident, Mignone had told him that Fagan was unlocking the bathroom door. Nuckols admitted that he had not addressed the issue with Fagan prior to January 15, purportedly because their schedules had not overlapped, and because he forgot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the January 15, 2012 incident, two similar incidents occurred on the very next night. Both were witnessed by Corrections Officer I Dwayne Fidler. He testified that he saw Fagan unlock the bathroom door twice while Mignone was inside. On the second occasion, after unlocking the door Fagan said, \"move over and make room for me in there.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to Mignone, Fagan opened the bathroom door, and this time she confronted him directly. Fagan did not respond, and never apologized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 17, 2012, Mignone reported the bathroom incidents to Captains Dusty Jones and Cody Ross. Although Fagan was briefly transferred out of Unit 6, the Department returned him to the unit during the first week of February 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Captain Jones asked Mignone to write an inter-office communication about the allegations involving Fagan, which she did on January 24. Following this written complaint, Jones collected statements from a number of witnesses. Jones drafted a memorandum and submitted it to Deputy Warden Chris McBee. The packet of information was forwarded to the Department's central Human Resources office in Jefferson City on January 27, 2012. After reviewing Jones' memorandum, the Human Resources department did not recommend an investigation. Because Fagan admitted to unlocking the bathroom door while Mignone was inside, Human Resources returned the matter to prison management for supervisory action, and recommended that Fagan be submitted for discipline. Fagan was suspended for one day without pay.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    On February 9, 2012, Mignone met with Function Unit Manager Paden and Lieutenant Penland. At the meeting, Mignone was asked to agree to continue working with Fagan. She refused.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    On February 16, 2012, Mignone was transferred out of Unit 6.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Over the following several months, she worked at housing units all over the facility, until she was placed in Unit 10 in Fall 2012. The explanation Mignone received at the time of her transfer was that inmates had made a death threat against her. According to Mignone, she was told that a \"kite\" (or note)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    with a threat had been found, along with a shank. Although Mignone requested to see the items, she was not shown either a kite or a shank, and was later told by Department supervisors that the threat was verbal, not written. Officer Jani Holt conducted an internal investigation into the threat, and issued a report on April 20, 2012. Holt reported that she \"sincerely doubt[ed]\" that \"an actual 'hit' [had been] placed on COI J. Mignone.\" Holt's report stated that Mignone \"thinks it is all a ploy to get her out of six (6) house and I would agree with that completely.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    When Mignone asked about the status of her request to be transferred back to Unit 6 in May 2012, she was informed by the Warden that the investigation into the death threat had not been completed, and that her request to return to Housing Unit 6 would be reevaluated after the investigation concluded. Despite the Warden's claim that the internal investigation of the threat was ongoing, Holt's investigative report had been sent to the Warden weeks earlier. Moreover, on May 23, 2012, the Warden's clerical assistant sent an email stating that \"the administrative inquiry where the offender made a threat is complete. However, the matter between [Mignone] and Officer Fagan is not so they have not returned her to her post.\" The Warden acknowledged that, after completion of the investigation of the death threat, Mignone should have been returned to Unit 6, and Fagan should have been reassigned.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    On May 9, 2012, Mignone reported to Lieutenant Lorieann Hunter that Sgt. Nuckols had inappropriately touched her thigh in November 2011. According to Mignone's testimony at trial, Nuckols called her over to him at the beginning of a shift while he was seated in a chair, and placed his hand on her thigh. When Mignone jumped back and asked what he was doing, Nuckols said that there was something on her pants. Nuckols denied the allegation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Mignone was interviewed by Investigator Bill Johnson on August 7 and 15, 2012, concerning her complaint against Sgt. Nuckols. Mignone's co-worker Officer Keithly sat in on the second interview as a co-worker representative. During the second interview, Johnson pressured Mignone to put her statements in writing, even though she objected because she did not want to guess on dates. Mignone felt like Johnson wanted her to write something inaccurately so she could be punished. Johnson raised his voice, causing Mignone's heart to race. Keithly described Johnson's demeanor as \"aggressive\" because he was very pushy and would not give Mignone time to answer. Mignone became visibly upset. She hyperventilated and passed out, and struck her head as she fell, causing a concussion. Johnson did not get out of his seat to assist her. Mignone was transported to the hospital by ambulance, and was on leave for a week.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Beginning on October 3, 2012, supervisors completed a series of five \"Employee Performance Log\" entries concerning alleged acts of misconduct by Mignone, which became part of her personnel file. Mignone had not received any such log entries prior to October 2012.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    The first entry concerned Mignone's alleged refusal on October 3, 2012 to report to Officer Holt to be interviewed as part of Holt's investigation. The log entry states that Mignone's conduct \"demonstrate[d] blatant insubordination\" and \"a significant degree of unprofessionalism.\" The entry warned Mignone that \"any further occurrences of this nature could result in further action being taken,\" and that she would \"be closely monitored for any further incidents of this nature.\" The log entry was signed by multiple supervisory employees.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Mignone protested the log entry, contending that she did not refuse to meet with Holt, but instead merely asked for additional information. She also contended that the request that she meet with Holt should have been directed to her attorney, who had previously notified the Department by certified mail that he was representing Mignone in connection with her claims of sexual harassment. The Department denied Mignone's request to remove the log entry from her personnel file. It documented its refusal to rescind the earlier log entry both in a letter, and in a\n    <em>\n     further\n    </em>\n    Performance Log entry, which was once again signed by multiple supervisors.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Mignone received a third log entry on December 12, 2012. This entry asserted that, in an interaction with an inmate, she \"began making exaggerated gestures/movements with her arms and legs,\" which were \"visibly on display to the offenders assigned to the wing.\" The log entry also contended that, in later reaching across a desk for paperwork to sign, Mignone \"entered [another Corrections Officer's] personal space with her arms and upper torso,\" making her co-workers uncomfortable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    On January 16, 2013, Mignone was subject to a further log entry, in which she was accused of \"sharing information of a sensitive/confidential nature\" by informing another Corrections Officer that this lawsuit was pending, and that a supervisor \"gave me a write up for nothing.\" The log entry also noted that another Corrections Officer reported to a supervisor's office with two unsigned, printed copies of a report Mignone had prepared concerning a claim of sexual harassment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Finally, on January 30, 2013, a log entry was prepared contending that Mignone \"was observed walking down the front walk at which time she turned around and skipped backwards halfway down the walk upon entering [Housing Unit] 10.\" The log entry contended that Mignone's conduct \"poses a safety concern\" and \"appears unprofessional in nature.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Mignone testified that none of the log entries were justified; she explained that the claimed conduct did not occur, or that it was subject to a benign explanation. The evidence indicated that the log entries constituted a formal counseling, were the most severe form of discipline a Sergeant could issue without approval of higher-level supervisors, and that the log entries were recorded in an employee's annual performance appraisals. Mignone testified that she understood the log entries to be formal documents telling her she had done something wrong, and that they negatively impacted her employment. With respect to the December 2012 entry, Mignone testified that it made her feel \"[d]egraded like no other.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Mignone was treated by a family-practice physician, Dr. Rodney Malisos, and by a clinical social worker, Christine Urie, in 2012 and 2013. Dr. Malisos testified that Mignone reported being \"under a lot of stress,\" and told him that she was there for follow-up on a recent urgent care visit for anxiety. Dr. Malisos diagnosed Mignone with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and prescribed her fluoxetine, an antidepressant medication, and the \"herbal product\" Sentra AM.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Urie testified that Mignone's primary complaint on her first visit was that a coworker at WMCC had opened the bathroom door two times in January 2012. Mignone told Urie she was experiencing nightmares and physical symptoms, including a racing heart and fear at the workplace. Urie diagnosed Mignone with post-traumatic stress disorder. Urie also testified that the fact that Mignone \"was getting written up directly caus[ed] or directly contribut[ed] to cause [her] to suffer\n    emotional distress.\" Urie characterized Mignone as \"affect scared\" because she believed she was going to lose her job.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Mignone submitted three claims to the jury: (i) sexual harassment based on Fagan's conduct and comments; (ii) retaliation for her complaints against Fagan, in the form of a job reassignment and Performance Log entries; and (iii) retaliation for complaint against Nuckols, in the form of Johnson's \"hostile or intimidating\" interview on August 15, 2012. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Department and against Mignone on the sexual harassment claim, but found in her favor on both of her retaliation claims. The jury awarded Mignone $100,000 in actual damages, and assessed punitive damages at $400,000 on her claim of retaliation for reporting Fagan's conduct, and $600,000 on her claim of retaliation for reporting Nuckols' conduct. In addition to the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury, the circuit court's judgment also awarded Mignone $276,186 in attorney fees and costs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The Department appeals.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Department's first three Points allege errors in the jury instructions.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    Whether a jury was instructed properly is a question of law that this Court reviews\n    <em>\n     de novo.\n    </em>\n    This Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to submission of the instruction.

Given that it was undisputed that Mignone had made complaints of sexual harassment, the failure of Instructions No. 12 and No. 13 to require the jury to find that such complaints had been made does not rise to the level of reversible error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Department also complains that the verdict directors failed to require the jury to find that Mignone had a \"good faith\" belief that the conduct she opposed violated the MHRA. Under Missouri law, it is unnecessary for a plaintiff claiming retaliation to prove that the conduct they opposed was\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    unlawful.

The Department cites no authority to suggest, however, that the omission of \"good faith\" materially affected the jury's verdicts, when the relevant instructions already required the jury to find that Mignone's belief was \"reasonable.\" In its Reply Brief, the Department suggests that requiring the jury to find a \"good faith\" belief would have required it to find that Mignone\n    <em>\n     subjectively\n    </em>\n    believed that she had grounds for complaint, while the requirement of a \"reasonable belief\" embodies only an objective standard. In the absence of authority indicating that a jury would understand the requirements of \"good faith\" and \"reasonableness\" differently, we are unwilling to hold that the omission of \"good faith\" from the verdict directors constituted reversible error. We note that, in the analogous context of federal anti-retaliation and \"whistleblower\"-protection statutes, federal courts have repeatedly held that a requirement that a worker have a \"reasonable belief\" in the illegality of conduct includes\n    <em>\n     both\n    </em>\n    objective and subjective components.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    <strong>\n     C.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In its third Point, the Department contends that Instructions No. 12 and No. 13 were erroneous, because they failed to instruct the jury on the elements of a hostile work environment claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Mignone did not assert a hostile work environment claim, however. Mignone's claims of retaliation focused on discrete actions taken by the Department, allegedly as reprisals for her complaints of sexual harassment, rather than on the overall work environment created by the Department's actions in the aggregate. Mignone's retaliation claims arise under a different statutory provision ( \u00a7 213.070, RSMo ) than a hostile work environment claim (\u00a7 213.055), and the claims have different elements.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Mignone was \"the master of ... her lawsuit and [could] choose which causes of action to plead.\"\n    <em>\n     Cox v.

Ellington testified that Fagan made her feel uncomfortable during her initial employment training, that he stared at her when they saw each other in the prison, and that he asked her out to eat and invited her for rides on his motorcycle. Ellington testified that she considered Fagan's conduct flirtatious and inappropriate, given that she was married.

Despite admission of Ellington's testimony, the jury found in the Department's favor, and against Mignone, on her claim of sexual harassment by Fagan-the claim to which Ellington's testimony was relevant. Because Ellington did not report Fagan's actions to management, her testimony did nothing to establish the Department's knowledge of Fagan's tendencies, or the Department's response to complaints of sexual harassment, and it therefore had no direct relevance to Mignone's retaliation claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Given that Ellington's testimony was only relevant to a claim on which the Department prevailed, it was not prejudiced by the admission of that testimony.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    <strong>\n     B.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    The Department's fourth Point also challenges the admission of Mignone's Exhibit ZZZ, a report prepared by the Department's Director of Human Resources, Bridget White, based on her investigation of Johnson's interview of Mignone. With attachments, Exhibit ZZZ totaled 117 pages in length.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Although the Department now argues that Exhibit ZZZ was improperly admitted because Mignone failed to lay a proper foundation and the exhibit contains hearsay, it offered only a more limited objection at trial:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n    This is one of those investigations where I think there's a risk of some confusion on the part of her conclusions.

None of these interview summaries were subject to the Department's objection. Those unobjected-to interview summaries were obviously relevant to Mignone's retaliation claim based on Johnson's interviews. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the report as a whole was not outweighed by any danger of confusing the jury based on the report's conclusions. The report makes clear that White's investigation only \"partially substantiated\" Mignone's allegations. In particular, White emphasized that she \"was unable to substantiate whether Mr. Johnson acted in an intimidating manner towards COI J. Mi[g]none due to her protected class.\" Instead, White concluded only that Johnson violated Department policies by failing to treat information developed during his investigation as confidential; by failing to hold himself to an appropriate standard of conduct by using profanity, and derogatory and aggressive language, during his interviews of Mignone and others; and by not being fully truthful during the investigation. It would have been clear to the jury that White's report did not come to any conclusion on the issue they were required to decide with respect to Johnson's interviews of Mignone: whether Johnson conducted those interviews in a hostile manner in retaliation for Mignone's complaint of sexual harassment by Nuckols.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Point IV is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The Department's Point V contends that the circuit court erroneously submitted the issue of punitive damages to the jury on both of Mignone's retaliation claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    \"Section 213.111 provides that the court may award punitive damages to the plaintiff in an action filed pursuant to the MHRA.\"\n    <em>\n     Alhalabi v.

To the extent the Department repeats its earlier argument in Point V, we reject it for the reasons previously stated.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The actions alleged in Instruction No. 12 supported an award of punitive damages. Department witnesses testified that a transfer would be improper if an officer did not want to be transferred, and that in the circumstances of this case,\n    <em>\n     Fagan\n    </em>\n    should have been transferred out of Housing Unit 6, not Mignone. The evidence indicated that the Department transferred Mignone based on an alleged threat to her safety which the Department's own investigation concluded was fabricated. Moreover, when Mignone requested that she be returned to Unit 6, the Warden falsely told her that the Department's investigation of the death threat had not concluded. The Department's failure to promptly advise Mignone that it had concluded that the threat had been fabricated left Mignone to worry that she was in danger of attack from prison inmates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    As we discussed in \u00a7 I.A., the jury could determine that the various performance log entries made by Department personnel were intended as discipline, and that Mignone was justifiably concerned as to how those log entries would affect her tenure with the Department. The log entries were hardly isolated, random acts. There was evidence of five separate entries, each of which the jury could find lacked a good-faith, performance-related justification. These included entries for allegedly making exaggerated gestures with her arms and legs; leaning across a desk in a purportedly provocative manner; walking or skipping backwards; telling inmates to stop making sexual comments to her; and asking that a previous log entry be removed from her file. The jury could reasonably conclude that these behaviors, even if they occurred, did not deserve a formal written reprimand. In addition, several of the log entries were signed by multiple supervisors, which would magnify the significance of the log entries from Mignone's perspective, but also reflects that the preparation of these entries was reviewed, and approved, by multiple senior Department employees. It is significant that Mignone did not receive a single performance log entry during the first three years of her employment, but instead received uniformly positive performance appraisals until she filed a complaint against Fagan. Following her complaint, she received five log notes in the course of four months.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Williams v.

Nuckols, the Department contends that the evidence established that it \"promptly responded to the actions alleged\" by removing Johnson from the investigation of Mignone's complaint, and by initiating an investigation of Johnson himself. While\n    DOC's attempts to rectify Johnson's misconduct were commendable, they do not negate or neutralize the severity of Johnson's actions during his August 15, 2012 interview of Mignone, as a result of which she started hyperventilating, lost consciousness, suffered a concussion and was hospitalized. The evidence indicated that Johnson had been the subject of prior written complains, and one other employee who had been subject to a hostile interview by Johnson testified during trial. In addition, the evidence indicated that, during his earlier interview of Mignone on August 7, 2012, Johnson's aggressive questioning techniques led Mignone's co-worker representative to request a break, and advise Johnson to proceed in a less aggressive manner. Despite the earlier interview, Johnson persisted on August 15, with serious consequences. When Mignone lost consciousness and collapsed, Johnson showed no concern, but remained seated. This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the submissibility of punitive damages, was sufficient to justify the submission of Mignone's punitive damages claim involving the Johnson interviews.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Point V is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    In its final Point, the Department argues that the circuit court erroneously failed to remit the punitive damages award of $1,000,000, which included a $400,000 award on Mignone's retaliation claim for complaining about Fagan's sexual harassment, and a $600,000 award on her retaliation claim relating to her complaint of sexual harassment by Sgt.

The Department's own investigator agreed with Mignone's assessment that the fabricated inmate threat was \"a ploy to get her out of six (6) house,\" and the Warden used further deception when Mignone sought to return, by falsely denying that the internal investigation of the threat had concluded. The Department then engaged in a pattern of retaliation through repeated unjustified log entries, which were approved by multiple supervisory employees. \"Though it is true that [Mignone]'s harm was neither physical nor economic, it was certainly emotional and psychological,\"\n    <em>\n     Diaz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6808819\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/64/#p90\">\n     484 S.W.3d at 90\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , resulting in emotional distress that was severe enough that she was diagnosed with anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and prescribed medication.

Both Mignone and her co-worker representative, who was present at the interview, testified that Johnson behaved in an aggressive and intimidating manner throughout the interview. Johnson engaged in this behavior despite the fact that Mignone had reacted adversely to his interviewing techniques a week earlier, and despite the fact that Mignone repeatedly told Johnson that her heart was racing and that she was not feeling well. When Mignone lost consciousness, Johnson did nothing to help her. As a result of the interview, Mignone suffered a concussion and was on leave from work for a week. Johnson's conduct during the August 15, 2012 interview was consistent with his prior behavior, which had been the subject of formal complaints. We find that Johnson's behavior, resulting in physical harm to Mignone and evidencing an indifference to her health and safety, was sufficiently reprehensible to warrant an award of $600,000 in punitive damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The Department also argues that the ratio between the actual and punitive award was so disproportionate as to be excessive.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    With regard to the second\n    <em>\n     Gore\n    </em>\n    guidepost, [the Supreme Court of the United States] has been reluctant to identify concrete constitutional limits on the ratio between harm, or potential harm, to the plaintiff and the punitive damages award; but, in practice, few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages will satisfy due process. Single-digit multipliers are more likely to comport with due process, while still achieving the State's deterrence and retribution goals.... Because there are no rigid benchmarks, ratios greater than those that this Court\n    has previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages, but when compensatory damages are substantial, then an even lesser ratio can reach the outermost limit of the due process guarantee.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    <em>\n     State Farm\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p416\">\n     538 U.S. at 410\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030875\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/408/#p416\">\n     123 S.Ct. 1513\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    In this case the ratio between $100,000 in actual damages and $1,000,000 in punitive damages does not violate due process principles.
