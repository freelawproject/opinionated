Tolen (\"Movant\") appeals the judgment of the motion court, in which it denied his Motion to Reopen his Rule 29.15 Post-Conviction Proceedings pursuant to Rule 75.01. Finding Movant cannot establish that his plea counsel failed to comply with Rule 29.15(e), we affirm the motion court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. We have, however, provided the parties a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed under Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
