Regarding the felony offense of passing a bad check, Petitioner was convicted on April 1, 1986. Petitioner received a suspended execution of sentence and five years' probation for the felony offense, which he completed in April of 1991. Approximately six months after that conviction, on October 15, 1986, Petitioner was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated. Thus, Petitioner's conviction of driving while intoxicated occurred after his felony conviction for passing a bad check but before his probationary period was completed. By its plain language, we find that \u00a7 610.140.5(2) only prohibits expungement of a felony when a person has been found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   a petitioner completed his sentence of imprisonment or any period of probation or parole. Thus, Petitioner's misdemeanor driving while intoxicated conviction, which preceded his completion of his probationary period, did not\n   bar him from seeking expungement of his felony conviction for passing a bad check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Per \u00a7 610.140.5(1), the court may not grant an expungement request until twenty years has passed since Petitioner completed his probation for the felony offense. Consequently, Petitioner was prevented from seeking expungement until 2011. Petitioner filed an amended petition seeking expungement of his conviction for passing a bad check on April 12, 2017. The trial court entered a judgment in favor of Petitioner. Missouri State Highway Patrol Criminal Records Repository and the Office of the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney (\"Appellants\") have appealed this judgment, contending that Petitioner has failed to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 610.140.5. Finding Petitioner has complied with all the requirements of \u00a7 610.140.5, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As this is a court-tried case, our review is governed by\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

The sole issue presented is a matter of statutory interpretation. The primary rule of statutory interpretation is to effectuate the General Assembly's intent.\n   <em>\n    Bateman v. Rinehart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7094852\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/391/441/#p446\">\n    391 S.W.3d 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (Mo. banc 2013). \"If the words are clear, the [c]ourt must apply the plain meaning of the law\" and refrain from using canons of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/#p266\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 266 (Mo. banc 2016), as modified, (Sept. 20, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellants argue that the trial court erred in granting Petitioner's request for expungement because, in less than a year after his conviction for passing a bad check, he was convicted for driving while intoxicated, thereby barring him from having his conviction for passing a bad check expunged under \u00a7 610.140.5. We disagree with Appellants' reading of the statute. Section 610.140.6 allows for the trial court to grant expungement if, after holding a hearing, the court determines that the petitioner \"meets all the criteria set forth in subsection 5 of this section.\" Appellants do not argue that Petitioner has failed to meet the requirements listed in subsections (3), (4), or (5). Thus, only the requirements noted in subsections (1) and (2) are in dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The relevant portion of \u00a7 610.140.5 reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The court may set a hearing on the matter no sooner than thirty days from the filing of the petition and shall give reasonable notice of the hearing to each entity named in the petition. At the hearing, the court may accept evidence and hear testimony on, and may consider, the following criteria for each of the offenses, violations, or infractions listed in the petition for expungement:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) It has been at least twenty years if the offense is a felony, or at least ten years if the offense is a misdemeanor, municipal offense, or infraction,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     since the person making the application completed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (a) Any sentence of imprisonment; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (b)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Any period of probation or parole\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) The person has not been found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony, not including violations of the traffic regulations provided under chapters 304 and 307, during\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the time period specified for the underlying offense in subdivision (1) of this subsection\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 610.140.5. (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the court's findings, it implicitly explains how it applied \u00a7 610.140.5 by stating, \"More than twenty (20) years has passed since [Petitioner] has\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     completed his probationary period\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for the felony of passing bad checks under cause number 21CCR-526547,\" and \"[Petitioner] has not been found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony during [that time period].\" (emphasis added). We believe the court properly interpreted and applied the statutory provisions in question. Looking only at the relevant language in the statute for addressing this issue, a petitioner meets the criteria in subsection \u00a7 610.140.5(1) &amp; (2) if \"it has been at least twenty years ... since the person making the application [for expungement] completed any period of probation or parole [and] [t]he person has not been found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony ... during [that twenty year] time period.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 610.140.5. There is no reference to a petitioner's date of conviction in the provision. We find that the plain language of the statute is unambiguous. When the plain and ordinary language of a statute is clear, \"there is no need to resort to tools of interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/#p266\">\n    497 S.W.3d at 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the statute's plain language, \"the time period specified\" in \u00a7 610.140.5(1) begins on the date that the \"person making the application [has] completed\" any sentence of imprisonment or any period of probation or parole, not the date of the petitioner's conviction for the offense he or she is seeking to expunge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thus, the \"the time period specified for the underlying offense in subdivision (1) of [\u00a7 610.140.5],\" as applied to Petitioner's case, would begin in April of 1991, when Petitioner completed his probationary period for passing a bad check. \u00a7 610.140.5(2). Because Petitioner's conviction for driving while intoxicated occurred on October 15, 1986-outside of \"the time period specified\" in \u00a7 610.140.5(1)-Petitioner met the criterion articulated in \u00a7 610.140.5(2), as he had not been found guilty of a misdemeanor or felony during that specified time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mary K.
