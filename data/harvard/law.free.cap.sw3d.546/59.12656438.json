We conclude that a new rule applies retroactively to cases pending on direct review when the new rule is announced but does so subject to other jurisprudential concepts, such as appellate review preservation requirements and the plain error doctrine. Accordingly, the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177208\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/502/118/\">\n    502 S.W.3d 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tenn. Crim.

Nevertheless, we evaluate the defendant's entitlement to relief by applying the plain error doctrine because the defendant failed to challenge the constitutionality of the statute in the trial court. We conclude that the defendant has established the criteria necessary to obtain relief pursuant to the plain error doctrine. Therefore, we reverse that portion of the Court of Criminal Appeals' decision denying the defendant relief and vacate the defendant's convictions under the criminal gang offense statute. We remand this matter to the trial court for resentencing on the defendant's remaining convictions in accordance with the sentencing classification ranges established by the specific statutes creating the offenses, without any classification or sentence enhancement pursuant to the criminal gang offense statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 8, 2014, Christopher Minor, a member of the Black P-Stone Nation criminal gang,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and another gang member went to an apartment Rico Swift shared with his girlfriend, Julie Frye, on the pretext of buying marijuana. They were acting on orders from a gang leader to rob Mr. Swift, and other gang members were waiting just outside the apartment. The two men entered the apartment, and, when Mr. Swift turned his back to retrieve the marijuana, they attacked him, punching and choking him. During the assault, the other gang members entered the apartment. According to Ms. Frye, the men choked Mr. Swift until his legs \"started jumping\" and he turned blue. When Ms. Frye attempted to leave the room to grab a knife to assist Mr. Swift, the defendant followed her and struck her with a gun, knocking her unconscious. By the time Ms. Frye regained consciousness, the assailants were gone, but Mr. Swift was lying on the sofa, unconscious and badly injured in a pool of his own blood. Emergency personnel were summoned, but Mr. Swift died from the injuries he sustained. Ms. Frye\n   later discovered that the assailants had also stolen items from her purse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Days later, police investigators linked the defendant to the crime. They showed Ms. Frye a photographic array, and she identified the defendant as the person who beat Mr. Swift and knocked her unconscious. When the officers questioned the defendant, he admitted being present at Mr. Swift's apartment, but he denied any involvement in assaulting Mr. Swift or Ms. Frye. According to the defendant, he was simply a scout and left the apartment and advised the gang members waiting outside not to go through with the planned robbery because Mr. Swift was not alone. The defendant admitted accepting his share of the proceeds from the robbery, however, explaining that he would have been disciplined by the gang had he refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Madison County Grand Jury returned a sixteen-count indictment charging the defendant with two counts of felony murder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   two counts of aggravated robbery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of aggravated burglary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of aggravated assault,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   six counts of violating the criminal gang offense statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which corresponded to the preceding six offenses charged in the indictment, one count of being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of employing a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   one count of being a convicted felon who employed a firearm during the commission of a dangerous felony,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and one additional count of violating the criminal gang offense statute, which corresponded to the charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first phase of the defendant's bifurcated trial, the jury convicted him on the charges of felony murder, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, and employing a firearm during the commission of the dangerous felony of aggravated burglary. In the second phase of the trial, the jury convicted the defendant on the remaining charges, including the seven counts of violating the criminal gang offense statute. These convictions qualified the defendant for sentencing on the criminal gang offenses at \"one (1) classification higher than the classification established by the specific statute[s] creating the offense[s] committed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-121\">\n    Tenn.

Although the record is not crystal clear, at least ten years of the defendant's effective sentence resulted from enhancement under the criminal gang offense statute. Additionally, the trial court recorded the defendant's convictions of aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, aggravated assault, and felon in possession of a handgun as one classification higher than the classifications established by the statutes creating the offenses, as authorized by the criminal gang offense statute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2040-35-121\">\n    Tenn.

In his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals, the defendant relied on\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   to attack-for the first time-the constitutionality of the criminal gang offense statute, arguing that his convictions under the statute should be vacated and his case remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    Minor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20634781\">\n    2017 WL 634781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9. The defendant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7. The State countered that the evidence sufficiently supported the defendant's convictions, that the defendant had waived his constitutional challenge to the statute by failing to raise the issue in the trial court, and that the defendant was not entitled to relief on his constitutional claim via the plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A majority of the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with the State's arguments and affirmed the defendant's convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In applying the plain error doctrine and answering the question of whether a clear and unequivocal rule of law had been breached, the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeals focused on the law existing at the time of the defendant's trial rather than at the time of appeal and concluded that no breach had occurred because, like any other statute, the criminal gang offense statute was presumptively constitutional until later declared invalid by\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One judge dissented and would have reversed and vacated the defendant's convictions under the criminal gang offense statute. The dissenting judge opined that even though he had not raised the issue in the trial court, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   unconstrained by the plain error doctrine because his case was pending on appeal when\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   was decided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11 (McMullen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

The Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   If the ... words \"plain error\" cover both (1) trial court decisions that were plainly correct at the time when the judge made the decision and (2) trial court decisions that were plainly\n   <em>\n    incorrect\n   </em>\n   at the time when the judge made the decision, then why should they not also cover (3) cases in the middle-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where the law at the time of the trial judge's decision was neither clearly correct nor incorrect, but unsettled?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   To hold to the contrary would bring about unjustifiably different treatment of similarly situated individuals. Imagine three virtually identical defendants, each from a different circuit, each sentenced\n   in January to identical long prison terms, and each given those long sentences for the same reason, namely to obtain rehabilitative treatment. Imagine that none of them raises an objection. In June, the Supreme Court holds this form of sentencing unlawful. And, in December, each of the three different circuits considers the claim that the trial judge's January-imposed prison term constituted a legal error. Imagine further that in the first circuit the law in January made the trial court's decision clearly lawful as of the time when the judge made it; in the second circuit, the law in January made the trial court's decision clearly unlawful as of the time when the judge made it; and in the third circuit, the law in January was unsettled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   To apply [the] words \"plain error\" as of the time of appellate review would treat all three defendants alike.... To interpret \"plain error\" differently, however, would treat these three virtually identical defendants differently, allowing only the first two defendants, but not the third defendant, potentially to qualify for [plain error] relief. All three defendants suffered from legal error; all three failed to object; and all three would benefit from the new legal interpretation. What reason is there to give two of these three defendants the benefits of a new rule of law, but not the third?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   There is no practical ground for making this distinction. To the contrary, to distinguish and treat more harshly cases where a circuit's law was unclear would simply promote arguments about\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   the law of the circuit initially was unclear (rather than clearly settled one way or the other). And these arguments are likely to be particularly difficult to resolve where what is at issue is a matter of legal degree, not kind. To what extent, for example, did a prosecutor's closing argument go\n   <em>\n    too far\n   </em>\n   down the road of prejudice? A \"time of error\" interpretation also would require courts of appeals to play a kind of temporal ping-pong, looking at\n   <em>\n    the law that now is\n   </em>\n   to decide whether \"error\" exists, looking at\n   <em>\n    the law that then was\n   </em>\n   to decide whether the error was \"plain,\" and looking at\n   <em>\n    the circumstances that now\n   </em>\n   are to decide whether the defendant has satisfied\n   <em>\n    Olano\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    's\n   </em>\n   third and fourth criteria.

The law at the time of the defendant's trial concerning the constitutionality of the criminal gang offense statute cannot be characterized as unsettled. Rather, the issue was simply undecided because no court had addressed it. Given the absence of a court ruling on the constitutionality of the criminal gang offense statute and the presumption of constitutional validity courts ordinarily afford statutes,\n   <em>\n    State v. Pickett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8341263\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/211/696/#p700\">\n    211 S.W.3d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (Tenn. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gallaher v.

The Court of Criminal Appeals' decision in\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   declaring the criminal gang offense statute unconstitutional constitutes the law now existing. The State neither sought review of\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   nor defended the constitutionality of the statute in this appeal. Accordingly, based on the law now existing, the defendant's convictions and enhanced sentencing under the unconstitutional criminal gang offense statute violate a clear and unequivocal rule of law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    3. Was a substantial right of the accused adversely affected?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The defendant has also established that this plain error adversely affected a substantial right. The record on appeal demonstrates that the defendant's effective sentence was enhanced by at least ten years based on an unconstitutional statute. The defendant's liberty interest-a substantial right to be sure-has been adversely affected by his convictions and enhanced sentencing under the unconstitutional statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    4. Did the accused waive the issue for tactical reasons?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Nothing in the record indicates that the defendant waived his challenge to the constitutionality of the statute for tactical reasons. Nor has the State suggested any tactical advantage the defendant would have gained by failing to raise the issue in the trial court. Thus, this criterion has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    5. Is consideration of the error necessary to do substantial justice?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The State argues that consideration of the error is not necessary to do substantial\n   justice because the defendant \"has over sixty-one years of sentence that gang enhancement did not impact.\" Furthermore, says the State, the basis on which\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   declared the statute unconstitutional-its failure to require the prosecution to prove a nexus between gang membership and the crimes committed-is \"more theoretical than real\" as applied to the defendant's case. The State asserts that the proof at the defendant's trial, including the defendant's admission that he went to Mr. Swift's apartment on the orders of a gang leader, overwhelmingly established a nexus between the defendant's crimes and his gang membership, even though the statute did not require the prosecution to prove the nexus. Finally, the State posits that consideration of the error is not necessary to do substantial justice because the defendant \"may have a potential avenue of post-conviction relief available to him to vindicate his constitutional rights.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We disagree with the State and conclude that consideration of the error is necessary to do substantial justice. Regardless of the sixty-one-year sentence, the defendant's effective sentence was enhanced by\n   <em>\n    ten\n   </em>\n   additional years based on an unconstitutional statute. Furthermore, the constitutional defect was not cured or mitigated by the proof at trial, as the State argues. This is true because, while the defendant admitted going to the apartment at the direction of a gang member on the pretext of buying marijuana, he only admitted to being a scout and denied participating in the crimes that occurred. Even more importantly, the jury was not required to determine whether the prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt a nexus between the defendant's gang membership and the crimes. Finally, the potential availability of relief on collateral review does not curtail the authority of appellate courts to grant relief on direct review via the plain error doctrine. Indeed, where the defendant has established all the criteria necessary for obtaining relief via the plain error doctrine, denying relief because a post-conviction remedy may be available would merely delay justice, and justice delayed is justice denied.\n   <em>\n    State v. Blackstock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9129638\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/200/#p213\">\n    19 S.W.3d 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 213 (Tenn. 2000) (\"We have reversed the conviction and sentence, and the remedy is a new trial and sentencing. In this case, however, where the defendant has served his entire sentence, the prospect of a new trial is of dubious practical value and unlikely to be in the interest of the defendant, the victim, or the public as a whole. In short, the criminal justice system has failed in this case, and justice delayed has been justice denied.\"). We conclude that the defendant has established the criteria necessary to obtain relief under the plain error doctrine, and we exercise our authority to grant relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that new rules apply retroactively to cases pending on direct review but do so subject to other jurisprudential concepts, such as appellate review preservation requirements and the plain error doctrine. Because the defendant has established his entitlement to relief via the plain error doctrine, the defendant's convictions under the criminal gang offense statute are vacated, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing in accordance with the sentencing classification ranges established by the specific statutes creating the offenses, without any classification or sentence enhancement pursuant to the criminal gang offense statute.

Similarly, in this case, no Tennessee court had addressed the constitutionality of the criminal gang offense statute at the time of the defendant's trial and sentencing hearing, although a Florida court had declared a similar Florida statute unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In both\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   and this case, the relevant issues were not definitively resolved for the first time until the defendants' cases were pending on appeal. Any other factual distinctions between this appeal and\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   are not sufficient to justify declining to adopt\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Adopting the\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   approach would serve the interest of fairness to the parties, clarity in the law, and conservation of judicial resources. This Court asked the parties to brief and argue\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   , and the parties did so. In four previous appeals, we declined to accept or reject\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is time we decide this issue. We should not stop short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For all these reasons, I would adopt as the law in Tennessee the United States Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Henderson v.
