Smith, proceeding pro se, challenges the trial court's order modifying the conservatorship terms of the parties' divorce decree to enable appellee, Grace Karanja, to travel abroad with the parties' child, L.S. Smith contends that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) determining that a material and substantial change had occurred since the date of the parties' divorce decree, (2) finding that the modification was in L.S.'s best interest, and (3) failing to impose appropriate international abduction prevention measures in permitting Karanja to travel with L.S. to Kenya.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although we are constrained by Smith's decision to forgo providing the reporter's record on appeal, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion because its factual findings supported neither the legal conclusion it drew nor the breadth of the relief it granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 37.3(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We reverse and render judgment in favor of Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 5, 2016, Karanja filed a motion to modify the trial court's April 29, 2016 decree finalizing her divorce from Smith, appointing her and Smith joint managing conservators of L.S., and designating the parties' possession and support obligations for L.S. However, the decree did not address L.S.'s ability to travel abroad. Thus, Karanja contended that there had been a substantial change in circumstances, which she described as follows: \"Movant believes it is in [L.S.]'s best interest that she is allowed to travel with [L.S.] to the country of [movant's] birth in Kenya Africa,\" because L.S.'s \"grandfather recently died and [Karanja] and the children would like to visit Kenya and attend a memorial service planned for her father.\" She requested temporary orders, specifically that Smith \"properly execute the written consent form to travel abroad and any other form required for the travel,\" as well as modification of the final decree \"so that it will add an international travel provision for the parties to adhere to.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Smith's response asked the trial court \"to deny all international travel privileges until the child, [L.S.], is of the age of maturity and/or 16 years of age\" pursuant\n   to Texas Family Code section 153.501, which provides that if credible evidence indicating a potential risk of international abduction of a child by a parent is presented, the court may take certain protective measures prescribed in section 153.503.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. FAM. CODE ANN. \u00a7\u00a7 153.501 -.503 (West 2014).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Family Code section 153.503(4) empowers a trial court to deny a child the ability to travel abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 153.503(4) (permitting the trial court to order passport and travel controls \"prohibit[ing] the parent ... from removing the child from this state or the United States,\" \"requir[ing] the parent to surrender any passport issued in the child's name,\" and \"prohibit[ing] the parent from applying on behalf of the child for a new or replacement passport or international travel visa\"). Because Kenya is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, Smith argued, such measures are necessary in this case, because permitting Karanja to \"secure the passport and return to her country permanently,\" could cause him to \"lose all contact with [L.S.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Smith asserted in his response that Karanja \"remained in the US as an illegal resident for 7 years. And now, 16 years later, she is petitioning ... to secure [L.S.]'s passport with the intent to permanently resettle to her homeland.\" He also argued that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If [Karanja] is empowered with the passport, all subsequent decisions, agreements, and court orders will be ignored in [the] absence of a treaty agreement between nations. There are no consequences for her and no remedies for me. Neither parent should suffer the burden of complete separation and alienation from their children. And all children have rights to access both parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   He concluded, \"If the scales of justice are meant to right that which is wrong, then it is my prayer that a seemingly routine decision is given greater scrutiny.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of the evidentiary hearing held on November 16, 2016, the trial court granted Karanja's motion to modify. Smith immediately filed a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Karanja filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The proposed findings of fact\n   and conclusions of law are unsigned, and the clerk's record does not include any separate findings of fact and conclusions of law entered by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 18, 2016, the trial court signed the Order Modifying the Divorce Decree which is the subject of this appeal. In it, the court found that \"the material allegations in [Karanja]'s Motion to Modify are true and the modifications made by this order are in the best interest of [L.S.],\" and ordered as follows: (1) either parent may apply for a passport for L.S., but must notify the other parent within five days; (2) Karanja has the right to maintain possession of the passport; (3) either parent must deliver the passport to the requesting parent within ten days of notice of intent to have L.S. travel abroad; (4) either parent must provide written notice to the other parent of plans to travel internationally within twenty-one days of the date of departure, and of certain information describing the travel (such as date, time, location, means of transportation) and (5) either parent must properly execute a written consent form to travel abroad and any other required form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court further found that \"credible evidence has been presented to the court indicating a potential risk of the international abduction of a child by a parent of the child,\" and so ordered that Karanja take certain protective measures, including posting a $75,000 bond and following detailed procedures for notification to the U.S. Department of State's Office of Children's Issues and to the relevant foreign consulate or embassy, before traveling abroad with L.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.

As Karanja stated in her petition, L.S. \"has traveled to Kenya on several occasions before with no issues\"; thus, travel to visit family in Kenya was an eventuality which was anticipated before the parties' divorce. Critically, while the divorce was pending-and a year before Karanja filed her motion to modify-Smith\n   filed a motion addressing the need to determine whether Karanja should be permitted to travel abroad with L.S. and requesting that L.S.'s passport \"be placed in [t]rust with the Court pending the outcome of the divorce proceedings.\" These record facts show that L.S.'s international travel issue was not a changed circumstance, but rather an issue of some contention between the parties which they neglected to address in their divorce decree. This paired with the trial court's express finding in the modification order that Karanja is a flight risk renders the trial court's modification order arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given these facts, it simply is not rational to conclude that Karanja's desire to renew L.S.'s passport to permit her to travel to Kenya to visit family constituted a change to circumstances as they existed at the time the parties' divorce decree was entered only three months earlier that would justify the trial court's modification order. \"[T]o construe section 156.101, requiring a material and substantial change in circumstances, as being satisfied by\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   change in circumstances would render the statutory requirement meaningless and defeat the Legislature's intent in enacting it.\"\n   <em>\n    In re K.J.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222227\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/138/536/#p538\">\n    138 S.W.3d 536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538 (Tex.

On the record before us, such carte blanche permission to Karanja to control L.S.'s international travel is contrary to the statutory requirement that a modification order be based upon a material and substantial change in circumstances. The changed circumstances here were the death of L.S.'s grandfather; that change does not open the door to other international travel that could have been anticipated at the time of the divorce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wiese\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203136874\">\n    2016 WL 3136874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (holding that trial court abused its discretion in concluding that a material and substantial change of circumstances had occurred in part because the parties' children would \"benefit from international travel\" now that they were ten years older because it is insufficient to show that children would benefit from such travel);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re K.J.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9222227\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/138/536/#p538\">\n    138 S.W.3d at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that ignoring requirement of material and substantial change \"would render the statutory requirement meaningless and defeat the Legislature's intent in enacting it\").
