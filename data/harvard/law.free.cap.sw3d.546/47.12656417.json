BIVINS, CHIEF JUSTICE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We assumed jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 16-3-201(d)(1) and Rule 48 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court and ordered expedited briefing and oral argument. The issue we must determine is whether the vacancy in the Office of Mayor of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County may be filled at the August 2, 2018 election, or whether it must be filled at a special election pursuant to section 15.03 of the Metropolitan Charter. We conclude that section 15.03 of the Metropolitan Charter requires that a special election be set, that the Davidson County Election Commission therefore acted in contravention of the Charter in setting the election on August 2, 2018, and that the trial court erred in denying Mr. Wallace's claims for relief and dismissing this case. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. The Commission is hereby ordered to set a special election in accordance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 2-14-102(a). This opinion is not subject to rehearing under Tennessee Rule of Appellate Procedure 39, and the Clerk is directed to certify this opinion as final and to immediately issue the mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 6, 2018, the Mayor of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee resigned. On that same date, the Metropolitan Clerk notified the Davidson County Administrator of Elections of the vacancy in the Office of Mayor. On\n   March 9, 2018, the Davidson County Election Commission (the \"Commission\") met, in part, for the purpose of setting a date for an election to fill the vacancy in the Office of Mayor. The Commission heard a brief presentation by legal counsel for the Commission, discussed the matter, heard public comment, including comment by counsel for Mr. Wallace, and further discussed the matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Commission then voted three to two against filing a declaratory judgment action seeking judicial guidance; three to two against setting the election on May 1, 2018; and three to two in favor of setting the election on August 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 12, 2018, Mr. Wallace filed in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee a \"Petition for Writ of Certiorari and Writ of Mandamus,\" naming as defendants the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County (\"Metro\") and the Commission. Mr. Wallace asserted jurisdiction pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated sections 27-9-101 (common law writ of certiorari), 29-25-102 (mandamus), and 29-14-102 (declaratory judgment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Wallace alleged that he is a citizen and resident of Nashville and that he is a qualified candidate for the Office of Mayor. He alleged that the action of the Commission in setting the election to fill the vacancy in the Office of Mayor on August 2, 2018, was in contravention of the Metropolitan Charter (the \"Charter\") and so was arbitrary, capricious, and illegal. Mr. Wallace further alleged that the effect of the Commission's action was to deny him the right to seek election to the Office of Mayor because it extended the election\n   period. According to Mr. Wallace, he lacks the financial resources to run a campaign for this additional election period. Mr. Wallace sought a writ of certiorari voiding the action of the Commission, a declaratory judgment declaring the action of the Commission illegal, and a writ of mandamus ordering that the Commission set a special election in May 2018, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 2-14-102. Mr. Wallace also filed a motion for extraordinary relief and for an expedited hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 12, 2018, the trial court issued a writ of certiorari and directed Metro and the Commission to forward to the Clerk and Master of the Chancery Court a transcript and complete record of the proceedings before the Commission. On that same date, the trial court granted Mr. Wallace's motion for an expedited hearing and set the hearing for March 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 13, 2018, Metro and the Commission filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12.02(6) of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure. Metro and the Commission subsequently filed a declaration of the Administrator of Elections with exhibits, including a digital recording of the Commission's March 9, 2018 meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on March 14, 2018. The parties agreed that the hearing and the subsequent ruling of the trial court would constitute a final adjudication of and judgment on the merits, and the trial court considered the matter accordingly. The trial court issued a ruling from the bench, finding that Mr. Wallace was not entitled to the relief sought. On March 16, 2018, the trial court entered its final order, adjudicating the case on the merits. Based on its construction of section 15.03 of the Charter, the trial court concluded: \"[T]here is a general metropolitan election scheduled within 12 months after the March 6, 2018 vacancy in the office of mayor, and, therefore, no special election is required. The August 2, 2018 election, a general election where several metropolitan government offices appear on the ballot, is a metropolitan general election. Accordingly, the Election Commission did not err in setting the mayoral election for August 2, 2018.\" The trial court denied mandamus relief and dismissed the case \"in its entirety.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 15, 2018, Mr. Wallace filed a notice of appeal. On that same date, he filed in this Court a motion requesting that we assume jurisdiction pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated section 16-3-201(d)(1) and Rule 48 of the Rules of the Tennessee Supreme Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By Order filed March 22, 2018, this Court granted Mr. Wallace's motion, assumed jurisdiction over this appeal, and set an expedited briefing schedule and oral argument. Oral argument for this case was held on April 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

This issue requires the Court to construe section 15.03 of the Charter and, more particularly, the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" as used in this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The principles of statutory construction guide us in our interpretation of the Charter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Renteria-Villegas v.

Construction of the Charter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 15.03 of the Charter provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Sec. 15.03.-Special elections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    There shall be held a special metropolitan election to fill a vacancy for the unexpired term in the office of mayor and in the office of district council member whenever such vacancy shall exist more than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the next general metropolitan election.\n   </em>\n   The special election shall be ordered by the county commissioners of elections and they shall give notice thereof as provided by Tennessee Code Annotated section 2-14-105. When a vacancy exists in the office of vice mayor or in the office of councilmember-at-large, said office shall remain vacant until the next general election at which time such vacancy shall be filled; however, in no event shall a special election be held to fill such vacancy. If in such special election to fill a vacancy for the unexpired term of the office of mayor or district council member, or in the general election at which time a vacancy in the office of vice mayor or councilmember-at-large, no candidate shall receive a majority of all the votes cast for such office, a runoff election shall be held five (5) weeks subsequent to the first special election to fill a vacancy in accordance with the provisions hereinbefore set forth in the case of a general metropolitan election. The provisions of section 15.01 hereof with respect to voting in general metropolitan elections and with respect to qualifying as a candidate shall apply to special elections and to general elections at which time a vacancy is filled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 15.01 of the Charter provides that the Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large and District Councilmen are to be elected at a \"general metropolitan election,\" held on the first Thursday in August\n   of every fourth odd-numbered year, beginning in 1971. The term for each of these offices is four years and expires upon the election and qualification of a successor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 3.02, 5.02, and 5.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is undisputed that, in accordance with section 15.01 of the Charter, the next regularly scheduled general metropolitan election for Mayor is to be held on August 1, 2019. Mr. Wallace contends that a special election is required under section 15.03 of the Charter because August 1, 2019 is the next \"general metropolitan election\" and it is more than twelve months after the March 6, 2018 vacancy. Metro and the Commission, in contrast, contend that any municipal general election constitutes a \"general metropolitan election\" and that the municipal general election scheduled for August 2, 2018, at which a number of other municipal officers will be elected, is the next \"general metropolitan election.\" Because that general election is less than twelve months from the date of the vacancy, Metro and the Commission contend that no special election is required under section 15.03 of the Charter. We, therefore, are called upon to construe section 15.03 of the Charter, and specifically the meaning of the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" as used in that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Article 15 of the Charter deals exclusively with elections for the offices of Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large, and District Councilmen. As noted, section 15.01 provides that the Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large, and District Councilmen are elected in a particular type of municipal general election, referred to as a \"general metropolitan election.\" The general metropolitan election for these enumerated offices is held every fourth odd-numbered year beginning in 1971.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 15.03 of the Charter, in turn, provides for elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large, and District Councilmen. This section draws a clear and critical distinction between elections to fill vacancies in the offices of Mayor and District Councilmen, on the one hand, and vacancies in the offices of Vice Mayor and Councilmen-at-Large, on the other hand. Vacancies in the offices of Mayor and District Councilmen are to be filled by special metropolitan election \"whenever such vacancy shall exist more than twelve (12) months prior to the date of the\n   <em>\n    next general metropolitan election.\n   </em>\n   \" Charter, \u00a7 15.03 (emphasis added). In contrast, vacancies in the offices of Vice Mayor and Councilmen-at-Large are never to be filled by special election. Rather, these offices \"shall remain vacant until the\n   <em>\n    next general election\n   </em>\n   at which time such vacancy shall be filled.\" Charter, \u00a7 15.03 (emphasis added). Section 15.03 reinforces this differentiation in the use of the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" and the phrase \"general election\" in its differing treatment of the elections to fill vacancies in the different offices subject to Article 15. Section 15.03 provides, for example, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [i]f in such\n   <em>\n    special election\n   </em>\n   to fill a vacancy for the unexpired term of the\n   <em>\n    office of mayor or district council member\n   </em>\n   , or in the\n   <em>\n    general election\n   </em>\n   at which time a vacancy in the\n   <em>\n    office of vice mayor or councilmember-at-large\n   </em>\n   [is filled], no candidate shall receive a majority of all the votes cast for such office, a runoff election shall be held five (5) weeks subsequent to the first special election to fill a vacancy in accordance with the provisions hereinbefore set forth in the case of\n   <em>\n    a general metropolitan election.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added). Section 15.03 further provides: \"The provisions of section 15.01 hereof with respect to voting in\n   <em>\n    general metropolitan elections\n   </em>\n   and with respect to qualifying as a candidate shall apply to\n   <em>\n    special elections and to general elections\n   </em>\n   at which time a vacancy is filled.\" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   That the intent of the drafters of the Charter was to draw a distinction between \"general metropolitan elections\" and all other \"general elections\" is evidenced by the use of these distinct phrases within section 15.03 to address different events. We do not read the use of the distinct phrases \"general metropolitan election\" and \"general election\" to be merely accidental. Rather, we view the two phrases to have been intentionally and thoughtfully employed to refer to different elections. The former phrase refers to the particular general election at which the Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large, and District Councilmen are elected in August of each fourth odd-numbered year, beginning in 1971, as called for in section 15.01 of the Charter. In contrast, the latter phrase refers more broadly to any municipal general election, including but not limited to general metropolitan elections. In other words, \"general metropolitan elections\" are one unique type of the broader category of municipal \"general elections.\" All municipal \"general elections,\" however, are not \"general metropolitan elections.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The distinction between the phrases \"general metropolitan election\" and \"general election\" is further evidenced by the fact that the Charter employs the former phrase only with respect to elections involving the offices of Mayor, Vice Mayor, District Councilmen, and Councilmen-at-Large. Indeed, with the exception of Article 15, the Charter utilizes the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" in only one other instance, Article 18, section 18.06. That section addresses the election of District Councilmen following re-districting. The election of District Councilmen falls under Article 15 of the Charter, so the use of the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" in section 18.06 is entirely consistent with the limited use of the phrase in Article 15 of the Charter. In contrast, other elected officials of the Metropolitan Government are elected in \"general elections\" held in different years.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Charter, section 14.05 (General Sessions Court Judges elected in August of every eighth even-numbered year, beginning in 1974); section 14.10 (Public Defender elected in August of every fourth even-numbered year, beginning in 1966). These other sections of the Charter governing the election of other officers of the Metropolitan Government do not use the phrase \"general metropolitan election.\" Rather, they refer simply to a \"general election.\" The same is true with respect to the filling of vacancies in these other offices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 14.10, 14.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on our analysis of the language, we conclude that the phrase \"general metropolitan election\" as used in section 15.03 of the Charter is not ambiguous. As used in this section of the Charter, \"general metropolitan election\" means and is limited to the particular general election at which the Mayor, Vice Mayor, Councilmen-at-Large, and District Councilmen are elected in August of each fourth odd-numbered year, beginning in 1971, as called for in section 15.01 of the Charter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The next \"general metropolitan election\" is the August 2019 election. Because the date of that election is more than twelve months from the date of the mayoral vacancy, section 15.03 of the Charter requires that a special election be set in accordance with Tennessee Code Annotated section 2-14-102. Under the facts of this case, the interplay between this statute and section 15.03 of the Charter does not authorize the Commission to set the election to fill the mayoral vacancy on the date of the August 2, 2018 general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although we have concluded that the relevant Charter language is not ambiguous, we do note that our construction of the language of section 15.03 of the Charter is consistent with the legislative history of this section.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current version of section 15.03 is the result of a 2007 resolution of the Metropolitan Council, approving the amendment of the section and placing it on the ballot for the approval of the voters pursuant to section 19.01 of the Charter. Section 19.01 of the Charter requires that the ballot \"set forth a brief description of the amendment worded so as to convey the meaning of said amendment, said description to be set forth in the original amendatory resolution.\" The 2007 amendatory resolution and the ballot contained the following summary of the amendment to section 15.03: \"This amendment would require that a special election be held to fill a vacancy in the office of mayor and a vacancy in the office of district councilmember whenever more than twelve (12) months remain in the unexpired term.\" Metropolitan Council Resolution No. RS2007-1846 (Approved June 5, 2007); August 2, 2007 ballot. This Court has noted that the sufficiency of this type of ballot summary is to be judged by whether it gives a voter sufficient information to advise him of the question; that is, does it \"convey[ ] a reasonable certainty of meaning so that a voter could intelligently cast a vote for or against the proposal with full knowledge of the consequence of his vote.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v.

The Commission, in its motion to dismiss in the trial court, asserted that \"[t]his summary was approved by the Metro Council and therefore the Council must have considered the summary a fair representation of the Charter Amendment.\" As we read the summary contained in the amendatory resolution and on the ballot, amended section 15.03 keys the requirement for a special election to fill a vacancy in the Office of Mayor to the length of the term of office remaining at the time of the vacancy. The term of office runs to the next \"general metropolitan election\" at which the Mayor is elected pursuant to section 15.01 of the Charter. Thus, the requirement of a special election is dependent on the time remaining from the date of the vacancy to the date of the next \"general metropolitan election\" at which the Mayor is elected pursuant to section 15.01, not the time remaining to the date of any other type of municipal general election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Our construction of the language of section 15.03 of the Charter also is consistent with the public policy regarding the nature\n   of elections for the Office of Mayor. As expressed in a 2011 resolution of the Metropolitan Council, it was the intent of the founders of the Metropolitan Government, and remains the intent of the Council, that the Office of Mayor be non-partisan and that the election for this office not be held in conjunction with partisan elections. Metropolitan Council Resolution No. RS2011-1607 (Approved April 21, 2011). As the Council expressed in its resolution, having the election for this office coincide with partisan elections \"would negatively impact the democratic process and destroy the purpose of having a non-partisan elected body.\" The August 2, 2018 election includes a general election for a number of Metropolitan offices, but also includes partisan primary elections for state and federal offices. Despite Metro's and the Commission's assertion to the contrary, we discern no logical basis for distinguishing between a partisan presidential election, as was the specific subject of the 2011 resolution, and any other partisan election. Setting the election to fill the vacancy in the Office of Mayor to coincide with these partisan primaries contravenes this express public policy of non-partisan mayoral elections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Metro and the Commission also contend that we previously decided the issue in this case and reached a contrary conclusion in\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

City of Germantown\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11151123\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/31/234/#p239\">\n     31 S.W.3d 234\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 239 (Tenn. 2000) ;\n    <em>\n     Calaway v. Schucker\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8416740\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/193/509/#p518\">\n     193 S.W.3d 509\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 518 (Tenn. 2005). They, therefore, offer a unique mechanism to effectively accomplish the same result. They suggest that we deem the date of our ruling in this case to be the date on which \"the officer or body charged with calling the [special] election receives notice of the facts requiring the call,\" thereby triggering the statutory time-frame for setting the special election.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%202-14-102\">\n     Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 2-14-102\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . They further suggest that we time the issuance of our ruling to cause the August 2, 2018 date previously set by the Commission to fit within the statutory time-frame for a special election. What Metro and the Commission suggest is tantamount to inviting us to judicially amend the statute. We recognize that consequences of the result reached here today include additional expense to Metro, scheduling issues, and logistical problems in conducting a special election. However, we are unable to consider these consequences in reaching our decision. Our responsibility remains resolute: To interpret the law rather than make the law. As a result, we decline this invitation by Metro and the Commission.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
