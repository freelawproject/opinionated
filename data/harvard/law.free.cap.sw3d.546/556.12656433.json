Both charges resulted from the stabbing death of a twelve-year-old boy in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and disposal of the murder weapon. Cambron confessed to both crimes, was declared indigent, and is represented by the Office of the Louisville Metro Public Defender (OLMPD). He is awaiting trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unbeknownst to the Commonwealth, in a span of thirteen months, the Jefferson Circuit Court entered more than thirty\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders in the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each is marked \"sealed\" and none is listed on the index to the thirty-eight-page appellate record. All but three of the orders direct entities to \"produce, within ten days of this order, certified copies of the complete records relating to the above named [sic] defendant.\" The copied records were to be delivered to the OLMPD's Mitigation Coordinator and no one else. The Commonwealth was never notified by OLMPD or the trial court of any request for, nor entry of, an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Entry of twenty-nine of the orders did not result from the filing of a written motion served upon the Commonwealth with an opportunity to respond. Instead, each resulted from \"[a]n oral motion having been made and the court being sufficiently advised.\" Based on the dates on which the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders were entered, the defense team may have conversed with the trial court at least seven separate times without the Commonwealth's knowledge. Entry of these orders clearly resulted entirely from one-sided oral requests from the defense. We do not know what argument-if any-was made to the trial court to justify entry; nothing was recorded for subsequent review. Nor do we know how-or whether-the trial court analyzed the requests before entering the orders. The orders reflect no rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One of the sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders for production of records was directed to the Louisville Metro Police Department Crimes Against Children Unit (CACU).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rather than complying with the sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order-or challenging the order directly-CACU alerted the Commonwealth to its receipt. Shortly thereafter, the Commonwealth moved to quash the order for production and sought disclosure of the \"nature\" of the more than thirty other \"sealed\"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   documents it discovered while searching CourtNet. The Commonwealth requested disclosure so it could file \"appropriate objections or other necessary motions.\" Cambron's attorneys filed and served a partial response on the Commonwealth and provided more detail in an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   supplemental response which was not served on the prosecution. According to the Commonwealth, the matter was orally argued in chambers but not recorded. Had CACU not alerted the Commonwealth to its receipt of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, this custom-which Cambron's defense team characterizes as \"common practice in Jefferson County and throughout the state\"-would continue unchecked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders entered by the trial court-and the briefs filed in this Court-have been sealed. An Order entered simultaneously with this Opinion unseals the appellate briefs and the recording of the oral argument heard by this Court on December 5, 2017. Said Order further directs the trial court, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Roman Catholic Diocese of Lexington v. Noble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9380327\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/92/724/#p728\">\n    92 S.W.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728 (Ky. 2002), and its progeny, including\n   <em>\n    Courier-Journal, Inc. v. McDonald-Burkman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300648\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/298/846/\">\n    298 S.W.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2009), to analyze each document it previously sealed and to unseal any document which does not comport with the procedure described therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This appeal pertains specifically to an opinion and order entered by the Jefferson Circuit Court on August 3, 2016, denying\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   the Commonwealth's motion to quash an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order for production of records directed to CACU and to disclose the nature of all other sealed documents. The trial court found Cambron's rights-to remain silent and to receive due process-as a defendant in a criminal case outweighed any argument made by the Commonwealth. Moreover, by granting Cambron's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion for production of records the trial court stated it was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   simply expediting the receipt of records to which [Cambron], in good faith, believes he is legally entitled, but that are being denied to him due to circumstances outside of his control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court went on to say-in its experience-records custodians do not always timely respond to requests, but upon receipt of a court order, they comply swiftly. The trial court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   denial of records to which the defendant is legally entitled offends the defendant's due process rights. To be forced to give the Commonwealth notice that such records are being sought, however, would run afoul of a defendant's rights to remain silent and develop a confidential and privileged defense strategy. Were the Court not to expedite receipt by way of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, it would feel constrained to repeatedly continue the case as the defendant attempted, often in vain, to secure the records on his own. This would practically grind the courthouse to a halt, and harm the Commonwealth and the community's interest in the swift resolution of criminal matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While finding no fault with CACU-\"[t]his is not meant as an indictment of record custodians, generally, or of LMPD CACU, specifically\"-it is curious the trial court found justification for entering an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order directing CACU to respond to the defense team within ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Recognizing its order might appear to give defense attorneys \"an unfair advantage,\" the trial court equated its grant of Cambron's\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion with the Commonwealth\n   seeking a post-indictment search warrant from a non-presiding judge so as not to reveal the prosecution's strategy. In attempting to justify entry of the sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order, the trial court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [b]oth sides occasionally need the imprimatur of the courts to accomplish the discovery they need to acquire in the interest of justice. To suggest that orders such as the one in question somehow but [sic] the Commonwealth at a disadvantage ignores the significant advantages it has in investigative resources,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commonwealth appealed. After thorough review, we reverse and remand for action consistent with this Opinion and a separate Order entered simultaneously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, interpretation of constitutional provisions, statutes, court rules and procedures requires\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review without deference to the trial court's view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

App. 2002) ). More particularly, whether the Commonwealth's motion to quash was properly denied turns on whether the trial court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301130\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/825/#p828\">\n    295 S.W.3d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 828-29 (Ky. 2009). Under either standard, the trial court's opinion and order fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin with an explanation of terms. An \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication\" is defined as \"[a] generally prohibited communication between counsel and the court when opposing counsel is not present.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 597 (7th ed.). When used as an adjective, the phrase \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   \" is defined as being \"[d]one or made at the instance and for the benefit of one party only, and without notice to, or argument by, any person adversely interested[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301130\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/825/#p828\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court saw its role in this case as simply helping a criminal defendant procure records he had been denied. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At its heart, this case is not about whether Cambron has been denied records he is constitutionally entitled to receive. It cannot be, for there has been no showing he has been denied anything, despite the trial court writing, \"records ... are being denied to [Cambron] due to circumstances outside of his control.\" Just as there has been no showing of a denial of records, there has been no showing of entitlement to such records, nor that Cambron may acquire them using an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order secretly entered by the trial court. Moreover, there has been no showing of a denial of due process. The trial court has based its decision on an unsupported premise and abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Quite simply, this case is about the proper way to seek records. Kentucky courts have adopted procedures governing acquisition of records. A few long-standing options are: requests under Kentucky's Open Records Act, KRS \u00a7 61.870\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; motions seeking orders pursuant to CR 4 7.02(1); issuance of a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   pursuant to RCr 7.02(3) ; and, general discovery and inspection as outlined in RCr 7.24. Additionally, when a criminal defendant desires a trial court's help in accelerating the process of acquiring records, he may request a court order pursuant to RCr 8.14 which directs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [a]n application to the court for an order shall be by motion which shall be in\n   writing unless made during a hearing or trial, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   These five long-standing and well-established options have worked well in a myriad of cases-both civil and criminal. They ensure all parties are aware of movement in the case and create a level playing field. When these options are ignored, justice is skewed and fairness eliminated. Based on the record and defense counsel's responses during oral argument, Cambron has pursued none of these routine avenues. He suggests his only option for acquiring his own records without revealing his potential defense to the prosecution is seeking multiple\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders. Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rather than using any one of several recognized rules, Cambron's defense team attempted to create a new procedure over which it unilaterally exercised complete control to the exclusion of the Commonwealth and in which the trial court appears to have been manipulated. Of perhaps even greater concern to us is Cambron's description of this tactic as \"common practice in Jefferson County and throughout the state.\" When pressed at oral argument, Cambron could not substantiate this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While this is a criminal case, \"unless otherwise provided by law, rules of procedure applying to civil cases apply as well to criminal cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Gholson v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2869896\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/308/82/#p86\">\n    308 Ky. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=212%20S.W.2d%20537\">\n    212 S.W.2d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539 (1948). RCr 13.02 authorizes local courts to regulate local practice by adopting their own rules, but only \"in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.\" No rule of criminal procedure applicable in Kentucky authorizes a party to use a trial court's power to procure discovery without serving notice of those discovery efforts on opposing counsel. In fact, just the opposite is true. CR 5.01 requires notice of service to each opposing party and CR 5.02 describes how service may be achieved. CR 5.03 directs in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   proof of the time and manner of such service shall be filed before action is to be taken thereon by the court or the parties. Proof may be by certificate of a member of the bar of the court or by affidavit of the person who served the papers, or by any other proof satisfactory to the court. Such certificate or affidavit shall identify by name the persons so served.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Additionally, CR 7.02(1) directs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [a]n application to the court for an order shall be by motion which, unless made during a hearing or trial, shall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought. The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of the hearing of the motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Entry of nearly thirty\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders in this case violated multiple rules-by both defense counsel and the trial court. The defense team gave no notice of its actions to the Commonwealth; the defense team provided no proof of mandatory notice via certificate or satisfactory alternative; the trial court entered\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders without making proof of service on the Commonwealth; and,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders were entered without written motions being filed specifying grounds therefor and relief sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We are baffled by the trial court's belief that repeated oral requests for\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders, and entry of such without notice to opposing counsel, was justified and entirely appropriate. A basic tenet of the legal profession is\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication between a judge and an attorney in a pending case is disfavored. The danger of giving one side \"private access to the ear of the court\" has been recognized for years.\n   <em>\n    Sanborn v.

SCR 3.130 -3.4(c); SCR 3.130 -4.1. The violation occurred when Megibow issued subpoenas to obtain documentary evidence without an accompanying notice of a deposition, hearing or trial in contravention of CR 45.01. In doling out a public reprimand, our Supreme Court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [t]he use of subpoenas to obtain documentary evidence or tangible things without an accompanying notice of deposition or notice of hearing or trial has been a recurring problem.

As stated in the rule, \"Subpoenas shall not be used for any purpose except to command the attendance of the witness and production of documentary or other tangible evidence at a deposition, hearing or trial.\" It is improper to use subpoenas in a manner contrary to the rule. We addressed a parallel issue in\n   <em>\n    Stengel v.

We amended RCr 5.06 to permit the use of such subpoenas provided the instrument was not misleading.\n   <em>\n    Stengel\n   </em>\n   does not modify or undermine CR 45.01.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Internal footnotes omitted). Under\n   <em>\n    Megibow,\n   </em>\n   Kentucky would not recognize an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   application for a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Fourth, Cambron uses the terms \"order\" and \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order\" interchangeably-as if they are the same. They are not equals and the distinction matters. Simultaneous with the filing of a motion seeking an order, notice is sent to opposing counsel and the matter may be set for a hearing. Upon entry of an order granting the motion, the order is distributed to all counsel and is entered into the record. In contrast, an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   motion is filed without notice to opposing counsel and may be granted in secret, without an opportunity for the opposing party to respond in writing or to be heard orally. The extreme number of\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders entered in this case is a prime example of the important distinction in orders and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders. But for CACU's impromptu revelation to the Commonwealth, the prosecution would likely have never learned of the significant motion practice from which it was entirely excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We pause to comment on CACU's role in this case. Upon receiving an order for records it considered to be out-of-the-ordinary, CACU mentioned the directive to the prosecution-an action for which the trial court chastised CACU because the order was \"sealed.\" However, had CACU simply complied with the directive as expected-rather than alerting the prosecution-the trial court's habit of routinely acceding to cloak-and-dagger OLMPD requests would not have been exposed to the light of day. As recognized by Justice Louis D. Brandeis in a 1913\n   <em>\n    Harper's Weekly\n   </em>\n   article, \"sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After all, defense counsel had-by its deceptive practice-developed a secret ally in the trial court and would not have willingly\n   jeopardized a procedure working in its favor. Similarly, the trial court endorsed and fully cooperated in the covert practice we deem reprehensible. Neither defense counsel nor the trial court would have exposed this clandestine and improper procedure. It is only because CACU-a third party-conscientiously and wisely revealed the action that we are able to explain its impropriety and forbid it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   A nagging question throughout this entire appeal is why Cambron immediately sought sealed\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders rather than mere orders with notice to the prosecution. This is particularly curious because the Commonwealth had just tried Cambron on a charge of child sex abuse. In light of the recently concluded prosecution, the Commonwealth was already aware of Cambron's background. A request for a plain order may not have drawn any objection from the Commonwealth-but if there were reasonable grounds to object, the Commonwealth deserved the opportunity to do its job and argue its position. As the Commonwealth stated at oral argument, it has a dual role-to both seek justice and to protect the citizenry from unreasonable requests and unnecessary expenditure of public money. Without input from the prosecution, the trial court was left to base its decision on only one side of the story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Just as Cambron confuses \"orders\" with \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders,\" he equates entry of an \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order\" with issuance of an \"\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum.\n   </em>\n   \" Citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Barroso,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297213\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/122/554/\">\n    122 S.W.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2003), Cambron suggests the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order under review was the equivalent of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum.\n   </em>\n   Again, we disagree. Records in\n   <em>\n    Barroso\n   </em>\n   were provided to the trial court which conducted an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. The records in this case were ordered to be provided directly to the defense team. The trial court wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [t]he Court has not seen the material and has no need to know what is in there. Frankly, it would seem prudent not to see the material unless and until the defense concludes the material will in fact be something with arguable relevance so as to trigger an obligation to disclose it as part of reciprocal discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In other words, the trial court placed all decision-making authority in defense counsel. The implication being the trial court did not care whether the documents Cambron sought were even relevant. As the Commonwealth notes in its reply brief, Cambron may not have even been entitled to the records since he sought them for pre-trial investigation, not introduction at trial. RCr 7.02(3) is not a discovery or investigatory device.\n   <em>\n    House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301130\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/825/#p828\">\n    295 S.W.3d at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court's position is highly troubling. It is the equivalent of burying one's head in the sand and repeatedly placing all control in the hands of the defense, especially when it would have been so easy for the trial court to utilize\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. A better practice would have been for defense counsel to move for an order-giving notice to the Commonwealth with opportunity to be heard-requiring production of the records with delivery to the trial court. Following\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection by the trial court, the records would then have been made available-in whole or in part-to both parties or, if appropriate in the trial court's view, to only the defense. This approach would have been entirely consistent with all court rules, including Canon 3(B)(7). Another avenue the defense could have taken was issuing a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   , again with delivery to the trial court followed by\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection by the court. These are but two avenues Cambron could have pursued. Suggesting his only option was an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   oral motion for entry of an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order sealed from the Commonwealth's view is pure folly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   To summarize, neither the Fifth, Sixth nor Fourteenth Amendments expressly authorize\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   contact between a defense attorney and a trial court regarding a pending case. The Commonwealth must be advised of all such contact and given the opportunity to participate and to be heard. Thus, the first scenario mentioned in Canon 3(B)(7) is eliminated from our consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Turning our focus to the Canon's second scenario, the trial court appears to have considered neither whether Cambron would gain a procedural or tactical advantage with the court's help, nor whether his request pertained to a substantive matter or an issue on the merits. Moreover, the trial court did nothing to notify the Commonwealth of the substance of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communication or give the prosecution the opportunity to be heard. The trial court violated the Canon in multiple ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   That Jefferson County attorneys are once again seeking to expand use of\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications with a judge-this time to procure production of records-is not surprising.

We have no way of knowing whether he is entitled to the requested material. We simply do not have the details necessary to make such a pronouncement. Based on the record provided to us, it does not appear the trial court had the necessary facts either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The arraignment order included a discovery provision citing JRP\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   803 (titled \"Discovery\") and directing, \"[t]he parties are expected to comply with this rule in all particulars.\" JRP 804(B)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   specifically addresses \"\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte\n   </em>\n   Requests\" under \"Pretrial [sic] Hearings,\" and is based directly on KRS 31.185(2). The arraignment order also specified RCr 5.16, 6.22, 7.24 and 7.26 are \"applicable in this case.\" Thus, normal rules of discovery were available to Cambron and should have been used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Commonwealth filed discovery at least three separate times between\n   November 2014 and February 2015. Because Cambron did not decline discovery, he was to \"produce reciprocal discovery\" within ten days of receiving the Commonwealth's compliance. No discovery provided by the defense team appears in the appellate record. The trial court believed Cambron's \"right\" to not divulge his defense was paramount, apparently ignoring some defenses must be revealed in advance of trial, specifically the desired introduction of expert testimony about mental disease or defect or any other mental condition bearing on the accused's guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

The record fails to show Cambron's attorneys tried less drastic means before seeking\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   orders in secret. For example, it does not appear they sent CACU a request for production of records that was ignored, nor that in the wake of non-compliance they moved to have CACU held in contempt. It does not appear Cambron's attorneys served CACU with a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   under RCr 7.02(3) to which CACU did not respond, nor that in the wake of non-compliance, they sought to have CACU held in contempt of court under RCr 7.02(7). It also does not appear the defense team filed an open records request under KRS 61.872 and 61.878(1)(h). If time were of the essence-as suggested in the trial court's opinion and order-a response is required within three days under the Open Records Act and does not require disclosure to opposing counsel. As noted previously, the unanswered question throughout this appeal is why a simple order for production of records-rather than an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order-was deemed inadequate and by whom? These are all basic questions untouched by the trial court in its opinion and order denying the Commonwealth's motion to quash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The trial court attempted to justify entry of the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order by emphasizing Cambron's right to remain silent. However, the records requested would come from a third party-not from Cambron himself.

However, the trial court failed to recognize any search warrant procured by the Commonwealth-along with its supporting affidavit, and any return on such a warrant-would be filed in the record and open to view.
