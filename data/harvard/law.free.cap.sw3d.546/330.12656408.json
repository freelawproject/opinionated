In his first issue, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection, made at the punishment phase of trial, to the portion of the State's closing argument during which it played a videotape recording titled, \"Lion tries to eat baby PART 1\" (the \"lion-tries-to-eat-baby video\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which contains the following two still frames:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the panel errs in holding that the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's objection, I respectfully dissent from the Court's order denying en banc reconsideration in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 41.2(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The complainant, LaSondra Robertson, testified that she previously worked as a store clerk and cashier at a CVS Pharmacy located in Harris County, Texas. On June 22, 2015, appellant came into the store and looked around for about ten or fifteen minutes. While appellant walked around the store, he behaved like \"any other customer,\" and the complainant was not alarmed or afraid. Appellant, after apparently waiting for \"no one else [to be] around,\" approached the complainant and placed several inexpensive \"food items\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the counter. Again, she was not afraid of appellant nor alarmed by his actions. As the complainant began to scan the items\n   that appellant had placed on the counter, he \"leaned over\" and told her, \"[T]his is a stick up, give me whatever is in the [cash] register, do not try anything, or I will kill you.\" Although appellant had told the complainant that he had a weapon, she did not see one. She then felt nervous and scared, and she gave him \"the money out of the register.\" Appellant picked up the \"food items\" that he had previously placed on the counter and grabbed \"four beers,\" \"a bag of Starburst[s],\" and \"some chips\" before walking out of the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The complainant explained that during the entire time that appellant stood at the counter with her, his hands stayed on the counter within her sight. He did not have a weapon in his hands, did not \"mess[ ] with [the] waistband\" of his pants, and did not place a weapon on the counter. He also did not touch her or cause her to sustain any scratches, bruises, or any bodily injury. The complainant did not know how much money appellant had taken from the cash register, but the only dollar bills in the register were in denominations of twenty dollars or less. She also explained that she did not tell any of the law enforcement officers, who arrived at the scene after the robbery, that appellant had told her he was going to \"kill\" her. The first time that she had ever stated that appellant threatened to kill her was in her trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Houston Police Department (\"HPD\") Officer C. Inocencio testified that following the incident, appellant was found to be in possession of a CVS Pharmacy bag, \"some kind of food products,\" \"cash money,\" \"rolled coins,\" and \"assorted [loose] change.\" The \"food products\" found in appellant's possession had a total value of $17.53. Inocencio explained that the complainant never reported that appellant had threatened to \"kill her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   HPD Officer A. Huckabee testified that when he detained appellant shortly after he had left the CVS Pharmacy, he did not have in his possession a firearm, a knife, or any type of weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And appellant fully cooperated with law enforcement officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At the punishment phase of trial, the trial court admitted evidence of appellant's criminal record, revealing that on August 17, 1993, he was convicted of two separate offenses of robbery\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced to confinement for seven years for each offense, to run concurrently; on September 26, 1994, he was convicted of the offense of theft\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced to confinement for fourteen years; on August 27, 2002, he was convicted of the offense of evading arrest\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced to confinement for ten months; on May 31, 2007, he was convicted of the misdemeanor offense of attempted unauthorized use of a motor vehicle\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced to confinement for eight months; and on January 22, 2013, he was convicted of the offense of forgery\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced to confinement for ten months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During its closing argument at the punishment phase of trial, the State, after playing the lion-tries-to-eat-baby video for the jury, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    [T]hat 30-second clip is exactly what this punishment phase is about\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...

After the complainant scanned the items that appellant had placed on the counter, he \"leaned over\" and told her that he had a weapon and to give him the money in the cash register. The complainant, however, never saw a weapon. And she noted that appellant's hands remained on the counter within her sight the entire time, he did not \"mess[ ] with [the] waistband\" of his pants, and he did not place a weapon on the counter. He did not touch the complainant or cause her to sustain any scratches, bruises, or bodily injury. After the complainant gave appellant the money from the cash register, he picked up the \"food items\" that he had previously placed on the counter and grabbed \"four beers,\" \"a bag of Starburst[s],\" and \"some chips\" before walking out of the store. The complainant did not know how much money appellant had taken from the cash register, but the only dollar bills in the cash register were in denominations of twenty dollars or less. The \"food items\" taken by appellant had a total value of $17.53. When appellant was later detained by law enforcement officers shortly after leaving the CVS Pharmacy, he did not have in his possession a firearm, a knife, or any type of weapon. And he fully cooperated with law enforcement officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A surveillance videotape recording from the date of the offense, admitted into evidence as State's Exhibit 6, shows appellant calmly walking up to the counter at the CVS Pharmacy.

After the complainant scans several items that appellant places on the counter, he calmly leans forward and says something to her. What he says to her cannot be heard on the videotape recording, but he does not make any threatening\n   or violent gestures. And he does not touch the complainant.

Counsel shall be required to confine the argument strictly to the evidence and to the arguments of opposing counsel.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 269(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   None of these authorities provide for presenting extraneous material beyond counsel's rhetorical summation of the evidence. The complained-of conduct was not the argument of counsel at all-it was a video clip played before the jury during the State's closing argument. The introduction of that 35-second video showed: a toddler sitting near a lion confined in a zoo, with the lion repeatedly lunging and pawing at the child from behind the glass. These facts were concededly completely unrelated to the facts of this case. The State used the video to equate the defendant to that of a predatory animal, who, like that animal, should be caged to protect innocent children. Given that the video presented facts outside the record and would never have been admitted into evidence, the trial court erred in allowing its admission during closing argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11178593\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/29/103/#p115\">\n    29 S.W.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The video clip was central to the State's plea for a lengthy confinement as punishment for this recidivist defendant. Its introduction before the jury caused harm. The State used the video to begin its rebuttal: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I know you're thinking, that was weird, what was that about?\n   <em>\n    But that 30-second clip is exactly what this punishment phase is about.\n   </em>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The State later referred to the video a second time: \"Let me talk to you about that video. That lion was cute, and it was laughable, and it was funny because he's behind that piece of glass. That motive of that lion is never changing, never changing. It's [in]nate. Given the opportunity,\n   remove that glass, it's no longer funny, it's a tragedy. That's what's going to happen, that's a tragedy. That's what's going on with this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A brief allusion to something outside the record to make a metaphorical plea for law enforcement is not viscerally the same as introducing facts from outside the record in the form of a video clip like this one; the former is easily categorized as argument by analogy in the minds of jurors, coming, as it does, directly from counsel's summation.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.
