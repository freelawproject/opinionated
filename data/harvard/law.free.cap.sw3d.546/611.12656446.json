Coats pleaded guilty to a class C felony, pursuant to Section 570.030.3, for stealing video games worth at least $500 from Walmart, Inc. (\"Walmart\"). On appeal, Coats argues that, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v. Bazell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), her sentence should have been based on a class A misdemeanor, not a class C felony. Because\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   does not apply retroactively to Coats's plea and sentencing, we affirm the motion court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find no error of law. No jurisprudential purpose would be served by a written opinion. However, the parties have been furnished with a memorandum opinion for their information only, setting forth the facts and reasons for this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
