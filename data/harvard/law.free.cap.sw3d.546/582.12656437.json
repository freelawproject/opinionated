Barden (\"Wife\") appeals from the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County modifying the dissolution decree dissolving her marriage to Theodore M. Barden (\"Husband\"). Wife asserts five points on appeal.

App. E.D. 2016) when it abated Husband's child support obligation for Emma and awarded Husband the dependency tax exemption for Sophie, we reverse those portions of the trial court's judgment and remand those issues with specific instructions as set forth in this opinion. The trial court's judgment as to the modification of Husband's maintenance and child support obligations is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because this is the third time this case has been before this Court, it is necessary we set forth the complete procedural history of the case as it is significant to the disposition of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Husband and Wife have three children, Emma, Sophie, and Stella. Husband and Wife separated in February 2010, and their marriage was dissolved in November 2011. Pursuant to the judgment of dissolution of marriage, Husband was ordered to pay Wife child support in the amount of $1,383 per month for three children, and maintenance in the amount of $1,875 per month plus 35% of any gross commissions or bonuses Husband received through his\n   employment. At the time of dissolution, Husband earned approximately $260,000 per year, including commissions and bonuses, and Wife was unemployed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, Husband was terminated from his job. It took him about six month to find new full-time employment. His new job paid approximately $50,000 annually. As a result of the decrease in his income, Husband filed a motion to modify the dissolution decree. On November 6, 2013, the trial court held a modification hearing, and subsequently entered a modified judgment, which, in relevant part, terminated Husband's obligation to pay maintenance to Wife, reduced his child support obligation to $861 per month, terminated his duty to assist in paying Emma's college expenses, and awarded Wife the right to claim all three children as exemptions for federal and state income tax purposes in 2013 and succeeding years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Wife appealed the modified judgment, arguing the trial court erred in terminating Husband's maintenance obligation, and terminating Husband's duty to assist in paying Emma's college expenses. On appeal, this Court reversed the trial court's judgment as to both issues because the court relied on Wife's post-dissolution conduct, and the nature of the relationship between Husband and Emma.\n   <em>\n    Barden v.

The judgment was affirmed in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Wife filed a motion to reopen evidence. The trial court allowed limited discovery regarding Husband's income. Husband's tax return revealed he earned approximately $150,000 in 2014. Subpoenaed records from Husband's employer also revealed Husband earned nearly $239,000 between November 6, 2013 and August 5, 2015. However, the trial court denied Wife's motion to reopen evidence and entered its amended judgment in September 2015. The trial court found Husband had an annual salary of $50,000 and imputed an annual salary of $24,000 to Wife.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ordered Husband pay Wife maintenance in the amount of $500 per month and child support in the amount of $720 per month. The trial court made the maintenance and child support orders retroactive to March 1, 2013. The trial court also terminated Husband's duty to assist in paying Emma's college expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Wife again appealed, arguing the trial court erred by using stale evidence to determine Husband's maintenance and child support obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court reversed the trial court's modification of Husband's maintenance obligation, and, on remand, specifically instructed the trial court to consider the parties' current financial information when determining the appropriate amount of maintenance to award Wife, in accordance with the remand in\n   <em>\n    Barden I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Barden v.

App. E.D. 2016) (\"\n   <em>\n    Barden II\n   </em>\n   \"). This Court also noted the trial court's calculation of Husband's child support obligation may need to be adjusted upon considering evidence of the parties' current finances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785929\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/492/641/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 644 n.3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following the remand, the trial court entered a pre-trial order allowing discovery with respect to changes in the parties' financial resources since November 2013. Thereafter, Husband filed a Motion to Abate Child Support, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , his child support for Emma should be abated retroactive to August 2014 because Emma failed to provide her college transcripts and class schedules to Husband, and Emma lived with Husband during the summer of 2016 and spent no overnights with Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On November 18, 2016, the trial court held a hearing on this Court's remand as well as Husband's motion to abate. In its judgment, the trial court, in relevant part, reduced Husband's maintenance obligation to $875 per month, retroactive to March 1, 2013, and reduced Husband's child support obligation for Sophie and Stella to $935 per month, effective July 1, 2016. The trial court also abated child support for Emma between September 1, 2014 and May 31, 2016, as well as between September 1, 2012 and February 28, 2013, and ordered Wife to pay Husband $1,000. The trial court further gave Husband the right to claim Sophie as an exemption for federal and state income tax purposes in 2016 and succeeding years. Wife appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Points Relied On\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wife asserts five points on appeal. In Point I, Wife argues the trial court erred in modifying maintenance Husband pays to Wife from $1,875 per month plus 35% of all commissions and bonuses earned to a flat $875 per month, retroactive to March 1, 2013, because said modification violates Section 452.370.1. In Point II, Wife argues the trial court erred in abating child support between September 1, 2012 and February 28, 2013 for Emma, and entering judgment in favor of Husband and against Wife in the amount of $1,000 because said abatement violates Section 452.340.7. In Point III, the trial court erred in abating child support between September 1, 2014 and May 31, 2016 for Emma because said abatement violates Section 452.340.5. In Point IV, Wife argues the trial court erred in departing from the presumed child support amount and setting child support for Sophie and Stella at $935 per month, effective July 1, 2016, because said departure violates Section 452.340 and this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Barden I\n   </em>\n   . In Point V, Wife argues the trial court erred in awarding Husband the dependency tax exemption for Sophie beginning in tax year 2016 because said departure violates Section 452.340.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As with any court-tried case, we review a trial court's judgment modifying a dissolution decree pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

Specifically, Wife argues (1) Husband failed to prove a substantial and continuing change in circumstances because his present income is not significantly lower than his income at the time of the dissolution judgment; (2) Husband presently earns sufficient income to pay the maintenance ordered in the dissolution judgement; (3) Wife cannot meet her reasonable needs with a lesser amount of maintenance; and (4) the trial court cannot force Wife to deplete her share of Husband's 401(k) awarded to her in the dissolution judgment to give Husband a lower maintenance obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 452.370 governs modification of maintenance. Pursuant to Section 452.370.1, in order to modify a maintenance support award, there must be a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms of the current support award unreasonable. The trial court must consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   financial resources of both parties when determining whether a substantial change in circumstances has occurred.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A decrease in income of the spouse paying maintenance constitutes a substantial and continuing change in circumstances where the obligor spouse is\n   unable to meet his own reasonable needs\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   is also unable to pay the original maintenance obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Draper v.

However, in 2012, Husband was terminated from his job, and, in 2013, his annual salary significantly decreased to approximately $50,000. On November 6, 2013, the date of the first modification hearing, Husband's reasonable monthly expenses were $5,279, which exceeded his monthly gross income of $3,878. Although, Husband's monthly gross income increased to $14,433 as of October 2016, his reasonable monthly expenses nearly tripled to $14,055. Notably, the calculation of Husband's reasonable monthly expenses does not include his child support obligation.

Specifically, the trial court took into consideration that Husband's debt increased from $13,130 in 2013 to $20,510 as of October 2016.

We find Wife's arguments unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the hearing, the evidence presented was that Wife was unemployed at the time of dissolution. As of November 6, 2013, Wife earned $728 in monthly gross income, and her reasonable monthly expenses were $7,895. As of November 18, 2016, Wife's gross monthly income increased to $781, and her reasonable monthly expenses decreased to $7,135. In its judgment, the trial court imputed an annual salary of $24,000 to Wife, and subsequently concluded a decrease in maintenance was justified because Wife's monthly income increased and her expenses decreased since dissolution. Specifically, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   If, upon dissolution of the marriage, when Wife had no earnings and greater expenses for herself than on the date of the final evidentiary hearing, she required maintenance of $1,875.00 per month, then, on the date of the evidentiary hearing, if Wife has gross wages of $2,000 per month and reduced expenses, she requires maintenance of $875.00 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On appeal, however, Wife argues $875 per month in maintenance fails to cover the shortfall-approximately $4,300-between her monthly income and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There is a long-standing public policy in Missouri that maintenance is awarded for the sole purpose of \"providing support until the more dependent spouse can achieve a 'reasonable self-sufficiency' in the light of the statutory factors.\"\n   <em>\n    Hammer v.

Rule 88.01 provides that to rebut the presumed child support calculation, the trial court should enter a specific finding on the record that the presumed amount is unjust and inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, the trial court performed its own Form 14 calculation. However, the court rebutted the presumed child support amount as unjust and inappropriate, and ordered Husband to pay child support in the amount of $935 per month for Sophie and Stella based on the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (a) upon conclusion of academic year 2015-2016, Wife told Emma to \"go live with\" Husband, who, as a result, will have full responsibility for support of Emma, including Emma's costs at\n   Southeast Missouri State University during her junior and senior years; (b) since Sophie and Stella have attained age 16, in 2015 and 2016 respectively, Husband has paid the expenses related to ownership and operation of Sophie's and Stella's motor vehicles; (c) Wife has told Sophie and Stella by text message that Wife plans to \"give more custody\" to Husband so that Husband still pays Wife support for Sophie and Stella, but Wife \"can spend it on myself\"; and (d) Wife has told Sophie and Stella that they \"will not be getting one red cent from me moving forward\" and that \"groceries will be slim[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On appeal, Wife argues there was no legal or factual basis for departure from the presumed child support amount. Specifically, Wife argues it is irrelevant that Emma lives with Husband because she was removed from the child support calculation, and Wife's statements to Sophie and Stella were speculative and amounted to hearsay. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Here, the trial court properly considered the factors outlined in Section 452.340.1 when rebutting the Form 14 as unjust and inappropriate. Specifically, the trial court considered the financial resources and needs of Husband when it considered Husband's new responsibility to fully support Emma, and his expenses related to the ownership, operation, and maintenance of Sophie and Stella's vehicles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 452.340.1(2). In considering Wife's text messages to the children about giving Husband more custody, spending the child support payments on herself, and that groceries would be slim, the trial court took into account the amount of time the children spend with each parent and the reasonable expenses associated with the custody or visitation arrangements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 452.340.1(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, even if the factors considered by the trial court do not fall under Section 452.340.1, as noted above, there is no mandatory worksheet or formula when determining whether a Form 14 amount is unjust and inappropriate, and the court may consider non-Form 14 factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woolridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10006650\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/915/372/#p379\">\n    915 S.W.2d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Husband also purchased vehicles for Sophie and Stella, and pays expenses for the vehicles, including taxes, maintenance, insurance, gas, and licenses. Wife also admitted sending the text messages to Sophie and Stella, regarding custody and support. The trial court was free to accept or reject all, part or none of the testimony of the witnesses, and we defer to its credibility determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blair v.

In Point III, Wife argues the trial court erred in abating child support between September 1, 2014 and May 31, 2016 for Emma. In Point IV, Wife argues the trial court erred in awarding Husband the dependency tax exemption for Sophie beginning in tax year 2016.

Therefore, the portions of the trial court's third amended judgment regarding abatement and dependency tax exemption were contrary to our directive in\n   <em>\n    Barden II\n   </em>\n   , and exceeded the authority of the trial court on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's findings abating child support for Emma between September 1, 2012 and February 28, 2013, and entering judgment in favor of Husband and against Wife in the amount of $1,000; abating child support for Emma between September 11, 2014 and May 31, 2016; and awarding Husband the dependency tax exemption for Sophie, as they exceeded the scope of our remand in\n   <em>\n    Barden II\n   </em>\n   .
