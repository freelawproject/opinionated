Lehrmann, Justice\n   This case comes to us on a county's petition to vacate an arbitrator's award in a dispute governed by a collective bargaining agreement between the county and its deputy constables. The primary issue presented involves the validity of the underlying agreement; specifically, we are asked whether deputy constables are \"police officers\" entitled to enter into collective bargaining agreements with their public employers under Local Government Code chapter 174. If they are, we are also asked whether the arbitrator in this case nevertheless exceeded his authority in (1) concluding the county violated the agreement by eliminating several deputy-constable positions without regard to seniority, and (2) ordering the county to reinstate the deputies in order of seniority. The court of appeals held that the deputy constables are \"police officers\" and that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority. We agree and affirm the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The case centers on a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between Jefferson County, Texas, and the Jefferson County Constables Association, which the County has recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent for the County's deputy constables. The CBA at issue, effective October 1, 2007, through September 30, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   established standards governing the deputy constables' wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. Pertinent here, Article 8 of the CBA vests exclusively with the County \"the right to lay off for lack of work or funds\" and \"the right to abolish positions,\" but Article 13 provides that \"[s]eniority shall be the sole factor in layoff and recall, with layoff being accomplished beginning with the least senior deputy, and recall beginning with the most senior deputy in the highest job classification.\" The CBA contained a multi-step procedure to resolve disputes involving alleged violations of the agreement or its proper interpretation, culminating in submission of the dispute to final, binding arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The County has six constable precincts, each with an elected constable and a number of deputy constables.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2010, the County implemented budget cuts and eliminated eight deputy-constable positions across the precincts. The Constables Association alleged that this action violated the CBA's seniority restriction on layoffs. Because the parties were unable to resolve the dispute during the grievance process, the Constables Association submitted the dispute to arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitrator issued written findings, including that the County \"violated the CBA by laying off or failing to budget for specific deputy constables without regard to seniority.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The arbitrator awarded the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The parties shall met [sic] and negotiate to agree on the seniority ranking of the deputy constables to determine which constables should be reinstated and in what order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The County shall reinstate those deputy constables laid off and pay the back wages, less the income made by the deputy from other employment, in the order of their seniority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction for thirty (30) days to resolve any dispute over the payment of back wages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The County filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in district court, alleging four grounds for vacatur: (1) the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to render an award that intruded on \"the sovereign governmental responsibilities of the Jefferson County Commissioners Court\"; (2) the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by \"essentially controlling the budgetary process reserved by law in this instance to the county government\"; (3) the award was not supported by substantial evidence; and (4) the \"arbitrator violated the law governing the interpretation of contracts\" by rendering meaningless the CBA provision reserving to the County the right to abolish positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both parties moved for summary judgment. The Constables Association argued that the arbitrator acted well within his authority in interpreting and applying the CBA. The County argued that the arbitrator (1) superseded the commissioners court's responsibility to determine the need for deputy-constable positions and set the County's budget, and (2) ignored the contractual rights reserved to the County to lay off employees or abolish positions. The trial court granted the County's motion and rendered final judgment in its favor. The Constables Association appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the parties completed principal briefing in the court of appeals, the County filed a supplemental brief arguing for the first time that the CBA was invalid, depriving the arbitrator of jurisdiction to resolve any dispute arising under it. Specifically, the County argued that the CBA's validity depends on the applicability of Texas Local Government Code chapter 174, also known as the Fire and Police Employee Relations Act (hereinafter, Collective Bargaining Act or Act), which authorizes fire fighters and police officers to collectively bargain with their public employers. Although the parties had agreed in the CBA to their \"mutual obligation to bargain in good faith\" under the Act, the County took the position in its supplemental briefing that deputy constables are not \"police officers\" as the Act defines the term; that the CBA is void and unenforceable as a result; and that the deputy constables (and the Constables Association) therefore \"lack[ ] standing under Chapter 174.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment for the Constables Association.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n    512 S.W.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi-Edinburg 2016). The court first addressed the newly raised issue of the deputy constables' status as police officers, noting that the issue's resolution implicated the Association's standing to enforce the CBA, which in turn implicated the courts' subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n    at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Concluding that the deputy constables qualified as police officers under the Collective Bargaining Act, the court went on to hold that (1) the arbitrator's award did not usurp the County's statutory authority concerning the appointment of deputy constables and (2) the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in awarding reinstatement of more senior deputies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n    at 440, 443-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the issue arose under much different circumstances than the case at hand. In\n    <em>\n     Wolff\n    </em>\n    , no agreement existed between the deputy constables and\n    Bexar County; rather, the deputy constables had requested, to no avail, that the County engage in the collective bargaining process with them and sought a declaratory judgment that the County violated the Act by failing to do so.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909161\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/362/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909161\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/362/\">\n     at 364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because the Act allows only fire fighters and police officers to engage in collective bargaining with their public employers, it follows that only fire fighters and police officers have standing to complain when an employer refuses to do so in violation of the Act. They are the ones whose interest in the conflict is \"distinct from that of the general public\" and who suffer a \"particular injury\" caused by the employer's conduct.\n    <em>\n     Sneed\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6857076\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/465/169/#p179\">\n     465 S.W.3d at 180\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    By contrast, this case does not stem from an alleged violation of the Collective Bargaining Act. The County and the Constables Association have already engaged in the collective bargaining process, reached an agreement, and participated in arbitration proceedings regarding a dispute over whether the County violated that agreement. Thus, the Association is seeking to enforce a contract, not the Act. In turn, although the CBA's validity may hinge on the Act's applicability, the Association's standing does not.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Accordingly, the CBA's validity does not affect the courts' subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, and the County therefore risked waiving illegality as a defense by failing to raise it as a basis to vacate the arbitration award in either the trial court or its principal briefing in the court of appeals. However, we note that both parties have fully briefed and argued the merits of the issue here. Further, the Constables Association does not ask us to resolve the question on waiver grounds and concedes that its general collective bargaining rights depend on the deputy constables' status as police officers under the Act. For these reasons, and because the issue is of continuing importance to our jurisprudence, we will address it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Deputy Constables Are \"Police Officers\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Whether the deputy constables are police officers entitled to collectively bargain under the Act is a matter of statutory interpretation. In construing the Act, as with any statute, our primary objective is to give effect to the Legislature's intent.\n    <em>\n     Molinet v.

Applying these principles, we hold that deputy constables are police officers under the Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The Act implements two express policies. First, it gives fire fighters and police officers \"the right to organize for collective bargaining\" as \"a fair and practical method for determining compensation and other conditions of employment.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092019\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/228/#p231\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 174.002(b). Second, despite granting this right, the Act stops short of allowing these employees to engage in strikes and other work stoppages,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    instead providing \"reasonable alternatives\" like arbitration and judicial enforcement of the Act's requirements.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092019\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/228/#p231\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 174.002(c), (d).

The parties' principal dispute is whether the deputy constables serve in \"the police department of a political subdivision.\" The Act does not define the term \"police department,\" but its ordinary meaning is \"a governmental department concerned with the administration of the police force.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD INT'L DICTIONARY 1754 (2002). In turn, a \"police force\" is \"a professional body of trained officers ... entrusted by a government with maintenance of public peace and order, enforcement of laws, and prevention and detection of crime.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7092019\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/403/228/#p231\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The County argues that the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department is \"the police department\" of Jefferson County and that, because the County's deputy constables do not work in the sheriff's department, they are not police officers under the Act. The County notes that the sheriff's department responds to 9-1-1 calls and manages the county jail, performing the kind of \"essential and emergency\" services the Act contemplates. TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 174.002(d). The County further maintains that, while deputy constables \"have some law enforcement power,\" their principal duty is to serve process. The Constables Association responds that the County views the term \"the police department\" too restrictively and that it includes both the sheriff's department and the constable's office. The Association argues that deputy constables \"perform essential and at times emergency public services\" and that preventing work stoppages by those employees is thus critical to public health, safety, and welfare.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The courts of appeals are divided on the issue. In\n    <em>\n     Wolff\n    </em>\n    , the Fourth Court of Appeals summarily concluded that deputy constables are not police officers under the Act \"because they do not serve in the 'police department' of the county or the Sheriff's Office.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909161\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/362/\">\n     441 S.W.3d at 366\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

For example, the Government Code provides for the establishment of a grant program to assist \"law enforcement agencies\"-defined as the police department of a municipality, the county sheriff's office, or a county constable's office-in testing evidence collected in relation to sexual assaults. TEX. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 772.00715(a)(4), (b). Further, the Legislature has established as a state agency the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, which, among other things, establishes minimum standards applicable to peace-officer licensing. TEX. OCC. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 1701.051(a), .151(2). The commission consists of nine appointed members, three of whom \"are sheriffs, constables, or chiefs of police.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373511\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/512/434/#p436\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1701.051(a)(1).

In other words, there is no argument or indication that deputy constables, or the departments they serve, lack the authority to provide the type of law-enforcement functions encompassed by the general definition of \"police department\" and the Collective Bargaining Act's policy of protecting public health and safety. Indeed, those courts of appeals that have concluded deputy constables are not \"police officers\" nevertheless recognize that they \"serve in a law enforcement capacity and render a valuable service to the community, risking their own safety.\"\n    <em>\n     Wolff\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6909161\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/441/362/\">\n     441 S.W.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    366 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Stines\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386024\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/523/691/#p718\">\n     523 S.W.3d at 718\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (acknowledging that \"many constable departments ... provide valuable law enforcement services the same as those of sheriff departments\"). Rather, the County argues (1) the Act's reference to \"the\" police department connotes a singular entity, and that entity is the sheriff's department in Jefferson County,\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    and (2) as a factual matter, the deputy constables in Jefferson County do not perform the kind of law-enforcement services the Act contemplates. We address these contentions in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    First, we disagree with the County's assertion that the Collective Bargaining Act's reference to \"\n    <em>\n     the\n    </em>\n    police department of a political subdivision\" means there can be only one such department. (Emphasis added). The word \"the\" can certainly be used as a definite article, but it is not necessarily so limiting. As the Constables Association argues, it may also be used to indicate that a noun \"is to be understood generically.\" WEBSTER'S THIRD INT'L DICTIONARY 2369 (2002). For example, as the amicus brief points out, the Act's statement that \"\n    <em>\n     [t]he\n    </em>\n    policy of this state is that fire fighters and police officers ... should have the right to organize for collective bargaining\" does not mean that the state has no other policies. (Emphasis added). Particularly given the Legislature's direction to construe the Act liberally, we decline to interpret the phrase \"the police department of a political subdivision\" so narrowly.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The County contends that, without this limitation, the defined term \"police officer\" is written out of the statute and replaced with the broader term \"peace officer.\" According to the County, the result is that all thirty-five categories of peace officers enumerated in Code of Criminal Procedure article 2.12 are permitted to collectively bargain with their public employers. While only the constable category is before us, we note that the County's conclusion appears overstated. For example, peace officers employed by state agencies, such as \"law enforcement agents of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission\" and rangers commissioned by the Public Safety Commission, do not serve in any department \"of a political subdivision,\" as the State itself is not a political subdivision.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    TEX.

The conclusion that deputy constables serve in the police department of a political subdivision simply does not stretch the Collective Bargaining Act to apply to all persons statutorily designated as peace officers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Next, the County insists that, whatever authority they might otherwise have, as a factual matter deputy constables in Jefferson County primarily serve process and therefore do not \"regularly serve[ ] in a professional law enforcement capacity\" as the Act requires. TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 174.003(3). By contrast, the County argues, the sheriff's department performs the types of \"emergency\" services that the Act contemplates.

EDUC. CODE \u00a7 53.46. The county appraisal district argued that the property at issue was not exempt from taxation because it was not in fact \"held for educational purposes only\" or \"devoted exclusively to the use and benefit of the students, faculty, and staff members of an accredited institution of higher education.\"\n    <em>\n     Tex.

TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 174.002(d). The Act then unequivocally states these employees \"are entitled to organize and bargain collectively with their public employer.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869305\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/460/137/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 174.023. Section 174.002 simply does not purport to modify the definition of police officer in section 174.003.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    This conclusion makes practical as well as interpretive sense. If the employees at issue otherwise qualify as police officers under the Act's express definition, courts need not engage in a fact-driven and open-ended analysis regarding whether the services specific employees provide are essential or emergent enough-or whether a strike by that group is a severe enough threat to public health and safety-to warrant the Act's application. The Legislature has categorically determined that they are.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In turn, the County's insistence that the deputy constables in Jefferson County perform some duties that arguably do not qualify as law enforcement or crime detection or prevention does not alter our conclusion. To some extent, deputy constables' daily responsibilities vary by county and even by precinct. But their statutory duties are identical, and we do not read the Collective Bargaining Act to apply to some deputy constables as \"police officers\" but not others. And in any event, the record-which is sparse in light of the fact that the issue was first raised on appeal-does not support the County's contention. According to the arbitrator's summary of the testimony, one county commissioner testified that, other than serving papers and acting as justice-court bailiffs, deputy constables are \"not required to do law enforcement functions, but some do law enforcement tasks.\" The county judge testified that \"deputy constables are authorized to perform some law enforcement duties, which he considered to be required in emergency situations, like observing an armed robbery.\" The County's annual budget for fiscal year 2010-2011, which is not in the trial court's record but which the County submitted to the Court as an appendix to its brief on the merits,\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    describes the county's constables as \"constitutionally\n    authorized peace officers elected by precinct. While they may perform patrol functions and make criminal investigations, the main duty of most Constables is to serve as executive officer of the Justice of the Peace Courts. Constables serve subpoenas and other papers.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    While the evidence is not entirely consistent, even the County's own documents and witnesses recognize that deputy constables perform law-enforcement duties separate and apart from serving process and acting as justice-court bailiffs. This corresponds to their statutory authority, which, while not identical to that of deputy sheriffs, certainly overlaps with it. And it supports the conclusion that the constable's office is a department concerned with the administration of \"a body of trained officers entrusted by a government with maintenance of public peace and order, enforcement of laws, and prevention and detection of crime.\"\n    <em>\n     Police department\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Police force\n    </em>\n    , WEBSTER'S THIRD INT'L DICTIONARY 1754 (2002).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In sum, we hold that deputy constables \"regularly serve[ ] in a professional law enforcement capacity in the police department of a political subdivision.\" TEX. LOC. GOV'T CODE \u00a7 174.003(3). Accordingly, deputy constables are \"police officers\" under the Collective Bargaining Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    We therefore hold that the CBA between the County and the Constables Association is valid and enforceable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Arbitrator's Award\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The County next challenges the arbitrator's authority to issue an award requiring the County to reinstate and award back pay to the terminated deputy constables in order of seniority.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    The award stemmed from the arbitrator's findings that the \"County violated the CBA by laying off or failing to budget for specific deputy constables without regard to seniority,\" which was to be \"determined by the length of service by an officer countywide.\" As noted, the CBA vested the County with \"the right to lay off for lack of work or funds\" and \"the right to abolish positions,\" but also provided that \"[s]eniority shall be the sole factor in layoff and recall.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The County argues that the county commissioners court \"eliminated\" the deputy positions (along with their respective salaries) as part of its delegated legislative duty to create the county budget, and that the arbitrator effectively usurped that duty by ordering the deputies \"reinstated\" to a position that no longer exists. The County distinguishes between layoffs, which are governed by seniority under the CBA, and \"the abolishing of positions,\" which the County has unfettered authority to do. The Constables Association responds that the County's mere disagreement with the arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA-an issue that was properly submitted to the arbitrator-does not provide grounds to vacate the award.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    We agree with the Association. The arbitrator did not quibble with the County's right to abolish as many deputy positions as it deemed necessary or prudent, nor did he order the County to create or fund positions that no longer existed. He merely determined that, upon eliminating funding for eight deputy-constable positions, the County was required under the CBA to consider the deputies' countywide seniority in determining which eight deputies were to be terminated. The arbitrator concluded\n    that the County's failure to do so violated the CBA, and he ordered the County to rectify that violation by reinstating the deputies pursuant to their seniority. The arbitrator's analysis of the interplay between the CBA's provisions regarding layoffs and abolishing positions may or may not be correct, but it is precisely within the scope of his contractual authority to resolve \"[a]ll disputes concerning the proper interpretation and application of\" the CBA.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     City of Pasadena v.

But the policy decision to grant them authority to engage in collective bargaining belongs to the Legislature, not this Court. The Legislature has granted that authority only to \"fire fighters\" and \"police officers.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    Under Texas law, deputy constables are not \"police officers\" any more than police officers are deputy constables. Essentially for the reasons the Beaumont and San Antonio Courts of Appeals have explained,\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    I do not agree with the Court's holding that deputy constables are \"police officers\" under the Collective Bargaining Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Texas law consistently recognizes that deputy constables serve their communities as \"peace\" officers, but it never equates them with \"police\" officers and instead consistently refers to the two separately.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Texas statutes refer to a variety of \"police departments,\" including municipal police departments,\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    school district police departments,\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    campus police departments,\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    and even-in certain counties-a sheriff's \"county police force,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    but no Texas statute ever refers to a constable's office as a \"police department\" or \"police force.\" To the contrary, although Texas statutes consistently include police departments, sheriffs' offices, and constables' offices within the broader category of \"law enforcement agencies,\" they unfailingly distinguish between the three types of entities.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Deputy constables may \"regularly serve[ ] in a professional law enforcement capacity,\" but they provide that service as employees of the constable's office, not as employees of \"\n    <em>\n     the police department\n    </em>\n    of a political subdivision.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nothing in the Collective Bargaining Act even\n    <em>\n     suggests\n    </em>\n    that it defines or uses the terms \"police officer\" and \"police department\" differently than the other Texas statutes that consistently use those terms. Because the Collective Bargaining Act applies only to fire fighters and police officers, it does not apply to deputy constables. If the Legislature had intended to permit deputy constables-or even all peace officers-to engage in collective bargaining, it could, should, and would have said so.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Because the Court holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-82\">\n     The County, not the Constables Association, is the party that initiated this suit by filing a petition to vacate the arbitration award.
