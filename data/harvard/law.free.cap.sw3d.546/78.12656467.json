The trial court denied the third-party's motion to intervene and also denied its motion to modify the order sealing the record. For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's denial of the motion to intervene, vacate its denial of the motion to modify the protective order sealing the record, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS &amp; PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The original parties involved in this proceeding were Mr. and Mrs. Laua Bearden (\"the Beardens\") and Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Kocher (\"the Kochers\") and their minor son. On October 23, 2014, the Kochers' thirteen-year-old son was riding his bicycle to school when he was struck by a truck driven by Mr. Bearden. On July 20, 2015, the Kochers and Beardens filed a \"Joint Petition for Approval of Minor's Settlement\" in the circuit court of Shelby County. That same day, the circuit court entered an \"Agreed Order Sealing File and Barring Public Access to Hearings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agreed order stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This case is before the Court upon the joint requests of the parties to seal the judicial record of this case from public inspection and to bar public access to the courtroom while the Court hears any matters in this case[.] Having duly considered the contemporaneous Joint Petition for Approval of Minor's Settlement and the statements of counsel for the parties, the Court finds the requests well-taken due to the sensitive nature of the evidence and factual issues before the Court and the privacy interests of the instant minor [ ] and his family[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The agreed order required the court clerk to seal the judicial record and withhold it from public access, \"barring all but the parties and the Guardian ad Litem from accessing the record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two months later, on September 23, 2015, the Kochers filed a separate lawsuit in circuit court against Durham School Services, LP (\"Durham\"), asserting claims individually and as parents, guardians, and next friends of their son. Durham provided school bus services to students at the child's middle school. The Kochers alleged that the bus to which their son was assigned\n   was negligently operated on the morning of the accident and left their son's bus stop before the designated time. According to the Kochers, the child returned home and told his father that he was going to ride his bicycle to school, and he was struck by a truck before he reached the school. The Kochers' complaint alleged that Durham's actions proximately caused their child's injuries and damages. The complaint further alleged that \"there are no other persons or entities, other than [Durham], who are responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the injuries and damages to Plaintiffs herein.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Durham removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. There, Durham filed an answer asserting that the conduct of other persons, including the driver of the vehicle that struck the child, proximately caused the child's injuries. Durham asserted the comparative fault of the driver, Mr. Bearden. Discovery ensued. Durham propounded interrogatories asking the Kochers to identify all documents they sent to or received from the driver of the vehicle (or his insurer). They also asked whether the Kochers had entered into any compromise or settlement with the driver. The Kochers refused to answer these interrogatories, claiming that such information was subject to a court order prohibiting disclosure. Durham also served the Kochers with requests for production of documents, seeking any documents exchanged with the driver, complaints they filed against him, or settlement agreements with him, but the Kochers again claimed that such information was subject to a court order prohibiting disclosure. Durham also asked for any documents filed in the circuit court case between the Kochers and the Beardens, but the Kochers again refused, stating that the record was \"filed under seal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Durham subsequently filed a motion to compel discovery. The motion was heard by Chief United States Magistrate Judge Diane Vescovo. Magistrate Judge Vescovo concluded that the documents and information sought by Durham's interrogatories and requests for production of documents were relevant under Rule 26(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, at the time of the hearing, the agreed order sealing the record in the Kocher-Bearden case remained sealed along with the rest of the record, so the extent of its protection was not clear to Magistrate Judge Vescovo or to Durham. As a result, Magistrate Judge Vescovo directed Durham\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   to first file a motion with the Shelby County Circuit Court in Docket No. CT-003028-15 to unseal the case to obtain the information and documents sought in [the discovery requests] and to determine if the order sealing Docket No. CT-003028-15 precludes the plaintiffs from responding to discovery requests propounded in this case, particularly as to documents that are not on file with the Shelby County Circuit Court, such as correspondence predating the filing of the Circuit Court case, sworn statements taken in conjunction with the matter giving rise to the Circuit Court case, or settlement agreements, if any, or to discussing the facts of the case in response to discovery requests or depositions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The motion to compel discovery was denied without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 25, 2016, Durham filed a motion to intervene in the Kocher-Bearden case in Shelby County circuit court. Durham sought permissive intervention pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 24.02\"in order to gain access to certain sealed documents filed in this matter.\" Specifically, Durham sought intervention\n   \"for the limited purpose of seeking to unseal these proceedings to obtain information and documents that Judge Vescovo has found are relevant to the lawsuit filed by Plaintiffs against Durham.\" Durham asserted that common questions of fact and law existed and that its intervention would not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. Durham referenced \"the general public right of access to courts and their records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Durham attached a proposed \"Intervenor's Complaint,\" indicating that it would seek an order\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   unsealing the record\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   modifying the agreed order to allow Durham to access the information and documents filed in the case solely for purposes of the lawsuit filed against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Durham emphasized that it did not intend for the information to be made available to the general public and suggested that the \"the seal can just be limited to the original parties to this lawsuit and Durham.\" Durham also suggested that a protective order could be entered in federal court to prevent exposure of the protected information. Durham also attached to its motion to intervene the complaint filed by the Kochers against Durham, the answer filed by Durham asserting comparative fault, the Kochers' discovery responses, and Judge Vescovo's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Kochers and the Beardens opposed Durham's attempt to intervene and its attempt to modify the agreed order sealing the record. According to the response filed by the Beardens, the original matter had already been concluded by a settlement that was approved by the court and completed by the Kochers, Beardens, and the Beardens' insurance carrier. The Beardens argued that permissive intervention was prohibited because no question remained for adjudication in the Kocher-Bearden case. They claimed that Durham was attempting to inject new claims or issues in the case. The Beardens acknowledged the pending federal case involving Durham's allegedly negligent operation of the school bus but insisted that no common legal or factual question existed for resolution. The Beardens suggested that the Kocher-Bearden case involved \"a different theory of liability, Mr. Bearden's negligent driving.\" They also argued that permitting Durham to intervene would substantially prejudice the original parties, their insurer, and the guardian ad litem, while only furthering Durham's private interest in discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The circuit court held a hearing on September 14, 2016, in order to consider Durham's motion to intervene and its motion to modify the agreed order sealing the case. The circuit court denied both motions, stating, \"Durham has not met its burden to establish the common legal or factual questions necessary to sustain permissive intervention under T.R.C.P. 24.02 or its burden to justify modification of the Court's prior protective order of July 20, 2015.\" However, for the benefit of the district court, the circuit court judge read into the transcript the provisions of the agreed order sealing the record. Durham timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While this appeal was pending, the discovery disputes continued in district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Durham filed a renewed motion to compel discovery, which a magistrate judge granted in part, requiring the Kochers\n   to reveal the monetary settlement amount that resolved their claim against the Beardens. The magistrate judge concluded that the agreed order from circuit court \"only sealed from the public the following documents: the joint petition, the order approving the joint petition, the guardian ad litem's report, and the agreed order sealing the file.\" The magistrate judge's ruling was reviewed and upheld by the district court judge. He concluded that \"disclosure of the settlement amount does not conflict with the Order Sealing the Case entered ... in the related Circuit Court matter\" as it \"made no reference to divulging the contents of the settlement agreement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At oral argument before this Court, Durham's attorney explained that the issues raised in this appeal are not moot because Durham still seeks access to the documents that were filed in the circuit court case and remain under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Durham presents the following issues for review on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   1. Whether the trial court erred in finding that Durham was not entitled to permissive intervention pursuant to Rule 24.02 when Durham sought to modify the order sealing the case; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2. Whether the trial court erred in denying Durham's motion to modify the agreed order sealing the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the following reasons, we reverse the trial court's denial of the motion to intervene, vacate its denial of the motion to modify the order sealing the record, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion to Intervene\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 24.02 governs permissive intervention. Durham sought to intervene pursuant to Rule 24.02(2), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Upon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: ... (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising discretion the court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tenn. R. Civ. P. 24.02(2). Simply put, \"[i]f the would-be intervenor's claim or defense contains a question of law or fact that is also raised by the main action then the requirement of the rule has been satisfied and the trial court is afforded discretion to permit intervention.\"\n   <em>\n    Ballard v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   , a newspaper and group of journalists filed a motion to intervene in a case for the purpose of requesting that the trial court rescind a protective order so that all proceedings and records would be open to the press and the public.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court allowed them to intervene and modified the protective order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The case eventually made its way to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The court first addressed the issue of permissive intervention. The court concluded that \"third parties, including media entities, should be allowed to intervene to seek modification of protective orders to obtain access to judicial proceedings or records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n    at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The court continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In such circumstances, intervention \"is not dependent on, nor is it determined by, the status or identification of\n   the parties nor the nature of the dispute.\" [citation omitted] Moreover, the question of intervention is collateral to, and does not have any bearing on, the primary issue-modification of the protective order. What is necessary is that the proposed intervenor demonstrate that its claims have \"a question of law or fact in common\" with the main action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Here, as in all such cases, by virtue of the fact that the media entities challenge the validity of the protective order entered in the main action, they meet the requirement of Rule 24.02, that their claim have \"a question of law or fact in common\" with the main action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11783443\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/982/359/#p362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court explained that once a common question of law or fact is established, the decision to allow intervention is a matter entrusted to the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n    at 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Thus,\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   and other Tennessee cases have \"firmly establishe[d] the right of the public, including the media, to intervene in court proceedings for the purpose of attending the proceedings, or for the purpose of petitioning the Court to unseal documents and allow public inspection of them.\"\n   <em>\n    Knoxville News-Sentinel v.

App. 1998). In the case before us, the proposed intervenor, Durham, challenges the continuing validity of the agreed order sealing the record. Applying the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that Durham meets the requirement of Rule 24.02 of a question of law or fact in common with the main action. Accordingly, we disagree with the trial court's finding that \"Durham has not met its burden to establish the common legal or factual questions necessary to sustain permissive intervention under T.R.C.P. 24.02.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We also disagree with the appellees' argument on appeal that no question or issue regarding the protective order remained pending or ongoing for the trial court to adjudicate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ballard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10022212\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/924/652/#p656\">\n    924 S.W.2d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Once entered, protective orders need not remain in place permanently, [ ] and their terms are not immutable.

Rule 24.02 provides that \"[i]n exercising discretion the court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.\" Despite the appellees' arguments to the contrary, we conclude that Durham did not seek to inject any new claims or issues in the Kocher-Bearden case, such as discovery or issues of fault. The Kocher-Bearden case was already settled. Durham sought to intervene only for the limited purpose of modifying the agreed order to gain access to the documents in the record. We discern no undue delay or prejudice to the adjudication of the rights of the original parties if intervention is permitted under the circumstances\n   of this case. We therefore reverse the trial court's decision denying Durham's motion to intervene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

They represent that the sealed record contains \"the Joint Petition for Approval of Minor's Settlement; the Order Appointing the Guardian ad Litem; the Agreed Order Sealing the File; the Order Granting the Joint Petition; and the\n   Report of the Guardian ad Litem, including all exhibits.\" The appellees argue that disclosure of the currently sealed documents would result in \"embarrassment and undue burden\" to the Beardens and impact their financial privacy because \"insurance coverage correlates to a policy holder's financial net worth.\" They claim that the Kochers' son is \"a vulnerable minor\" who should remain \"safe from those who might wrongfully exploit information about his settlement.\" They also argue that revelation of the sealed documents would breach the guardian ad litem's duty of confidentiality and \"detrimentally expose the private claim-management practices of [the Beardens' liability insurer].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This Court is not privy to the documents and information in the record that the trial court deemed appropriate to seal.
