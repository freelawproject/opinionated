The Statute of Frauds is inapplicable to an executed contract. <em>(Tyler </em>v. <em>Windels, </em>186 App. Div. 698, 227 N. Y. 589 ; <em>Matter of Ditson, </em>177 Misc. 648; <em>Buechler </em>v. <em>Pickrell, </em>230 App. Div. 706; <em>Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Linden, </em>207 Misc. 702.) II. A fully performed one-year agreement, initially void under the Statute of Frauds, is validly renewed from year to year by continued performance. <em>(Berth </em>v. <em>Knapp Co., </em>215 App, Div. 693; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>125 N. Y. 124; <em>Brightson </em>v. <em>Claflin Co., </em>180 N. Y. 76; <em>Treffinger </em>v. <em>Groh\u2019s Sons, </em>112 App. Div. 250,185 N.

A master-servant relationship is not determinative of the issue presented. <em>(Squier </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>131 Misc. 129, 225 App. Div. 797; <em>Locke </em>v. <em>Pembroke, </em>280 N. Y. 430.) IV. The sole basis for automatic renewal is continuance of a course of conduct by the parties. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>78 Misc. 377,155 App. Div. 897.) V. The basic motion was fatally defective. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Hellman Motor Corp., </em>122 Misc. 422; <em>Earle </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>73 App. Div. 300,173 N.

After December 31, 1958 the arrangement between the parties became one at will and, accordingly, Hudson\u2019s termination of the arrangement on April 18, 1960 is not actionable. <em>(McGovern </em>v. <em>Madame Elize, Inc., </em>137 Misc. 599; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Second Ave. R. R. Co., </em>97 N. Y. 384; <em>Lally </em>v. <em>Crookston Lbr. .Co., </em>85 Minn. 257; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>125 N. Y. 124; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins.

The rule that the continuation of a contract beyond its expiration gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rise by implication to a renewal for one year has no application to the arrangement set forth in the complaint. <em>(Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>33 N.

Plaintiff alleges that without any express agreement the same relationship was continued on the same terms during the calendar year 1959 and similarly on past the beginning of the year 1960. However, in April, 1960, so the complaint says, defendant-respondent refused to allow plaintiff to act any longer as export manager, to plaintiff\u2019s damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Defendant-respondent moved for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the alleged agreement, not being in writing and hot to be performed within a year, was unenforcible. Special Term, citing <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>(125 N. Y. 124), denied the motion and stated the rule to be that the Statute of Frauds has no application to a fully performed contract. The Appellate Division majority did not disagree with that but stated that the automatic renewal doctrine as to contracts which parties continue to act under after expiration date \u201c is strictly confined to agreements in which the master and servant relationship is the basis of the contract \u2019 \u2019. The majority held \u2014 and with this we agree \u2014 that, while the word \u201c employed \u201d is used in this complaint, the relationship described is not really that of master and servant but of some sort of agency. The two dissenting Appellate Division Justices thought that, while the complaint failed to set forth facts establishing an implied renewal, plaintiff should be allowed to amend by stating such additional facts if they exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><em>Adams </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>(125 N. Y. 124, <em>supra) </em>settled it as the law of this State that, where one enters into the employ of another under a contract for a year\u2019s service at a yearly salary and continues in the employment after the year\u2019s end, there is available an inference or implication of fact that the parties intended to renew for another year (see, also, <em>Brightson </em>v. <em>Claflin Co., </em>180 N. Y. 76) even though the agreement, being oral and made more than a year before its original expiry, was until performed unenforcible under the Statute of Frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">No one really doubts the nonapplicability of the Statute of Frauds defense. Such difficulty as exists comes about because all the decisions cited to us and found by us are in. master-servant or landlord-tenant cases <em>(Beeston </em>v. <em>Collyer, </em>4 Bingham 309 [Common Pleas, 1827]; <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>14 Daly 372, and cases cited; <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>33 N. Y. 47; <em>Treffinger </em>v. <em>Groh's Sons, </em>112 App. Div. 250, affd. 185 N. Y. 610). But the rule is not really one of substantive law, but of evidence. Entering <em>into </em>a contract to run for a year, and then continuing to act as if its time had not run, is sufficient evidentiary support for a finding that the parties in fact intended to keep it alive for another year (1 Corbin, Contracts [1963 ed.], \u00a7 18, p. 43). Suggestive although not controlling is <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Second Ave. R. R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>Co. </em>(97 N. Y. 384). Chase was not suing on an employment or real estate tenancy agreement, but the court at least intimated that had the contract been for one year only there could have been implied at its expiration an agreement to renew for another year.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">This complaint does not show the usual contract of hire but we see no reason why the implication of an agreed renewal from the fact of continuance beyond a year should not be available at least as to engagements like the one made between these parties for performance of services. The use of the fact of continuance to prove an intent to prolong the relationship is one of justice and common sense. It should not be considered inapplicable here. Plaintiff should be allowed to establish such intent by any facts he can exhibit, including the fact \u2014 if it be the fact \u2014 that the parties allowed the original arrangment to be carried without change into subsequent years. Defendant of course may bring forward evidence that the parties intended otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The judgment should be reversed and the motion denied, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Judges Fuld, Burke, Foster and Scileppi concur with Chief Judge Desmond ; Judges Dye and Van Voorhis dissent and vote to affirm for the reasons stated in the opinion at the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Judgment reversed and matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
