The Appellate Division erred in affirming the judgment of conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Schenkel, </em>256 N. Y. 539; <em>People </em>v. <em>Manganaro, </em>218 N. Y. 9; <em>People </em>v. <em>Migliori, </em>273 App. Div. 915; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellano, </em>273 App. Div. 978; <em>People </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>143 App. Div. 590; <em>People </em>v. <em>Reimann, </em>266 App. Div. 505; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>257 App. Div. 5; <em>Hodgskin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>279 F. 85; <em>People ex rel.

The appropriate remedy is a reversal of the conviction and the granting of a new trial. <em>(Stephens </em>v. <em>United States, </em>289 F. 2d 308; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>314 F. 2d 293; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>303 F. 2d 165.) IV. Defendant has been effectively deprived of his right to appeal in violation of the due process ' and equal protection clauses of the Federal Constitution. <em>(McKane </em>v. <em>Durston, </em>153 U. S. 684; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>351 U. S. 12; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pride, </em>3 N Y 2d 545.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-5\"><em>Edward S.

Apparently the summations were not taken down by the stenographer except as to one part of the prosecutor\u2019s speech to which defendant objected and a similar incident during the summation by defense counsel. Neither of these excerpts shows any erroneous ruling or any serious misconduct. As to the argument that in every criminal cause the closing speeches of counsel must be recorded in full, the Judges of this court know from experience as well as from records filed with us that in many parts of the State (as in other States \u2014 see, for instance, <em>Magoohan </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>71 Conn. 551) such has not been the practice. However, various statutes (see Code Crim. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 388, 456, 458, 485; Judiciary Law, \u00a7 295) if read literally require that \u201c the entire proceedings\u201d of the trial be taken down stenographically.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">While the present record shows an absence of prejudice to defendant from a failure to record the summations as well as an implied waiver of such recording, it would seem to be better practice in criminal causes for the Judge to order the summations to be taken down by the stenographer unless both counsel stipulate to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Vooehis, Burke, Foster and Scileppi concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
