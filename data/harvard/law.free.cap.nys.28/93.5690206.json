The plaintiff made proper effort, but was not allowed, to prove that defendant\u2019s wife, daughter, and son had from time to time during these years purchased goods from defendant at his jewelry store, which were always charged to the defendant, and bills for the same rendered to and paid by him; and that the goods so purchased, billed, and paid for were similar to those purchased by the son, and herein sued for. The plaintiff was nonsuited, on the ground \"that nothing has been proven, either agency or promise.\u201d However, defendant contends that the complaint does not state a cause of action against defendant, and hence the nonsuit was proper. No attack was made, before or at trial, against the complaint upon any ground whatever; and moreover, the complaint, although somewhat carelessly drawn, sets forth the cause of action against defendant. The plaintiff was improperly, nonsuited, and the judgment is reversed, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
