The answer alleged that the work was not done in a good and workmanlike manner; that plaintiffs failed to return surplus cloth to the account of defendants to the amount of any demand by plaintiffs which might be proved on the trial. The action having been regularly reached on the calendar, defendants failed to appear. Their default was entered, and an inquest taken, \u25a0and plaintiffs entered judgment. From a judgment of the city court affirming an order denying defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the judgment and affirming the clerk\u2019s adjustment of costs allowing plaintiffs a trial fee of $30 on an issue of fact, defendants appeal.

Code, \u00a7 3251, subd. 3. It is argued that, a plaintiff being entitled only to a verdict, decision, or judgment (Code, \u00a7 990), and these plaintiffs, not being entitled to a verdict or decision, because there was no issue tried, were not entitled to a trial fee in taking judgment. An issue of fact was presented by the pleadings upon the defendants\u2019 plea of recoupment which was to be deemed controverted by plaintiffs. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 522, 964. This issue was disposed \u2022of by the judgment taken by the plaintiffs on defendants\u2019 default, and such judgment was conclusive against defendants\u2019 claim. Embury v. Conner, 3 N. Y. 522. An issue is tried and determined whether the party holding the affirmative appears or not, and the successful party is therefore entitled to his trial fee. A trial fee is always allowed the plaintiff upon an inquest. Hawley v. Davis, 5 Hun, 642; Wessels v. Carr (City Ct. N. Y.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 525; Pomeroy v. Hulin, 7 How. Pr. 161. A trial fee is taxable where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the complaint is dismissed on failure of plaintiff to appear. Dodd v. Curry, 4 How. Pr. 123. Also where the cause is discontinued while on the day calendar, although it had not been actually called. Duperey v. Phoenix, 1 Abb. N. C. 133, note. In none of these cases-was there a trial other than such as was had in this case. The orders appealed from must be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
