The party has his remedy by action. Haebler v. Myers, 132 N. Y. 363, 30 N. E. 963; Baylies, New Trials, 191. Since the submission of this motion it appears that the action has been retried in the court below, and that the trial has again resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff. We deem it, therefore, a proper exercise of our discretion to deny restitution upon summary application therefor. \u00a1No costs of this motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
