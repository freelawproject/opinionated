The case is barren of any proof that the premises became untenantable by reason of any sudden disaster of any kind, but the testimony rather tends to show that they became dilapidated by gradual decay, which was one of the things the tenant undertook to guard against by his covenant in the lease. The judgment is therefore clearly erroneous, and it must be reversed, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
