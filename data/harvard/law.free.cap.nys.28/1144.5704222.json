Y. Supp. 301) and upon this. On the former appeal we held that there was a trilateral agreement between the parties, and we see no reason to recede from that, upon the facts presented in this. We think, therefore, this judgment is proper, and should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
