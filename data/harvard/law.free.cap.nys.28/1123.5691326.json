Without discussing the other questions presented on this appeal, we think the judgment must be reversed for the error already pointed out. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to examine the question as to the validity or propriety of the order granting the plaintiff an extra allowance. Judgment and order reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
