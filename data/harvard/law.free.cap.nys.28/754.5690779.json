These persons thereupon applied to the court for an order directing Mulholland, as an attorney' and officer of the court, to pay the proceeds over, according to the duty incumbent upon him as such attorney and officer. The justice at special term, as he lawfully might, directed a reference to determine and report upon the questions arising upon the motion. Code, \u00a7 3172. Nothing has been decided against the appellant, and the only question submitted for review is whether the court below had the power to make the order directing a referee to inquire into the facts. As the statute furnishes warrant for the power assumed, there remains nothing for us to do but to affirm the order appealed from, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
