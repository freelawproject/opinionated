When the car reached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>next station, plaintiff got off, but before the car started he went on the platform again, though it was as much crowded as before, and was injured in consequence of its crowded condition. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was chargeable with contributory negligence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b760-5\">Appeal from trial term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b760-6\">Action by Henry Graham against the Manhattan Railway Company for personal injuries.

To which appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cI think the respondents ought to have taken two or three from that platform, and put them over on the platform; they could have closed the gates then. I submit, on the testimony of the witness McCabe, he could have taken the passengers off.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b760-8\">Argued before BOOKSTAVER, BISCHOFF, and PRYOR, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-9\">Gilbert D.

The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
