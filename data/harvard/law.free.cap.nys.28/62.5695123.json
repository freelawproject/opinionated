The answer denies the contract; and whether there was a valid contract is the question for decision. To the validity of the contract, a memorandum of its terms was requisite under the statute of frauds; and such memorandum, the plaintiffs contend, is furnished by the following series of telegrams between the parties: On June 27th, the plaintiffs,, in New York, wired the defendants, in San Francisco: \u201cWill you ship us one or two carloads of sherry?\u201d On June 28th, the defendants answered: \u201cCan furnish one, perhaps two, cars sherry,, at fifty-two and a half cents per gallon, including cooperage, against thirty days\u2019 acceptance,\u201d\u2014to which, on June 29th, plaintiffs replied: \u201cAt prices quoted, former terms, you can ship 2 cars by Sunset route.\u201d On June 30th, defendants wired: \u201cPrice is net 52-|- cts. without any rebate. If you understand it that way, answer.\u201d On July 1st, plaintiffs replied: \u201cIf you cannot do. better, will accept your terms and price. Ship Sunset, one dollar rate.\u201d Finally, on July 5th, defendants telegraphed: \u201cCannot accept your order for sherry. Partiesi holding refusal of sherry before arrival of your order have taken it.\u201d It is elementary law that to the constitution of a contract the consent of the parties is indispensable; and the consent must be to the same thing, at the same time,\u2014consensus ad idem. Broom, Comm. 252; Bish. Cont. \u00a7 313; Pol. Cont 400. So that \u201ca mere offer, not accepted, involves no concurrence of wills, and can never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>constitute a contract.\u201d Bish. Cont. \u00a7 321. And, \"though there is an acceptance, if it is not to the exact thing offered, or if it is accompanied by any conditions or reservations, however slight, in t me or otherwise, no contract is made. It is the same where new terms are introduced. They constitute an offer on the other side, and leave the question open.\u201d Id. \u00a7 323. These fundamental principles in the formation of contracts suffice to determine whether an obligatory engagement between the parties to the action was consummated by the above correspondence. The direction as to the mode of shipment may be laid out of view, as not an element of the supposed contract. Manifestly, an obscurity lurks in the words \u201cformer terms,\u201d in the telegram of June 29th. What terms? Clearly, the parties had m mind previous conditions in bargains between them; and these \u201cformer terms\u201d nowhere appear in the correspondence. The telegram of the 28th, reciting the quantity of sherry to be sold, the price, and the time and method of payment, embodies all the essential stipulations of a contract of sale; and yet, in purporting to accept the offer, the plaintiffs interpolate the further condition that their acceptance is dependent also on \u201cformer terms.\u201d What those terms may be is not indicated by the defendants\u2019 reply, which merely restates the price by a more explicit expression; nor by plaintiffs\u2019 response, which accepts \u201cterms and price.\u201d Nor, again, is it possible to collect from the :orrespondence whether the sale was of one or two car loads of sherry. The plaintiffs\u2019 offer was to buy one or two car loads. The defendants\u2019 offer was to sell one, perhaps two, car loads. The correspondence fails to disclose that the parties finally agreed on the sale of one car load,\u2014the contract on which the judgment was recovered. The fact that the complaint contains a count for two car loads of sherry as well as for one is a concession that even yet the plaintiffs have not definitely accepted either alternative of the offer. Again, in the telegram by which the plaintiffs claim that they closed and consummated the contract, they say: \u201cIf you cannot do better, will accept your terms and price.\u201d Not in the definition of lexicographers only, but in popular apprehension as well, \u201cif\u201d is \u201ca word which introduces a conditional clause; supposing; provided.\u201d Stormonth, Cent. Diet., and all others. Plainly, a promise by one to another, if the other will do a certain thing, is not absolute, but conditioned that the other do the thing. In saying, \u201cIf you cannot do better, I will accept your offer,\u201d the plaintiffs referred the matter back to the defendants for reconsideration, suspending, meanwhile, their acceptance of the offer. The construction would be different had the plaintiffs said: \u201cAs you will not do better, I accept your offer.\u201d At this point the defendants withdrew the offer, and hence no agreement was perfected between the parties. A reversal of the judgment is the necessary consequence. Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
