Proc. \u00a7 452, by virtue of having insured the title to the property, and is therefore not entitled as a matter of right to be made a defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b412-11\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-12\">.Actions, one by Herman Russ and others against Eliza Stratton and others and the Lawyers\u2019 Title Insurance Company of New York, and the other by Louis E.

A transfer of the property was executed by persons representing themselves to be plaintiffs, and afterwards the property was sold under a judgment, and purchased by defendants\u2019 grantor.

Its interest is only in the question involved in the action, and this is not the interest to which section 452 refers. A consequential interest will not suffice. Barb. Parties, 488. The special term had power to direct the respondent to be made a defendant, though not required to do so by the Code provision (Bank v. Farthing, 101 N. Y. 344, 4 N. E. 734), but naturally this power ought not to have been exercised, except for sufficient reason. The papers disclose none. There is no charge of misconduct against the insured, nor does there appear to be any reason to doubt that the respondent will have a fair opportunity to protect its\u00bbinterest without being a defendant. Under the circumstances, the motion should not have been granted. Davies v. Fish, 47 Hun, 314. Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
