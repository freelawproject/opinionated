United States\u2014whereby defendant agreed to carry the horses from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Liverpool, by the steamship Queen, to the city of New York. In loading the horses upon the steamship at Liverpool, one of the horses fell overboard, and was drowned. This action is to recover the value of the horse thus lost, together with \u00a310 which had been paid for freight thereon by the assignors of plaintiff to the defendant. The complaint alleges that \u201cthe defendant, or its servants, performed their duties so unskillfully and negligently, and supplied such insufficient machinery and appliances, * * * that one of said horses fell overboard, and was drowned.\u201d The defendant, by its answer, substantially admits the contract for transportation set forth in the complaint, and alleges that \u201cit has fulfilled its contract, and that it is under no such liability as is alleged in the complaint.\u201d For further answer, defendant says that a horse, while in the charge of the servants of plaintiff\u2019s assignors, was drowned. It is thus seen that the issues raised by the pleadings are (1) the proximate cause of the loss of the horse, and the responsibility therefor; and (2) the value of the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The process of shipping consisted in placing the horse into a box or crate with a door at each end. Then the doors were closed, and the box, containing the horse, was hoisted, and swung on board the steamship. The horse in question, called \u201cGay Lad,\u201d was restive and uneasy, and did not readily enter the box. After four other horses had been safely placed on board, in the manner described, the horse Gay Lad still refused to be led into the box, as the other horses were, and was therefore backed into the box, and went through the door at the other end, off the dock, into the water, and was drowned. It was the defendant\u2019s contention upon the trial\u2014 and there was evidence introduced in support thereof\u2014that the horse was in charge of the servants of plaintiff\u2019s assignors when he was drowned. The issue on this question seems to have been fairly and squarely left to the jury. The learned trial judge said to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u201cIf you find that the horse was in the possession and under the control of Messrs. De Young and Atterbury [the assignors of plaintiff] at the time this accident happened, of course there cannot be any recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On this question the jury, by their verdict, found adversely to the defendant, and there is ample evidence to sustain their conclusion. While it is true that there is a conflict of testimony on this point, we are of the opinion that there is a fair preponderance of evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the defendant assumed and undertook the task of loading the horses upon the steamship. It is the defendant\u2019s testimony, as well as the plaintiff\u2019s, that one Balfe, an employ\u00e9 of the defendant, superintended the loading of the horses, and gave specific instructions in reference to the management of the horse in question, while upon the wharf. When the horses arrived upon the wharf, they were assigned by defendant\u2019s servants to a shed, in which to stand until brought to the box for hoisting upon the steamer, under the superintendence .of Balfe. The evidence is certainly sufficient to sustain the conclusion that there was a delivery of the horses by plaintiff\u2019s Assign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ors to the defendant, and that at the time of the accident they were in the possession and under the control of the defendant. The de- \u00b0 fendant had received on the day previous payment for the transportation of the horses, at the rate of \u00a310 for each horse. The fact being established that defendant received the horses for transportation to the city of \u00a1New York, the common-law liability of common carriers of property rested upon the defendant, in respect of the horses, and it became insurer against all loss, subject to the following qualifications: It could be relieved from liability, in case of loss, provided the loss could be attributed to the intrinsic qualities or nature of the animal, and defendant\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence could be made to appear, and provided the loss was due to an act of God or of the public enemy. On this question the learned trial judge laid down, for the guidance of the jury, the rule in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u201cIf this unmanageable condition of the horse was one innate in the animal, \u2014in other words, if he was such an animal as would, from his disposition, be unmanageable, or was, from his very disposition, unmanageable at the time, \u2014there cannot be a recovery here, unless this unmanageable condition was brought about by the carelessness or negligence of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We think it may be said that this rule was more favorable to defendant than it had a right to ask, since the controlling authorities hold that, to excuse the carrier from liability, it must not only appear that the injury arose from the viciousness, unruliness, or restiveness of the animal, or similar causes attributable to the nature and propensities of the animal itself, but it must also appear that the carrier has been guilty of no negligence causing the loss. Penn v. Railroad Co., 49 N. Y. 204; Cragin v. Railroad Co., 51 N. Y. 61; Evans v. Railroad Co., 111 Mass. 142.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">It was not error to refuse to charge that \u201cthe proximate cause of the accident was the unmanageable condition of the horse,\u201d inasmuch as that was a question of fact, clearly within the province of the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">After careful examination of the entire case, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of defendant\u2019s negligence, as set forth in the complaint in the following language, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">\u201cThat, in loading said horses upon said steamship, the defendant, or its servants, performed their duties so unsldllfully and negligently, and supplied such insufficient machinery and appliances, that * * * said horse fell overboard and was drowned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">There is sufficient testimony to support the conclusion of the jury as to the amount of damages, and we can find no reason for setting aside or modifying the verdict, as being against the evidence, or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">The question of jurisdiction is not in the case. The defendant duly appeared and answered, but did not plead the want of jurisdiction. If that question could have been raised, it must be deemed to have been waived. Code, \u00a7 266; Popfinger v. Yutte, 102 N. Y. 38, 6 N. E. 259; McLean v. Railroad Co., 13 Daly, 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">The rules of law laid down by the court below in the conduct of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the trial, and in the presentation of the case to the jury, were cor- \" rect. The result of the trial depended upon questions of fact, which were fairly left to the jury to decide, and its verdict is conclusive. The judgment and order appealed from must he affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
