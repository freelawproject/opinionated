A station of the defendants is situated at the corner of Forty-Second street and Second avenue, and the platform of the station extends the full length of the building. The issues presented by the pleadings were referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>-a referee to hear and determine. After the hearing, he determined that the plaintiff had not been injured by defendants\u2019 station, a,nd \u2018dismissed the complaint. Among the findings of fact upon which -he based his conclusions of law was the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u201cNo substantial interference with the air or light of said premises has been shown to result directly from the maintenance of the railway structure of \u25a0the defendants in said avenue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">But that is what the plaintiff apparently attempted, although \u25a0ineffectually, to prove. A tenant in the building in question being \u25a0under examination, the plaintiff asked him:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cQ. Now, then, will you state whether or not this platform in front of .your store cuts off any light from the front part of the store? The question is whether any more light would come to it if that structure and station was \u25a0not there, or if the light is cut off by it. (Objected to by defendants\u2019 counsel, on the ground that it calls for an opinion of the witness upon a state of facts that does not exist. The referee sustained the objection, and counsel \u25a0for the plaintiff duly excepted.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The objection was not well taken. The question called for a fact. Whether an awning or an elevated railway platform overhanging \u25a0a window \u201cwill cut off any light\u201d is a fact easily within the grasp of the average intellect. As the error is one calling for reversal, we need not discuss the other, exceptions to which our attention T\u00edas been called. The judgment should be reversed, with costs to the appellant, to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
