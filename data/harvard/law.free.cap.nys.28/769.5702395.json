On March 1, 1894,\u2014over 3J years after commencement of the action, and more than one year after same had been dismissed for want of prosecution,\u2014the plaintiff moved to open his default in the motion to dismiss, and his motion was granted, and the default opened by the order from which this appeal is taken. Not a single fact, as above set forth, was denied by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, nor by plaintiff\u2019s own affidavit, except that he says he did not personally hear about the case until the judgment was entered, which was more than one year before his motion. The defendant\u2019s judgment was for costs only, and the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action was not on the merits. Hence, he can bring a new action, if\" he has any cause, and, if he does, he needs to amend his complaint, for it is indeed doubtful whether it sets forth a cause of action. His motion should have been denied, leaving him to his new action. Judge Van Brunt says in James v. McCreery (Sup.) 7 N. Y. Supp. 494:</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">\u201cThere is no good reason why all the damages arising from the negligence of a party or his attorney should be visited upon the opposing party to the action, as would be the case if defaults were to be opened as a matter of course. The plaintiff in this case has been guilty of laches in the making of this motion, and should be remitted to a new action for the enforcement of his rights, if he has any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">And see Wygant v. Brown, Id. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">The order is reversed, and plaintiff\u2019s motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
