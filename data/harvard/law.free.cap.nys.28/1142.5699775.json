The general term of the city court has passed upon that, and its decision is final. The claim that the verdict is against the preponderance of evidence admits that there is some evidence to support the verdict. There is no other question raised in the joints of the appellant, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
