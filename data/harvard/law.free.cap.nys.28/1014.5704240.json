He added: \u201cIf you say it was an imprudent act, it was a negligent act, why, then the village is responsible for the negligent act of the commissioner of highways; for it was his business to keep those roads in safety. He was acting, for the village in that respect.\u201d And again he charged: \u201cBut it was his business to take care that the sidewalks</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-14\">were not permitted to be left open to this hole.\u201d An exception was taken to the charge as thus given. No such negligence was alleged in the complaint, and it is at least questionable whether the plaintiff should have been permitted to recover upon the ground so stated in the charge. We think it was error to receive the declarations of the plaintiff as to headache, made several months after the accident occurred. Roche v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 294, 11 N. E. 630. Non-expert witnesses were improperly permitted to testify as to mental condition and impaired memory of the plaintiff after the accident occurred. We grant a new trial upon the exceptions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
