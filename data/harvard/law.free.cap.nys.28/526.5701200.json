The judgment was entered on a verdict directed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">We have passed on this question in our opinion at this general term (28. N. Y. Supp. 525) on the appeal from the judgment. At most, the contention set up by the defendant could have gone only to a reduction of plaintiffs\u2019 claim as conceded by the defendant\u2019s answer. The trial justice, having ruled out the evidence offered to prove defendant\u2019s counterclaim, passed on the issues presented, and thus there was no offset or deduction to be made, and the plaintiff became entitled to a verdict for the full amount. The proper course left, then, for defendant was by appeal from the judgment, and not by the method herd adopted. The order should therefore be affirmed, with costs. ,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
