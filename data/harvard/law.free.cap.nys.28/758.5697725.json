The claim was assigned by the bank-note company to the plaintiff. The evidence clearly established the performance of the work and furnishing of the material, and that $795, with interest, was due therefor. The assignment was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>by the president of the bank-note company, in the presence of its secretary, and the corporate seal of the company was affixed. The assignment was certainly sufficient to protect the defendant in paying the amount due to the plaintiff, and therefore the defendant cannot seriously question the legality of the transfer. Sheridan v. Mayor, etc., 68 N. Y. 30. It nowhere appears that the defendant w\u00e1s entitled to the plates upon which the bonds were printed, and the bonds themselves were delivered and accepted. The verdict of the jury is satisfactorily sustained by the evidence, and finds every fact in favor of the plaintiff which is required to sustain the judgment, which must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
