Modified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-3\">The complainant alleges that plaintiff bought $3,200 worth of furniture, fixtures, and chattels of Elliott &amp; Congle, and paid at various times by check, cash, and return of furniture a sum equal to this amount; that five months after th'e purchase of furniture, Elliott &amp; Congle, by their agents, secured through fraud, trick, and device a mortgage on these chattels to defendant of $3,179.51, and at several other times subsequent to this mortgage secured three other mortgages in same manner to defendant amounting, with the first one, to $5,560.21.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b474-4\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

The mortgagee can ask to have the mortgages foreclosed in this action, and on such an issue might have an injunction restraining the plaintiff from removing the property from the state, or from dispersing it, to the injury of the mortgagee\u2019s interests. We think, under the allegations, that the mortgagee should be restrained from enforcing the power of sale pending this action, upon condition the plaintiff should be required to give an undertaking, in lieu of those heretofore given, in the sum of $2,000. No costs to either party. Order modified accordingly, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
