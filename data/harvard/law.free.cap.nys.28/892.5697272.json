The plaintiff recovered judgment against the defendant in the justice\u2019s court, and the defendant thereupon appealed for a new trial in the county court, he haying pleaded a counterclaim for more than $50. At the close of the testimony in the case, the court nonsuited the plaintiff \u201cupon the ground that, from the testimony of the plaintiff, it appears that the contract, if any. entered into between the plaintiff and defendant was a contract to answer for the debt or default of the copartnership firm of Salisbury &amp; Johnson, and that the same .was not in writing, and therefore void, by the statute of fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The complaint of the plaintiff and the answer of the defendant were both in writing. The defendant, in his answer, did not plead the statute of frauds as a defense, although, as will be seen from the substance of the complaint, as hereinbefore stated, he was fully apprised of the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. Neither was there any objection made by the defendant, upon the trial, to the reception of the evidence establishing the contract by parol. This was-error. The statute not being pleaded as a defense, and the evidence which established the parol contract having been received without objection, the defendant was not in any position to take advantage of the statute at the close of the trial. Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y. 379, 34 N. E. 911. In addition, however, it may be stated that if the plaintiff\u2019s version of the contract, as given by him upon the trial, is correct, then the defendant did not agree to pay the debt of another, but entered into a contract of his own, and for which he was personally responsible, as the original contractor. The judgment of the county court should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
