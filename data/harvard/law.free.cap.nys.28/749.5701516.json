The application was not founded on any defense meritorious in its character, but upon a technical objection as to the plaintiff\u2019s capacity to sue. The ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>jection did not appear on the face of the complaint, and was one that could not be urged by way of demurrer, but, in the nature of things, would have to be taken advantage of by special plea in the answer, calling upon the plaintiff to make proof that it had the necessary legal authority to transact business in this state. We think the application made below should have been denied, if it was granted as matter of right. Such decision would be erroneous, and, if granted as a matter of favor, the discretion was not wisely exercised. In either case, the order appealed from would have to be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
