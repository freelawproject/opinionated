The answer of the defendant alleges that' its liability, if any, for the loss of baggage, is limited to five pounds sterling, by reason that any value in excess of that sum was not declared. From a judgment entered upon the verdict of a jury herein, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial, this appeal is taken. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony is that the defendant\u2019s agent demanded from the plaintiff five dollars for extra freight for the package, the contents of which had been disclosed to the agent, and that she paid the same, and therefore the plaintiff is not limited in her recovery by the provisions in the ticket. Glovinsky v. Steamship Co. (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 26 N. Y. Supp. 751. The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur. \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
