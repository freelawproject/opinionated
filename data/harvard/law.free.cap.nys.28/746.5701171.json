The complaint alleges due demand, nonpayment, protest, and notice of same; and the answer denies these allegations, and that plaintiff is the holder, while admitting the making of the note, and defendant\u2019s indorsement. The defendant did not at any time serve, as required by section 923 of the Code, an affidavit to the effect that defendant had not received such notice. At trial the notary public\u2019s certificate of protest was admitted in evidence against defendant\u2019s objection that it was not in proper form, in that it did not contain a statement that New York, the place to which the notice was mailed to defendant, was his usual or reputed place of residence. The certificate did not contain such statement, although it stated that such notice had been duly mailed to the first indorser, Thomas Auld (defendant), directed to New York, and every other fact permitted by section '923 to be so stated. The omission of such statement as to defendant\u2019s residence might have been fatal if the instrument had been a foreign bill of exchange, for such bills must be protested; but this note is an inland bill, executed, delivered, and made payable within this state, and as to such bills the rule is that due demand \u25a0on maker, nonpayment, and due notice of same to the indorser is sufficient to charge him, without a formal or technical protest, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>proof of any or all of the facts necessary to charge him can be made by parol evidence. This section of the Code says that the notary\u2019s certificate, in case of protest, and in the absence of the indorser\u2019s affidavit of nonreceipt, shall be presumptive evidence of certain facts therein named, provided they are certified, which means presumptive evidence of such facts as are so certified. This certificate contained a statement of every fact permitted by this section, except the one as to defendant\u2019s usual or reputed residence, hence was properly admitted in evidence to prove every fact necessary to charge the indorser, except as to whether the notice addressed to him at New York was mailed to him at his residence; and proof of this fact was properly supplied by his own testimony that before such mailing, at that time, and ever since, he has resided in New York. This certificate was only presumptive evidence of the other necessary facts, and defendant had the right to show by extrinsic evidence that there had been no such demand, nonpayment, protest, or such mailing of such notice, which, however, he did not even offer to do. Hence, upon the proof, there was nothing to go to the jury upon, and it became the court\u2019s duty to direct for plaintiff, as he did; and, moreover, the defendant did not request to go to the jury, but relied upon his two exceptions to the exclusion, on plaintiff\u2019s objection, of evidence offered by him, and which will be now discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Appellant claims error, because the court would not allow him to say whether or not he had received the notice of protest, etc., which the certificate proved was duly mailed at Tarrytown, addressed to him at New York, which was his actual residence, as shown by his own testimony. This was not error, and to have allowed such proof of nonreceipt of notice, against plaintiff\u2019s objection, would have been reversible error, if the verdict had been for defendant. The rule of the law. merchant has ever been that no-tic to an indorser, of demand and nonpayment, may be given through the post office, when such indorser and the sender reside at different post offices, and, if properly addressed and mailed, will charge the indorser, whether he ever receives it or not. How could a bona fide holder of a note ever protect his holding by finding proof to contradict an indorser\u2019s statement that he had never received the notice of demand and nonpayment sent by mail? The due mailing of such notice is, in itself, sufficient to charge an indorser. Judge Earle, in Gawtry v. Doane, 51 N. Y. 89, says that it may be proper to insert in the indorser\u2019s affidavit, permitted by the Code, the denial of his receipt of notice of protest, but it is not a proper denial to insert in his answer, and that \u201cit is wholly immaterial whether the indorser has received the notice. The only material question is whether notice has been properly served, and the rights of the holder of a note are not affected if the notice does not reach the indorser.\u201d And so, too, it is said in Arnold v. Railroad Co., 5 Duer, 210, that \u201can answer denying that a notice of protest was received would deny an immaterial fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The defendant\u2019s other exception is to the exclusion of a paper signed by the maker, purporting to certify to this defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the note in suit was indorsed hy Mm for the purpose of taking up \u25a0 another note, for like amount, by same maker; also indorsed by tMs defendant, and then held by this plaintiff under protest. There \u25a0 was not the slightest evidence that this plaintiff knew or overheard of this paper, and it was properly excluded for that, if for no-other reason, and so, too, because it was mere hearsay evidence,. and the person signing it was not in court, or his absence explained; and, moreover, the very facts to wMch it purported to certify were \u2022 fully proven by the-best evidence\u2014First, by defendant\u2019s exhibit 1, being plaintiff\u2019s letter acknowledging that the note in suit was. given in renewal of the one mentioned in the properly rejected certificate; and, secondly, by defendant\u2019s exhibit 2, which is the very note itself, duly indorsed by the payee and this defendant, and so-mentioned in such rejected certificate. The judgment and order - are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">McCARTHY, j., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b768-6\">EHRLICH, C. J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">The action is against the defendant, an indorser of a promissory note. The defense relied upon, was want of service of notice of protest. The proof on the subject of notice consisted of\u2014First, the certificate of the notary, certifying to the fact that the notice of protest was mailed to the defendant; second, the evidence of the plaintiff, proving that he mailed, a copy of such notice to defendant. At the trial the defendant undertook to prove that he had never received any notice of the dishonor of the note, but the testimony was ruled out by the trial; judge, under the defendant\u2019s exception. This was error. The certificate of the notary was merely presumptive evidence of the fact of service of notice (Code, \u00a7 928), and it was quite competent for the defendant to negative this presumption by proof that he had never received the notice. This would have created a question of fact, for the jury to determine,\u2014whether the notice was, as a matter of fact, deposited in the post office or not.. If the jury found that the deposit was actually made, it would be good service of the-notice upon the defendant, whether he received it or not. Fertile error in excluding this evidence, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant, to abide-the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
