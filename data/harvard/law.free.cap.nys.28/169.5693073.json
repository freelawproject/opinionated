Plaintiff alleged that while;, a locomotive was standing idle on defendant\u2019s track, near the highway, plaintiff asked the engineer not to start or make any noise until he got past with his team, but that the engineer started the locomotive, blew the whistle, let off steam, and made such a noise that the team was frightened into running away and doing the damage complained of. Defendant answered that it used such prudence and reasonable care as was usual in its business, and no more noise was made than was needed for the necessary signal. There was a judgment in favor of plaintiff, and defendant appeals.

The answer to that argument is that the opinion of the plaintiff was not binding on the jury, who were the judges of that question. The engineer testified that he blew the whistle in the course of his duty for the purpose of moving the cars. The jury had a right to believe the engineer. They were also authorized by the testimony to find that the action of the engineer was heedless, and without due regard to the situation of the plaintiff. The charge of the court correctly laid down the law, and the testimony warranted the verdict. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
