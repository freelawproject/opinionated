On the hearing of the motion, this was disputed, and it was also asserted and sworn to that the judgment debtor appeared at the examination, and waived this objection. This is also certified to by the referee. On these facts the justice at special term, in the exercise of his \u2022sound discretion, denied the motion to remove. The facts are sufficient to justify this determination, and, there being no abuse of \u2022discretion, order must be affirmed with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
