They cannot, as in this case, exceed the damages. Section 3228, subd. 3, Code Civ. Proc. We are clear that the justice erred in allowing the insertion of the disbursements in this case. The plaintiff, having recovered six cents damages, was only entitled to six cents costs, no matter what might be his disbursements. The orders appealed from should therefore be reversed, and the clerk\u2019s taxation reinstated and affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
