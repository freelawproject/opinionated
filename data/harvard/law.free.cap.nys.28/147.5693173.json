All the negotiations between the parties concededly existed only in the correspondence between them. On October 13, 1893, \u00abdefendant wrote to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, offering to accept a lease of the New Rochelle house from November 1, 1893, to April 1, 1894, at the monthly rental of $25. In response to this the assignor called at defendant\u2019s residence, but failed to meet the latter; On October 16th defendant again wrote, referring to the occasion of the assignor\u2019s call, and expressing regret at not meeting him. In this last-mentioned letter defendant mentions the fact that he was informed by his wife that he (the assignor) had accepted his (defendant\u2019s) offer of'October 13th, and refers to the assignor\u2019s expressed wish to have possession of the house surrendered to him on March 20, 1894, to enable him to proceed with contemplated decorations and repairs, to which proposed surrender, however, defendant refused to accede. On October 17th plaintiff\u2019s assignor replied by refusing to recede from his proposal that the house be surrendered to him at the time mentioned, and on October 23d defendant again wrote, this time withdrawing his offer to accept a lease altogether. This last letter evoked a response from plaintiff\u2019s assignor, which was to the effect that he would hold defendant to his offer, of October 16th. It is apparent that the minds of the parties never met; that they had never fully agreed respecting the terms of any proposed lease; defendant insisting that it should endure until April 1st, and plaintiff\u2019s assignor that it should expire on March 20th. Consistently with his withdrawal of the offer to accept a lease, defendant concededly never occupied the premises during any part of the proposed term. Until, therefore, defendant\u2019s offer was unconditionally accepted by plaintiff\u2019s assignor, or the latter\u2019s proposed modification of the offer was unconditionally assented to by the defendant, there was no agreement, hence no lease; and before his offer was unconditionally accepted by plaintiff\u2019s assignor it was competent to defendant to withdraw it. Stove Co. v. Holbrook, 101 N. Y. 45, 4 N. E. 4. It was error on the part of the justice below to award damages in any amount to the plaintiff, and as, upon the facts, the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ment must be reversed, and the complaint be dismissed, it is unnecessary to examine other grounds of alleged error. Judgment reversed, and complaint dismissed, with costs of this appeal and of the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
