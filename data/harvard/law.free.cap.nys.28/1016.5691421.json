But the only evidence in the case in regard to the said check was that introduced by defendant. He proved by plaintiff, whom he (defendant) made his witness in that regard, that the check in question was given for three days\u2019 work done prior to March 9, 1891. The defendant was afterwards sworn, and did not contradict plaintiff\u2019s testimony, but rather corroborated it. Hence, the defendant proved that the check in question was for work done prior to the alleged hiring; and, such being the case, it was properly excluded by the justice. Had the defendant, in the first instance, proved the check in question by another witness than the plaintiff, and the latter, as a witness on his own account, had testified that said check was given for work done prior to March 9, 1891, doubtless the defendant would have had the right to go to the jury as to the credibility of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, even if such statement of the plaintiff had not been denied on the trial. But defendant chose to malee the plaintiff his own witness in regard to the check, and proved by him what the check was given for, and that it was not material to the issues formed by the pleadings; and, his evidence not being contradicted, the justice was authorized to sustain plaintiff\u2019s objection to the introduction of the paper. But, were it otherwise, it may be doubted whether the error of the justice, if any error there was, in excluding the paper in question, was one that in any manner harmed the defendant. The facts that the check would have shown, if introduced, seem to have been proved by the evidence in the case. The plaintiff testified: \u201cThis check was given to me for days\u2019 work done before March 9, 1891, for Mr. Forsyth; for three days\u2019 work, at $1.50 per day.\u201d Defendant testified: \u201cThis check of March 26,1891, is for three days\u2019 work, at $1.50 per day.\u201d The above-quoted testimony was not stricken out, but remained in the case, and showed that on March 26,1891, defendant gave to plaintiff a check for three days\u2019 work, at $1.50 per day. The check, if introduced, would have shown no more. The judgment of the county court should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
