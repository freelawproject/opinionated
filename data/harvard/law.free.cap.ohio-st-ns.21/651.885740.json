Under the act of July 1, 1858 (S. <em>&amp; </em>O. 673, see. 14, 5), which requires guardians of infants to <em>\u201c </em>appear for and defend, or cause to be defended, all suits\u201d against the infant, the guardian is authorized to appear for an infant defendant to a petition for dower; and where he appears and answers as guardian, and his answer is received and acted on by the court, the effect is the same as though he had been expressly appointed <em>guardian ad litem, </em>and had appeared and answered as such.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b659-7\">2.

Rankin (now Kemp), the defendants thereto being all minors. Process was served upon the minors, and also upon their general guardians. No guardian <em>ad litem </em>was appointed for the infants, but their general guardians appeared and put in answers. By their answers the guardians admitted the marriage of the petitioner and the seizen of her husband, but denied all other allegations in the petition. The record shows that the cause was heard by the court \u201cupon the petition, answer and exhibits,\u201d and that the court thereupon found all the allegations of the petition to be true, and ordered the assignment of dower. It is alleged that in these proceedings the court erred (1) in omitting to appoint a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the infants, and (2) in finding the allegations of the petition true upon the petition, answers and exhibits, the answers admitting facts prejudicial to the in fants, and which, by the code, are required to be denied by the guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>This judgment was affirmed by the district court, and leave is now asked of this court to file a petition in error to reverse the judgment of affirmance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b660-5\"><em>Spence &amp; Arthur </em>for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWL\"><em>Exhibits. </em>\u2014 Wharton\u2019s Law Dic. 365; 1 Bouv.

The act of July 1, 1858 (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 673, sec. 14, \u00a7 5), requires guardians of infants to \u201c appear for and defend, or cause to be defended, all suits\u201d against their wards. Where the guardian appears and answers as such, and his answer is received and acted upon, without objection, by the court, the effect is the same as if he had been expressly appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>by the court, and had appealed and answered as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>As to the objection that the cause was heard upon answers admitting facts prejudicial to the infants, and without testimony, it is enough to say that we are bound to presume that there was evidence before the court, either in the \u201c exhibits\u201d or otherwise, to warrant the court in finding, as it did, that <em>all </em>the allegations in the petition were true. It is immate rial, therefore, to inquire whether the facts admitted by the answers, the marriage and seizen, were facts prejudicial to the infants, or whether the proceeding was one to which the provisions of the code in regard to infant defendants is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
