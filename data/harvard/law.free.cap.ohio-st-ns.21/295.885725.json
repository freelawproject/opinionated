The wife of Jacob Bush did not join him in the execution of the deed, but retained her contingent right of dower in the land. The alleged ground for setting aside the conveyance was, that it was made and received with the intent to defraud Jacob Bush\u2019s creditors, and for a grossly inadequate consideration. The petition further states that, before suit brought, William Bush conveyed his half of the farm to Allen Bush, a son of Jacob Bush, for a like colorable consideration, or for a grossly inadequate consideration, if any, and for the purpose of defrauding the creditors of Jacob Bush ; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Allen Bush had full knowledge of the circumstances. The further prayer of the petition was, that the lands might be soldi and the proceeds applied to pay the judgment creditors for whom the action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Pending the suit in the common pleas, Isaac Stookey died, and John McNally, one of the judgment creditors named in the petition as such, was substituted as plaintiff in his place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-6\">The answer of the defendants avers, in substance, that the intention of the sale and conveyance by Jacob Bush to William Bush and Strawder James was to secure them as his creditors and sureties to the extent of ten thousand dollars, and that the sale and conveyance by William Bush of his half of the lands to Allen Bush was in good faith, for a valuable consideration, and not to defraud any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-7\">The cause was appealed to the district court, and there tried at the September term, 1867, and resulted in a judgment and decree for the plaintiffs. The court found that the conveyance made by Jacob Bush to William Bush and Strawder James \u201cwas not made with the actual intent, and for the purpose of delaying, hindering and defrauding the said plaintiff, and other creditors of the said Jacob Bush ; nor was said consideration in said conveyance expressed entirely colorable, as in said petition charged, but that said conveyance is constructively fraudulent in this, to wit: the consideration in said conveyau.ce set forth and proved was inadequate and insufficient,\u201d and much less than the lands were worth at the date of the conveyance ; that the lands were then worth fifteen thousand dollars, and that the contingent right of dower of Eva Bush, wife of Jacob Bush, both living, was valued at four thousand dollars, and deducted at that value from the value of the lands, but that the real value of the right of dower was not more than one thousand dollars, which, added to the ten thousand dollars, left four thousand dollars of the fifteen thousand the lands were really worth. This four thousand dollars, with interest from January 31st, 1861, was adjudged to be paid by the purchasers of the lands, or, in default, that the lands be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>sold, &amp;c.; and the money was ordered to be paid into the hands of the clerk, to be distributed according to law, under the order of the court of common pleas, to which court the cause was remanded to carry the judgment and order into execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-5\">On the return of the cause to the common pleas, Samuel Jamison, as assignee of Jacob Bush, and as administrator of Merett Jamison, deceased, was, on his own motion, made a party to the suit, and filed his answer, in the nature of a cross-petition, in which he states that, after the judgment in the district court, and the remanding of the cause to the common pleas, he was appointed assignee of Jacob Bush, by the probate court of Boss county, on the application of one of a number of Jacob Bush\u2019s creditors, whose claims, though notin judgment, existed prior to and ever since January 31, 1861, one of such claims being due to him as administrator ; and averring Jacob Bush\u2019s insolvency, and claiming that the amount recovered in the action should be distributed to all his creditors <em>pro rata, </em>whether judgment or non-judgment creditors, and not alone to the judgment creditors for whose benefit the suit was brought; and insisting that they acquired no lien by the filing of the petition to set-aside the conveyance, having given no notice to creditors, as required by the statute of 1863 ; and, as assignee, asks the direction of the court as to whether such creditors shall present and establish their claims, according to the general law governing ordinary assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors, or according to the act of 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-6\">The plaintiff replied to Jamison\u2019s answer, denying that he had been duly appointed assignee, and insisting that creditors whose claims were not reduced to judgment prior to the filing of the original petition, have no right to. or lien upon, the fund recovered or to be distributed in the case ; that the suit was prosecuted for the exclusive benefit of such creditors as had reduced their claims to judgment prior to the commencement of the action; that by reason of the action, and the judgment therein, the plaintiff and the other judgment creditors acquired, in equity, a priority over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>other creditors, and that Jamison, by his answer, shows no right to question that priority, and no right to the fund to be distributed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">Upon the issues thus raised the cause was tried in the common pleas, and appealed to the district court, and therein again tried at the September term, 1868, as between Jami-son and the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">On this trial the court found that after the rendition of the judgment in the original case in the district court, on the application of a creditor of Jacob Bush, who was such creditor prior to the execution of the\u2019conveyance mentioned in the original petition, the probate judge of Ross county appointed Jamison as assignee of Jacob Bush, under the act of February 12, 1863, to amend section seventeen of the act of April 6, 1859, \u201cto regulate assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors ; \u201d that Jamison was duly qualified, and was, when he filed his answer, and still is, acting as such assignee; that no notice of the pendency and object of the suit to set aside the conveyance was ever published, or attempted to be published, under said act of 1863 ; but that the facts stated in Jamison\u2019s answer do not entitle him, as assignee, or as an individual creditor of Jacob Bush, or as administrator, to any relief in the premises, and that, under the final decree of the district court, the act of 1863 has no application ; and that Jamison could not be appointed assignee for want of power in the probate judge. Therefore the court dismissed Jamison\u2019s answer and cross-petition, at his costs, and held that the judgment creditors, by and for whom the original action was prosecuted, were entitled to the fund to be distributed, to the exclusion of Jamison, according to their respective rights. Judgment was entered accordingly, and Jamison excepted, and filed the present petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-7\"><em>Alfred Yaple </em>for plaintiff in error :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">The conveyance, though found to be <em>not actually </em>but only <em>constructively fraudulent, </em>as against creditors, is, nevertheless, a conveyance \u201c made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>creditors,\u201d within the meaning of section 17 of the act relating to assignments and insolvent debtors, (S. &amp; C. 713 714 ; S. <em>&amp; </em>S. 397, 398,) and the general <em>prior </em>non-judgment or lien creditors of the grantor come in, <em>pro </em>rata, for their distributive share of the fund, with the plaintiff below and other judgment creditors. <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Street, </em>6 Watts, 247 ; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Mackall et al. </em>5 Ohio St. 121-124, 132, 133, 138 ; <em>Stanton et al. </em>v. <em>Keys et al. </em>14 Ohio St. 443 ; <em>Swasey </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>8 Ohio, 5, 20 ; <em>Ash </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>9 Ohio St. 383-387 ; 11 Ohio St. 1-13 ; 12 Ohio St. 139 -144 ; <em>Crumbaugh </em>v. <em>Kugler, </em>2 Ohio St. 373.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">The district court, in effect, held the conveyance to be <em>bad, </em>under the 2d section of the statute of frauds. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>1 Johns.

See Laws of 1859, p. 235, sec. 17, and <em>Stanton et al. </em>v. <em>Keys et al. </em>14 Ohio St. 443; 1 Am. Lead. Cas. (4th ed.) 42, note; 3 Johns.

Under the act of Feb. 12, 1863, (60 O. L. 8,) that fund should pass into the hands of the assignee for the benefit of all the creditors. This act embraces all classes of fraudulent conveyances. This conveyance was fraudulent within the meaning of the statute of frauds. The court found it so, to the extent of the $4,000, the fund in question. The fact that the fraud was found to bo constructive can make no difference.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">No notice having been given to the yther creditors, they had no day in court, and the proviso contained in sec. 17, act of 1863, has no application whatever, and the assignee is entitled to the fund.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-10\"><em>W. H. Safford </em>for McNally :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-11\">After the decree in the case, Jamison was, on the application of one of the creditors not embraced in the petition, appointed assignee, and now claims the fund by virtue of the statute. <em>S. &amp; </em>C. 713, sec. 17.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>To this we answer, that the statute only provides for cases where the conveyances are <em>absolutely </em>void, as against creditors, by reason of the conveyances having been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been <em>made with intent </em>to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. No such declaration has been made by the court in this case; on the contrary, the court declare that the conveyance <em>ivas not made with such </em>intent, but was constructively fraudulent by reason of the inadequacy of consideration. The conveyance-was not, therefore, void, but was permitted to stand, on payment of the value of the land as found by the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-5\">A distinction is to be observed between actual and com structive fraud. The statute contemplates cases of actual, fraud, and those only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-6\">A deed fraudulent <em>in fact </em>is absolutely void, and is not permitted to stand as security for any purpose of reimbursement or indemnity; <em>aliter, </em>where it is constructively fraudulent. <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>1 J. C. 478.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">Where a deed is sought to be set aside as voluntary and fraudulent as against creditors, and there is no sufficient evidence of fraud to induce the court to avoid it absolutely,, but there are suspicious circumstances as to the adequacy of the consideration and fairness of the transaction, the-court will not set aside the conveyance altogether, but will, permit it to stand as security for the sum actually paid. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">If actual fraud be not proved, the court will not set aside the title, but will either make it subservient to the equity of the case, or leave the party complaining to his remedy at law. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">This case is not embraced by the statute aforesaid ; and McNally, having first commenced proceedings, obtained priority, and is entitled to the fund as against Jamison, theassignee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b309-10\">White, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axe\">The first question in this case is, whether a conveyance made by a debtor, which is constructively fraudulent as to creditors, comes within the provisions- of the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>of February -L2, 1863, amending section 17 of the act of April 6, 1859, entitled, \u201can act regulating the mode of administering assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The original section provided that all transfers, conveyances or assignments made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, should inure to the equal benefit of all creditors, in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, and required the probate judge, after such transfer, conveyance, or assignment should have been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made with the intent aforesaid, on application of a creditor, to appoint an assignee, according to the provisions of the act, who, upon being duly qualified, was required to proceed, by due course of law, to recover possession of all property so transferred, conveyed or assigned, and to administer the same as in other cases of assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors. S. &amp; C. Stat. 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In <em>Thomas </em>v. Talmadge, (16 Ohio St. 437,) referring to the act regulating the mode of administering assignments, it was said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cUnder this act assignments in trust may be divided into three classes : First: Such as profess to be for the equal benefit of all the creditors, and where the terms of the assignment are such as to effect this object. Second : Such as are made in contemplation of insolvency, with intent to prefer one or more creditors. Third: All transfers and conveyances made with intent to defraud creditors, though no trust for the benefit of creditors may be designed or declared in making the transfer or conveyance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cThose of the first class harmonize with the provisions of the statute, and, if carried out in good faith, will necessarily effect a <em>pro rata </em>distribution of th\u00e9 assets among all the creditors. In the second class, the sixteenth section of the act defeats the preference sought to be created, and gives to the assignment the same legal operation as if its terms had been made in conformity with the first class. In cases falling within the third class, the seventeenth section, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>out respect to the intention of the parties, fastens a trust upon the property, and provides that the transfer or conveyance shall <em>inure, </em>not to the fraudulent grantee or assignee, but to the equal benefit of all creditors, in proportion to their respective claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The amendatory section is as follows: \u201c All transfers, conveyances, or assignments made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, shall be declared void at the suit of any creditor; and the probate judge of the proper county, after any such transfer, conveyance or assignment shall have been declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been made with the intent aforesaid, shall, on the application of any creditor, appoint an assignee, according to the provisions of this act, who, upon being duly qualified, shall proceed, by due course of law, to recover possession of all property so transferred, conveyed or assigned, and to administer the same as in other cases of assignment to trustees for the benefit of <em>creditors; provided, </em>however, that any creditor instituting a suit for the purpose aforesaid, shall cause notice of the pendency and object thereof to be published for at least four consecutive weeks in some newspaper printed, or of general circulation, in the county in which said suit shall be pending ; and all creditors who shall, within fifteen days next after the expiration of said notice, file an answer in said action, in the nature of a cross-petition, praying to be made parties thereto, and setting forth the nature and amount of their respective claims, and shall secure the payment of their <em>pro rata </em>share of the costs and expenses of such action, including reasonable counsel fees, in proportion to the amount of their said claims, either by a deposit of money, or by an undertaking given to the plaintiff in such sum and with such security as the court or clerk thereof shall require and approve, shall be first entitled, with the plaintiff, to the benefits of such transfer, conveyance or assignment, in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims; and after the costs and expenses aforesaid, and the claims of the aforesaid creditors shall have been paid by such assignee, the residue in his hands, if any, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>shall inure to the equal benefit of the remaining creditors, in proportion to the amount of their claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The original and amended sections were enacted in puisuance of the same general policy. By the original section the conveyance was made to inure to the equal benefit of all creditors. The only change effected by the amendatory section is to give to those instituting the suit, and such other creditors as become parties, a preference over the other creditors. But before such preference can be obtained, the-opportunity must be presented to all the creditors, of becoming parties, by giving them the required notice of the pendency aud object of the suit. It is true, the language of the proviso requiring the notice to be given seems to be imperative; but the obvious meaning is, that the notice is to be given in order to obtain the preference for which the-act provides, and that the only effect of not giving the notice is to leave the fund that may be recovered, to be administered as in other cases of assignments in trust for the-benefit of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The section, in terms, applies to all conveyances made with intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. The question raised by the record is, whether, in order to bring' a case within the operation of the section, the conveyance-must have been made with an <em>actual </em>intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The operation of the section is, in our opinion, as comprehensive as the power of the court to set aside conveyances, on the ground of their being made in fraud of the rights of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Parties are presumed to intend the natural consequences' of their own acts; and to the extent that a conveyance is found to work a fraud, to that extent is fraud presumed to-have been intended. If the intent exists, it is immaterial, under the statute, whether its existence is proved by evidence directly, or is to be inferred, as a matter of law, from the nature of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">The original decree in this case was rendered upon the principle recognized in equity, that when a conveyance is set aside as only constructively fraudulent, it is upheld in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>favor of one not guilty of any actual fraud, to the extent of the actual consideration, and is vacated only as to the excess. In the application of this principle the grantee may be decreed to be, as to such excess, a trustee for creditors. 1 Am. Lead. Cases, 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The object of the statute is to make all property con veyed in fraud of creditors subject to the payment of their just demands, upon the principle of equality, provided they take upon themselves, in the mode prescribed, equality of burden for its recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The remaining question is, whether the right to a preference, for which the statute provides, in the distribution of the funds realized by the suit, has been lost by the failure to give the notice which the statute requires, of the pendency and object of the suit. We think a fair construction of the statute requires this question to be answered in the affirmative. The rights of the parties become fixed by the decree which finally determines the fraudulent character of the conveyance. Where an assignee has been appointed, as was done in this case, he, as the representative of the creditors, becomes entitled to the fund, and it is made his duty \u201c to administer the same as in other cases of assignments to trustees for the benefit of creditors.\u201d If no assignee should be appointed, it would be competent for the court having jurisdiction of the funds and of the parties to direct the execution of the trust, and order distribution, as was held under the original section. <em>Oonrad </em>v. <em>Pancost, </em>11 Ohio St. 685. But after the suit has been prosecuted to a successful result, it seems to us it is too late for a party to gain the statutory preference over other creditors by publishing the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">But where such notice has not been given, the court, before ordering the funds to be paid over to the assignee appointed under the act, will provide for the payment of the costs and expenses of the creditor in prosecuting the suit by which the fund was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The order of the district court distributing the fund and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>dismissing the cross-petition of the assignee, is reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-5\">Welch, C.
