The indictment is founded on sec. XY of the act of April 12, 1858, \u201c to establish the-independent treasury of the State of Ohio.\u201d S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1610. The indictment avers that on the 17th October, 1870, Morton was treasurer of Richland township, in Logan county, charged, as such officer, with the collection, receipt, safekeeping, transfer and disbursement of the public money of the township, and that he embezzled and converted to his-own use certain money belonging to the township, that came to his hands as such treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-8\">On motion of the accused the common pleas .quashed the indictment, an the ground that there is no law authorizing such an indictment, and that the matters charged do not constitute a crime under any statute of this State. The State, on bill of exceptions, seeks to review this ruling of the common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b677-9\"><em>F. B.

That section provides \u201c That if any officer or other person charged with the collection, receipt, safe keeping, transfer or disbursement of the public money, or and part thereof, belonging to the State, or to any county, or township, or organized city or village in this State, shall convert to his own use <em>* * * </em>any portion of the public money <em>* * * </em>received, controlled or held by him for safe keeping, transfer or disbursement, <em>* * * </em>every such act shall be deemed and held in law to be an embezzlement of so much of the said moneys # * as shall be thus converted, used,\u201d &amp;c. We are of opinion that this provision embraces a township treasurer; and when the section is read, as it should be, in connection with section XX of the act of April 12, 1858, \u201c to provide for the better regulation of the receipt, disbursement and safe keeping of the public revenue,\u201d (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1602) making it the duty of the prosecuting attorney \u201cto prosecute <em>* * * </em>all violations of this act or the act to establish the independent treasury of the State of Ohio * # * by the treasurer of the county or <em>the treasurer of any township </em>in the county,\u201d there would seem to be no doubt but that the legislature intended that section XY of the latter act should embrace township treasurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">It follows, therefore, that the common pleas erred in iffi holdings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
