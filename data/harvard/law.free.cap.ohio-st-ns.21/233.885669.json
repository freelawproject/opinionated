The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count, but made no response to the second. The prisoner, by his counsel, inter, posed a motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial on the grounds : 1. That the verdict was not sustained by sufficient evidence ; and 2. That the verdict was contrary to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">The prosecuting attorney, after verdict, of his own motion and without the consent of the prisoner, entered a <em>nulle prosequi </em>on the count for grand larceny. Whereupon the court overruled the motion for a new trial and entered judgment on the verdict; to reverse which, the record is brought into this court, the prisoner assigning as grounds of reversal that the common pleas erred: 1. In overruling the motion for a new trial; and 2. In sentencing the prisoner on the verdict, it not being responsive to the several counts ot the indictment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-10\"><em>J.

From this, it appears, that the structure alleged to have been violated was originally erected for and had during many years been occupied as a \u201c still-ho use ;\u201d that, during the same time, there was operated therein a small pair Of burs for \u201c chopping corn, both for the distilling and for customers ; that it continued to bear its original designation, though in 1862, long before the time of the alleged breaking, the boiler used in distilling was removed, the machinery and presses severed from their connections, and the building permanently dismantled and abandoned as a \u201c still-house,\u201d with the distinct intention not to resume the business therein, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>it continued to be used as \u201c a mill for chopping corn\u201d for customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">This evidence is insufficient to sustain the verdict, and judgment of reversal must be entered on the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The statute defining burglary has regard to the substantive character of the structure in which it may be committed, and not to the name or designation it may have acquired. A building, though erected for, and occupied during many years as a still-house, ceases to be such when permanently dismantled and abandoned as a place of distillation. Its original designation does not determine its substantive character, in the sense of the crimes act. This must be ascertained from the nature of the uses to which the structure is appropriated at the time it is violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Judgment of reversal must, therefore, be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The prosecutor having entered a <em>nolle </em>on the count for larceny, it is out of the case, for which reason the second assignment of error has not been considered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-9\">Welch, C.
