Thereuiion a warrant was issued by the justice, and Jacobs-was arrested and brought before him, and the examination-required by the statute was had, and the complaint was-found by the justice to be true, and Jacobs was recognized, to appear and answer the complaint at the next term of the-court of common pleas, to be held in November, 1867. At that term, the child not having been born, the cause was continued until the March term, 1868, and Jacobs renewed his-recognizance. Between the terms, to wit, January 27th, 1868, the complainant intermarried with Ludwig <em>W. </em>Dilg\u00bb Afterward, at the March term, 1868, of the common pleas, on motion of the complainant, her husband was joined with-her as a party plaintiff; and, on motion of Jacobs, the complaint was dismissed on the ground of said marriage and that the child had not yet been born; and judgment was-entered against her for costs. The plaintiff took exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>to the dismissal of the cause, and filed her petition in erroi in the district court, and assigned the dismissal as error. The cause was reserved in the district court for decision here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b655-5\"><em>W. W.

The subsequent marriage of the complainant cannot relieve the father of the child from this liability, unless, in consequence of such marriage, the child, if born alive, would not be a bastard. That is not the necessary effect of the marriage upon the question of the legitimacy of the child, for it cannot be conclusively presumed that the man who marries a pregnant woman is the father of the child with which she is pregnant. He may not have known that she was in that condition when he married her. And even if he did know it, he may not be the father of the child. It <em>may, </em>therefore, if born alive, be a bastard. Notwithstanding the marriage, the question remained, whether the defendant was the lather of the child or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In such cases the public is interested in having that question determined, so that the father of the child, if born alive, may be charged with its maintenance, as provided in the bastardy act, and the public be exempted from that expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The order of dismissal must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
