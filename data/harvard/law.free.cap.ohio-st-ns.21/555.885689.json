In such case, the incorporated company, if located within this State, is relieved from the duty imposed by the 16th section of said act of 1859, (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1446) of listing its interest in such unincorporated company, by virtue of the 9th clause of the 3d section, which provides that \u201cno person shall be required to include in his statement, as a part of the personal property, moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stock, joint stock companies, or otherwise, which he is required to list, any share or portion of the capital stock or <em>property </em>of any company or corporation which is required to list or return its capital stock or property for taxation in this State.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b563-7\">4.

A motion for a new trial was made by the plaintiffs and was overruled, and a bill of exceptions taken containing all the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The principal error now relied upon is, that the district court erred in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 petition and rendering judgment in favor of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-5\">Some of the plaintiffs are incorporated companies, orga. nized under, the laws of Ohio, doing business in the State of Ohio; others are incorporated companies organized under the laws of the State of West Virginia, doing business in the State of West Virginia. Valentine B. Horton, one of the plaintiffs, is a citizen of the State of Ohio. They are all engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling salt.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-6\">In their petition the plaintiffs set forth in substance the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-7\">The several plaintiffs, in order to faciltate the selling and shipping of salt manufactured by them respectively, appointed certain agents for that purpose, but subject to the direction and control of the plaintiffs. For the purpose of keeping proper accounts, and regulating expenditures, the agency was called the Ohio River Salt Company. After this agency was created, several of the plaintiffs associated themselves with the companies who originized the agency, and for like purposes, and with them beuame principals of the agency, and owners of the personal property mentioned in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-8\">In the prosecution of business by means of this agency, it became necessary for the plaintiffs to own a large number of flat boats, barges, and other personal property. This property was owned in common by the plaintiffs, but in different proportions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-9\">All the plaintiffs, except the Excelsior Salt Company, located in the county of Meigs, were taxed upon their respective shares in the joint property. Such of the plaintiffs as are companies located in Mason county, West Virginia, were there taxed for the years 1865 and 1866, and not subjected to tax in Meigs county, Ohio. The Excelsior Salt Company listed its interest in the joint property for taxation in the year 1866. For the year 1865, through the advice of the auditor of Meigs county, the Excelsior company failed to list its interest in the joint property for taxation, but should have so listed $3,640.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>At the times of listing personal property for taxation in Meigs county, for the year 1865, and 1866, the assessor returned, in the name of the Ohio River Salt Company for taxation, a valuation of $26,000 for the year 1865 ; and a valuation of $27,000 for the year 1866, to which a penalty of $13,800 was added. These returns of the assessor are averred to have been wrongful and unauthorized by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-5\">It is also averred that the defendant, the county treasurer, well knowing that the Ohio River Salt Company was none other than the agency described, on the 17th of January, 1867, distrained, for the payment of the taxes and penalties assessed against it, certain property of the plaintiffs, and had advertised and intended to sell the same, in the name of the Ohio River Salt Company; and that if he should do so, the plaintiffs would be taxed double on the same property. Wherefore an injunction is prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-6\">The defendant answered, in substance :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-7\">1. That the Ohio River Salt Company is not a mere agency of the plaintiffs, but is a joint stock company, distinct, in name and character, from the several plaintiffs, and does business, in its own name, shipping and selling salt; and is composed of several individuals associated together, having a president, directors, and managing agent, and constituted for the object of shipping and selling salt, under the name and style of such company ; and has so held and still holds itself out to the business community and the world. That, in order to carry out the object of the company, it necessarily had, at the time the tax mentioned in the petition was assessed, and still has, flat-boats, barges and other personal property, controlled by the agents of the company ; and that, at the time the tax was assessed in Meigs county, in the years 1865 and 1866, the property assessed was subject to be listed, in that county, as the property of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-8\">2. That the property thus taxed, and the property dis-trained to pay the tax, belonged to the Ohio River Salt Company, separate and distinct from the property of the plaintiffs or either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-9\">3. That if the several plaintiffs were interested in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>pany at the time of the levy of the tax and the distraint of the property, it was subject to the control of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-5\"><em>4. </em>That the taxes for the years 1865 and 1866 levied against the company, were legally assessed ; and that neither the taxes nor penalty had been paid, but were due and payable at the time of the distraint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">5. That if the Ohio River Salt Company was the mere agent of the plaintiffs, still it should have listed the property in its possession and under its control, for the years 1865 and 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-7\">6. That neither of the plaintiffs had listed and paid the tax on their individual shares in the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-8\">7. That the plaintiffs were notified by the auditor of Meigs county not to list their stock in the Ohio River Salt Company for taxation, and that he had received instructions from the auditor of state to have the property of the com\u2022pany listed in its name, and that the property of the company should be so listed and taxed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-9\">On the trial the plaintiffs, to maintain the issue on their part, offered the following evidence, and it was all the evidence offered :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-10\">\n<em>The Record of the Ohio River Salt Company.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-11\">\u201cAt a meeting of the delegates of the salt companies on the Ohio river, held at the Ohio River Salt Company\u2019s office, Coalport, Ohio, July 31, 1857, the following salt companies were represented : Dabney Salt Co., by Y.

To transport this salt to market the plaintiffs purchased quite a large number of barges, lines and other equipment, which property is scattered and used on the Ohio, Mississippi, Cumberland and Illinois rivers. This property is never all of it in this State, county or township, and but a small portion of it is ever in this county at one time, and especially so in the spring, when heavy shipments are made, which happens to be the time for listing property for taxation. Over one-third of this property is now owned in the State of West Virginia. At the time of year when property is listed for taxation, a valuation of this property is made out <em>pro rata </em>to each plaintiff \u2014 each plaintiff listing and paying their own tax, except the Excelsior Salt Company, in 1865, who were induced not to list their portion, through the influence of the county auditor. This property is not owned or claimed to be owned by these agents. They use it under the control of and direction of the plaintiffs who are the sole and exclusive owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b570-5\">\u201cI am secretary and treasurer and managing agent of the Ohio River Salt Company. Furnaces located partly in Mason county, West Virginia, and partly in Meigs county, Ohio. Home office of Ohio River Salt Company, was located in Coalport, Meigs county, Ohio, for the reason that inside there each Salt Company has a representative or member in Ohio River Salt Company to direct agency. Property used by Ohio River Salt Company consists of barges, lines, &amp;c., bought by the Ohio River Salt Company, and assessment made on each company for <em>pro rata </em>when necessary to pay the same. The property in 1865 listed for taxation, by making aggregate estimate of all the property, and dividing to each in proportion to quantity of salt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>furnished Ohio River Salt Company by each. In this way all the property used by Ohio River Salt Company is listed for taxation. The name \u2018 Ohio River Salt Company \u2019 was adopted merely for convenience in managing and carrying on joint business of selling salt manufactured by all the plaintiffs. All contracts for sales of salt made in the name of the \u2018Ohio River Salt Company;\u2019 all purchases made by the same. We make no purchases only such as are incident to and necessary to carry on the business of shipping and selling salt, except the purchase of some salt prior to and since 1865.

By whom ? In whose name ? And in what district ? These are the questions in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">That the Ohio River Salt Company had an existence, and management, and that it was the agency by which the plaintiffs\u2019 salt was transported to market and sold, are undisputed facts. But in order to arrive at proper answers to the above questions, it is necessary to understand the mode and means in and by which the company was formed, organized and managed, as well as the nature and extent of its agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The Ohio River Salt Company, was established by the plaintiffs, and they constitute its sole membership. This is evident from the articles of association, which is the fundamental law of the company. The preamble &amp;c. is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201c For the purpose of insuring system and <em>unity </em>of action in the disposition of salt, <em>the undersigned manufacturers </em>of salt agreed to form themselves into an association, and have adopted the following article.- :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201c Article 1st. \u2014 The association shall be called the Ohio River Salt Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">\u201c Art. 2d. \u2014 The business of the company shall be the shipping, transportation and sale of the salt made by the members of the association, and the company may, if deemed for its interest, buy such salt from others than members of the association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c Art. 3d. \u2014 Salt manufacturers may become members of this association by subscribing these articles, binding themselves to deliver all the salt made by them, and to conform to all the rules made in pursuance of the provisions of these articles, as to the delivery of salt, cooperage, and general conduct of the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The members of the board of directors are not members of the company, but only representatives of the plaintiffs in the management of its affairs, as appears from the 4th article of the constitution of the association, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c Art. 4th. \u2014 The board of directors shall be chosen annually in the following manner, to wit: Each salt company being a member of this association shall elect a delegate to represent its interest and to act as a member of the board of directors. The persons so chosen shall constitute the board of directors of this association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The board of directors was not invested with authority over the individual property or affairs of the members of the association, but only with authority to organize and regulate the company and its business in detail, to appoint agents for the company and fix their compensation, and through such agents to transact all its business, aud to do whatever in the opinion of the board was necessary to carry out most advantageously the objects of the association, as prescribed in the fifth article :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u201c Art. 5th. \u2014 The board of directors shall elect one of their members as president, and shall appoint a suitable and competent person as secretary and treasurer. The board of directors shall keep a set of books and records in which they shall cause to be entered and recorded, in an appropriate and business like manner, all their appointments, rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>business transactions; and these books shall at all proper times be open to the inspection of such persons or their agents as shall be interested therein. And the said board shall have power to make rules for the conduct of the business of the association, including mode and time for receiving salt, inspection of quality, mode of settling with manufacturers, and inspection of cooperage, to appoint agents, fix their compensation, and through such agents and under such rules as they may prescribe, shall have power to transact all the business of this company, and to do whatever may be necessary in the opinion of the board to carry out most advantageously the objects of this association.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">\u201cA quorum shall consist of such members as represent a majority of the manufacturing companies composing this association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On the 31st day of July, 1857, the delegates chosen by the members of the company met and organized the board of directors, and on the following day adopted rules and regulations for the management of the business of the company ; \u25a0established a home office on the Ohio river, in Miegs county, Ohio, and constituted the secretary and treasurer of the company the principal or managing agent of the company, and placed him in charge of the home office.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The Ohio River Salt Company, thus constituted, bought a large number of boats, barges, lines, &amp;c., in its own name, to be used in the shipment of plaintiffs\u2019 salt; appointed agents at Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis, &amp;c., to whom the salt was shipped, and by whom it was sold. These sub-agents made monthly returns to the managing agent at the home office. The company receives all the salt made by its members, and, after shipment and sale, divides the proceeds, less the expenses, among the members of the company <em>pro rata </em>according to the number of bushels of salt delivered by each to the company. All purchases and contracts are made in the name of the company. All the hands are hired, directed and paid by it. The members of the company cannot individually control the property used by the company. Notes are executed by the company in its own name, and are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>taken and endorsed in the same way. Suits are prosecuted and defended by the company, using however the names of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Such is a substantia] description of the formation, organization, management and businness of the Ohio River Salt Company. And the question now is, whether the boats, barges, lines, &amp;c., used by it in the management of its business have been properly and legally listed and taxed in its name, and in the district of its home office, in which its managing agent resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">It is claimed by the plaintiffs that this property can only be listed and taxed by and in their, names respectively ; that is, that the interest of each member of the company in this property, should be listed and taxed in the name of such member, and in the taxing district where the other personal property of such member is rightfully listed and taxed. And this proposition is sought to be maintained principally upon the ground, that the Ohio River Salt Company is not a corporation or a copartnership, and therefore can not be required, under the 4th section of the tax law of April 5, 1859, as amended April 8, 1865, (S. <em>&amp; </em>S. 756,) to list its property for taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The 4th section provides, that \u201c Every person <em>* * * </em>shall list * * * the personal property of which he is the owner,\u201d &amp;c.; and that \u201cthe property * * * of every <em>company, firm, </em>body politic or corporate\u201d shall be listed \u201cby the president or principal accounting officer, partner or agent thereof. * * * Every person required to list property on behalf of others * * * shall list it in the same township in which he would be required to list, if such property was his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Now, although \u201c company\u201d may well be said to embrace a \u201c firm,\u201d yet we think it was used in this connection in a more comprehensive sense, for there are many unincoporated bodies which are not, strictly speaking, copartnerships, that own personal property subject to taxation under the laws of this State. And, no doubt, the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>embrace all such within the meaning of \u201c company,\u201d though they be not \u201c firms \u201d or copartnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We are not called upon, therefore, to determine whether or not the Ohio River Salt Company is a corpartnership, in the technical meaning of that term, but simply to ascertain if it be a \u201c company\u201d owning property subject to taxation within the meaning of said 4th section.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Passing for a moment from the question of ownership in this company. It is claimed by the plaintiffs that if this property is subject to taxation in the name of the Ohio River Salt Company, under the provisions of the 4th section, it must nevertheless be listed, in fractional parts or shares, by the plaintiffs, or so many of them as are corporations in this State, under the provisions of the 16th section of the act of 1859 ; and thus double taxation is the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">If it should be determined that the language used in the 16th section (which describes the property certain corporations are required to list) is broad enough to include the plaintiffs and the interest they have in this property, still, we apprehend they would be relieved from double taxation, as would a natural person, under the provisions of the ninth clause of the 3d section, S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 1441, which provides as follows: \u201cNo person shall be required to include in his statement, as a part of the personal property, moneys, credits, investments in bonds, stocks, joint stock companies or otherwise, which he is required to list, any share or portion of the capital stock or property of any company or corporation which is required to list or return its capital and property for taxation in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">Returning then, to the question of the ownership of these boats and barges. We admit the general rule, that part owners of boats and vessels are tenants in common, and not joint tenants; yet it does not follow that such boats and vessels cannot be acquired and held jointly, as, for instance, by a partnership, or other joint company, whether incorporated or unincorporated. And in either case, there is no doubt that the stockholders, or members of the company, have au equitable interest in the property, as it must be regarded as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u2022owned and held in trust for them by the company ; nevertheless the ownership in the company is such, that, under \u2022our system, the property must be listed and taxed in the name of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">With regard to the salt delivered by each of the plaintiffs to the Ohio River Salt Company, it may be, as claimed by plaintiffs, a case of mandate, a bailment without reward, for shipment and sale, wherein no special property or interest is acquired in the subject of the mandate, by the mandatory ; and, hence, each manufacturer should list, with its \u25a0or his other personal property the salt so owned by it or him, although in the possession and custody of the bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">But these questions are not before us for decision. We \u25a0can only enquire, in this case, as to the relations of these parties to the boats, barges, lines, <em>&amp;c. </em>This distinction, .however, must be observed, viz.: that there has been no <em>delivery </em>of this last-named property to the Ohio River'Salt Company by the plaintiffs, either jointly or separately,\u2014 neither actually nor constructively. Now, delivery is' \u2022of the very essence of the bailment, and without which the relation of bailor and bailee does not exist. As to these boats and barges, therefore, the case of a mandate does not \u2022arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">It is true, that this property was purchased with the plaintiffs' money, either directly or indirectly, and, therefore, a trust results, under the circumstances, in their favor. But this is so in all cases of corporations and copartnerships, \u2022and we can see no reason why the ownership should be regarded as a tenancy in common in one case, more than in the other ; and in the latter it is quite clear that the ownership is joint only.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">This property is not purchased nor held in the names of the plaintiffs, nor is it subject to their individual control. In every sense of the word, there is a joint interest and ownership in this property as between the <em>plaintiffs; </em>that \u2022each holds <em>per my et per tout, </em>\u2014 the legal title being in the Ohio River Salt Company, coupled with a right to use and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>control the property for all the purposes of the trust or agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Nor do we see any want of capacity in the plaintiffs,, although they be corporations, to enter into this joint enterprise, there being no departure, in the line of its business, from the scope of their corporate powers, to wit, to make- and sell salt. But even if it were so, that they, as corporations, lacked power to enter into this joint enterprise, it is exceedingly doubtful whether they, in their corporate names,, should be permitted, as against the State of Ohio, to resist taxation in such form as would undoubtedly be proper, had. their powers been co-extensive with their purposes and actual dealings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Again, it is said that this property is seldom in the State-of Ohio, and never all at the same time ; that it is as much in the State of West Virginia, where a large interest in it. is owned, as in this State; that in transporting plaintiffs\u2019 salt to distant markets, it is chiefly used in navigating the. Tennessee, Illinois, Wabash and other rivers, not within nor; bordering upon the State of Ohio ; but that the interests-owned in this State are held by parties subject to taxation in different districts. It is therefore claimed to be unjust,- and not within the meaning and intent of our statute, that the .whole amount of the property should be taxed in one locality and subjected to its local burdens, while other localities equally interested in the property are wholly deprived, of the benefits of its taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">In reply to these arguments it is sufficient to say that we must be controlled in this matter by the legislative will, when expressed within the limits of legislative power. In. <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Terence, </em>8 Ohio, 521, it was held, under the statute then in force, that steamboats owned by citizens of this State and employed in navigating waters within or bordering upon the State, were property subject, within the legislative discretion, to taxation in this State, although also -used in other waters neither within nor bordering upon the-State ; and that it was subject to taxation in the place where; the owners resided. Like statutes are still in force.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>We have already shown that the boats in question were owned by the Ohio River Salt Company \u2014 an association organized in this State, with its principal office in this State, at Middleport, on the Ohio river, and in the district where they were taxed, at which place the managing agent of the company also resided. It appears to us, then, that Middle-port must be regarded as the home port of these boats\u2014 the place where the owners thereof resided within the meaning of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">If citizens or corporations of one taxing district invest their means and become members of a company which by law is required to list its property in another district, they have no right to complain. And if non-residents or foreign corporations become interested in property situate in this State in like manner, it is competent for the legislature to impose its burdens of .taxation upon such property in the district where it is situated and controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">On the whole case, although not free from difficulty, we are of opinion that the boats, barges, lines, &amp;c., used by the Ohio River Salt Company were lawfully taxed in the name of the company in the taxing district where its home office was located, and in which its managing agent resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-8\">Welch, C. J., and White, Day and West, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
