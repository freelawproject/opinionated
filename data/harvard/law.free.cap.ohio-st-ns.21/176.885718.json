A party having such interest and possession, in his written application for insurance on the property, answered questions propounded in the application, as follows : Question \u2014 \u201c Is the property owned and operated by the-applicant ? \u201d Answer \u2014 \" Xes.\u201d Question \u2014 \" Is any other person interested in the property ?

The defence set up was that McCulloch, the party assured, had, in his written application for the policy, made false representations, or a false warranty, as to his interest in the property insured. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">The property was a building, with machinery therein, situate upon a lot in Berea, which McCulloch had lately purchased of the owner, but for which he had received no conveyance. He had purchased the property at $2,000, and had paid but $500, the remaining $1,500 not being due. He was in possession, and held the vendor\u2019s written contract, for a deed, to be executed when the purchase money should be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">By the terms of the policy the written application of the assured was made a part of the policy. The form of application contained various questions to be answered, by the applicant, and, among others, the following : (1.) \u201cIs the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>perty owned and operated by the applicant ? \u201d (2.) \u201c Is any other person interested in the property ? If so, state the interest.\u201d (3.) \u201c Incumbrance \u2014 Is there any on the property ? If mortgaged, state to whom ; is there any insurance by the mortgagee ? \u201d To the first of these questions the applicant answered \u201c Yes ; \u201d to the second he answered \u201cNo;\u201d and to the third his answer was, \u201cHeld by contract.\u201d Immediately following the questions and answers is this provision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">\u201c And the said applicant hereby covenants and agrees to and with the said company, that the foregoing is a just, full and true exposition of all the facts and circumstances in regard to the condition, situation and value of the property to be insured, as far as the same are known to the applicant, and material to the risk; and the same is hereby made a condition of the insurance and warranty on the part of the-insured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">Upon these facts the court of common pleas held that the policy was avoided by the false representations, or false warranty, contained in the application, and gave judgment for the company. The district court, upon a petition in error filed by McCulloch, reversed this judgment; and now, to reverse the judgment of the district court, a petition in error is filed here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>E.

The insured misrepresented his interest in the risk to be assumed, by representing himself to be the owner of the property to be insured, and that no other person was interested in it, thus violating the covenant in the application, as well as the conditions of the policy.

The vendor, who contracted to convey to the insured, had a lien on or interest in the property equal to the consideration money unpaid ; and so it was not true that no person other than the insured had an interest in the property.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>G. M. Barter </em>and <em>8- J. Andrews </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-7\">The insured was the owner of the property. He had bought and paid for it, and was in possession under his purchase. He had paid part in money and the remainder in his agreement to pay, and the vendor held the legal title as security for the payment of the unpaid portion of the purchase money ; and this state of facts is fully disclosed in the answers given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">The questions and answers taken together do not, when properly interpreted, mean that he held the property by a <em>paid up contract. </em>As to incumbrance, the answer that he <em>11 held ty </em>contract,\u201d is an express statement that the contract .is an incumbrance. 2 Greenl. Ev. 242 ; 4 Mass. 630 ; 2 Greenl. 22 ; 22 Pick. 447. The answer thus given is not very full, it is true, but it discloses the fact that there was \u2022an incumbrance; and if the company saw fit to make the .policy without making any further inquiry, they cannot now \u25a0complain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">\u201c Is any other person interested in the property ? If so, \u25a0state the interest.\u201d Answer \u2014 \u201c No.\u201d This question and answer are to be taken and construed in connection with all \u25a0the others. Thus taken and construed, the meaning is, that .as to the ownership held by him, it is held by contract, \u2022which is an incumbrance, and no other person is interested. The answer was true.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-10\">It was the right of the insurance company to refuse to write <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the policy until more full and explicit answers were given, but if they saw fit to write it, when any of the questions they had put were unanswered, or the answers to any were incomplete, as long as the insured answered truly, as far as he did answer, and as far as he understood the questions, and made no concealment, it is their own fault, and they cannot take advantage of their own negligence. They thought the application good enough to take the premium on; it ought therefore to be good .enough, now a loss has occurred, to pay on. 1 Allen, 63 ; 6 Gray, 185 ; 5 Gray, 384, 389 ; 7 Gray, 261; 1 Allen, 301; 29 Conn. 10; 18 Pick. 419; 10 Cush. 540 ; 2 Duer on Ins. 662 ; 10 Pick. 535, 40 ; 30 Pa. 282.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-5\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">It is, perhaps, not seriously denied, that the interest of the defendant in error in the property was an insurable interest. That it was such, we have no doubt. The ground relied upon for the avoidance of the policy is an alleged breach of warranty, consisting in the fact that the answers given to the questions contained in the written application were not full answers, and also in the fact that they were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In regard to the former ground of objection, it seems to us sufficient to say, that 'the receipt of the application, and the issuance of the policy thereupon, was a waiver of the questions in so far as they remained unanswered, and that the policy .cannot, therefore, be avoided by the company on the ground that the answers are not full. The objection should have been made at the time of the receipt of the premium, and the issuance of the policy, or not at all. Had further answers been insisted upon at that time, the applicant would doubtless have given them. To receive his premium, and issue the policy upon the answers as given, and afterward avoid the policy on the ground that the answers were not full, would be to practice a virtual fraud upon the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">But are the answers fals.e ? We think not. Taken together, and construed as a whole, they are substantially true. To the question whether he owned the property, the assured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>answers, \u201c Yesto the question whether any other person has an interest in it, he answers, \u201cNo ;\u201d and to the question whether there are any incumbrances upon it, he answers that it is \u201c held by contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It is contended that, even admitting the interest of the defendant to be an insurable interest, and that the title of a purchase by mere contract is sufficient to justify a warranty of ownership, yet these answers are false, because they do not disclose the tact that there was a <em>lien </em>for unpaid purchase money, but oil the contrary allege that no other person has an interest in the property. The three answers, it is said, can only be reconciled, and sustained as true, upon the theory that the purchase money had been all paid, and that the equitable title of the defendant was thus made-complete. We do not so understand the answers. The answer which sets forth that the property was \u201cheld by contract,\u201d is made in response to the question whether there was any \u201c incumbrances \u201d upon the property. We think it was fairly to be inferred from this answer, made in this connection, that there was such an incumbrance as usually exists in such cases, namely, a <em>lien </em>in favor, of the vendor for purchase money. Substantially, the answers amount to this : \u201c The property is held by contract of purchase merely, and is subject to no incumbrance except what that description of ownership implies ; I am the owner of that title ; and I am the sole owner.\u201d Understood in this sense, the answers are substantially in accordance with the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-8\">Scott, C.
