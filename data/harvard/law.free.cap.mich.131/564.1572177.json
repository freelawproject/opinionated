Miller and John A. Miller upon a promissory note. Erom a judgment for plaintiff, defendants bring error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AtB\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">This suit is brought upon a promissory note for $4,045, dated December 30,1899, with defendant Isabella as maker and defendant John as indorser. With the plea of the general issue defendant gave notice that she was the wife of her codefendant, and that said note was for money obtained for his individual use. The defendants are husband and wife. Isabella owned property in her own right to the amount of about $15,000. In 1892 she borrowed $200 of the plaintiff, for which she- gave her individual note. It was renewed from time to time, and payments made until the amount was reduced to $145. In February, 1893, she obtained a loan from the bank of $1,000, for which she gave her note. When she applied for the-loan, the cashier informed her that some security would be required, and spoke to her about procuring the indorsement of Mr. Miller.\" She stated that she did not like to ask him, but she brought a note signed by herself, with Mr. Miller\u2019s indorsement, and obtained the money at the bank. This note also was renewed from time to time. John A. Miller also had individual notes at the bank. All these notes were, on November 18, 1896, consolidated into a single note for $4,070, signed by her and indorsed by him. This was renewed from time to time, interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>and small payments made until December 30, 1899, the date of the note in suit. The court directed a verdict for plaintiff for the amount of $145, which was a part of the consideration of the note in suit, holding that it was Mrs. Miller\u2019s personal matter. He left it to the jury to determine whether, under the proofs, the $1,000 was obtained upon representations by Mrs. Miller that it pertained to her separate estate. Upon this point the jury found for the plaintiff. The judge instructed the jury that defendant Isabella was not liable for the balance of the note. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff for $1,287.35.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-5\"><em>W. J. Turner (S. H.

Plaintiff made its <em>prima facie </em>case by introducing the note in evidence. Defendants thereupon moved the court to direct a verdict for the defendants on the ground that the plea and notice showed that the defendants were husband and wife, and the duty rested upon the plaintiff to prove such a consideration as would bind her. Upon its face the note was hers, and it imported a consideration paid to her. It was indorsed by her husband. There was no presumption against the legality of such a note. The burden rested upon the defendant to prove facts which would relieve her from liability. The motion was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">2. The defendants then entered into the merits of the controversy, and testimony was taken; the cashier of the bank and Mr. and Mrs. Miller giving testimony. The cashier gave the following testimony in regard to the transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201cMrs. Miller came and asked me if she could borrow a thousand dollars from the bank. I says, \u2018 What on ? \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>and she says, \u2018 On my note.\u2019 I says, \u2018 On what security ? \u2019 She says, \u2018Ain\u2019t .my note good ? \u2019 I says, \u2018 I presume it is, Mrs. Miller, but we are in the habit of having some collateral security or indorser on notes of any size.\u2019 \u2018Why,\u2019 she. says, \u2018you didn\u2019t ask me for any security on that $200.\u2019 I said, \u2018That was a small amount, and I knew you were all right; but I think on an amount of this size our people would want some security.\u2019 She says, \u2018 I don\u2019t know what security to give you; haven\u2019t any to give you that you would take.\u2019 I says, \u2018 Could you give us an indorser ? \u2019 She says, \u2018 I don\u2019t know who to ask to indorse.\u2019 I says, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Mr. Miller indorse for you ?\u2019 She says, \u2018 I presume he would if I would ask him, but don\u2019t want to ask him to indorse my note.\u2019 I took her application down on the book without indorser, and says: \u2018 If you want me to submit your application in this shape, will submit it, but am afraid our people will not take it. Think Mr. Miller would not hesitate to indorse the note, and, if he would, thinkthey would take it.\u2019 She says, \u2018You may put it down with Mr. Miller\u2019s name;\u2019 and I put it down, and it was passed upon by tbe committee favorably. The note is dated on the 24th of February, 1893, the same date of the application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">He further testified that he relied upon her statements in making the loan, and understood that .the money was obtained for her separate estate. Mrs. Miller did not deny this testimony of the cashier. She did not tell the cashier that the money was for her husband. If she obtained the money representing that it was for herself individually, and for her separate estate, she will not be heard to defend on the ground that her husband persuaded her to take this course, and to obtain the money for him. She herself testified that she was under no threats or coercion. It is evident from her own testimony that she gave the cashier to understand that she was acting in her individual capacity, and desired the money for her own use in regard to her separate estate. We think the court committed no error in leaving the question to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">3. Conversations which took place between the defendants were incompetent, since no attempt was made to show that they were either in the presence of, or were communicated to, the cashier of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>4. The court allowed a wide latitude to the plaintiff in inquiring into, the business relations between the defendants, and the amount of property and extent of business carried on by each. We think the case was one justifying such inquiry, and that the court committed no error in admitting such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b622-6\">Hooker, O. J., Moore and Montgomery, JJ., concurred.^.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
