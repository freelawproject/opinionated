Said bond and mortgage provided that Peterson should keep all buildings on the premises insured, and make the loss, if any, payable to the association as its interest might appear.</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\" pgmap=\"574\">There was $2,000 due and unpaid on said bond and mortgage at the time of the trial. March 23, 1893, the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, by William M. Martin,'its agent at Hegewisch, issued to and in the name of Peterson its policy of insurance whereby it insured the dwelling house situated on said premises against loss by lire to the amount of $1,700 for the term of three years from March 24, 1893, for a premium of $18, which sum Peterson then paid to Martin and took his receipt, as such agent, therefor.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\" pgmap=\"574\">Peterson instructed Martin to deliver the policy to said association, who received and held it as additional security for said loan until August 8, 1893, when Martin (who had failed to pay said premium to the defendant and who had been ordered by .the defendant to cancel said policy) went to the office of the association and told its secretary, to whom he had originally delivered the policy, that the Hartford Company had ordered said policy canceled and asked him for it, and, upon receiving it from the secretary, delivered it to the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, and on the back of it, made this memorandum: \u201cCanceled and issued back August 8, 1893.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\" pgmap=\"574\">The Hartford Fire Insurance Company never in any way notified Andrew Peterson of their intended cancellation of said policy, nor that they had canceled it, until after the destruction of said dwelling, and they never returned or tendered any part of the premium that he had paid them for the policy.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\" pgmap=\"574(48) 575(42)\">August 26, 1893, said Martin, as agent of the Fireman\u2019s Insurance Company, issued and delivered to said secretary a policy of insurance whereby the latter company purported to insure Andrew Peterson against loss by fire to the amount of $1,700 on said dwelling house for the term of three years from August 26, 1893, the premium on which policy was never paid for by Peterson or said association, and Peterson never ordered the policy and never knew it had been issued until after the destruction of the house by fire.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-4\" pgmap=\"575\">October 5, 1893, said house, which was then worth $1,700 and still owned by said Peterson, was, without his fault, totally destroyed by fire, and Martin, the agent that issued said policies, was present at the fire.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-5\" pgmap=\"575\">October 17, 1893, Peterson signed and served the following written notice upon the Hartford Fire Insurance Company:</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-6\" pgmap=\"575\">\u201c Please take notice that the dwelling situated on lot 68, block 32, Calumet and Chicago Canal and Dock Company\u2019s Addition to Hegewisch, was totally destroyed by fire October 5,1893, at 11 o\u2019clock p.m., insured in your company as policy 958, issued by your agent, W. M. Martin, March 24, 1893. My notice would have been given you earlier but that your agent, W. M.

Neither said association nor any of its agents knew of, authorized or ratified the statement signed by Peterson on the back of said notice.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\" pgmap=\"576\">Each insurance company claimed that the other company \u2022was the only one legally responsible for said loss, and each refused and failed to pay any part of the same.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576\">On the same day that the suit was commenced against the Hartford Fire Insurance Company,suit was also brought in the same court in the name of the same plaintiff for the use of the same beneficiary against the Fireman\u2019s Insurance Company for the recovery of insurance under its policy for loss on the same house, which latter suit is still pending and undetermined.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\" pgmap=\"576\">The secretary of said association never received any direction from the board of directors, or president or other officer, to surrender or deliver the Hartford policy or to accept the Fireman\u2019s policy.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-7\" pgmap=\"576\">The slip attached to said Hartford policy permits other insurance, and said policy contains the usual printed clauses, and among others the following:</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-8\" pgmap=\"576\">\u201c This policy shall be canceled at any time at the request of the insured, or by the company giving five days\u2019 notice of such cancellation.

Co. v. McKenzie, 70 Ill. App. 615.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b578-10\" pgmap=\"578\">\u201c When the policy provides that the * * * insurer may, any time, at its option, cancel it, on giving notice to that effect, and paying a ratable proportion of the premium for the unexpired term, payment of the unearned premium is essential to absolve the company from liability under the policy; and although the policy has been surrendered to the company, yet if the unearned premium has not been paid until after a\"loss, the company is liable for the loss, and this, even though the assured after the loss, but in ignorance of it, accepts the balance of premium due him for the unexpired term. * * *</blockquote> <p id=\"b578-11\" pgmap=\"578(31) 579(26)\">The policy is not canceled until the unearned premium is actually received by the assured or his agent; and if, after he receives notice to return the policy for cancellation, he sends it to the insurer, but before he receives the return premium, a loss occurs, the insurer is liable therefor.\u201d Wood on Fire Ins., Sec. 113.</p> <p id=\"b579-4\" pgmap=\"579\">The circumstance that the mortgagee, for whose use this suit was brought, consented to the cancellation of the policy, can not be held to deprive the assured of his right. Peterson, the assured, had no knowledge or notice of the action of the mortgagee, or the insurance company, until after the fire had occurred and his property became destroyed, and it would be a most harsh doctrine to hold that somebody else might surrender his rights without knowledge on his part or notice of any kind to him.</p> <p id=\"b579-5\" pgmap=\"579\">The contract of insurance was with Peterson. His rights were fixed by that contract, and he could not be deprived of them without his consent, except in the manner provided by the contract.</p> <p id=\"b579-6\" pgmap=\"579\">The mortgage clause became a part of the contract, but its effect, so far as questions here involved are concerned, was no more than to give to the mortgagee the right to receive from the insurance company whatever loss or damage Peterson might sustain under the policy. Ho right existed in the mortgagee under the mortgage clause to cancel the policy, and thus abrogate and destroy Peterson\u2019s contract with the insurance company, and any attempted accomplishment of such result by the mortgagee was entirely ineffectual as against Peterson.</p> <p id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579(135) 580(44)\">The policy not being rightfully canceled, it remained in full force and effect, and was in law, at the time the fire occurred, just as effectual to maintain a suit upon as though it had always remained in Peterson\u2019s hands. And such suit was properly brought in the name of Peterson for the use of the mortgagee, to whom the loss was made payable for Peterson\u2019s account. Although it be that both Peterson and the mortgagee had separate insurable interests in the property covered by the policy, yet, the only interest that was insured being that of Peterson, the mortgagor, a suit in his name for the use of the mortgagee, to whom the loss was made payable, may be properly maintained. By the terms of the mortgage clause the loss was made payable to the mortgagee, and gave the benefit of the policy 'to the mortgagee. Hence, it was proper to sue in the name of the owner of the legal title for the use of the beneficiary. Illinois Fire Ins. Co. v. Stanton, 57 Ill. 354.</p> <p id=\"b580-4\" pgmap=\"580\">What the effect may be upon the Fireman\u2019s Insurance Company of the policy that was issued by it upon the premises without the knowledge of Peterson, we need not decide nor discuss; but that it was without effect as between the parties to this suit, we have no doubt. The facts concerning the issue of that policy and the conduct of Peterson in regard to it are set forth in the statement of agreed facts, and do not require special comment at this time.</p> <p id=\"b580-5\" pgmap=\"580\">In our view, Peterson did nothing in connection with that policy that makes it inequitable, or contrary to any recognized rule of law, for him to recover from appellee the loss that it agreed to protect him against, and we therefore will reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand the cause, with directions to that court to enter judgment in favor of the appellant and against the appellee for $1,700, with lawful interest from December 5,1893, the date when said loss became payable. ^Reversed and remanded with directions.</p> <p id=\"b580-6\" pgmap=\"580\">Hr. Justice Horton does not concur.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
