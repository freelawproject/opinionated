Hill appeals his conviction, contending that the jury instruction for constructive possession should have included the term \u201cknowingly,\u201d and the district court\u2019s denial of his request to modify the instructions to reflect such was an abuse of its discretion. The government cross-appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to enhance Hill\u2019s term of imprisonment pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). It contends that Hill\u2019s prior convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer, in violation of Florida Statutes sections 784.03 and 784.07(2)(b), and resisting an officer with violence, in violation of Florida Statutes section 843.01, constitute violent felonies under the ACCA, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-9\">After review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hill\u2019s request to modify the jury instruction for constructive possession, and thus affirm Hill\u2019s conviction. However, because we conclude that Hill\u2019s prior Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence constitutes a violent felony under the ACCA, we vacate Hill\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-12\">In contending that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request to modify the jury instruction, Hill argues that the jury instruction given for constructive possession, which did not include the term \u201cknowingly,\u201d seriously impaired his defense. Hill avers that without inclusion of the term \u201cknowingly,\u201d the jury was permitted to conclude that Hill could have constructive possession of the firearm without actually knowing that the firearm was in the passenger compartment of the car he was alleged to have been driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-13\">The district court\u2019s refusal to submit a defendant\u2019s requested jury instruction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d 1051, 1071 (11th Cir.2011). Under this standard, a court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed if it falls within a range of possible conclusions that do not constitute a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>649 F.3d 1222, 1236 (11th Cir.2011). We consider three factors when determining whether the district court\u2019s refusal to give a requested jury instruction warrants reversal: \u201c(1) whether the requested instruction is a substantially correct statement of the law; (2) whether the jury charge given addressed the requested instruction; and (3) whether the failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-14\">In order to be convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1), a defendant must be a convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>ed felon that knowingly possesses a firearm that is \u201cin or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); see <em>also United States v. Beckles, </em>565 F.3d 832, 841 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cPossession of a firearm may be either actual or constructive.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam). A defendant is in constructive possession of a firearm when the defendant does not actually possess the firearm \u201cbut instead knowingly has the power or right, and intention to exercise dominion and control over the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Jury instructions that imply knowledge or an awareness of the object possessed when defining constructive possession, substantially cover the requirement that a defendant knowingly possess a firearm \u2014 the use of such an instruction does not constitute reversible error. <em>See United States v. Winchester, </em>916 F.2d 601, 605 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">Hill\u2019s proposed jury instruction was an accurate statement of the law, but the instruction given by the district court adequately covered Hill\u2019s proposed instruction. <em>See Dominguez, </em>661 F.3d at 1071. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s instruction on the elements of the crime stated that it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Hill knowingly possessed a firearm. Finally, the definition of constructive possession given to the jury impliedly required that Hill knowingly possess the firearm. <em>See Winchester, </em>916 F.2d at 605. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hill\u2019s request to modify the jury instruction to include the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d and therefore, we affirm Hill\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-7\">On cross-appeal, the government argues that the district court erred in concluding that Hill\u2019s prior felony convictions in Florida for battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence do not constitute violent felonies under the ACCA. The government contends that both convictions constitute violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause pursuant to this Court\u2019s well-established binding precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-11\">We review de novo whether a defendant\u2019s prior convictions qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1292 (11th Cir.2013). The ACCA provides that a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense is subject to a fifteen-year statutory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). The last clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) of the ACCA, commonly referred to as the \u201cresidual clause,\u201d enumerates crimes that present \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293-94 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-12\">The Supreme Court recently held that the residual clause of the ACCA was unconstitutionally vague. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 2557-58, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The Supreme Court, however, did \u201cnot call into question application of the Act to the four enumerated offenses, or the remainder of the [ACCA\u2019s] definitions of a violent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 135 S.Ct. at 2563. Thus, by holding in <em>Johnson </em>that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court necessarily abrogated this Court\u2019s prior binding precedent, which held that these two Florida felony convictions qualified as predicate offenses under the residual clause of the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>quently, <em>Johnson </em>forecloses the government\u2019s argument on appeal that Hill\u2019s pri- or Florida felony convictions for battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer with violence are violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">As previously mentioned, in <em>Johnson </em>the Supreme Court expressly limited its holding to the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, leaving undisturbed \u201cthe remainder of the [ACCA\u2019s] definitions of a violent felony,\u201d which would include the ACCA\u2019s definition of a violent felony under its elements clause. <em>Id. </em>Section 924(e)(2)(B)(i) of the ACCA is often referred to as the \u201celements clause.\u201d <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1293. Section 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae defines a violent felony as a crime that is punishable by more than one year in prison that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">To determine whether an offense is a violent felony under the ACCA, we use a categorical approach, looking at \u201cthe fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>See Petite, </em>703 F.3d at 1294 (internal quotation marks omitted). The phrase \u201cphysical force\u201d in the context of the statutory definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d means \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. at 1271. While the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d is a question of federal law, federal courts are bound by a state supreme court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements of the underlying state offense. <em>See id. </em>at 138, 130 S.Ct. at 1269. \u201c[A]bsent a decision from the state supreme court on an issue of state law, we are bound to follow decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless there is some persuasive indication that the highest court of the state would decide the issue differently.\u201d <em>McMahan v. Toto, </em>311 F.3d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-8\">In Florida, any person who \u201cknowingly and willfully resists, obstructs, or opposes any officer ... in the lawful execution of any legal duty, by offering or doing violence to the person of such officer,\u201d is guilty of resisting an officer with violence \u2014 a third degree felony. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01. Florida\u2019s intermediary courts have held that violence is a necessary element of the offense. <em>See Rawlings v. State, </em>976 So.2d 1179, 1181 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.2008) (\u201c[V]iolence is a necessary element of the offense [of resisting an officer with violence].\u201d); <em>see also Walker v. State, </em>965 So.2d 1281, 1284 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 2007) (\u201c[Resisting arrest with violence is a felony that involves the use or threat of physical force or violence....\u201d) (quoting <em>Watson v. State, </em>749 So.2d 556, 556 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-9\">In looking to the decisions of Florida\u2019s intermediary courts before, we have held that a prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence categorically qualifies as a violent felony under the elements clause of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Romo-Villalobos, </em>674 F.3d 1246, 1251 (11th Cir.2012) (per curiam) (concluding that a conviction under section 843.01 \u201cis sufficient for liability under the first prong of the ACCA\u201d (internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>omitted)). Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred in finding that Hill\u2019s Florida conviction for resisting an officer with violence under section 843.01 did not constitute a violent felony under the ACCA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Hill\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence given the district court\u2019s error in finding that Hill\u2019s prior felony conviction for resisting an officer with violence did not constitute a violent felony under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">On remand and prior to resentencing Hill, the district court must also determine whether any of Hill\u2019s previous drug convictions constitute \u201cserious drug offenses\u201d under the ACCA. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In response to Hill\u2019s objections to the presentence investigation report, the government contended that Hill\u2019s 1999 cocaine sale/delivery conviction, in violation of Florida Statutes section 893.13(l)(a)(l), and his 2008 cocaine trafficking conviction, in violation of Florida Statutes section 893.135(l)(b)(l), were ACCA-qualifying \u201cserious drug offenses.\u201d At sentencing, the district court did not address whether Hill\u2019s prior drug convictions were serious drug offenses. As such, the government\u2019s brief declined to address Hill\u2019s drug convictions \u201cin the first instance on appeal\u201d and relied primarily on Hill\u2019s other convictions and the residual clause. Given the intervening decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>that overrules the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decisions about the same residual clause,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we direct the district court to allow the parties on remand to raise and brief whether any of Hill\u2019s prior convictions nevertheless support the ACCA enhancement under the two other provisions of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">Finally, we acknowledge the existence of a clerical error in the judgment, which states that Hill pleaded guilty to the indictment. Hill was, in fact, convicted by a jury after trial. We may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct the errors. <em>See United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (remanding with directions to the district court to correct the clerical errors). Accordingly, the district court should correct the clerical error contained in the judgment after resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">. We acknowledge that we have previously held that battery on a law enforcement officer, in violation of Florida Statutes sections 784.03 and 784.07(2)(b), and resisting an offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>cer with violence, in violation of Florida Statutes section 843.01, qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See, e.g., Turner </em>v. <em>Warden Coleman FCI (Medium), </em>709 F.3d 1328, 1340 (11th Cir.2013) (Florida battery on a law enforcement officer conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.); <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (Resisting an officer with violence under Florida law is a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause.). But, we are no longer bound by this precedent after <em>Johnson. See, e.g., United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">. The government concedes that Hill's Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer under Florida Statutes sections 784.03 and 784.07(2)(b) does not categorically constitute a violent felony under the elements clause of the ACCA pursuant to Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 136-37, 140-42, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1269, 1271-72, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010) (concluding that a Florida conviction for battery under section 784.03 is not categorically a violent felony because the elements of the offense are in the disjunctive and the prosecution can prove a battery in one of three ways: that the defendant (1) intentionally caused bodily harm, (2) intentionally struck the victim, or merely (3) actually and intentionally touched the victim). In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court added that \"nothing in the record of Johnson's 2003 battery conviction permitted the District Court to conclude that it rested upon anything more than the least of these acts,\u201d which is merely touching the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">. The Supreme Court twice upheld the ACCA\u2019s residual clause before holding it unconstitutionally vague. <em>Compare James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), <em>and Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), <em>with Johnson, </em>576 U.S. at -, 135 S.Ct. at 2557-58.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
