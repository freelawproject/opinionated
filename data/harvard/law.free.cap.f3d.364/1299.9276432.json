Slakman appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Barbara F. Adamo, Sherwin Glass, and Continental Casualty Co. in Continental\u2019s interpleader action. We issued an opinion in the case on April 2, 2003, in which we certified the following question to the Georgia Supreme Court: \u201cWHETHER SECTION 33-25-13 OF THE CODE OF GEORGIA BARS AN INDIVIDUAL FROM RECEIVING <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>BENEFITS UNDER A MURDER VICTIM\u2019S LIFE INSURANCE POLICY BEFORE HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE BECOME \u2018FINAL\u2019 UNDER STATE LAW.\u201d <em>See Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Adamo, </em>326 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">The Georgia Supreme Court then answered the question in the negative. They held that a reading of OGCA \u00a7 33-25-13 that ensures that a conviction for murder or voluntary manslaughter may serve as prima facie evidence of guilt in a \u00a7 33-25-13 civil proceeding upon exhaustion of the right to appeal or the expiration of time within which a first direct appeal could be filed, furthers the public policy upon which OGCA \u00a7 33-25-13 is based. <em>See Slakman v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>277 Ga. 189, 587 S.E.2d 24, 27 (2003). In addition, they held, such a reading \u201caffords an individual the opportunity to challenge a criminal conviction through direct appeal before imperiling his rights to any insurance benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of that holding, we reverse the district court\u2019s order finding that Slakman forfeited all rights under the insurance policy at issue, and remand for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
