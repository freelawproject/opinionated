After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-22\">The government has filed two Rule 35(b) motions in Moreno\u2019s case, but only the second Rule 35(b) motion is at issue in this appeal. We review the first motion and then the second one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-23\">In 1998, Moreno was convicted of drug and money laundering crimes and sentenced to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment. Since being sentenced, Moreno has provided the government with information concerning criminal activity in Georgia. Although the information was helpful, the government did not believe that it rose to the level of substantial assistance. Accordingly, the government did not file a Rule 35(b) motion based on the information Moreno provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-24\">However, in October 2001, Isa\u00edas Ponce, a fugitive from justice, was apprehended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreno agreed to cooperate with the government\u2019s prosecution of Ponce and to testify for the government at Ponce\u2019s trial. The government indicates Ponce pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>guilty \u201c[biased in part on Moreno\u2019s cooperation.\u201d Accordingly, in April 2002, the government filed a motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence pursuant to Rule 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-5\">At the time the government filed its first Rule 35(b) motion in Moreno\u2019s case, Rule 35(b) restricted the government\u2019s sentence-reduction motions made one year or more after a defendant\u2019s sentence to circumstances where the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial assistance involves information or evidence not known by the defendant until one year or more after sentence is imposed.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) (2002). Rule 35(b) read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-6\">If the Government so moves within one year after the sentence is imposed, the court may reduce a sentence to reflect the defendant\u2019s subsequent assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person, in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994. The court may consider a government motion to reduce a sentence made one year or more after the sentence is imposed <em>if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involves information or evidence not known by the defendant until one year or more after sentence is imposed. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-7\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) (2002) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-8\">On April 17, 2002, the district court denied the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion \u201cbecause Defendant\u2019s assistance was not based on information unknown to him during the year following his sentence.\u201d Although Moreno filed a notice of appeal, this Court dismissed Moreno\u2019s appeal for want of prosecution because Moreno failed to pay the docketing and filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1261-9\">Effective December 1, 2002, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were amended. Rule 35(b) was amended to expand the types of circumstances under which the government may file a sentence-reduction motion more than one year after a defendant\u2019s sentencing. Rule 35(b) now reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-11\">(1) In General. Upon the government\u2019s motion made within one year of sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-12\">(A) the defendant, after sentencing, provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-13\">(B) reducing the sentence accords with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines and policy statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-14\">(2) Later Motion. Upon the government\u2019s motion made more than one year after sentencing, the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance involved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-15\">(A) information not known to the defendant until one year or more after sentencing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-16\">(B) information provided by the defendant to the government within one year of sentencing, but which did not become useful to the government until more than one year after sentencing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1261-17\">(C) information the usefulness of which could not reasonably have been anticipated by the defendant until more than one year after sentencing and which was promptly provided to the government after its usefulness was reasonably apparent to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1261-18\">Fed.R.CrimJP. 35(b)(1) \u2014 (2) (2003). In adopting the new rules, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2002, and shall govern in all proceedings in criminal cases thereafter commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending.\u201d Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>der Amending Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 122 S.Ct. 127 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-4\">. On June 5, 2003, based on the new Rule 35(b)(2), the government again filed a motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence. On July 7, 2003, the district court denied the motion. In so doing, the district court made two separate determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-5\">First, the district court noted that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s order, the new Rule 35(b)(2) would apply \u201cin all proceedings in criminal cases ... commenced\u201d after December 1, 2002. The district court determined that this did not apply to Moreno because \u201cthe criminal proceedings against Defendant were obviously commenced prior to December 1, 2002.\u201d In making this determination, the district court appeared to focus on the date the government began its criminal case against Moreno, not the June 5, 2003 date on which the government filed its Rule 35(b)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">Second, the district court noted that, under the Supreme Court\u2019s order, the new Rule 35(b) would be applied retroactively \u201cinsofar as just and practicable, [to] all proceedings then pending.\u201d The district court determined that this provision did not apply to the government\u2019s Rule 35(b) motion because \u201cDefendant\u2019s Rule 35(b) proceeding was not pending on December 1,2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-7\">Moreno appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-9\">The issue of whether the , new Rule 35(b)(2) applies to the government\u2019s motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence is an issue of first impression in this Circuit. Furthermore, the parties do not identify, nor were we able to find, any published opinion from any of our sister circuits dealing with this issue. However, after review of the amended rules and the Supreme Court\u2019s order adopting those rules, we conclude that the new Rule 35(b)(2) applies to the government\u2019s June 5, 2003 motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence under Rule 35(b). We so conclude for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-12\">As noted above, the Supreme Court\u2019s order states that the \u201camendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2002, and shall govern in all proceedings in criminal eases thereafter commenced.\u201d Order Amending Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 122 S.Ct. 127 (2002). The district court interpreted the phrase \u201call proceedings in criminal cases\u201d as meaning that the \u201ccriminal proceedings\u201d against Moreno must have commenced after December 1, 2002. In essence, the district court determined that the government must have initiated its criminal case against Moreno after December 1, 2002, in order for the new Rule 35(b)(2) to apply. We conclude that this is an incorrect application of the Supreme Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-13\">Rather, in the context of Rule 35(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we conclude that the proper reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s order is that the amended rules shall govern in \u201call proceedings in criminal cases\u201d that are commenced after December 1, 2002. Therefore, if the government\u2019s filing of its June 5, 2003, motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence constitutes a separate \u201cproceeding\u201d in his criminal case, then the new Rule 35(b)(2) applies. We conclude that the filing of a Rule 35(b)(2) motion does constitute a separate proceeding in Moreno\u2019s criminal case. We do so for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1262-14\">First, although no court explicitly has stated that a Rule 35(b) motion constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>a separate proceeding, this and other circuits have referred to the filing of a Rule 35(b) motion as a \u201cRule 35 proceeding.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chavarria-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d 1033, 1036 n. 4 (11th. Cir.1994) (\u201cFor example, it makes no sense to suggest that Congress contemplated an appeal when the original sentence was imposed in violation of law, \u00a7 3742(a)(1) and (b)(1), but not when an illegal sentence was ordered in Rule 35 proceedings\u201d); <em>Ouellette v. United States, </em>862 F.2d 371, 376 (1st Cir.1988) (\u201cFurthermore, it appears that during the subsequent immunity, civil contempt, and Rule 35 proceedings, petitioner never once indicated to the court that his plea had been induced by his attorney\u2019s misrepresentation as to a plea agreement with the government\u201d); <em>Bontkowski v. United States, </em>850 F.2d 306, 313 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201cBecause defendants who plead guilty have an opportunity to challenge their sentence directly and in Rule 35 proceedings, we hold that the cause and prejudice standard is applicable when these defendants attack their sentences by raising new issues for the first time in a section 2255 proceeding\u201d (internal quotation marks, citations, and brackets omitted)); <em>United States v. Moss, </em>591 F.2d 428, 438 (8th Cir.1979) (\u201c[T]he propriety of consecutive sentences for separate mail fraud offenses arising out of essentially a single scheme should be reconsidered by the district court in a Rule 35 proceeding.\u201d). By identifying different proceedings in a particular criminal case, these decisions support the proposition that a Rule 35(b)(2) motion is a separate proceeding from other proceedings in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-5\">Second, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a proceeding as, in part, \u201cany procedural means for seeking redress from a tribunal or agency.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1221 (7th Ed.1999); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1368 (4th Ed.1968) (defining a proceeding as \u201cany application to a court of justice, however made, for aid in the enforcement of rights, for relief, for redress of injuries, for damages, or for any remedial object\u201d). A Rule 35(b)(2) motion certainly falls within Black\u2019s definition of a proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-9\">We therefore conclude that the filing of a Rule 35(b)(2) motion is a separate \u201cproceeding in a criminal case.\u201d Because the government filed its Rule 35(b)(2) motion after December 1, 2002, the new Rule 35(b)(2) governs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1263-10\">Consequently, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying the government\u2019s motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence and remand this case with instructions that the district court consider anew the government\u2019s second Rule 35(b)(2) motion to reduce Moreno\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-11\">VACATED and REMANDED with INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1260-14\">. Ponce was one of the codefendants named in the indictment with Moreno. However, Ponce fled following his initial appearance and arraignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1262-10\">.

We further note that our reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s order creates a parallel reading between the two situations in which the amended Rule 35(b) would be applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
