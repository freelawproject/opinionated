The respondent is charged with three counts of misfeasance; namely, diverting funds of his client to his own use and failure to pay recording fees amounting to $76.10. By amendment two additional counts were added to the presentment. One count charged conviction of embezzlement in \u2022the Vermont District Court in Brattleboro on respondent\u2019s plea of <em>nolle contendere. </em>The other count charged failure of the respondent to file state income tax returns for the years 1963 to 1967 inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-17\">The respondent waived his rights to be heard on the merits of the presentment and any other rights to further hearing in the premises. In this posture of the case we find the several charges against the respondent as alleged in the presentment as amended are true and control our disposition of the case. The undisputed facts, presented to the-Court, require that the respondent be disbarred.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\n<em>Judgment that J.
