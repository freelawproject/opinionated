We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As rephrased by this Court, the issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">1. Did the District Court err in determining that, prior to Nimmick\u2019s settlement with Employers Mutual Insurance Company (Employers Mutual), Sobieck was an uninsured motorist pursuant to the terms of Nimmick\u2019s State Farm insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">2. Did the District Court err in determining that Nimmick\u2019s settlement with Employers Mutual did not affect Sobieck\u2019s status as an uninsured motorist?</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Nimmick filed a complaint in the Fourth Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, Montana, alleging the following facts. On May 17, 1990, Sobieck drove an automobile in which Chris White, Allissa Mattson and Nimmick were passengers. The automobile belonged to Sobieck\u2019s boyfriend, Cory Harmon, and was insured by Employers Mutual. Sobieck lost control of the vehicle which ultimately left the road and struck a tree, injuring Nimmick. The complaint accused Harmon of negligent entrustment, White of negligently instructing Sobieck in the operation of a vehicle with which she was unfamiliar and Sobieck of negligent operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Nimmick\u2019s parents maintained automobile insurance with State Farm at the time of the 1990 accident. While the Ravalli County complaint was pending, Nimmick was also negotiating with State Farm. Nimmick sought to recover under the uninsured motorist provision, claiming that since Employers Mutual denied coverage, the vehicle was uninsured under the terms of the State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Nimmick subsequently entered into a settlement agreement with Employers Mutual, and the Ravalli County cause of action was dismissed. Employers Mutual paid Nimmick $200,000. In the settlement agreement, Employers Mutual stated that it believed that Harmon and White were \u2018likely to have insurance coverage for their liabilities.\u201d The settlement was made expressly on behalf of Harmon and White but not on behalf of Sobieck. The settlement released Harmon and White from any and all future liability or claims arising from the accident. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the claims against Harmon and White were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The settlement agreement purported not to be a release of Sobieck, claiming that the $200,000 payment was not made on her behalf. While the Employers Mutual policy covered Harmon and White, the settlement agreement denied that the policy covered Sobieck.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">However, the agreement also explained, at some length, what rights Nimmick relinquished in relation to further action against Sobieck. The complaint against Sobieck was to be dismissed without prejudice. Nimmick covenanted that neither she nor her heirs or assignees would execute against Sobieck\u2019s personal assets. The settlement agreement specifically reserved State Farm\u2019s right to seek subrogation against Sobieck. The terms and conditions of the settlement agreement, proposed by Nimmick, were drafted to accomplish two goals: (1) to establish that the $200,000 payment was made on behalf of Harmon and White, not Sobieck, and (2) to preserve Nimmick\u2019s right to seek recovery under her uninsured motorist coverage with State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On December 29, 1992, Nimmick filed a complaint against State Farm in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, Montana. Nimmick claimed that the vehicle in which she was riding at the time of the accident was an uninsured motor vehicle as defined by her parents\u2019 State Farm policies. The basis of the claim was that since Sobieck, the unauthorized driver at the time of the accident, was not covered under the Employers Mutual policy, Nimmick is entitled to uninsured vehicle coverage under the State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">On April 15, 1993, State Farm moved for summary judgment, arguing that Nimmick was not entitled to uninsured vehicle coverage under the State Farm policy. The District Court denied State Farm\u2019s motion, concluding that Sobieck was an -uninsured motorist. The parties stipulated to the District Court entering a judgment on the issue of uninsured vehicle coverage pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.R State Farm appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Did the District Court err in determining that, prior to Nimmick\u2019s settlement with Employers Mutual, Sobieck was an uninsured motorist pursuant to the terms of Nimmick\u2019s State Farm insurance policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling is the same as that initially used by the district court. <em>Cooper v. Sisters of Charity </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 205, 207, 875 P.2d 352, 353. We examine the record to determine whether a genuine issue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>fact exists. If there is no genuine issue of fact, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Cooper, </em>875 P.2d at 353. We review district court conclusions of law to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603. The District Court concluded that \u201cTammy Sobieck was an uninsured driver by definition under [the State Farm] insurance policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy defines an uninsured motor vehicle as a vehicle which is \u201cuninsured\u201d as to its ownership, maintenance or use. This policy language reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">We will pay damages for <em>bodily injury </em>an <em>insured </em>is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle. </em>The <em>bodily injury </em>must be caused by accident arising out of the operation, maintenance or use of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle. Uninsured Motor Vehicle </em>\u2014 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">1. a land motor vehicle, the ownership, maintenance or use of which is: .... [Italics in original; underscore added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">We have interpreted this policy language to provide uninsured motor vehicle coverage \u201cif there is no insurance as to either [the vehicle\u2019s] ownership <em>or </em>its maintenance or its use.\u201d <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Taylor </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 215, 218, 725 P.2d 821, 823 (citing <em>Finney v. Farmers Ins. Co. </em>(Wash. App. 1978), 586 P.2d 519, 526, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>600 P.2d 1272 (Wash. 1979)). Thus, even though the ownership of the vehicle in this case was insured by Harmon\u2019s Employers Mutual policy, the vehicle was \u201cuninsured\u201d pursuant to Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy if Sobieck\u2019s use of the vehicle was not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy goes on to define an uninsured motor vehicle as a vehicle, the ownership, maintenance or use of which is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">a. not insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">b. insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident; but</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">1) the limits of liability are less than required by the financial responsibility act of the state where <em>your car </em>is mainly garaged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">2) the insuring company denies coverage or is or becomes insolvent.... [Italics in original; underscore added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Employers Mutual initially denied coverage of Sobieck\u2019s use of the vehicle. Therefore, in regard to any claim against Sobieck, the vehicle was uninsured under the express terms of the State Farm policy. Even though the Harmons maintained an insurance policy on the vehicle, Employers Mutual\u2019s denial of coverage rendered the vehicle uninsured under the State Farm policy. Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy\u2019s uninsured vehicle provision therefore applied to any claims against Sobieck arising from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">We conclude that the District Court properly determined that, prior to Nimmick\u2019s settlement with Employers Mutual, Sobieck was an uninsured motorist pursuant to the terms of Nimmick\u2019s State Farm insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Did the District Court err in determining that Nimmick\u2019s settlement with Employers Mutual did not affect Sobieck\u2019s status as an uninsured motorist?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">State Farm argues that while Sobieck may have originally been an uninsured motorist because Employers Mutual initially denied her claim, her status was altered when Nimmick entered into a settlement agreement with Employers Mutual. State Farm claims that the settlement between Employers Mutual and Nimmick was not solely on behalf of Harmon and White, but rather was on behalf of Sobieck as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">State Farm relies on a series of cases which stand for the proposition that if the liability insurer initially denies coverage, but later settles with the injured party on behalf of the liable party, the liable party is not \u201cuninsured\u201d and thus the injured party may not recover from his or her own uninsured motorist coverage. It is immaterial whether the insurer continues to deny coverage if it in fact settles on behalf of the liable party. <em>See Jones v. Sentry Insurance Co. </em>(Ct.App.Minn. 1990), 462 N.W.2d 90; <em>Fryer v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Minn. 1985), 365 N.W.2d 249; <em>Coleman v. Florida Insurance Guaranty Assoc. Inc. </em>(Fla. 1988), 517 So.2d 686; <em>Rister v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Mo.App. 1984), 668 S.W.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">For example, in <em>Rister, </em>Ricky Rister was killed when the pickup truck in which he was a passenger collided with a fuel transport truck. <em>Rister, </em>668 S.W.2d at 133. In a suit brought by Rister\u2019s family, the insurer of the pickup denied coverage for the driver, invoking the \u201cfellow employee\u201d exclusion in its policy. The insurer of the pickup later settled with Rister\u2019s family, and the claims against the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>estate were dismissed. The Missouri Court of Appeals concluded that, although the insurer of the pickup initially denied coverage, the settlement with Rister\u2019s family revoked the initial denial. <em>Rister, </em>668 S.W.2d at 134-35. Since Rister\u2019s family recovered insurance benefits on behalf of the driver, he was no longer considered uninsured. Therefore, the Risters could no longer pursue their uninsured motorist claim against Rister\u2019s own insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We must examine the terms of the settlement agreement to determine if the settlement was in fact on behalf of Sobieck. We first note that Nimmick proposed the relevant terms of the agreement to further her attempt to recover from both Employers Mutual and State Farm. The agreement states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Nimmick proposed the basic terms of this agreement for the sole purpose of (i) settling her disputes with Harmon and White and (ii) <em>protecting her claims under the underinsured and uninsured provisions of her insurance policy with State Farm Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm Policy\u201d) and (iii) reaching a settlement which would comply with all of the terms and provisions of said State Farm Policy </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Any ambiguities must be construed against the drafter. <em>Wyman v. DuBray Land Realty </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 294, 298, 752 P.2d 196, 199. In determining the contract\u2019s purpose and intent, we examine the contract as a whole, giving no special deference to any specific clause. <em>Peterson v. Hopkins </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 429, 684 P.2d 1061; <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Cumiskey </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 350, 665 P.2d 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">After reviewing the settlement agreement as a whole, we conclude that the settlement was made on behalf of Sobieck as well as Harmon and White. First, we note that Sobieck was a party to the settlement agreement. Had the settlement not been on her behalf, she would not have been included as a party to the agreement. The terms of the settlement also indicate that it was in fact made on her behalf. The settlement agreement reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">In consideration of the mutual understandings and promises contained herein, the parties hereto hereby covenant and agree as follows: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">b(l). Execute a covenant not to execute against Sobieck\u2019s personal assets wherein Nimmick and her parents, on behalf of themselves, their agents, heirs, successors, and assigns, shall covenant that they (and all of them) shall never initiate, pursue, or levy any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>execution for any judgment (obtained or obtainable) against Sobieck, and shall likewise forever forebear to collect (or attempt to collect) any amount as a debt, obligation, or otherwise, relating to any of Nimmick\u2019s claimed injuries arising from the Accident, from the personal assets of Sobieck or any member of Sobieck\u2019s family. This covenant is not intended to affect any right of State Farm, if any, to seek subrogation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-4\">b(2). Execute an agreement not to assign any action, claim or judgment of Nimmick against Sobieck to any other person or entity, including without limitation Mid-Century Insurance Company or any of its affiliates or State Farm Insurance Company or any of its affiliates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">c. Dismiss Nimmick\u2019s Complaint in the tort action ... against Sobieck without prejudice ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">f. Execute a full, final and unconditional release of Employers Mutual for any and all claims under Section 33-18-201 and 33-18-242, Montana Code Annotated, in respect of any claims arising from Tammy Sobieck\u2019s putative status as an insured under the Employer\u2019s Mutual Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In light of this broad sweeping release language, it is disingenuous for Nimmick to claim the settlement was not made on Sobieck\u2019s behalf. A basic premise of contract law is mutuality of consideration. <em>See Richardson v. Safeco Insurance Co. </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 73, 76, 669 P.2d 1073, 1074. The language above, which releases Sobieck from financial responsibility for the accident, clearly appears to be in exchange for the monetary settlement with Employers Mutual. We do not believe releasing Sobieck was a gratuitous act on Nimmick\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Nimmick relies on the purported reservation of State Farm\u2019s right of subrogation found in the settlement agreement. As previously stated, the terms of the settlement agreement state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">This covenant is not intended to affect any right of State Farm, if any, to seek subrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Nimmick argues that because the settlement agreement reserved State Farm\u2019s right to seek subrogation against Sobieck, she has not been \u201creleased\u201d from liability for Nimmick\u2019s injuries. Nimmick claims that because Sobieck is still potentially liable to State Farm under a subrogation action, she has not been released and, therefore, the settlement with Employers Mutual was not on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>This argument is faulty for several reasons. First, an insurer\u2019s subrogation right vests upon its payment of a claim. One authority summarized this principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">No right of subrogation arises until the claim has been paid. [Footnote omitted.] Thus, before subrogation can be had, the insurer must have paid the insured his loss according to the contract, for it is this securing of satisfaction by the insured which gives the insurer the right to be subrogated to the rights of the insured against a wrongdoer primarily liable for the loss. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">16 Couch on Insurance 2d, \u00a7 61:49 (1983). This principle is well-established in our case law. <em>See St. Paul Fire and Marine v. Allstate </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 47, 51, 847 P.2d 705, 707; <em>Skauge v. Mountain States Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1977), 172 Mont. 521, 525, 565 P.2d 628, 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In this case, State Farm has not paid any benefits to Nimmick. Therefore, State Farm does not have a vested right to seek subrogation against Sobieck.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Secondly, an insurer seeking subrogation has only those rights maintained by its insured. The insurer steps into its insured\u2019s shoes. Therefore, in a subrogation action, the insurer sues the purported tortfeasor in place of its insured. In <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine v. Glassing </em>(1994), [269 Mont. 76], 887 P.2d 218, we adopted language from Couch on Insurance in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">The right of subrogation is purely derivative as the insurer succeeds only to the rights of the insured, and no new cause of action is created. In other words, the concept of subrogation merely gives the insurer the right to prosecute the cause of action which the insured possessed against anyone legally responsible for the latter\u2019s harm ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\"><em>Glassing, </em>887 P.2d at 220-21, (citing 16 Couch on Insurance 2d, \u00a7 61:37 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">In this case, Nimmick executed broad sweeping covenants not to execute against the personal assets of Sobieck or her family. State Farm, stepping into Nimmick\u2019s shoes, has likewise been limited from executing against Sobieck. While the settlement agreement purports to maintain State Farm\u2019s right of subrogation, this subrogation right, if any, is very limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">By severely limiting or destroying State Farm\u2019s right of subrogation, Nimmick further released Sobieck from any potential liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>arising from the accident. In a section entitled \u201cRelease of Tortfeasor and Effect Thereof,\u201d Couch on Insurance states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">If the employer\u2019s or insurance carrier\u2019s statutory right of subrogation is impaired by the act of the employee in settling with the wrongdoer, the employee\u2019s right to compensation is barred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\"><em>A covenant not to levy against the tortfeasor by the insured destroys the right to subrogation, </em>[footnote omitted] <em>and as such may bar the insured\u2019s recovery under the policy. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEF\">16 Couch on Insurance 2d, \u00a7 61:191 (1983). By inhibiting subrogation, Nimmick has barred her claim against State Farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">After examining the settlement agreement and its underlying effects as a whole, we conclude that the settlement between Employers Mutual and Nimmick was made on behalf of Sobieck as well as Harmon and White. Because the settlement was on behalf of Sobieck, she is no longer an uninsured motorist under the terms of Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy. We affirm as to issue one and reverse as to issue two the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b350-7\">JUSTICES GRAY, WEBER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b350-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"ADP\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">I concur in the result. However, I think the Court has needlessly relied upon both subrogation and insurance contract analyses. Despite the document\u2019s protestations to the contrary, the settlement agreement between Nimmick and Employers Mutual did include Sobieck. Sobieck was a signatory to the settlement and Nimmick gave Sobieck a covenant not to execute against her assets or those of her family. As the Court correctly points out, because the settlement was on behalf of Sobieck, she is no longer an uninsured motorist under the terms of Nimmick\u2019s State Farm policy. The Court does not need to further analyze the case in terms of subrogation theory because a right of subrogation does not even arise unless there is coverage under the policy resulting in payment by the insurer. Here, although Sobieck initially fit the definition of an uninsured motorist under the terms of the policy, the subsequent settlement changed her status.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Since the Court does engage in subrogation analysis, I must observe that, strictly in the context of subrogation law, I would reverse and remand for a determination as to whether or not Sobieck had any assets with which to respond to State Farm\u2019s potential subrogation claim. In other words, I would adopt a \u201cno prejudice\u201d rule whereby a settlement with a tortfeasor would not release an insurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>such as State Farm if the plaintiff could show that the tortfeasor was judgment proof and, thus, there was no prejudice to the insurer. However, in the context of an uninsured motorist\u2019s policy, if the insured (Nimmick) entered into an insurance settlement with the tortfeasor (Sobieck), regardless of the amount, Sobieck is no longer \u201cuninsured\u201d under the State Farm policy and there is no insurance coverage. In the absence of coverage and payment by State Farm, the right of subrogation does not come into play. Thus, the question of whether State Farm has, in fact, been prejudiced is not an issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b351-4\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AGr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The only issue in this case is whether Tammy Sobieck is an uninsured driver within the meaning of the insurance policy provided by State Farm to Jennifer Nimmick. That policy provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">We will pay damages for <em>bodily injury </em>an <em>insured </em>is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an <em>uninsured motor vehicle. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\"><em>Uninsured Motor Vehicle </em>\u2014 means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">1. a land motor vehicle, the ownership, maintenance or use of which is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">a. not insured ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">(Underlining added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Tammy Sobieck\u2019s use of Cory Harmon\u2019s vehicle was not insured.</p>\n<p id=\"AOl\">Cory Harmon\u2019s vehicle was insured by Employers Mutual Companies. The policy which was issued to him, and which applied to the vehicle being driven by Tammy Sobieck at the time of her accident, had the following exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">A. We do not provide Liability Coverage for any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">8. Using a vehicle without a reasonable belief that that person is entitled to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">According to the deposition testimony of Cory Harmon taken in Employers Mutual\u2019s Ravalli County declaratory judgment action, Tammy Sobieck did not have permission to operate the Harmon vehicle at the time and place where she negligently caused Jennifer Nimmick\u2019s injuries. Based on the arguments of the parties in District Court and on appeal, that testimony is uncontroverted and assumed to be true for purposes of the issue involved in this proceeding. Therefore, based on the plain language of the State Farm and Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ployers Mutual policies, Tammy Sobieck was uninsured when she negligently lost control of Cory Harmon\u2019s vehicle and caused severe injuries to Jennifer Nimmick. Because she was uninsured, and pursuant to our prior decision in <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Taylor </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 215, 218, 725 P.2d 821, 823, the majority correctly notes that uninsured coverage was initially available pursuant to the terms of the State Farm policy. That should be the end of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">However, based on decisions from other jurisdictions which are factually inapposite to this case, the majority concludes that an uninsured driver can become an insured driver because of references to that person in a settlement agreement in which third persons are released.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In all of the cases relied on by the majority, settlement amounts were ultimately paid on behalf of the person for whom coverage was originally denied. <em>See Jones v. Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(Minn. Ct. App. 1990), 462 N.W.2d 90; <em>Fryer v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Minn. 1985), 365 N.W.2d 249; <em>Coleman v. Florida Ins.

App. 1984), 668 S.W.2d 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">For example, in the <em>Rister </em>decision, the Missouri Court of Appeals simply held that where an uninsured motorist claim is based on an insurer\u2019s denial of coverage, the unconditional withdrawal of that denial precludes uninsured coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Both the <em>Jones </em>decision, and the <em>Fryer </em>decision merely stand for the principle that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">[W]here the liability carrier denies coverage for the involved motor vehicle but subsequently admits coverage prior to the arbitration hearing, such motor vehicle is not an uninsured motor vehicle within the meaning of the policy provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-9\"><em>Fryer, </em>365 N.W.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coleman </em>has nothing to do with the issue involved in this case, but instead relates to when an insured may stack a number of uninsured motorist coverages for which he had paid more than one premium. The case does make passing reference to when an injured party can recover under his or her own uninsured motorist policy, but only in the context of Florida law. The reference has nothing to do with the policy provisions involved in this case, nor the facts involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">Here, denial of coverage for Sobieck was never withdrawn. Employers Mutual denied coverage for Sobieck the first time a claim was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>filed, and denied coverage for Sobieck when it ultimately paid money to Nimmick on behalf of Cory Harmon and Chris White.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">There is nothing similar about this case and those authorities relied on by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The settlement agreement upon which the majority opinion is based begins by pointing out that Sobieck did not have permission to drive Harmon\u2019s car at the time of Nimmick\u2019s accident. The agreement specified that while Cory Harmon was an insured according to the terms of Employers Mutual\u2019s liability policy, and that while there was a possibility the District Court would conclude that Chris White was also covered, Employers Mutual continued to deny any coverage for Tammy Sobieck.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The agreement specifically provided that the settlement amounts paid by Employers Mutual were paid on behalf of White and Harmon, and that only White and Harmon and Employers Mutual were released from liability for Nimmick\u2019s injuries. The agreement provided that Nimmick\u2019s tort claim against Harmon and White would be dismissed with prejudice, but that any claim against Sobieck would be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Furthermore, while Nimmick and her parents agreed not to execute against Sobieck\u2019s personal assets to recover any damages due them, the agreement specifically provided that \u201c[t]his covenant is not intended to affect any right of State Farm, if any, to seek subrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">If these were the terms negotiated in exchange for payment on behalf of Sobieck, they are most inadequate and unlike any other settlement agreement with which I am familiar. To say the least, the terms differed significantly from any of the agreements involved in the cases relied on by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Based on the language of the agreement entered into between Nimmick and Employers Mutual, I necessarily conclude that nothing therein changed the fact that Sobieck was uninsured based on the plain language of the State Farm and Employers Mutual policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Whether or not the majority \u201cbelieve releasing Sobieck was a gratuitous act on Nimmick\u2019s part,\u201d is irrelevant. The fact is that based on the plain language in the settlement agreement, Sobieck was not released from future liability for her conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">The majority next reasons that since an insurer subrogates to only those rights possessed by its insured, State Farm was prejudiced by Nimmick\u2019s waiver of her right to execute against Sobieck\u2019s assets. However, the majority\u2019s subrogation analysis is incomplete and out of context. Nimmick provided only a partial waiver of the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>execute. She specifically reserved whatever right State Farm could claim by operation of law or pursuant to its contract with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The plain terms of Nimmick\u2019s agreement with Employers Mutual provided that although neither she nor her parents would execute against Sobieck\u2019s assets, State Farm\u2019s rights to do so would not in any way be impaired. It is the majority\u2019s selective and incomplete discussion of subrogation principles to establish that State Farm\u2019s rights have been diminished in spite of plain contract language to the contrary, which is disingenuous \u2014 not Nimmick\u2019s arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">For these reasons, I would conclude that Sobieck was an uninsured driver at the time she negligently caused Jennifer Nimmick\u2019s injuries, and that State Farm\u2019s policy, therefore, provided uninsured motorist coverage to Jennifer Nimmick for Tammy Sobieck\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-7\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
