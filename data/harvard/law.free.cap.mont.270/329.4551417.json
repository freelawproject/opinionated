We conclude that the District Court did not err in convicting Black of an offense with which he was not specifically charged, that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>that Black was afforded effective assistance of counsel. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In 1987, Black rented a portion of the shop in which Gary Russell operated an automotive repair business in Helena, Montana; the shop was immediately adjacent to Russell\u2019s residence. Russell\u2019s ten-year-old son, G.R., became acquainted with Black when he visited his father in the shop. G.R. testified that Black gave him several gifts and would grab his buttocks while he was in the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">While on a fishing outing with G.R. at Ten Mile Creek, Black pulled down his pants and masturbated in front of G.R. He asked G.R. to expose his penis and, after initially refusing, G.R. did so; Black neither touched G.R. nor asked G.R. to touch him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">During two subsequent outings to Ten Mile Creek, Black told G.R. to pull down his pants and get on his knees; according to G.R., Black then entered him from behind. G.R. also testified to another \u201centering from behind\u201d incident which occurred at Black\u2019s house and was interrupted when Russell arrived with a vehicle he had been repairing.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">G.R. testified that he experienced extreme pain during these incidents and bled after each. After each incident, Black said that what they had done was \u201cperfectly natural\u201d and told G.R. not to tell anyone. G.R. testified that he felt threatened by Black. G.R. did not reveal the incidents to anyone until he suddenly remembered them in September of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The State of Montana (State) charged Black with sexual intercourse without consent, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Through his counsel, Black notified the State of his intent to rely on an alibi defense. The case was tried to the District Court sitting without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">The court acquitted Black of the charged offense, finding the evidence insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Black actually penetrated G.R.\u2019s anus. It found him guilty, however, of felony sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. Black was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, with five years suspended upon certain conditions. Black appealed. Subsequent events are not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">1. Did the District Court err in convicting Black of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Black advances three fundamental challenges to his conviction of the offense of sexual assault. First, he argues that the District Court was without authority to convict him of an offense with which he was not charged. Second, he asserts that the charging document was insufficient to serve as the basis for a conviction of the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>sexual assault. Finally, he contends that his constitutional due process rights were violated by the conviction for sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">We note at the outset that the issue of whether sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent is not before us in this case. Black did not raise the issue in the District Court. Moreover, while he makes a passing reference to the existence of the issue in his opening brief on appeal, that brief contains neither argument nor legal authority relating to the issue, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P. Indeed, the entirety of Black\u2019s argument in his opening brief relating to the court\u2019s authority to convict him of an uncharged offense is premised upon sexual assault being a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. It is only in his reply brief that Black argues that sexual assault is not a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Furthermore, unlike cases such as <em>State v. Voegele </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 222, 793 P.2d 832, the parties to this case have not raised or argued the plain error doctrine, in either its statutory or judicially-created form, insofar as that doctrine might provide a basis for our consideration of the issue. Under these circumstances, that issue is not properly before us and we specifically do not address it here. Instead, we assume for purposes of this opinion that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">a. Was the District Court authorized to convict Black of the lesser included offense of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Section 46-16-607(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part that a \u201cdefendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged ....\u201d The language of the statute is so plain as to need no interpretation. <em>See Curtis v. Dist. Court of 21st Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 231, 234, 879 P.2d 1164, 1166 (citation omitted). Because we assume for purposes of this case that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent, the statute provides clear and express authority for Black\u2019s conviction of the offense of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Black relies on \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, and the 1991 Commission Comment to the statute in making a circuitous argument regarding when lesser included offense instructions may, may not and must be given and how those issues relate to this case. Little discussion of this argument is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">We note first that, by its terms, \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, relates only to jury trials. Questions relating to instructing the jury simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>do not arise in bench trials. Thus, \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">For the same reason, the Commission Comment stating in part that \u201c[t]his statute is a newly developed provision intended to regulate a jury\u2019s consideration of lesser included offenses\u201d also is inapplicable to this case involving a trial to the court. In addition, we note that the portion of the Comment on which Black relies \u2014 allowing a lesser included instruction \u201conly upon a party\u2019s request\u201d and when warranted by the evidence \u2014 appears to vary the terms of \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, which provides that a lesser included offense instruction <em>must </em>be given upon a party\u2019s request when sufficient evidence supports the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Black also argues that <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 118, 832 P.2d 370, supports his position. Like \u00a7 46-16-607(2), MCA, <em>Sheppard </em>is inapplicable to this appeal from a bench trial because it addresses only questions relating to a trial court\u2019s responsibilities in instructing a jury on lesser included offenses. Those responsibilities are not relevant where the trial court is deciding questions of both law and fact pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-16-103 and 46-16-110(3), MCA, and, as a result, no instructions are given.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We conclude that \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA, authorizes the conviction of a criminal defendant for a lesser included offense. Under the circumstances of this case, therefore, we hold that the District Court was authorized to convict Black of the offense of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">b. Did the charging document provide a sufficient basis for a conviction of the offense of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Black asserts that the information charging him with the offense of sexual intercourse without consent did not provide him with notice sufficient to enable him to prepare his defense to the uncharged offense of sexual assault. His argument is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Section 46-11-401, MCA, sets forth the requirements which must be contained in the charging document. Here, the information charging Black with sexual intercourse without consent meets the statutory requirements; Black does not contend otherwise. He argues that he could not be convicted of the offense of sexual assault because that charge was not specifically included in the information and, as a result, he did not have sufficient notice of the possibility of a conviction of that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">As discussed above, \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA, unambiguously and expressly authorizes a defendant\u2019s conviction of an offense included in the charged offense. The statute itself provides the notice that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>conviction for a lesser included offense is possible. Because we assume for purposes of this case that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent, Black had notice via the information and \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA, that he could be convicted of the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">While we have not previously addressed the precise issue of notice vis-a-vis \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA, the California Supreme Court did so succinctly in <em>People v. Lohbauer </em>(Cal. 1981), 173 Cal.Rptr. 453, 627 P.2d 183. There, the California court determined that the requisite notice is afforded where an offense is necessarily included within the statutory definition of the charged offense and a conviction of the included offense is statutorily authorized. <em>Lohbauer, </em>173 Cal.Rptr. at 454, 627 P.2d at 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Nor do the Montana cases on which Black relies support his position. <em>State v. Kills on Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 71, 793 P.2d 1273, 1283, <em>State v. Matson </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 36, 43, 736 P.2d 971, 975, and <em>State v. Longneck </em>(1981), 196 Mont. 151, 154, 640 P.2d 436, 438, all state the general rules regarding the necessity of reasonably apprising the accused of the charges against him in the information so that a person of common understanding would know what offense is being charged. None of those cases involved the issue now before us regarding notice of lesser included offenses vis-a-vis \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Black also advances arguments, as he did in challenging the District Court\u2019s authority to convict him of the lesser included offense, premised on cases involving a trial court\u2019s jury instructions on lesser included offenses. Here too, as above, those cases are inapplicable to this case which was tried to the District Court sitting without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Finally, Black argues that \u201cthe main case on point\u201d is <em>State v. Copenhaver </em>(1907), 35 Mont. 342, 89 P. 61. He urges that our statements in <em>Copenhaver, </em>89 P. at 62, that \u201cthe defendant was charged with one crime and convicted of another. The judgment must therefore be reversed ...\u201d are equally applicable here. His reliance on <em>Copenhaver </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">In <em>Copenhaver, </em>the defendant was charged with burglary in the nighttime or, as defined by statute, burglary in the first degree; he was convicted of burglary in the daytime, or burglary in the second degree. We reversed on appeal, concluding that burglary in the nighttime clearly did not \u201cinclude\u201d burglary in the daytime. <em>Copenhaver, </em>89 P. at 62. Thus, unlike the present case, <em>Copenhaver </em>did not involve a conviction of a lesser included offense; it involved a conviction of a separate, independent offense which was not a lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>included offense. Indeed, we specifically noted in <em>Copenhaver </em>that \u00a7 2147 of the Penal Code \u2014 a predecessor to \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA\u2014 would have authorized a conviction for an offense included in the charged offense. <em>Copenhaver, </em>89 P. at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">The information charged Black with sexual intercourse without consent. For purposes of this case, we assume that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Section 46-16-607(1), MCA, expressly authorizes a conviction for an offense included in the charged offense. For these reasons, we conclude that the charging document provided a sufficient basis for Black\u2019s conviction of the offense of sexual assault,</p>\n<p id=\"AUM\">c. Did the conviction of the offense of sexual assault violate Black\u2019s constitutional right to due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Black\u2019s due process arguments are premised on his assertion that he did not have notice of the offense of which he ultimately was convicted. We have concluded to the contrary based on the statute. Black had notice of the possibility of a conviction of sexual assault pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-607(1), MCA, which specifically authorizes a conviction for an offense included in the charged offense. Little more need be said.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Both the Montana Constitution, Article II, \u00a7 24, and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantee accused defendants certain due process, including the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation. Relying on <em>State v. Barker </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 85, 858 P.2d 360, Black argues that his conviction of the offense of sexual assault violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In <em>Barker, </em>we concluded that a justice court conviction for reckless driving after a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol violated due process. <em>Barker, </em>858 P.2d at 362. We stated that it is elementary that a party cannot be charged with one offense and \u201cconvicted of another independent offense.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>858 P.2d at 362 (citation omitted). The quoted language establishes the distinguishing factor between <em>Barker </em>and the present case: <em>Barker </em>involved two independent offenses. Indeed, we specifically stated therein that \u201creckless driving is not a lesser included offense of driving under the influence\u201d and, on that basis, concluded that Barker could not be convicted of an offense \u201cindependent\u201d from that charged. <em>Barker, </em>858 P.2d at 362. <em>Barker </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Like the California court in <em>Lohbauer, </em>we conclude that the notice required by the constitutional guarantee of due process is afforded where an offense is included within the charged offense and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>a conviction of the included offense is authorized by statute. We hold that Black\u2019s due process rights were not violated, under the circumstances of this case, by his conviction of the offense of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">2. Does sufficient evidence support Black\u2019s conviction of the offense of sexual assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Our standard in reviewing the sufficiency of evidence in criminal cases is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Licht </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 123, 879 P.2d 670, 675 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Black does not dispute that G.R.\u2019s testimony establishes the elements of sexual assault as that offense is statutorily defined. Moreover, the law is clear in Montana that a victim\u2019s testimony in a sex offense case is sufficient to sustain a conviction and needs no corroboration. <em>State v. Biehle </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 257, 260, 824 P.2d 268, 270-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Black argues that, in rejecting G.R.\u2019s testimony regarding the extent of the actual sexual intercourse or penetration, the District Court determined that G.R. was not a credible witness. With that purported determination as a base, Black contends that adding discrepancies in G.R.\u2019s testimony and that of others testifying compels a determination that G.R.\u2019s testimony was incredible in its entirety and, therefore, insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Black cites no authority for his position. In addition, he apparently overlooks the District Court\u2019s specific determination that \u201cG.R. was a credible witness.\u201d As we have stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">[a] trial court acting as a finder of fact is in the best position to observe the witnesses, including their demeanor and credibility.... The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are exclusively the province of the trier of fact....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-10\"><em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">The court\u2019s credibility determination and the weight it gave G.R.\u2019s testimony were exclusively within its province as the trier of fact in this case; the same is true regarding the court\u2019s weighing of all the evidence before it, including discrepancies in testimony. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact on matters of credibility and the weight of evidence. We hold, therefore, that sufficient evidence supports Black\u2019s conviction of the offense of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>3. Was Black afforded effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">This Court has adopted the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, for determining whether counsel was ineffective. <em>State v. Mahoney </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 89, 99-102, 870 P.2d 65, 72-73. Under the first prong of that test, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient by demonstrating that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution; under the second prong, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s deficient performance so prejudiced him that he was deprived of the right to a fair trial. <em>Mahoney, </em>870 P.2d at 72-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Black\u2019s contention that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel is premised on two alleged deficiencies. Black relies first on <em>State v. Denny </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 248, 865 P.2d 226, in arguing that counsel\u2019s failure to interview witnesses who would have supported his alibi defense constituted deficient performance. In this regard, we note that the alleged failure to interview helpful witnesses cannot be either established or disproved on the record before us; as a result, that allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be addressed in this direct appeal from Black\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Black also argues that counsel failed to follow up on discrepancies in the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses. Here, we need consider only the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test to conclude that Black has not met his burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel. The record before us establishes that counsel cross-examined each of the State\u2019s witnesses. The cross-examinations tested the witnesses\u2019 memory of events occurring some six years earlier and attempted to cast doubt on the witnesses\u2019 recollections and credibility. Black cites no authority in support of his general and conclusory allegation that more, or different, cross-examination was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">A strong presumption exists that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. <em>Denny, </em>865 P.2d at 228-29; <em>citing Nealy v. Cabana </em>(5th Cir. 1985), 764 F.2d 1173, 1177-1178. Black\u2019s conclusory allegations do not begin to establish that counsel\u2019s performance was not reasonable under prevailing professional norms. <em>See Denny, </em>865 P.2d at 228; citing <em>Lawrence v. Armontrout </em>(8th Cir. 1990), 900 F.2d 127, 129 (citation omitted). We conclude that Black has not met the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test by demonstrating record-based deficient performance by counsel and, to that extent, we hold that he was afforded effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b365-5\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"AHK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">I dissent for the reason that I find the Court\u2019s reasoning offends due process of law. The majority points out that the question of whether sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent has not been addressed by this Court. The Court takes the position that the issue is not properly before the Court because Black did not raise this issue in his opening brief. As it has done on four previous occasions, the Court then declines to rule on that question but assumes, for purposes of this decision, that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(Mont. 1995), 890 P.2d 754, 52 St.Rep. 106; <em>State v. Ogle </em>(1992), 255 Mont. 246, 841 P.2d 1133; <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 118, 832 P.2d 370; <em>State v. Lundhlade </em>(1986), 221 Mont. 185, 717 P.2d 575. Based upon that assumption, the Court then determines that the District Court was within the law and the constitution when it found Black guilty of sexual assault even though Black was charged only with sexual intercourse without consent. A criminal conviction cannot be based upon an assumption of such a fundamental legal proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The majority concedes that the question of lesser included offense has not been addressed. Nonetheless, it is willing to affirm the conviction based upon an assumption that the crime of which Black was convicted (sexual assault) is a lesser included offense of the crime with which he was charged (sexual intercourse without consent). Since the question is admittedly an open question, let us assume the opposite \u2014 that sexual assault is not a lesser included offense. Then, of course, Black stands convicted of an offense for which he was given no notice. The Information does not charge Black with sexual assault. Black would have had no reason to believe that he was even at risk of being convicted of sexual assault until such time as the court rendered its final judgment. Without advance knowledge of what the charge is, the accused is unable to exercise any meaningful decisions about his defense: what witnesses (if any) to call, whether he will take the stand himself, whether he will seek a bench trial or a jury trial \u2014 just to name a few of the more obvious and basic decisions confronting a person accused of a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Due process of law requires, at a minimum, that a defendant be reasonably apprised of the charges against him in the charging document in such a manner that a person of common understanding would know what offense is being charged. <em>State v. Kills On Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 71, 793 P.2d 1273, 1283. In <em>State v. Barker </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 85, 89, 858 P.2d 360, 362, we held that it is \u201celementary\u201d that a party cannot be charged with one offense and convicted of another independent offense. In my opinion, this Court cannot circumvent such a fundamental and \u201celementary\u201d legal proposition by resorting to an assumption that sexual assault is a lesser included offense merely because Black\u2019s counsel has failed to raise the issue in his opening brief. Black\u2019s counsel did contend, in his Issue number two, that Black was convicted of an offense of which he was not charged. In its Answer brief, the State countered that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent and, as such, notice of the lesser included offense is included within the charge of the greater offense. Black, in his Reply brief, argued that sexual assault is not a lesser included offense. Thus, although the issue could have been more artfully raised and addressed, the parties did discuss and brief the issue. Given the fundamental and elementary nature of the issue \u2014 if the trial court were incorrect in assuming that sexual assault is a lesser included offense \u2014 that assumption amounts to plain error which this Court should address regardless of whether defense counsel raised the issue in a proper manner. In <em>State v. Voegele </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 222, 224, 793 P.2d 832, 834, this Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">\u201c[w]hen the substantial rights of a defendant are involved, the lack of timely objection does not preclude us from exercising our power of discretionary review to examine any error at the trial court level.\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 78, 80-81, 746 P.2d 588, 589. This discretionary review under the plain error doctrine provides a remedy to prevent manifest injustice and will only be used in exceptional cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In addressing the power of an appellate court to raise, sua sponte, and determine issues which were not raised either in the trial court or by any of the parties on the appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">The conclusion which we have reached from these cases is that, although <em>ordinarily </em>an appellate court will not consider an issue which has not been raised in the trial court or which has not been raised by the parties on appeal, the court does have the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>do so in exceptional circumstances, where considerations of the new issue is necessary to serve the ends of justice or to prevent a denial of fundamental rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><em>State v. Puckett </em>(Kan. 1982), 640 P.2d 1198, 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It is axiomatic that the right to be put on notice of the crime you are being charged with is a fundamental as well as a \u201csubstantial\u201d right. If we assume that the District Court was incorrect in its assumption, this is one of those \u201cexceptional\u201d cases in which the Court must invoke the doctrine of plain error in order to prevent manifest injustice; the manifest injustice being that Black is deemed to have been put on notice of the crime of sexual assault by virtue of having been charged with sexual intercourse without consent. This result is reached via an assumption (rather than a legal conclusion) that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent. This assumption flies in the face of the notice requirement of the guarantee of due process. Either sexual assault is a lesser included offense or it is not. If it is, then under the law, Black is deemed to have been put on notice of that offense when he was charged with sexual intercourse without consent. If it is not, then Black was not put on notice of the crime of which he was ultimately convicted and his conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">For the above-stated reasons, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to affirm a conviction based upon a mere assumption that sexual assault is a lesser included offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER and JUSTICE HUNT join in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
