Kovash (Myron) appeals from an order of the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, which assessed Myron an arrearage in his child support obligation and his children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses, and modified his prior child support obligation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Kathleen A. Kovash (Kathleen). We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">1. Did the District Court err in determining the amount of Myron\u2019s arrearage?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">2. Did the District Court err by failing to give Myron credit for his payment of the children\u2019s health insurance premiums?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">3. Did the District Court err by ordering that the assessed arrearage may be collected by the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED)?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">4. Did the District Court err in setting the effective date of Myron\u2019s modified child support obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">5. Did the District Court err in determining Kathleen\u2019s gross income?</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">Myron and Kathleen were married on October 16,1976. They had four children during their marriage. The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved on August 31, 1992. Pursuant to the decree of dissolution, Kathleen was granted custody of the four children and Myron was granted limited visitation rights subject to certain conditions. Myron was ordered to pay a total of $493 per month in child support. The District Court also ordered Myron to maintain health insurance for the children through his employer or, if none was available, to pay Kathleen $80 per month to reimburse her for health insurance premiums. The parties were to equally share uncovered medical costs. Myron appealed from the District Court\u2019s findings of facts, conclusions of law and decree. This Court affirmed the District Court in all respects with the exception of a travel restriction placed on Myron. <em>In re Marriage of Kovash </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 44, 858 P.2d 351 <em>(Kovash I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Subsequently, two of the parties\u2019 four children began living with Myron as of September 1, 1993. Myron petitioned the court for a redetermination of child support. On June 24, 1994, the District Court entered its order modifying Myron\u2019s child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">The court found that Myron\u2019s new obligation was $322.83 per month and that Kathleen\u2019s support obligation was $34.93 per month, leaving Myron with a net support obligation of $287.90 per month. The court ordered that the new child support amount would be effective as of September 29, 1994. The court also found Myron in arrears a total of $7,678 through September of 1993. The court determined the amount of arrearage by finding that through Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ber of 1993, Myron owed $5,576 in back child support, $502 in uncovered medical expenses and $1,600 representing one-half of the cost of braces for one child\u2019s teeth. The order was not intended to preclude a finding of further arrears that may have occurred since September of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Myron filed motions for reconsideration or modification of the court\u2019s order. Because the court failed to decide Myron\u2019s post-order motions within 45 days, they were deemed denied pursuant to Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.R Myron appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">In previous cases, we have stated that we review findings of fact in child support modification cases to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Barnard </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 103, 106, 870 P.2d 91, 93 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Durbin </em>(1992), 251 Mont. 51, 55, 823 P.2d 243, 245). However, in other areas of marital law, we review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., In re Marriage of Taylor </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 122, 125-26, 848 P.2d 478, 480 (findings regarding division of marital estate); <em>In re Marriage of Eschenbacher </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 139, 142, 831 P.2d 1353, 1355 (findings regarding maintenance award). There is no reason for this inconsistency. Therefore, from this time on we will review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in child support modification cases to determine whether they are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">We will continue to review a district court\u2019s overall decision on modification of child support awards to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Hill </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 52, 57, 874 P.2d 705, 707. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of law was correct. <em>Marriage of Barnard, </em>870 P.2d at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\n<em>Issue 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">Did the District Court err in determining the amount of Myron\u2019s arrearage?</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The District Court concluded that Myron was $5,576 in arrears in child support payments for the time up to and including September of 1993. Myron contends, and Kathleen concedes, that this amount is incorrect. The parties stipulated that through August of 1993, Myron was $2,316 in arrears in child support payments. Myron contends that this stipulation was binding and that the court erred by finding a child support arrearage over $2,316.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>We disagree with Myron\u2019s contention that the court was bound by the stipulation. \u201cParties cannot make binding agreements, oral or written, as to support, custody or visitation of children.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Mager </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 78, 80-81, 785 P.2d 198, 200. However, the record does not support the court\u2019s assessment of $5,576 in child support arrearage through September of 1993. The $2,316 figure appears to be the correct child support arrearage amount from the date the dissolution decree was entered through August of 1993. Even considering a possible pre-decree child support arrearage and those for the month of September 1993, the District Court\u2019s amount of $5,576 is inflated. We hold that there is not substantial credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding of $5,576 as Myron\u2019s amount of child support arrearage through September of 1993. Thus, the District Court\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. We reverse the court\u2019s determination and remand for redetermination of the proper amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Next, the District Court included $1,600, one-half the cost of braces, in the amount of Myron\u2019s arrearage. Myron argues that this amount cannot be considered an arrearage as it has not yet been incurred. We agree. Myron is responsible for one-half of the uncovered medical expenses. However, medical expenses must first be incurred before they can be considered in the arrearage. Half of the expense will be Myron\u2019s responsibility, and the court may order payment of this amount including one-half of the down payment required to commence the orthodontic work, but it may not be considered an arrearage at this time. Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that Myron is $1,600 in arrears for payments on braces for his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In determining Kathleen\u2019s child support obligation, the District Court also gave Kathleen a credit of $75 per month for payments she would have to make for the braces. Including the amount to be paid for braces in Kathleen\u2019s child support calculation distorts the amount of each party\u2019s child support obligation. The dissolution decree declared that the parties are to equally share the amount of uncovered medical expenses. On remand, to avoid distortion in the guideline amount of each party\u2019s child support obligation, the District Court should exclude any amount for payments on the braces in its guideline calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Finally, the District Court concluded that Myron was $502 in arrears for uncovered medical expenses. Myron argues that Kathleen testified that she had paid a total of $358 in medical expenses and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>therefore, he is responsible for only one-half of that amount. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Kathleen introduced two exhibits representing amounts still owed for the children\u2019s medical needs and amounts that she had paid for the children\u2019s outstanding medical expenses. The $358 Kathleen testified to represented only the amount she believed she had already paid toward the uncovered medical expenses. Accordingto the parties\u2019 decree of dissolution, Myron is responsible for one-half of the children\u2019s uncovered medical expenses, not just those which Kathleen has already paid. Combining the amounts that Kathleen\u2019s exhibits show she actually paid and the total amounts still due, it is apparent that the District Court\u2019s finding that Myron was $502 in arrears in unpaid medical expenses is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>Issue 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Did the District Court err by failing to give Myron credit for his payment of the children\u2019s health insurance premiums?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In redetermining Myron\u2019s child support obligation, the District Court did not credit Myron with any amounts he paid for the children\u2019s health insurance premiums. Myron testified, without objection or contradiction by Kathleen, that he had obtained health insurance for the children through his employer. The testimony of one witness is generally sufficient for the proof of any fact. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-301, MCA. We hold that the District Court erred by failing to include this expense in its redetermination of the parties\u2019 child support obligations. The estimated amount Myron expended on the children\u2019s insurance coverage was $44 per month. On remand, the District Court should include this figure in its determination of the parties\u2019 child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>Issue 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Did the District Court err by ordering that the assessed arrearage may be collected by the CSED?</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The District Court concluded that the CSED could collect the arrearage, including the $502 Myron was in arrears for uncovered medical expenses and $1,600 for one-half the cost of braces. Myron contends that Montana statutes only provide the authority for the CSED to collect arrears for child support and amounts for health insurance, not uncovered medical expenses or the cost of braces.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">We have already determined that the District Court erred in assessing Myron an arrearage for the unincurred costs of the braces. We need only determine whether the Montana legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>granted the CSED the authority to collect an arrearage of uncovered medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Kathleen contends that the definition of \u201csupport order\u201d contained in \u00a7 40-5-403, MCA, indicates that medical expenses may be collected by the CSED. Section 40-5-403(7), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-5\">\u201cSupport order\u201d means an order of the district court of the state of Montana ... that provides a set and determinable amount for temporary or final periodic payments of funds for the support of a child. Support order further includes the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">(a) an order for reimbursement of public assistance money paid by a public agency for the benefit of a minor child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(b) an order for maintenance to be paid to a former spouse when the former spouse is the custodial parent of a child for whom child support is awarded under the same order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">(c) an order requiring payment of interest due on unpaid judgments for child support.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">In interpreting statutes, we must give language its plain meaning. <em>Stansbury v. Lin </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 245, 249, 848 P.2d 509, 511. If the legislature\u2019s intent can be determined from the plain meaning of the words used in a statute, we will go no further. <em>State ex rel. Neuhausen v. Nachtsheim </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 296, 299, 833 P.2d 201, 204 (citation omitted). It is the function of the courts to ascertain and declare what, in terms or substance, is contained in a statute; it is not our function to insert what has been omitted. Neuhausen, 833 P.2d at 204 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The plain statutory language indicates that the legislature intended to grant the CSED the power to collect periodic child support payments. The statute makes no mention of medical expenses. We hold that the legislature did not intend to grant the CSED the authority to collect delinquent medical expense payments. It is the legislature\u2019s prerogative to give the CSED that power if it so chooses, but that is not the function of this Court. We hold that the District Court misinterpreted the law and erred by ordering that the CSED may collect the amount Myron is in arrears in uncovered medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\n<em>Issue 4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Did the District Court err in setting the effective date of Myron\u2019s modified child support obligation?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">The District Court ordered that the modified monthly amount of child support due would be effective September 29,1994. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>stipulated, for the purpose of child support determination, that two of the children began living with Myron as of September 1, 1993. Myron filed his petition for modification of child support on September 29, 1993. In February of 1994, the parties entered into a stipulation that the modified child support obligation would be retroactive to September of 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Again, stipulations involving child support, custody or visitation are not binding on the court. <em>Marriage of Mager, </em>785 P.2d at 200. However, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in determining that the child support modification would not be effective until September 29, 1994. In determining the effective date for the support modification, the court apparently gave no weight to the de facto custody arrangement in effect since September of 1993. Continuing Myron\u2019s original child support obligation, which was determined when Kathleen had all four children in her custody, for an entire year after Myron had custody of two of the children does not reflect the realities of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">A court may modify a decree regarding child support only as to installments accruing after the parties have been provided actual notice of the motion for modification. <em>See </em>\u00a7 40-4-208(1), MCA. Myron filed for modification of child support on September 29,1993. Therefore, the effective date of the child support modification should be September 29, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>Issue 5</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Did the District Court err in determining Kathleen\u2019s gross income?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">For the purpose of determining child support, the District Court assigned Kathleen an annual gross income amount of $10,560. Myron contends that this amount is incorrect and that Kathleen should have an imputed annual income of $15,600. He argues that Kathleen was working at a federal job earning approximately $7.50 an hour before leaving that job in June of 1993. Since leaving the job, Kathleen has been indicted, but not convicted, for stealing federal money while employed by the federal government.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Myron contends that the situation in this case is similar to that in <em>Mooney v. Brennan </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 197, 848 P.2d 1020. In <em>Mooney, </em>a majority of this Court held that a father who was being sent to prison did not qualify for a modification of his child support obligation. The majority reasoned that the father\u2019s pre-incarceration income should be imputed to him because committing the crime which resulted in his imprisonment was a choice rather than an involuntary change in circumstances. Also, the obligor should not profit by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>criminal conduct at the expense of his children. <em>Mooney, </em>848 P.2d at 1023 (quoting <em>Willis v. Willis </em>(Or.Ct.App. 1991), 820 P.2d 858, 860, rev\u2019d (Or. 1992), 840 P.2d 697).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Mooney. </em>Here, Kathleen had custody of all four children at the time she stopped working for the federal government. Since Kathleen had no child support payment obligations at the time she ceased working for the federal government, it cannot be said that she left her federal job to escape her support responsibilities. We hold that it was not clearly erroneous for the District Court to find Kathleen\u2019s gross income to be $10,560 for the purpose of child support calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-6\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, HUNT, NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
