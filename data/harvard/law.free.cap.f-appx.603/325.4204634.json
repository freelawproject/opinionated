He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, in which he sought a sentence reduction pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act (FSA) and Amendment 750 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Chopane argues that although he was sentenced pursuant to a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement, the record reflects that the district court considered the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the plea agreement in determining the appropriate sentence. He further asserts that the district court had the discretion to reduce his sentence in view of <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>636 F.3d 713, 717 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">Chopane was sentenced pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to 180 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. The plea agreement did not expressly state that the sentence would be determined pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines and the 180-month sentence was not based on the advisory guidelines range. The district court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Cho-pane in accordance with it. Because Cho-pane\u2019s sentence was not derived from the quantity of cocaine involved in the offense under the Guidelines, the district court had no authority to reduce Chopane\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>560 U.S. 817, 826-27, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). The district court did not have discretion to reduce Chopane\u2019s sentence under <em>Freeman </em>because the plea agreement did not expressly state that the sentence would be determined pursuant to the Sentence Guidelines, and the sentence specified by the agreement was not based on the applicable advisory guidelines range. <em>See Freeman, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2699-2700 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Chopane\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Henderson, 636 </em>F.3d at 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b350-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
