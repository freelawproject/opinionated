We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Alwan filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 alleging that he was \u201cfalsely accused and convicted of murder, conspiracy and robbery\u201d because: (1) he never received a copy of the arrest warrant, the search warrant, the probable cause affidavit, and \u201cany documents related to the extradition agreement\u201d; (2) Robert Gray, who had confessed to the crime, had recanted any statements implicating Alwan, and had testified at Alwan\u2019s preliminary hearing and his trial that Alwan was actually innocent; (3) a Judge improperly denied Al-wan\u2019s requests for discovery and delayed his trial date; (4) Alwan wrote a letter to another Judge, complaining of these purported errors; and (5) despite Gray\u2019s testimony exonerating him, Alwan was \u201cfalsely\u201d convicted. Alwan\u2019s complaint named as defendants several Judges of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, prosecutors in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office, police officers, and criminal defense attorneys \u2014 all of whom, Alwan alleged, \u201cconspired against his rights\u201d by \u201cdepriv[ing] him of the right to a fair public trial by an impartial jury.\u201d Alwan sought an order requiring the defendants to \u201cidentify, produce and certify ... any and all documents that either incriminate and/or exonerate [him]\u201d as well as a declaration that his rights were violated. In addition, Alwan requested that the District Court refer his case to the United States Attorney for the initiation of criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-15\">The District Court dismissed Alwan\u2019s complaint pursuant to its screening obligations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The District Court concluded that: (1) though Alwan\u2019s complaint mentioned 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982, those statutes have no application to his claims; (2) Alwan\u2019s claims \u2014 that he was maliciously prosecuted, falsely convicted on fabricated evidence, denied a fair and speedy trial, and denied access to exculpatory material \u2014 are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), <em>see also Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005) (\u201c[A] state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is barred (absent prior invalidation) \u2014 no matter the relief sought (damages or equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction or internal prison proceedings) \u2014 if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ty of confinement or its duration.\u201d); (3) to the extent Alwan alleged claims of false arrest or false imprisonment, and to the extent those claims were not barred by <em>Heck, see Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 395 n. 5, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007), they are time-barred by the statute of limitations, <em>see id. </em>at 389, 127 S.Ct. 1091 and the one-year statute of limitations in \u00a7 1986; and (4) amendment of his complaint would be futile, <em>see Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp., </em>293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Alwan appealed. We have jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s dismissal order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial questions. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We conclude that there is no arguable basis to challenge the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Alwan\u2019s complaint, for the reasons set forth in the District Court\u2019s memorandum. We also agree that amendment of his complaint would be futile. <em>Grayson, </em>293 F.3d at 108. Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b93-12\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
