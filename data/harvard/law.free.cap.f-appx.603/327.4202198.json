Betancourt, </em>586 F.3d 303, 308-09 (5th Cir.2009), which held that knowledge of drug type and quantity is not an element of the offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Mercado also requests a remand for the limited purpose of correcting the judgment under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36 to reflect that he was acquitted on count one. The government joins in requesting remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-24\">Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment is AFFIRMED and REMANDED with instruction to correct the judgment pursuant to Rule 36 to reflect that Mercado was found not guilty on count one. The government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file its brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b351-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
