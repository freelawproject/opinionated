In imposing sentence, the court stated that, despite the fact that Rodriguez-Oro was subject to deportation, a term of supervised release was appropriate because the threat of prosecution upon any future reentry would not be a sufficient deterrent due to the fact that \u201cthere are 15 million or so illegal aliens in the United States right now who are not being prosecuted.\u201d Rodriguez-Oro appeals his sentence, arguing that the imposition of the one-year term of supervised release is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Zinn, </em>821 F.3d 1084, 1087 (11th Cir.2003). We review the substantive reasonableness of the term of supervised release for abuse of discretion, after ensuring that the term is procedurally reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583, a district court may impose a term of supervised release as part of \u25a0 its sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a). In determining whether to include such a term, the length of the term and the conditions of the release, the court \u201cshall consider the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 ] 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), (a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).\u201d <em>Id. </em>3583(c). These factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; the kinds of sentences available; the applicable guideline range; the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; and the need to deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct, and avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, the court may order a term of supervised release when such a term is not required by statute and the court does not order a term of imprisonment of more than one year. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(a)-(b). However, when the defendant is an alien likely to be deported after imprisonment, the court \u201cordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5Dl.l(c). The application notes explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-12\">Unless such a defendant legally returns to the United States, supervised release is unnecessary. If such a defendant illegally returns to the United States, the need to afford adequate deterrence and protect the public ordinarily is adequately served by a new prosecution. The court should, however, consider imposing a term of supervised release on such a defendant if the court determines it would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-13\"><em>Id. </em>cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the court erred in calculating the Guidelines sentence range, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>plain the sentence. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory, the court must treat them as the \u201c \u2018starting point and the initial benchmark.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 49, 128 S.Ct. at 596). The Supreme Court has recognized that the Sentencing Commission has the capacity courts lack to \u201cbase its determinations on empirical data and national expei'ience, guided by a professional staff with appropriate expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108-09, 128 S.Ct. at 574 (quotation marks omitted). On the other hand, the sentencing judge has greater familiarity with the individual case and individual defendant and is in a superior position to find facts and weigh their import under the instructions set out in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 109, 128 S.Ct. at 574. Given these institutional strengths, the Supreme Court has stated that a district judge\u2019s decision to vary from the Guidelines sentence range may attract greatest respect when the judge finds a particular case \u201coutside the \u2018heartland\u2019 to which the Commission intends individual Guidelines to apply,\u201d while closer review may be in order when the judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the view that the Guidelines sentence range \u201c \u2018fails properly to reflect \u00a7 3553(a) considerations\u2019 even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109, 128 S.Ct. at 574-75 (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We conclude that the District Court committed procedural error in imposing the one-year term of supervised release. First, the sole fact the court cited for the imposition lacked evidentiary support. <em>Cf. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1091. The court found that Rodriguez-Oro would likely not be prosecuted upon any future reentry based solely upon the number of illegal aliens in the United States who are not being prosecuted. The record, including the PSI, contains nothing to support that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Second, we find nothing in the record indicating that the court considered the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or explained why the recommendation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) should not be followed. <em>Cf. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1090-91; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c). The court\u2019s reason for imposing supervised release therefore appears not to have been based on any \u00a7 3553(a) factor or any fact specific to Rodriguez-Oro\u2019s case, but, instead, on a factually unsupported disagreement with the underlying premise of the relevant Guidelines provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">Accordingly, we vacate Rodriguez-Oro\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.-<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\">. The presentence investigation report (\"PSI\u201d) fixed Rodriguez-Oro\u2019s total offense level at <em>6, see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2 and 3El.l(a), and his criminal history category at I. This yielded a sentence range of zero to six months\u2019 imprisonment and a supervised release term of up to one year. Neither party objected to the PSI\u2019s factual recitations or sentence range calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b919-7\">.
