Hopkins, Jr., appeals his 48-month imprisonment sentence following his guilty plea to being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">On March 12, 2013, a deputy with the Escambia County Sheriffs Office (\u201cECSO\u201d) saw Hopkins standing beside the open passenger door of a parked car at an apartment complex in Pensacola, Florida. When he noticed the deputy, Hopkins immediately closed the car door. As the deputy approached, several other individuals left the area of the car and walked in different directions. Hopkins told the deputy he and others were just hanging out. When the deputy looked into the car window, he saw a plastic baggie containing a white-rock substance, which tested to be .4 grams of crack cocaine. While retrieving the crack cocaine from the car, the deputy saw underneath the passenger seat a Glock Model 30, .45 caliber gun, loaded with 11 rounds of ammunition. Hopkins\u2019s DNA was found on the gun. The deputy also found a pocket knife with white residue on it in Hopkins\u2019s pants pocket; the white residue tested positive for cocaine. The deputy additionally found an unspecified amount of cocaine in the driver\u2019s door of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">On April 19, 2013, an ECSO deputy saw Hopkins and another individual standing under the stairwell of an apartment complex in Pensacola. After the deputy exited his car, he saw Hopkins walk to and lean toward a large bush beside the stairwell. The deputy saw Hopkins remove an object from his pocket and drop it into the bush. The deputy approached Hopkins and saw on the ground below the bush a Jimenez Model JA Nine, 9mm pistol, loaded with eight rounds of ammunition in the magazine clip and one live round in the chamber. Hopkins\u2019s DNA was found on the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-15\">On July 25, 2013, an ECSO deputy conducted a traffic stop of a Chevrolet Impala in Pensacola. As the deputy stepped out of his car, the driver of the Impala ran away. Hopkins was the passenger in the front passenger seat of the Impala. An ECSO K-9 unit conducted a walk-around of the Impala; the dog alerted on the driver\u2019s side door. A search of the Impala revealed a loaded Raven Arms handgun with a scratched-off serial number and five rounds of .25 caliber ammunition inside the center.console. Also in the center console, officers found a pouch containing powder cocaine, crack cocaine, marijuana, and a set of digital scales. The drugs had been separated into plastic baggies commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>used for drug sales. Inside the glove compartment, officers found another plastic baggie of crack cocaine and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">A federal grand jury charged Hopkins with two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). The indictment charged Hopkins with having previously been convicted of a felony, knowingly possessing a gun and ammunition on March 12, 2013 (\u201cCount One\u201d), and knowingly possessing a gun and ammunition on April 19, 2013 (\u201cCount Two\u201d). Hopkins pled guilty to both counts without a plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Hopkins had an offense level of 21, including (1) a two-l\u00e9vel enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), because the offense involved three to seven firearms; (2) a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B), because one of the firearms had an altered or obliterated serial number; and (3) a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), because he had used or possessed a firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Hopkins objected to all three enhancements. He contended the enhancements improperly were based on his uncharged July 25, 2013, conduct and argued there was insufficient evidence he possessed the Raven Arms gun recovered in the Impala. Specifically, he maintained (1) he was a passenger in the Impala, not its owner; (2) he had no knowledge of the gun or the drugs in the center console; (3) the gun was not in plain view; (4) after his arrest, he told law enforcement he had no knowledge of the gun or drugs; (5) no DNA or fingerprint evidence connected him to the gun; and (6) there was no evidence concerning his. relationship to the driver of the Impala.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">At Hopkins\u2019s sentencing, ECSO Deputy Jason Thomas van Ansbach-Young testified for the government and stated he had arrived at the traffic stop on July 25, 2013, after another deputy had called for backup. He had searched the Impala and found the drugs, scales, and gun in the center console, as well as the drugs in the glove compartment. He stated the center console was accessible to someone sitting in the front passenger seat of the Impala, and miscellaneous paperwork with Hopkins\u2019s name on it was found in the trunk and throughout the car. Based on his training and experience, the deputy testified the drugs in the glove compartment and center console were packaged in a way that indicated distribution. He stated Hopkins\u2019s fingerprints were found on the driver\u2019s side-door frame of the Impala, although no fingerprints were found on the Raven Arms gun. Kimberly McGrain, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives testified no determination could be made regarding the presence of DNA on the Raven Arms gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">The district judge overruled Hopkins\u2019s objection the government had failed to prove he possessed the Raven Arms gun and found the totality of the circumstances made clear Hopkins \u201cwas there involved in drug activity, and has a history of drugs and guns, and that\u2019s what was happening that day.\u201d R. at 200. He further explained that Hopkins\u2019s \u201cimprimatur was all over the car in terms of paperwork, fingerprints, and drug paraphernalia.\u201d R. at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">Hopkins renewed his objection to the four-level enhancement for use of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). He argued the March 12, 2013, offense did not involve drug trafficking but merely the possession of -a small amount of drugs. He acknowledged the district judge might rely on the uncharged conduct from July 25, 2013, to impose the enhancement but maintained he objected to the enhancement and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>court\u2019s finding he possessed the Raven Arms gun at the July 25 incident. The judge determined the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) enhancement was proper, not based on the drugs found on March 12 but because of the July 25 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">A. Enhancements for Three to Seven Firearms_under_U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) and Possession of a Firearm with an Obliterated Serial Number under \u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(4)(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">On appeal, Hopkins argues the district judge erred in imposing a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) for possessing between three and seven firearms and a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B) for possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number, because both were based on the conclusion Hopkins possessed the firearm recovered on July 25, 2013. The judge, however, identified no facts to support that conclusion. He contends no evidence showed he knew of or intended to exercise control over the Raven Arms gun, and his mere presence in the vicinity of the gun was insufficient to prove constructive possession. Hopkins argues the district judge improperly based the conclusion he possessed the Raven Arms gun on his past conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">For Sentencing Guidelines issues, we review \u201cpurely legal questions <em>d\u00e9 novo,\u201d </em>and a district judge\u2019s \u201cfactual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d 621, 624 (11th Cir.2010). In most cases, a judge\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts is reviewed with due deference, which is \u201ctantamount to clear error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFor a finding to be clearly erroneous, this Court must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">In determining a defendant\u2019s specific offense characteristics, a district judge must consider all of the defendant\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a). \u201cRelevant conduct\u201d includes all acts by the defendant \u201cthat occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A). Relevant conduct also includes all acts \u201cthat were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">A defendant receives a two-level increase, if the offense involved between three and seven firearms. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A). Additionally, a defendant receives a four-level increase if any firearm had an altered or obliterated serial number. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B). The government bears the burden of proving the applicability of Guidelines provisions that enhance a defendant\u2019s offense level. <em>United States v. Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.1999). Where the defendant challenges the factual basis for his sentence, the government must prove the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence with \u201creliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThis burden requires that the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.\u201d <em>United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1315 (11th Cir.) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 629, 184 L.Ed.2d 408 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-14\">We have explained that a defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm may be actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>661 F.3d 568, 576 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cConstructive possession of a firearm exists when a defendant does not have actual possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>but instead knowingly has the power or right, and intention to exercise dominion and control pver the firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant\u2019s presence near a firearm or mere association with someone else who possesses a firearm is insufficient to prove constructive possession. <em>Id. </em>But \u201c[t]he firearm need not be on or near the defendant\u2019s person in order to amount to knowing possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Wright, </em>392 F.3d 1269, 1273 (11th Cir.2004)). The government may prove constructive possession by direct or circumstantial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Hopkins focuses his argument on whether there was sufficient evidence to support the district judge\u2019s finding he constructively possessed the Raven Arms gun. He does not raise an argument that the July 25, 2013, conduct was not part of the \u201csame course of conduct\u201d as the charged offenses. In his reply brief, Hopkins states he disputed the factual account of the July 25 incident in his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), in a response to the PSI. We disagree. Hopkins\u2019s arguments challenge the conclusion that the facts in his PSI sufficiently supported a determination that he possessed the Raven Arms gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Hopkins\u2019s argument the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence he constructively possessed the Raven Arms gun falls short. On this record, the district judge\u2019s implicit conclusion Hopkins constructively possessed the Raven Arms gun in the Impala does not elicit \u201ca definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>See Rothen-berg, </em>610 F.3d at 624. Despite a dearth of DNA or fingerprint evidence connecting Hopkins to the Raven Arms gun, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the district judge\u2019s implicit finding that Hopkins knew of its presence and intended to exercise dominion or control over it. <em>See Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 576. The evidence shows Hopkins was in the front passenger seat and had access to the center console, where the Raven Arms gun was found. <em>See id. </em>Hopkins\u2019s fingerprints were present on the driver\u2019s side door frame, and paperwork containing Hopkins\u2019s name was found in the car. The government proved the factual account of the July 25, 2013, incident in the PSI by a preponderance of the evidence with reliable and specific evidence. <em>See Cataldo, </em>171 F.3d at 1321. The judge reasonably could have determined Hopkins was aware of the gun and had the ability and intent to exercise control over it later. <em>See Perez, </em>661 F.3d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Contrary to Hopkins\u2019s assertion, the district judge did not improperly base his conclusion Hopkins possessed the Raven Arms gun on Hopkins\u2019s criminal history. Although the judge mentioned Hopkins\u2019s history, he also had read the PSI, considered the parties\u2019 sentencing memoranda, and heard the witnesses\u2019 testimony at Hopkins\u2019s sentencing. Because the judge did not clearly err in finding that Hopkins possessed the Raven Arms gun, he did not clearly err in imposing' a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) for an offense involving between three and seven firearms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A); <em>Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d at 624. Hopkins also has not disputed the serial number had been scratched off of the Raven Arms gun. Since the district judge did not err in finding Hopkins possessed this gun, he did not clearly err in applying a four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">B. Enhancement for Possession of a Firearm in Connection with Another Felony Offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2,l(b)(6)(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b828-12\">Hopkins additionally argues the evidence was insufficient to find he possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. He contends the district judge improperly imposed a four-level enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). Although the drugs and paraphernalia were found in the same closed console as the firearm, he maintains there was insufficient evidence to link him to those items. Hopkins does not argue the drugs and paraphernalia recovered from the Impala are insufficient to show that a drug-trafficking offense had occurred. Instead, he focuses on the sufficiency of the evidence to establish his involvement in any drug trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The Guidelines provide a four-level enhancement if the defendant \u201cused or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense; or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge, intent, or reason to believe th\u00e1t it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B). This enhancement applies \u201cif the firearm or ammunition facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating,\u201d \u201cany federal, state, or local offense ... punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, regardless of whethfer a criminal charge was brought, or a conviction obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 14(A), (C). The enhancement applies \u201cin the case of a drug trafficking offense in which a firearm is found in close proximity to drugs, drug-manufacturing materials, or drug paraphernalia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 14(B)(ii). We have explained that \u201c[a] firearm found in close proximity to drugs or drug-related items simply <em>has </em>\u2014 without any requirement for additional evidence \u2014 the potential to facilitate the drug offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 92 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">The district judge found Hopkins constructively possessed the Raven Arms gun. Additionally, the judge implicitly determined that Hopkins constructively possessed the drugs and drug paraphernalia in the center console, found his \u201cimprimatur\u201d was on the car, and he was involved in drug trafficking activity on July 25, 2013. R. at 200. His conclusion that Hopkins was involved in drug-trafficking activity does not elicit a definite and firm conviction that a mistake was made, given: (1) Hopkins\u2019s presence in the immediate vicinity of the drugs; (2) the drugs were packaged in a way that indicated distribution; (3) his ability to access the drugs and scales from his passenger seat; and (4) the finding he was aware of the presence of the Raven Arms gun, which was next to the pouch containing drugs and scales in the center console. <em>See Rothenberg, </em>610 F.3d at 624. Because the Raven Arms gun was found in close proximity to the drugs and scale, it had the potential of facilitating a drug trafficking offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B) &amp; cmt. n. 14(B)(ii); <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 92. Under these circumstances, the enhancement applies. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 14(B)(ii). The district judge did not err in imposing the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
