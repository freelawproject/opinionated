He was sentenced to 360 months in prison, which is less than the advisory guideline sentence of life. On appeal, Cruz contends that his plea was invalid because the district court participated in plea negotiations, thereby violating Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Cruz did not raise this claim in the district court, so we review it for plain error. <em>See United States v. Davila, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2139, 2147, 186 L.Ed.2d 139 (2013). To succeed, Cruz must show that a forfeited error was \u201cclear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute,\u201d and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>see </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(h). Even if he does so, we have the discretion to correct the error if we conclude that it seriously affects the integrity, fairness, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Rule 11(c)(1) provides a \u201cbright line rule\u201d and \u201can absolute prohibition on all forms of judicial participation in or interference with the plea negotiation process.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>720 F.3d 561, 570 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). To determine whether a judge\u2019s participation in plea discussions affected a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, we consider \u201cwhether it was reasonably probable that, but for the [judge\u2019s] exhortations, [the defendant] would have exercised his right to go to trial.\u201d <em>Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2150. The effect of the judge\u2019s \u201ccomments should be assessed, not in isolation, but in light of the full record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">Although at the start of the plea hearing Cruz said he wanted to plead guilty, defense counsel asked the court to address some concerns that Cruz had previously expressed to counsel. The court said, among many other things, \u201c[T]here are some advantages to entering a plea because most often, now there\u2019s no guarantee, but most often you get a somewhat lesser sentence if you do enter a plea. No guarantee, but that\u2019s the case.\u201d The court went on to explain clearly that the .choice to plead was Cruz\u2019s alone and that the actual sentence could not yet be determined. The court later explained that Cruz faced up to a life sentence if he pleaded guilty and that there was no assurance that Cruz would get credit for accepting responsibility because there was already a jury waiting and ready for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">Cruz has not shown that the court\u2019s generalization about possibly lower sentences for guilty pleas was a violation of Rule 11(c)(1) beyond \u201creasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Moreover, even if the brief remark was a violation of the rule, the record as a whole firmly establishes that it could not reasonably have affected Cruz\u2019s decision to plead guilty. <em>See Davila, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2149-50. Cruz\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
