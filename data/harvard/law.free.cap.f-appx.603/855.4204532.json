His petition raised multiple grounds for relief, including that the court had wrongly imposed three-year terms of supervised release for his convictions of aggravated identity theft, instead of the statutory one-year maximum; he was wrongly ordered to pay restitution covering losses and victims that were unrelated to his offenses; and his trial .attorney had rendered ineffective assistance during the plea colloquy that resulted in violations of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. In dismissing the instant \u00a7 2241 petition, the district court concluded that Allen had not met the requirements under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-19\">On appeal, Allen argues that the district court failed to fully review the arguments and evidence he had submitted to show that he met all of the requirements of the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. He asserts that the court instead simply concluded in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>order that he could not demonstrate that \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention because \u201chis challenge to his sentence [was] foreclosed by\u201d <em>Gilbert v. United States, </em>640 F.3d 1293 (11th Cir.2011). The fact that the court ignored the very evidence that would allow it to hear the issues in the \u00a7 2241 petition constituted a denial of due process. Second, Allen argues that his three-year terms of supervised release, which exceeded the statutory maximum for convictions of aggravated identity theft, qualify as a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d in sentencing that ultimately would allow him to seek relief under \u00a7 2241. Lastly, Allen argues that, for purposes of \u201copening the portal\u201d to the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause, a \u00a7 2255 motion would qualify as an \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201cineffective\u201d remedy to address technical violations of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, since the Supreme Court barred such \u00a7 2255 claims in <em>United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The availability of habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). The \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, however, permits a federal prisoner, under very limited circumstances, to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. Under the savings clause, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). We recently held that the savings clause is a jurisdictional provision, such that a petitioner must show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d before the district court has jurisdiction to review the \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Williams v. Warden, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>713 F.3d 1332, 1339-40 (11th Cir.2013), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 52, 190 L.Ed.2d 29 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">In <em>Williams, </em>we noted two necessary, if not sufficient, conditions for a sentencing claim to be viable under \u00a7 2255(e)\u2019s savings clause. <em>Id. </em>at 1343-44. First, the claim must be based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. <em>Id. </em>at 1343. Secondly, the Supreme Court \u201cmust have overturned a circuit precedent that squarely resolved the claim so that the petitioner had no genuine opportunity to raise it at trial, on appeal, or in his first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">In <em>Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir.2013), we faced the question whether a petitioner can use the savings clause to \u201copen the portal\u201d to \u00a7 2241 where an erroneous application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) resulted in a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum. <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1256. We held that, in order to show that his prior \u00a7 2255 motion had been \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention,\u201d Bryant had to establish that: (1) throughout his sentencing, on direct appeal, and the first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, our binding precedent had specifically addressed his distinct prior state conviction that triggered 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and had squarely foreclosed his \u00a7 924(e) claim that he was erroneously sentenced above the ten-year statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a); (2) subsequent to his first \u00a7 2255 proceeding, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), as extended by us to his prior conviction, overturned our precedent that had foreclosed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u00a7 924(e) claim; (3) the new rule announced in <em>Begay </em>applied retroactively on collateral review; (4) as a result of Begay\u2019s new rule being retroactive, Bryant\u2019s current sentence exceeded the ten-year statutory maximum authorized in \u00a7 924(a); and (5) the savings clause in \u00a7 2255(e) reached his pure \u00a7 924(e)-Begay error claim of illegal detention above his statutory maximum penalty in \u00a7 924(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"A5Z\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Allen\u2019s petition because he had failed to open the portal to \u00a7 2241 relief. He has not shown that \u00a7 2255 relief was inadequate or ineffective to challenge his sentences\u2019 legality, as he did not base his claims on retroactively applicable Supreme Court decisions. <em>Bryant, 738 </em>F.3d at 1274; <em>Williams, </em>713 F.3d at 1343. Furthermore, Allen\u2019s claim of a due-process violation by the district court is merit-less, as the court\u2019s written order restated all of Allen\u2019s claims before reviewing the case law and discussing its conclusions. Allen also has pointed to nothing else in the record to substantiate his claim that the court deliberately ignored his arguments that he qualified for \u00a7 2241 relief. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AqxG\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AHR\">.
