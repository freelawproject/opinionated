On appeal, Chandler argues that the district court unlawfully enhanced his sentence by ruling that his prior conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1), which did not require proof that he knew of the illicit nature of the substance, was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d within the meaning of United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Because this Court recently held in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014), that \u201cSection 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes is ... a \u2018controlled substance offense,\u2019 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b),\u201d we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">After Chandler entered his guilty plea, the probation office prepared his presen-tence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d). The probation officer calculated an initial base offense level of 22 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3), because the offense involved a \u201cfirearm that is described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)\u201d \u2014 in this case, a sawed-off shotgun with a barrel less than 18 inches in length \u2014 and he had a prior felony conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Specifically, Chandler had a prior Florida conviction for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a)(l). Two levels each were added under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), because the offense involved three firearms, and under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(B), because one of the firearms had been reported stolen. Finally, as a result of Chandler\u2019s acceptance of responsibility and cooperation with authorities, the probation officer reduced the offense level by three. Chandler\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Chandler qualified for a criminal history category of IV. His resulting advisory guideline range for Counts 1 and 4 was 70 to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment. Count 2 carried a 120-month guideline range, required to be served consecutively to the sentences for Counts 1 and 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">At sentencing, Chandler made no objection to the calculation of the sentencing guideline range. After hearing evidence and considering the arguments of the parties, the district court imposed concurrent 60-month sentences of imprisonment on Counts 1 and 4, below the advisory guideline range, and a consecutive 120-month sentence on Count 2, for a total term of 180 months. *</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">Generally, we review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>89 F.3d 1501, 1505 (11th Cir.1996). However, where, as here, the issue presented on appeal was not raised before the district court, we review for plain error only. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>694 F.3d 1192, 1195 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-14\">Chandler argues that his prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) does not require proof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance. In 2002, the Florida legislature amended \u00a7 893.13 by eliminating knowledge of the illicit nature of a substance as an element of controlled-sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>stance offenses. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.101(1)-(2). Chandler contends that, when applying the categorical approach<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, his \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) conviction does not fit within the generic federal definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d because, unlike analogous federal law, 21 U.S.C. -\u00a7 841(a)(1), the State is not required to establish the defendant\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>of the illicit nature of the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The sentencing provision that Chandler challenges, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3), provides, in relevant part, for a base offense level of 22 if the defendant committed the instant offense after sustaining a felony conviction for a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(3)(B). If-Chandler\u2019s prior conviction did not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d his offense level would have been 20, resulting in a guideline range of 57 to 71 months of imprisonment. The Guidelines define \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d in turn, as \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Chandler\u2019s argument that his Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a) conviction for possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute is not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), because it has no <em>mens rea </em>requirement, is squarely foreclosed by this Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Smith. See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1268. Ae-cording to our decision in <em>Smith, </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) includes \u201ccrimes that do not require an element of <em>mens rea </em>regarding the illicit nature of the controlled substance.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1264. \u201cWe are bound by prior panel decisions unless or until we overrule them while sitting <em>en banc, </em>or they are overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>635 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.2011). Therefore, the district court did not plainly err, and we affirm Chandler\u2019s 180-month sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. <em>See generally Descamps v.
