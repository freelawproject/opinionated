He argues that the district court erred by increasing the statutory maximum sentence based upon a prior aggravated felony conviction that was neither charged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Because Jones\u2019s challenged is foreclosed by precedent, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-27\">We generally review constitutional sentencing issues <em>de novo. United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1248 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>An alien who enters or is found in the United States illegally after previously having been deported is subject to a maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). If the defendant\u2019s removal occurred after a conviction for an aggravated felony, however, the statutory maximum increases to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350, (1998), the Supreme Court held that a prior conviction \u201crelevant only to the sentencing of an offender found guilty of the charged crime\u201d does not have to be charged in an indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, even if it increases the defendant\u2019s maximum statutory sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 228-47, 118 S.Ct. at 1223-33. The Court concluded that subsection (b)(2) of \u00a7 1326 was intended by Congress to be a such a \u201csentencing factor\u201d and not an element of the offense that needed to be charged in the indictment or proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 118 S.Ct. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Two years later, the Supreme Court held that any \u2018Tacts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed\u201d are elements of the crime. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (quotation marks omitted) (concerning statutory maximum penalties). But the Court also carved out an exception for prior convictions covered by <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>despite acknowledging that it was \u201carguable that <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63 (\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Recently, the Supreme Court, consistent with <em>Apprendi, </em>held that \u201c[a]ny fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (concerning mandatory minimum sentences). Nevertheless, the Court also noted specifically that it was not at that time revisiting <em>Almendarez-Toms\u2019s </em>\u201cnarrow exception\u201d for the fact of a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 2160 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">Turning to this Court\u2019s precedent, we have specifically stated that we are \u201cbound by <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201c[W]e are bound to follow <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that de'cision.\u201d). After <em>Alleyne </em>was decided, we recognized that there was \u201csome tension between <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>on the one hand and <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Ap-prendi </em>on the other,\u201d but we again concluded that \u201cwe are not free to do what the Supreme Court declined to do in <em>Alleyne, </em>which is overrule <em>Almendarez-Toms.\u201d United States v. Harris, </em>741 F.3d 1245, 1250 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">Nevertheless, Jones argues that <em>Almen-darez-Torres </em>has been \u201cgravely wounded\u201d by subsequent Supreme Court decisions and asserts that we need not follow that decision because the facts of his case are distinguishable. <em>See, e.g., Jefferson Cnty. v. Acker, </em>210 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201cBut if the facts of a gravely wounded Supreme Court decision do not line up closely with the facts before us \u2014 if it cannot be said that decision \u2018directly controls\u2019 our case \u2014 then, we are free to apply the reasoning in later Supreme Court decisions to the case at hand.\u201d). The crucial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>factual difference, Jones contends, is that the defendant in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>admitted the fact of his prior convictions at the plea hearing, whereas Jones did not. But this Court has held that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>forecloses his argument that the existence of his prior convictions needed to be admitted in his guilty plea or otherwise proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d 627, 635 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 229, 187 L.Ed.2d 171 (2013). Accordingly, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>applies to the facts of Jones\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Because we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>until it is \u201cexplicitly overruled\u201d by the Supreme Court, the district court did not err in increasing Jones\u2019s statutory maximum based on a prior conviction not admitted in a guilty plea or charged in the indictment. <em>Overstreet, </em>713 F.3d at 635; <em>Dowd, </em>451 F.3d at 1253. Accordingly, we affirm Jones\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
