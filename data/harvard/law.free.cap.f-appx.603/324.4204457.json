Walker has abandoned his claims against FFVA by failing to brief them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">With respect to his claims against State Farm, Walker has failed to show that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in State Farm\u2019s favor. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standard as that employed by the district court. <em>Carnaby v. City of Houston, </em>636 F.3d 183, 187 (5th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and may not be thwarted by conclusional allegations, unsupported assertions, or presentation of only a scintilla of evidence. <em>Hathaway v. Bazany, </em>507 F.3d 312, 319 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Mississippi law prohibits direct actions by third parties against insurance companies, except where the third party brings a declaratory action against an insurer who has denied coverage or has indicated that it may deny coverage. Miss. R. Civ. P. 57(b)(2); <em>Mississippi Mun. Liab. Plan v. Jordan, </em>863 So.2d 934, 942 (Miss.2003). State Farm\u2019s documentary evidence, including an affidavit from its employee, unequivocally establishes that State Farm has not denied coverage or indicated that . it will deny coverage. Although Walker argues that a letter his attorney sent to State Farm establishes a denial of coverage, his argument is contradicted by the record evidence, including the letter he references. Because Walker failed to put forward any evidence suggesting the existence of a disputed material fact regarding State Farm\u2019s coverage decision, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of State Farm since Walker\u2019s suit against State Farm was prohibited under Mississippi law. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); <em>Jordan, </em>863 So.2d at \u2022 942.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
