As in the district court, he challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence and argues that it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-21\">Aguirre-Loza\u2019s discretionary, within-guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008). Aguirre-Loza argues that we should not apply the presumption of reasonableness to his sentence that was calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because the guideline is not based on empirical data. He recognizes, however, that his claim is foreclosed by circuit precedent and raises the issue in order to preserve it for further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009). Additionally, Aguirre-Loza avers that his sentence fails to reflect his personal history and characteristics, specifically, the fact that he returned to the United States to earn money to pay for his mother\u2019s surgery. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1). The record at sentencing, uncontroverted by other evidence, \u201cimplies that the district court was aware of and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Losoya, </em>219 F.3d 437, 440 (5th Cir.2000). Aguirre-Loza has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">As to the sentence, Aguirre-Loza contends that it and the guidelines on which it is based overrepresent the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense, which is essentially only an international trespass offense. We previously have rejected this challenge. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 212 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). We have similarly declined to adopt the view that \u00a7 2L1.2 double counts prior convictions by using them to calculate both criminal history and the offense level. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">As to Aguirre-Loza\u2019s arguments that his sentence is greater than necessary to promote the \u00a7 3553(a)(2) factors, these essentially seek a re-weighing of those factors as applied to the facts of his case. \u201c[T]he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). That we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Aguirre-Loza has failed to show that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
