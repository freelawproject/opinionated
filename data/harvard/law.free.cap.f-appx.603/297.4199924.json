Penal Code \u00a7 22.02, and was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision. His deferred adjudication was revoked in 2004 and he was deported in 2006. In 2014, in federal district court, Rodriguez pleaded guilty to illegal reentry subsequent to deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). The district court sentenced him to forty-six months in prison and three years of supervised release. Rodriguez then filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-17\">Counsel appointed to represent Rodriguez on appeal has moved for leave to withdraw and has filed a brief in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>dance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant record reflected therein. Although we concur with the counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no non-frivolous issue for appellate review with regard to most of the issues directly addressed in the <em>Anders </em>brief, the brief fails to adequately address two issues: (1) whether Rodriguez was properly convicted and sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which carries a maximum twenty-year prison term, rather than under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carries a maximum ten-year prison term; and (2) whether the district court erred in calculating Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history score under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 4A1.2(k), which resulted in a criminal history score of three, rather than under \u00a7 4A1.2(f), which would have resulted in a criminal history score of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">First, counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief fails to adequately address whether the district court erred when it sentenced Rodriguez under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). The presentence report (PSR) stated that under \u00a7 1326(b)(2) Rodriguez was subject to a <em>twenty-year </em>maximum sentence for reentry of a removed alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction of an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d The final judgment also cites \u00a7 1326(b)(2) as the sentencing statute. Unlawful reentry of a removed alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction of a felony, as opposed to an aggravated felony, is sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carries a <em>ten-year </em>maximum sentence, as opposed to the twenty-year maximum sentence of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 369 (5th Cir.2009). For Rodriguez\u2019s Texas conviction to qualify as a conviction of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), it must have resulted in a term of imprisonment of at least one year. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (defining \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 1326). We have held that because \u201c[djeferred adjudication probation in Texas does not impose a sentence of imprisonment, and thus does not involve a \u2018term of imprisonment,\u2019\u201d deferred adjudication cannot be considered a conviction of an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>Mond,ra,gon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 368-69; <em>United States v. Arias, </em>481 Fed.Appx. 234, 235 (5th Cir.2012) (unpublished) (applying <em>Mondragon-Santiago </em>and reasoning that revocation of a deferred adjudication is irrelevant for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief fails to analyze whether the district court properly applied \u00a7 1326(b)(2) instead of \u00a7 1326(b)(1). Instead, counsel suggests that an appeal of the issue would be frivolous because, even if the district court should have applied \u00a7 1326(b)(1), the sentencing statute had no impact on the sentence the district court ultimately imposed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But, if Rodriguez was improperly convicted under a statute with double the sentencing exposure of the properly applicable statute, it may call into question the voluntariness of Rodriguez\u2019s guilty plea and the corresponding validity of Rodri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>guez\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Dunlap v. United States, </em>462 F.2d 163, 164 (5th Cir.1972) (\u201c[I]n the' event a defendant enters his guilty plea without full knowledge of the maximum consequences thereof, his plea is invalid and must be set aside.\u201d). The PSR available to Rodriguez when he entered his guilty plea may have employed an incorrect sentencing statute, and if so, Rodriguez may not have been aware of the maximum consequences of that guilty plea. Therefore, there may be a non-frivolous argument on appeal that Rodriguez did not knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty or waive his right to appeal his plea. <em>See Baty, </em>980 F.2d at 979-80; <em>Dunlap, </em>462 F.2d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"A5A\">Second, counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief fails to address whether the district court applied the proper U.S.S.G. provision when it calculated Rodriguez\u2019s criminal history score. The court applied \u00a7 4A1.2(k), entitled \u201cRevocations of Probation, Parole, Mandatory Release, or Supervised Release.\u201d Applying \u00a7 4A1.2(k), the district court \u201cadd[ed] the original term of imprisonment\u201d\u2014which it set as zero years for the deferred adjudication community supervision\u2014\u201cto any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation\u201d to calculate the total term of imprisonment, yielding a criminal history score of. three. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(k)(l). Arguably, a plain reading of the guidelines suggests that deferred adjudications should be treated under \u00a7 4A1.2(f), which is entitled \u201cDiversionary Dispositions\u201d and covers diversions of the judiciary process such as deferred adjudications, rather than under \u00a7 4A1.2(k), which expressly contemplates an \u201coriginal term of imprisonment\u201d that is not present in a deferred adjudication. Had the court applied \u00a7 4A1.2(f) rather than \u00a7 4A1.2(k), the guidelines would have yielded a criminal history score of one. Although our precedent does not dictate which one of these two subsections applies here and plain error review sets a high bar for the appellant to overcome, counsel seeking to withdraw under <em>Anders </em>must provide some basis in the <em>Anders </em>brief for this court to review whether a non-frivolous issue exists with respect to how the district court calculated the guideline range. <em>See Garland, </em>632 F.3d at 880. Counsel has failed to meet that minimum standard here because the <em>Anders </em>brief omits any discussion of this issue. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJL\">In sum, after review of the relevant portions of the record, we find that there may be non-frivolous issues on appeal that counsel failed to adequately brief. We do not decide today whether Rodriguez will be able to establish, under plain error review, that the district court\u2019s sentencing errors were clear or obvious and affected Rodriguez\u2019s substantial rights, <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009), or that Rodriguez\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>voluntary. However, when considering counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw under <em>An-ders, </em>\u201cthe question before us is not whether [the defendant] is likely to prevail ..., but instead only whether there is a non-frivolous [ ]argument that even can be offered.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Davis, </em>291 Fed.Appx. 563, 567 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Accordingly, counsel is directed to file supplemental briefing under <em>Anders </em>to address these issues or, in the alternative, file a merits brief. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED, subject to our reconsideration of counsel\u2019s supplemental briefing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">. Counsel's <em>Anders </em>brief does adequately address the district court\u2019s decision not to apply the more lenient \u00a7 1326(a), which carries a two-year maximum sentence. In a single sentence at the conclusion of that analysis, counsel notes that \"there is no indication in the record that Mr. Rodriguez's alleged status as an 'aggravated felon' had any impact at all on his sentence, and his .forty-six-month prison sentence is well below the ten-year statutory maximum even for an offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).\u201d This one-sentence conclusion is inadequate to allow for meaningful review of this issue. <em>See Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 742-43, 87 S.Ct. 1396; <em>United States v. Garland, </em>632 F.3d 877, 880 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AUsj\">. Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief pretermits discussion of Rodriguez\u2019s guilty plea in light of Rodriguez\u2019s written confirmation in the record that he wishes only to appeal his sentence and not his conviction. <em>See Garcia v. United States, </em>483 F.3d 289, 291 (5th Cir.2007) (holding that counsel may only pretermit analysis of a guilty plea in an <em>Anders </em>brief with documented confirmation that the defendant decided to forgo a challenge to the plea). Whether Rodriguez knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his plea, notwithstanding the documentation of Rodriguez\u2019s waiver, may depend on whether the district court erroneously sentenced Rodriguez under a subsection of the statute that carries a higher maximum sentence than Rodriguez should actually have been exposed to. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Baty, </em>980 F.2d 977, 979-80 (5th Cir.1992) (\"[The defendant] did not effectively waive her right to appeal because she did not understand the consequences of the waiver when she pled guilty.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
