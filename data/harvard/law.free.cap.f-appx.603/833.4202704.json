(\u201cMetro\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s (1) grant of summary judgment in favor of Metro\u2019s insurer, Transportation Insurance Company (\u201cTIC\u201d) and (2) denial of Metro\u2019s motion for reconsideration. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">Metro is a real estate brokerage firm conducting business in Georgia. Metro maintained bank accounts with Fidelity Bank (\u201cBank\u201d) and used the Bank\u2019s online system to make payments from Metro\u2019s accounts. On 10 December 2011, thieves logged into the Bank\u2019s online banking system using a Metro employee\u2019s access ID and password. Then, using a randomly generated single-transaction security code, the thieves authorized various payments\u2014 totaling over $188,000 \u2014 from a Metro client escrow account to several other bank accounts. Over $154,000 of the stolen funds remains unrecovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Although the exact details of the theft are unknown, the parties agree that all available evidence suggests that the thieves used a key-logger virus known as \u201cZeus\u201d (which was found on several Metro computers) to gain access to Metro employee access IDs and passwords.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Metro filed a claim for the loss under Metro\u2019s insurance policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) with TIC. TIC denied coverage based on the Policy\u2019s malicious-code and system-penetration exclusions. Metro, on the other hand, contends that the loss is not excluded and is covered by the Policy\u2019s Fraud and Alteration (\u201cF <em>&amp; </em>A\u201d) endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">In two detailed and well-reasoned opinions, the district court concluded that the Policy did not cover Metro\u2019s loss and, thus, that TIC was entitled to summary judgment on Metro\u2019s breach of contract claim. The district court determined that Metro\u2019s loss was not covered by the Policy\u2019s F &amp; A endorsement for two reasons: (1) the fraudulent electronic transfers did not involve a \u201ccheck, draft, promissory note, bill of exchange, \u2022 or similar written promise, order or direction to pay a sum certain;\u201d and (2) Metro\u2019s loss fell within the Policy\u2019s exclusions for losses caused by malicious code or system penetration. Because Metro\u2019s claim was not covered under the Policy, the district court granted summary judgment for TIC on Metro\u2019s claims for breach of contract and for bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Harrison v. Benchmark Elecs. v. Huntsville, Inc., </em>593 F.3d 1206, 1211 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Under Georgia law, \u201c[a]n insurance policy is governed by the ordinary rules of contract construction.\u201d <em>Banks v. Bhd. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>301 Ga.App. 101, 686 S.E.2d 872, 874 (2009). Whether the language in an insurance policy is ambiguous is a matter of law for the court to decide. <em>Id. </em>\u201cExtrinsic evidence to explain ambiguity in a contract becomes admissible only when a contract remains ambiguous after the pertinent rules of construction have been applied.\u201d <em>Claussen v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>259 Ga. 333, 380 S.E.2d 686, 687 (1989). \u201cWhen the language of a policy is unambiguous and capable of but one reasonable construction, we enforce the contract as written.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>686 S.E.2d at 874. \u201cThe words used in policies of insurance, as in all other contracts, bear their usual and common significance, and policies of insurance are, as in all other contracts, to be construed in their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Griffin, </em>302 Ga.App. 726, 691 S.E.2d 633, 636 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>Metro argues that its loss is covered by the Policy\u2019s F &amp; A endorsement. We disagree. The Policy\u2019s F &amp; A endorsement provides that TIC \u201cwill pay for loss resulting directly from \u2018forgery\u2019 or alteration of, on, or in any check, draft, promissory note, bill of exchange, or similar written promise, order or direction to pay a sum certain....\u201d The term \u201cforgery\u201d is defined in the Policy as \u201cthe signing of the name of another person or organization with intent to deceive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The electronic fund transfers in this case did not involve a \u201ccheck, draft, promissory note, [or] bill of exchange.\u201d The transfers also cannot be characterized as involving a \u201cwritten promise, order or direction to pay\u201d that was <em>\u201csimilar\u201d </em>to the three enumerated instruments. Under both federal and Georgia law, electronic fund transfers are distinguished from \u2014 and treated <em>differently </em>from \u2014 fund transfers made by check, draft, or bill of exchange. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693a(7) (emphasis added) (the Electronic Fund Transfer Act defines an \u201celectronic fund transfer\u201d as \u201cany transfer of funds, <em>other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, </em>which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument, or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct, or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit an account.\u201d); O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-4A-108 (providing expressly that Georgia\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code on fund transfers does not apply to electronic fund transfers governed by the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Moreover, Metro has also failed to demonstrate that the theft involved the \u201csigning of [a] name,\u201d as required under the Policy\u2019s \u201cforgery\u201d definition. Although the thieves used the stolen access ID and password to access the Bank\u2019s online system (and then used a randomly generated security code to authorize the transfers), nothing establishes that doing so constituted the \u201csigning of the name of another person or organization\u201d under the terms of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">First, nothing about the Policy\u2019s provision that \u201csignatures that are produced or reproduced electronically\u201d will be considered \u201cthe same as handwritten signatures\u201d \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 establishes that an access ID and password constitute a \u201csignature\u201d (electronic or otherwise) within the meaning of the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Second, contrary to Metro\u2019s argument, the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Renshaw, </em>151 Ga.App. 80, 258 S.E.2d 744 (1979), does not control here. In <em>Renshaw, </em>the state court concluded a loss resulting from the theft of plaintiffs bank card and personal identification number (PIN) constituted a \u201cforgery\u201d under plaintiffs homeowners insurance policy. Because the policy contained no definition of the term \u201cforgery,\u201d the court relied on the definitions of \u201cforgery\u201d and \u201cwriting\u201d found in Georgia\u2019s criminal code. The court concluded that the recording of plaintiffs PIN number was a \u201cwriting\u201d within the meaning of Georgia\u2019s criminal code. Here \u2014 unlike in <em>Ren-shaw </em>\u2014 the Policy defined expressly and unambiguously the term \u201cforgery.\u201d Thus, we need not (and must not) rely on Georgia\u2019s criminal code to interpret the Policy\u2019s language. The question of whether the unauthorized use of Metro\u2019s access ID and password was a \u201cwriting\u201d under Georgia\u2019s criminal code has no significance to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Because Metro has failed to demonstrate that its loss was covered under the Policy\u2019s F &amp; A endorsement, TIC was entitled to summary judgment on Metro\u2019s breach of contract claim. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Grayes, </em>216 Ga.App. 419, 454 S.E.2d 616, 618 (1995) (\u201cTo establish a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>case on a claim under a policy of insurance the insured must show the occurrence was within the risk insured against.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AoxM\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Metro\u2019s claim fell under the Policy\u2019s malicious-code exclusion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That the thieves (in some way) used a computer virus to commit then-theft is undisputed. The Policy defines \u201cmalicious code\u201d as including, among other things, \u201ccomputer viruses.\u201d Although Metro argues that the computer virus did not in fact \u201ccause\u201d the loss (because of the thieves\u2019 intervening conduct), the Policy states unambiguously that it does not cover losses \u201ccaused directly or indirectly\u201d by malicious code \u201cregardless of any other cause or event that contributes concurrently or in any sequence to the loss.\u201d Based on this broad (but plain) exclusionary language, we conclude that Metro\u2019s loss is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"AKd\">Because Metro\u2019s loss is not covered by the Policy, Metro\u2019s claims for both breach of contract and for bad faith must fail. <em>See Lawyers Title Ins. Corp. v. Griffin, </em>302 Ga.App. 726, 691 S.E.2d 633, 636-37 (2010) (concluding that, to establish a bad faith claim under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 33-4-6, an insured must show, among other things, that his claim is covered under the insurance policy).</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Aca\"><em> </em>Because we conclude that Metro\u2019s loss is excluded under the malicious-code exclusion, we do not decide whether the loss would also fall under the system-penetration exclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
