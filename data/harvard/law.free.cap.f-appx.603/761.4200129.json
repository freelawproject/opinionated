Campbell, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(d)(3) motion for relief from judgment in his employment discrimination case. Campbell contends that the judgment against him should be vacated because of judge-perpetrated fraud on the court. Campbell also contends for the first time on appeal that the district judge erred by not <em>sua sponte </em>disqualifying herself from ruling on his Rule 60(d)(3) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A89r\">In 2011 Campbell filed a <em>pro se </em>lawsuit against his former employer, the Department of Veteran Affairs, alleging race discrimination, gender discrimination, religious discrimination, and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Following discovery, the VA moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion. Campbell appealed and we affirmed. <em>See Campbell v. Shinseki, </em>546 Fed.Appx. 874 (11th Cir.2013) (unpublished). Applying <em>de novo </em>review, we concluded that the VA had given legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for terminating Campbell and that Campbell had not presented any evidence that the VA\u2019s reasons were pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 876-78.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">Campbell returned to district court and filed a post-judgment motion pursuant to Rule 60(d)(3), which permits a court to \u201cset aside a judgment for fraud on the court.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3). He argued that the district judge, along with the three judges on this Court who affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment, defrauded the court by ignoring his evidence, failing to consider his arguments, and preventing his case from going to a jury. Campbell did not ask the district judge to disqualify herself from deciding his motion. Finding no evidence of fraud on the court, the district court denied Campbell\u2019s motion. This is his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A7b\">Campbell\u2019s contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 60(d)(3) motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A party who seeks relief from judgment on the basis of fraud must establish the fraud by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Booker v. Dugger, </em>825 F.2d 281, 283 (11th Cir.1987). \u201cConclusory averments of the existence of fraud made on information and belief and unaccompanied by a statement of clear and convincing probative facts which support such belief do not serve to raise the issue of the existence of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283-84 (alterations, and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1338 (5th Cir.1978) (\u201cGenerally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated, will constitute a fraud on the court.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQuE\">Campbell\u2019s allegations of judicial misconduct are the very definition of \u201cconelu-sory averments ... [that] do not serve to raise the issue of the existence of fraud.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>825 F.2d at 283-84. Any \u201cfacts\u201d offered in support of Campbell\u2019s belief that the district judge conspired with the three judges on this Court to commit fraud on the court are allegations that go to the merits of his employment discrimination claims, not to the issue of fraud. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>words, Campbell\u2019s motion is a misguided effort to relitigate claims already raised and rejected. As the district court correctly observed, a Rule 60(d)(3) motion is not a proper vehicle to seek review of this Court\u2019s final judgment affirming the district court\u2019s judgment against him. The denial of Campbell\u2019s motion was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Campbell also contends that the district judge committed plain error by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse herself under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 because, as a named participant in the alleged fraud, she had \u201cconstructive notice of a conflict of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although a judge must disqualify herself in any proceeding in which her impartiality might reasonably be questioned or where she actually has a personal bias or prejudice against a party, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) and (b)(1), it is well established that neither \u201cjudicial rulings\u201d nor \u201copinions ... as a result of what [a judge] learned in earlier proceedings,\u201d standing alone, constitute a valid basis for bias or prejudice. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 551, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1155, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Instead, \u201c[t]he bias or prejudice must be personal and extrajudicial; it must derive from something other than that which the judge learned by participating in the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted); <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]t is well settled that the allegation of bias must show that the bias is personal as distinguished from judicial in nature.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Here, Campbell presented no evidence that the district judge was influenced by any personal or extrajudicial bias. Campbell\u2019s only arguments pertaining to impartiality or bias stem from the earlier rulings in this case. Adverse rulings, without some evidence of improper influence, do not constitute bias. <em>Liteky, </em>510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157; <em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651. The district judge\u2019s failure to disqualify herself from ruling on Campbell\u2019s post-judgment motion was not error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-12\">Finally, Campbell\u2019s motion to disqualify Judge Stanley Marcus from hearing the present appeal is DENIED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Campbell\u2019s baseless contention that Judge Marcus should be disqualified because he exercised \u201cintellectual dishonesty and improper analysis\u201d in affirming the district court\u2019s judgment on Campbell\u2019s employment discrimination claims is a far cry from the type of extrajudicial bias that warrants even the consideration of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ACX\">. We review a district court's denial of a Rule 60(b)(3) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cox Nuclear Pharmacy, Inc. v. CTI, Inc., </em>478 F.3d 1303, 1314 (11th Cir.2007). Like a Rule 60(d)(3) motion, a Rule 60(b)(3) motion deals with fraud on the court. We therefore apply the same abuse of discretion standard to Campbell\u2019s Rule 60(d)(3) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A6nJ\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), ,we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">. Campbell concedes that he did not move for recusal; therefore, our review is for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents, </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b787-23\">. Campbell also moved to disqualify Judges Hull and Jordan. Because neither Judge Hull nor Judge Jordan are serving on this panel, those motions are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
