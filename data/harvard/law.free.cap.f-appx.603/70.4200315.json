For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In 1971, Taylor was convicted in Delaware state court of first degree kidnapping and first degree rape. He received two concurrent sentences of life in prison. Taylor was released on parole in 1986 and his parole was later revoked. Taylor was apparently re-paroled several times but each time his parole was revoked. In 2004 and 2005, Taylor filed petitions seeking habeas relief in state and federal court without success. <em>See Taylor v. Carroll, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 05-cv-00030, 2006 WL 278542 (Feb. 6, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In 2012, Taylor filed a complaint in District Court pursuant to 42 U.S.O. \u00a7 1983 against several prison officials and unidentified individuals at the Delaware Department of Corrections Central Offender Records. Taylor alleged that he was awarded good time and meritorious time credits, but that the defendants have withheld the accrued credits and have failed to apply them to reduce his sentence. He stated that when he was convicted, a life sentence was defined as 45 years and could be reduced by good time credits. Taylor claimed that the defendants are improperly applying Delaware\u2019s Truth in Sentencing Act of 1989 to him in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause and that they are viol\u00e1ting his Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment rights. He sought\u2019 money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Taylor and the defendants moved for summary judgment. In granting the defendants\u2019 motion, the District Court ruled that Taylor\u2019s action is barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In the alterna-five, the District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction under the Rooker-Feldman<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> doctrine. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our standard of review is <em>de novo. Renchenski v. Williams, </em>622 F.3d 315, 324 (3d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>the Supreme Court held that a state prisoner\u2019s claim for damages is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 if \u201ca judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence,\u201d unless the prisoner can show that the conviction or sentence has been invalidated. <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 643, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (quoting <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364). The Court in <em>Heck </em>explained that the principle that civil tort actions are not the proper vehicles to challenge the validity of a criminal judgment applies to \u00a7 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement. <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Similarly, in <em>Balisok, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that a claim for damages and declaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging the validity of the procedures used in his disciplinary proceedings to deprive him of good time credits is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983 if a judgment in his favor would necessarily imply the invalidity of the loss of good time credits. <em>Bal-isok, </em>520 U.S. at 643-46, 117 S.Ct. 1584. Restoration of good time credits must be sought in a habeas proceeding. <em>See id. </em>at 643-44,117 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">Taylor contends that he has been deprived of good time and meritorious time credits, not through a disciplinary proceeding, but by the prison\u2019s failure to apply his accrued credits to reduce his sentence. Taylor\u2019s claim is not cognizable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u00a7 1983 because success in his action would establish the invalidity of the duration of his confinement. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544 </em>U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 258 (2005) (\u201ca state prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action is barred (absent prior invalidation) \u2014 no matter the relief sought (damages or equitable relief), no matter the target of the prisoner\u2019s suit (state conduct leading to conviction <em>or </em>internal prison <em>proceedings) </em>\u2014 if success in that action would necessarily demonstrate the invalidity of confinement or its duration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Taylor has not shown that his sentence has been invalidated. As recognized by the District Court, prior to filing his \u00a7 1983 action, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the denial of his mandamus petition seeking to compel the Department of Corrections to apply his accrued credits to reduce his life sentences. <em>Taylor v. Danberg, </em>31 A.3d 77 (table), 2011 WL 5137182 (Del. Oct. 27, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the judgment of the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. <em>Rooker v.
