He contends the district court erred by applying two, two-level enhancements, pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (increase two levels for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with the drug offense), and 2Dl.l(b)(12) (increase two levels for maintaining the premises for the purpose of manufacturing or distributing drugs).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-16\">\u2022Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and a properly preserved objection to an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the advisory Guidelines-sentencing range for use in deciding on th\u00e9 sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, for issues preserved in district court, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Although this court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo, </em>its deciding a \u00a7 2D1.1 enhancement applies is reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Akins, </em>746 F.3d 590, 610 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 707, 190 L.Ed.2d 439 (2014); <em>United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Paredes claims his use of the premises to manufacture and distribute cocaine was incidental or collateral to its use as a residence. He asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>the storage of the cocaine in an unsecure location (the residence\u2019s garage), and his family\u2019s non-involvement with the cochine support this contention. There was no clear error in applying the enhancement; that Pa-redes knowingly maintained a residence primarily for the purpose of storing a controlled substance for later distribution is not \u201cunreasonable or implausible in light of the record as a whole\u201d. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>509 Fed.Appx. 317, 318 (5th Cir.2013); <em>accord </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Regarding the dangerous-weapon enhancement under Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), Paredes claims he possessed the weapon for home-protection purposes. In support, he notes the weapon was stored in the bedroom, roughly 30-40 feet from the garage where the drugs were stored. Nevertheless, a connection between the firearm discovered in the residence and Paredes\u2019 drug-related offense was not \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>62 F.3d 723, 724 (5th Cir.1995); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 11(A); <em>see also, e.g., Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d at 765-66. Further, Paredes\u2019 assertion is a challenge to the court\u2019s credibility determination, which is \u201cpeculiarly within the province\u201d of the district court and will not be disturbed by this court. <em>United States v. Goncalves, </em>613 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u25a0 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
