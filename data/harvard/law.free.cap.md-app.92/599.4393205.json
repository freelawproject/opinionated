Albert Eyler, and the appellees, Joseph G. Eyler and J. Eugene Eyler, are brothers. In this case, they seek a determination as to the validity of certain agreements concerning an interest in a piece of real property that was owned by their late father, Joseph H. Eyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>The parties\u2019 father died on November 22, 1988. Under the terms of his Last Will and Testament, he left the rest, residue, and remainder of his estate to his three sons, the appellant and the appellees, in various proportions. The Will provided that the appellant, J. Albert Eyler, was to receive 50 percent of the residue of the estate, the appellee Joseph G. Eyler was to receive 35 percent thereof, and the appellee J. Eugene Eyler was to receive 15 percent thereof. Part of this residue was an undivided one-third interest which the father owned, as a tenant in common, in a 17.5-acre piece of improved real property in Thurmont, in Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Approximately nine days after his father\u2019s death, the appellant asked his two brothers to sign a document entitled \u201cAgreement between the beneficiaries and heirs of the late Joseph H. Eyler.\u201d The agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cWe the undersigned agree as follows. Our late father had no interest or ownership in parcels of real estate located in Thurmont, Maryland described in a deed dated May 19, 1986 and recorded in book 1339 at page 666 among the land records of Frederick County Maryland. Containing 17.5 acres more or less, improved with a brick residential house, large barn and out buildings, utilized for the operation of the Eyler Stables. Even though said deed conveys V3 interest into Joseph H. Eyler. We further agree that J. Albert Eyler and Josephine H. Eyler, his wife, are sole and total owners of this real estate. We authorize the personal representatives of the estate of Joseph H. Eyler to execute a deed conveying any ownership or title in said parcels of real estate unto J. Albert Eyler and Josephine H. Eyler, his wife, without any payment or compensation unto the estate of Joseph H. Eyler; or we the undersigned, heirs and beneficiaries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAr\">The agreement was signed by all three brothers and was then filed by the appellant in the Estate of Joseph H. Eyler and recorded among the Land Records of Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The appellant and the appellee Joseph G. Eyler are the co-personal representatives of their father\u2019s estate. In Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ber, 1989, the appellant asked Joseph to execute a deed conveying the property in question to him and his wife by reason of the agreement. Joseph refused to do so and challenged the validity of the agreement. When the two co-personal representatives were unable to agree on the final accounting and distribution of the estate, the appellant filed a petition with the Orphans\u2019 Court for Frederick County seeking an order compelling the appellees to sign the deed to the property in question or an order removing Joseph G. Eyler as a co-personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">As a consequence, the appellees filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit Court for Frederick County challenging the validity of the agreement and seeking to have the court declare the agreement invalid, null and void, and unenforceable. With their complaint, the appellees filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by an affidavit of each appellee. The appellant filed an answer and an affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the motion for summary judgment was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Meanwhile, the appellant filed a two-count counterclaim. In the first count, he sought to have the agreement declared a valid and legal disclaimer by the appellees of their interests in the property. In the second count, the appellant alleged that in July, 1982, he and his father entered into an oral agreement whereby he would receive fee simple title to the property upon his father\u2019s death. Pursuant to the agreement, the appellant was to pay to his father 10 percent of the net sale commissions for any sales held on the property. The appellant alleged that he paid these commissions to his father until his father\u2019s death and that he maintained and improved the property. He sought to have the court declare that this agreement too was valid and enforceable. He also sought to have the court order the personal representatives of the estate to execute a deed conveying his father\u2019s interest in the property to him and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The appellees filed another motion for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the counterclaim and on the complaint. The court declared both the agreement between the appellant and the appellees and the alleged oral agreement between the appellant and his father to be invalid, null and void, and unenforceable. The court ordered that no disposition of any portion of the father\u2019s estate be made pursuant to either of these agreements. The appellant has filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">On this appeal, the appellant contends that the circuit court order must be vacated because the appellees failed to join certain necessary parties. He contends that his wife, Josephine H. Eyler, and his and the appellees\u2019 heirs should have been joined in the action. While we are not persuaded that the heirs were necessary parties, we do agree that the appellant\u2019s wife has an interest which was affected by the proceedings and should have been made a party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-405(a) (1991 Repl.Vol.) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\"><em>\u201cPerson who has or claims interest as party. </em>\u2014 (1) If declaratory relief is sought, a person who has or claims any interest which would be affected by the declaration, shall be made a party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">(2) Except in a class action, the declaration may not prejudice the rights of any person not a party to the proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">In addition, Md.Rule 2-211(a) requires, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">\u201cPersons to be Joined. \u2014 Except as otherwise provided by law, a person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if in the person\u2019s absence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">(1) complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">(2) disposition of the action may impair or impede the person\u2019s ability to protect a claimed interest relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the subject of the action or may leave persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring multiple or inconsistent obligations by reason of the person\u2019s claimed interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In <em>Mahan v. Mahan, </em>320 Md. 262, 272, 577 A.2d 70 (1990), the Court of Appeals said that the \u201cprimary purposes of the requirement that necessary parties be joined are \u2018to assure that a person\u2019s rights are not adjudicated unless that person has had his \u201cday in court\u201d \u2019 and, to prevent \u2018multiplicity of litigation by assuring a determination of the entire controversy in a single proceeding.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Josephine H. Eyler\u2019s interest in the property was unquestionably affected by a determination as to the validity of the agreement between the appellant and the appellees. The effect of the court\u2019s declaration that the agreement was invalid, null and void, and unenforceable was that Mrs. Eyler continued to own an undivided one-third interest in the property as a tenant in common. On the other hand, had the agreement between the appellant and the appellees been declared valid, Mrs. Eyler and her husband would have become sole owners of the property. Mrs. Eyler, therefore, had an interest in the proceedings and should have been made a party. <em>See Kelley v. Davis, </em>233 Md. 494, 197 A.2d 230 (1964); <em>Saunders v. Roland Park Co., </em>174 Md. 188, 198 A. 269 (1938); <em>Berret v. Allen, </em>45 Md.App. 544, 413 A.2d 1373 (1980). The failure to join a necessary party is a defect that was not waived by the appellant\u2019s failure to raise it at the trial level. <em>Mahan v. Mahan, supra </em>[320 Md.] at 273, 577 A.2d 70. Accordingly, the declaratory judgment must be vacated and the case remanded to the circuit court so that the appellees may file an amended complaint joining Josephine H. Eyler as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In view of our disposition of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the appellant\u2019s remaining contentions concerning the propriety of the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
