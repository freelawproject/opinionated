Bias, III, the younger brother of former University of Maryland basketball star Len Bias, was senselessly gunned down in cold blood as he was leaving the parking lot of the Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall. In a joint trial before a Prince George\u2019s County jury, presided over by Judge G.R. Hovey Johnson, the appellants, Gerald Wynn Eiland and Jerry Samuel Tyler, were convicted of that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Tyler was convicted of murder in the first degree and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder and to a consecutive term of 20 years for the handgun violation. Eiland was convicted of murder in the second degree, of the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and also of being an accessory after the fact to murder. He was sentenced to a term of 30 years for second-degree murder, ten of which were suspended, and to a consecutive term of 20 years for the handgun violation, ten of which were also suspended, for a total of 30 years to be served. Recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>ing the then-present inconsistency between convictions for murder and accessory after the fact to murder, Judge Johnson vacated the conviction on the accessory charge and entered a judgment of acquittal as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Each appellant has filed, briefed, and argued a separate appeal. Because they were both convicted at a joint trial, because the evidence admitted as to each was also admitted as to the other, and because of the broad (albeit not total) overlap of the issues raised by the two appellants, we have elected to consolidate the two appeals for purposes of this opinion. Both appellants raise the following four contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">1. That the evidence was not legally sufficient to support the convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">2. That Judge Johnson erroneously refused to sever their trials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">3. That Judge Johnson erroneously admitted in evidence the last words of Jay Bias; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">4. That the State unconstitutionally used its peremptory challenges to exclude women from the jury solely on the basis of gender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The appellant Tyler alone raises one additional contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-11\">5. That the State unconstitutionally used its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury solely on the basis of race.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">The appellant Eiland alone also raises one additional contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-13\">6. That his inconsistent convictions for murder and accessory after the fact to murder dictate that the sentence for murder should be vacated and the case remanded with instructions to sentence him only on the accessory charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">\n<em>The Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-15\">In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, of course, we take that version of the facts, including the inferences that can fairly be drawn from those facts, that is most favorable to the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Jay Bias worked at the Hyattsville Branch of the Sovran Bank. On the afternoon of December 4, 1990, two of his coworkers, Andre Campbell and Tydus Mathis, decided to drive to the nearby Prince George\u2019s Plaza Mall during their lunch hour. Hearing their plans, Bias asked to accompany them. He had recently purchased from Kay Jewelers, located in the mall, a ring, which was being sized for him and which he wanted to show to his coworkers. The three drove to the mall in Mathis\u2019s car. While Mathis went off to browse in another part of the mall, Bias and Campbell went to Kay Jewelers, where they were waited on by Shaunelle Tyler, an employee of the store and the wife of the appellant Jerry Tyler. Bias spoke to Shaunelle Tyler about the ring and showed it to Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">At approximately the same time, the appellants, Jerry Tyler and Gerald Eiland, arrived at the mall in a green Mercedes Benz, owned by Tyler\u2019s father but driven by Eiland. The two of them headed directly for Kay Jewelers. As Bias and Campbell were leaving the jewelers, Jerry Tyler entered. He apparently believed that his wife had been flirting with Jay Bias. A turbulent argument ensued between Tyler and his wife, culminating in Tyler\u2019s hurling a stapler at her. The manager of Kay Jewelers thought it prudent to end the dispute by escorting Tyler out of the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Bias and Campbell, now rejoined by Tydus Mathis, were standing just outside when Tyler was escorted to the exit. Visibly agitated, Tyler turned to Bias and said, \u201cYou can have her.\u201d Bias replied \u201cthat he didn\u2019t want [Tyler\u2019s] girl\u201d and that \u201che was just buying a ring.\u201d Tyler, his agitation persisting, challenged Bias to \u201c[c]ome on outside, we can take care of this outside.\u201d Bias initially started toward Tyler but was stopped by Mathis. During the entire verbal encounter, the appellant Eiland was standing just two to three steps away from Tyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Heeding Mathis\u2019s advice of restraint, Bias, with Campbell and Mathis, walked toward the mall exit leading to the rear parking lot. The two appellants were making their way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>toward another exit, leading to the front parking lot, when Tyler again yelled to Bias to \u201cstep outside,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you outside; I\u2019ll cap you.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that time, Eiland was still standing within two to three feet of Tyler.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As they prepared to leave the parking lot, Mathis was in the driver\u2019s seat of his car, Campbell was in the rear passenger compartment, and Bias sat in the front passenger seat. As they approached the exit leading onto Toledo Terrace, they came to a stop in a left-turn lane as they waited for two cars in front of them to make a left turn. At that point, Mathis noticed a green Mercedes \u201cspeed\u201d toward them from the opposite side of the parking lot. As the Mercedes pulled abreast of them in the lane to their immediate right, Mathis noticed that Eiland was driving the car and that Tyler was sitting in the front passenger seat. Because the flow of traffic on Toledo Terrace was heavy, Mathis was not able to proceed immediately to exit the parking lot. Indeed, when the Mercedes first pulled abreast of Mathis\u2019s Toyota, the Toyota was \u201cstacked up\u201d behind two other cars waiting to make a left-hand turn. The right-hand lane was free, however, and there was nothing to impede the Mercedes, driven by Eiland and occupied by Tyler, from going forward. Eiland, nonetheless, brought the Mercedes to a stop parallel with Mathis\u2019 Toyota. When, a few seconds later, the Toyota was able to \u201cinch\u201d forward one automobile length before stopping again, Eiland moved the Mercedes proportionately forward to maintain the parallel relationship between the two cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Mathis noticed that the left front window of the Mercedes was open. He saw Eiland press backward against the driver\u2019s seat as Tyler stretched across in front of him and yelled out the window. As Eiland pressed his body back against his seat, allowing Tyler to lean across in front of him, his hands were on the low arc of the steering wheel. The testimony was clear that they were not high on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>steering wheel or even at midpoint but were as low as they could be without actually releasing the wheel. Campbell, who also observed this, noticed that Tyler had his right hand placed below his knee. Tyler initially appeared \u201cscared\u201d but then became very angry. Because the windows of the Mathis vehicle were closed, neither Mathis nor Campbell could hear the words being yelled by Tyler. As the Mathis vehicle moved slightly forward toward the intersection, Eiland kept the Mercedes parallel with it. As Campbell was briefly turning his head away from the direction of the Mercedes, between seven and ten bullets were fired into the right side of the Mathis vehicle. Two of those bullets struck and mortally wounded Jay Bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The Mathis vehicle made an immediate left-hand turn onto Toledo Terrace and drove toward the Leland Memorial Hospital, where Bias was rushed to the emergency room. Shortly thereafter, Bias was pronounced dead by the hospital\u2019s attending physicians. Immediately after the shooting, Eiland drove the Mercedes away in an opposite direction from that taken by the Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>The Legal Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The test for legal sufficiency of evidence to convict that has always prevailed in Maryland, and is almost universally accepted elsewhere, is the constitutional test for sufficiency under the Due Process Clause clearly spelled out in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 573 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">\u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-9\"><em>Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 566-567, 597 A.2d 1359 (1991); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535-536, 573 A.2d 831 (1990); <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 717, 415 A.2d 830 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>It is, moreover, clear that the test for legal sufficiency is precisely the same when we are measuring 1) whether the trial judge in a jury trial is in error, as a matter of law, in submitting the case to the jury over a timely defense motion for a judgment of acquittal or 2) whether the trial judge sitting as the fact finder in a court trial is clearly erroneous in rendering a verdict of guilty. In <em>Bedford v. State, </em>293 Md. 172, 174-175, 443 A.2d 78 (1982), the Court of Appeals approved and adopted the analysis made by Judge Orth for this Court in <em>Williams and McClelland v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 450, 458, 247 A.2d 731 (1968), wherein we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">\u201c \u2018Once the question of the sufficiency of the evidence is properly before us, we believe that the criteria used to determine the question is the same, be the verdict rendered by the court or a jury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-6\"><em>See also Metz v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 15, 23, 262 A.2d 331 (1970); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535-536, 573 A.2d 831 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Both appellants grasp desperately at straws as they attempt to hang their legal insufficiency claims upon the purported notion that whenever circumstantial evidence forms part of the State\u2019s case, a conviction cannot be upheld unless \u201cthe circumstances, taken together, are inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 537, 573 A.2d 831 (1990). That unfortunate language, which has a vestigial validity in perhaps one percent of the cases in which it is invoked, is profligately bandied about on numberless occasions when it is not remotely apposite.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">As a general proposition, proof of guilt based in whole or in part on circumstantial evidence is no different from proof of guilt based on direct eyewitness accounts. In <em>Nichols v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 340, 350-351, 247 A.2d 722 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>(1968), Judge Orth attempted to lay to rest the ghost of this oft-invoked but seldom pertinent language. Judge Smith, speaking for the Court of Appeals in <em>Gilmore v. State, </em>263 Md. 268, 292-293, 283 A.2d 371 (1971), <em>vacated in part, Gilmore v. Maryland, </em>408 U.S. 940, 92 S.Ct. 2876, 33 L.Ed.2d 763 (1972), quoted with approval and adopted Judge Orth\u2019s analysis for us in <em>Nichols:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201c \u2018The law makes no distinction between direct evidence of a fact and evidence of circumstances from which the existence of a fact may be inferred. No greater degree of certainty is required when the evidence is circumstantial than when it is direct, for in either case the trier of fact must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">... \u201c[C]ircumstantial evidence need not be such that no possible theory other than guilt can stand____ It is not necessary that the circumstantial evidence exclude every possibility of the defendant\u2019s innocence, or produce an absolute certainty in the minds of the jurors.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Although it might have been more efficacious if Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 573 A.2d 831 (1990), had simply stomped upon this mischievous language once and for all, he nonetheless effectively cabined it to the rare and unusual situations where it still possesses some residual vitality. He reaffirmed, at 319 Md. 535, 573 A.2d 831, that the <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>standard for legal sufficiency is the ultimate test, whatever the nature of the proof. He reaffirmed that \u201c[a] conviction may rest on circumstantial evidence alone.\u201d 319 Md. at 536, 573 A.2d 831. <em>See also Veney v. State, </em>251 Md. 182, 201, 246 A.2d 568 (1968). He reaffirmed the analysis of Judge Smith in <em>Pressley v. State, </em>295 Md. 143, 148-150, 454 A.2d 347 (1983) that, generally speaking, circumstantial evidence is to be analyzed not as a \u201cchain,\u201d no stronger than its weakest link, but rather as a \u201ccable,\u201d the strength of which does not depend upon a single strand. 319 Md. at 536, 573 A.2d 831. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>He reaffirmed the unwavering common denominator of the legal sufficiency measurement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">\u201c[W]hether the evidence is circumstantial or direct, \u2018 \u201c[n]o greater degree of certainty is required ... [because] in either case the trier of fact must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gilmore v. State, </em>263 Md. 268, 292, 283 A.2d 371 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The small kernel of residual vitality is to be found not in cases where circumstantial evidence of guilt combines with direct evidence of guilt nor even in exclusively circumstantial cases where multiple strands of circumstance point in the same direction, reinforcing and corroborating each other. It is to be found, rather, in those cases where the State\u2019s proof of guilt depends exclusively upon a single strand of circumstantial evidence. As part of the very nature of such proof, the circumstance must serve as the predicate for an inference of guilt. The treacherous language (because it is so frequently abused) simply states the truism that a fact finder could not fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt if the circumstantial predicate could also give rise to <em>reasonable </em>inferences of innocence. It is self-evident that a finding of guilt based upon a process of elimination must effectively eliminate the other reasonable possibilities. <em>See, e.g., Tucker v. State, </em>244 Md. 488, 224 A.2d 111 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The classic instance where the concept retains vitality is where the defendant is a workman or other employee whose fingerprint is found in a bedroom from which jewels are stolen. To predicate guilt upon a process of elimination, it is necessary reasonably to eliminate as candidates for the theft those others who also had access to the bedroom. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 538, 573 A.2d 831 (1990). Until reasonably eliminated, each alternative candidate remains, by definition, a \u201creasonable hypothesis of [the defendant\u2019s] innocence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Warfield v. State, </em>315 Md. 474, 554 A.2d 1238 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Combine the circumstantial evidence of the fingerprint, however, with direct observations of the defendant\u2019s returning to enter the room at an unusual hour of night or of his leaving the room with a bulge in his pocket that was not there before he entered and guilt is no longer dependent upon a single strand of circumstantial evidence. Combine the circumstantial evidence of the fingerprint with other independent circumstantial evidence such as an expressed expectation of imminent wealth made just before the larceny or the display of unusual affluence just after the larceny and guilt is no longer dependent upon a single strand of circumstantial evidence but rather upon a cable made up of multiple strands.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The mere fact that a direct observation may give rise to an inference of greater legal significance, moreover, does not transmute direct evidence into circumstantial evidence. Almost every murder verdict, for instance, infers an intent to kill from the observed directing of a deadly weapon at a vital part of the human anatomy. Such eyewitness murders do not thereby become cases of circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In the cases at bar, this whole concept of having to eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence when a case is based <em>solely </em>on circumstantial evidence is not remotely apposite. Neither the case against Tyler nor the case against Eiland is based exclusively upon a single strand of circumstantial evidence. Neither case, moreover, is based upon even multiple strands of circumstantial evidence. Both cases rest not only in part but almost exclusively upon direct evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In the case against Tyler, eyewitnesses described the fight between Tyler and his wife. Eyewitnesses described Tyler\u2019s anger at Jay Bias, whom Tyler obviously believed to have been flirting with his wife. Eyewitnesses described Tyler\u2019s challenge to Bias to \u201ccome outside and settle this.\u201d An eyewitness described Tyler\u2019s direct threat to shoot Bias (to \u201ccap\u201d him) just minutes before he did just that. Eyewitnesses described his speeding across the parking lot in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>car driven by his confederate to intercept the vehicle carrying Bias. Eyewitnesses described his leaning angrily toward the open window of the Mercedes and his reaching for something down at his knee-level. Eyewitnesses described seven to ten gunshots immediately ringing out. Eyewitnesses described the fatal consequences of two bullets striking the body of Jay Bias. There was nothing remotely circumstantial about the evidence of Tyler\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Tyler\u2019s argument that Eiland, rather than Tyler, must have done the shooting because 1) at five feet, seven inches of height, his (Tyler\u2019s) arms were too short to have permitted him to reach with a gun out the driver\u2019s window from the passenger side and 2) he could not have fired from within the car because a) the flash would have burned Eiland, who was not burned; b) the report would have deafened Eiland, who was not deafened; and c) the shell casings would have been ejected inside the car, which they were not is simply an ingenious jury argument and we are not jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In the case against Eiland, eyewitnesses described his close association with Tyler at all critical times. Eyewitnesses described his being present when the verbal altercation between Tyler and Bias took place. Eyewitnesses described his close proximity to Tyler when Tyler threatened to \u201ccap\u201d Bias. Eyewitnesses described his speeding across the parking lot to intercept the vehicle containing Bias. Eyewitnesses described his bringing of the Mercedes deliberately abreast of the Bias vehicle and then maintaining that parallel position. Eyewitnesses described his pressing backward against the seat and his lowering of his arms to take himself out of the line of fire. Eyewitnesses described his then taking off in an opposite direction. There was nothing remotely circumstantial about the evidence of Eiland\u2019s guilt as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Neither the case against Tyler nor the case against Eiland was based upon circumstantial evidence at all. <em>A fortiori, </em>neither was based <em>solely </em>upon circumstantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>dence generally. <em>A fortiori, </em>neither was based <em>solely </em>upon a single strand of circumstantial evidence. All talk, therefore, about having to eliminate all reasonable hypotheses of innocence, as some kind of supplemental test superimposed upon the ordinary legal sufficiency test, is irrelevant fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>The Severance Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Each appellant claims that Judge Johnson erroneously refused his motion to have his trial severed from that of his co-defendant. There is no shred of merit in the contention. Maryland Rule 4-253(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">\u201cOn motion of a party, the court may order a joint trial for two or more defendants charged in separate charging documents if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Both Tyler and Eiland were, in separate charging documents, alleged to have participated in the same act, to wit, the murder of Jay Bias. The State, a party, moved for a joint trial. Judge Johnson granted the motion. The terms of Rule 4-253(a) were eminently satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">Rule 4-253(c) goes on to provide, in pertinent part: \u201cIf it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of ... defendants, the court may ... on motion of any party, order separate trials of ... defendants ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">The necessary precondition for the granting of a trial severance is the likelihood of prejudice. What then, under the law of this state, does that term of art \u201cprejudice\u201d mean? Has either appellant suffered \u201cprejudice,\u201d as defined by Maryland law?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">The case law is unequivocal. \u201cPrejudice as a term of art means damage from inadmissible evidence, not damage from admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Sye v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 356, 362, 468 A.2d 641 (1983). In <em>Osburn v. State, </em>301 Md. 250, 254-255, 482 A.2d 905 (1984), the Court of Appeals quoted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>this passage from <em>Sye v. State </em>with approval, as it further observed, at 301 Md. 254, 482 A.2d 905:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u201cIn <em>McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 375 A.2d 551 (1977), we established the general test for the joinder/severance of multiple defendants ...; the evidence offered must be <em>mutually admissible </em>as to each defendant ... for joinder to be proper.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">So long as <em>most </em>of the evidence at a joint trial is mutually admissible against both defendants, joinder is proper. As Judge Bloom recently noted for this Court in <em>Cook v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 122, 130, 578 A.2d 283 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201c[Jjoinder of defendants for trial is favored for reason of judicial economy ... and is appropriate \u2018where most, if not all, of the evidence admitted at trial would have been admissible in each trial if the several defendants had been tried separately.\u2019 <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 120, 130, 403 A.2d 812, <em>affd, </em>287 Md. 504, 413 A.2d 1340 (1979)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">Here, there was no prejudice to either appellant in the refusal to sever their trials on the charges lodged against them jointly. Any evidence that was admissible against either appellant on <em>those </em>charges would be admissible against both.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\"><em>See also McKnight v.

State, </em>319 Md. 452, 458, 573 A.2d 38 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">This possibility of significant damage to a defendant by evidence inadmissible as to him but admissible against a codefendant is the only criterion for measuring joinder/severance ever recognized by Maryland law. Unless damaging evidence is not mutually admissible, a trial severance is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>indeed, contraindicated. As we stated in <em>Ball v. State, </em>57 Md.App. 338, 353, 470 A.2d 361 (1984) (emphasis supplied), <em>\u201cA </em>severance is called for <em>only </em>when a defendant will be significantly prejudiced by evidence admissible against a codefendant but not admissible against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">According to this exclusive criterion, the appellants did not remotely qualify for a trial severance. Not simply <em>most </em>(which would be enough) but, indeed, <em>all </em>of the evidence was mutually admissible against both Tyler and Eiland. We would have no difficulty affirming Judge Johnson\u2019s decision to deny severance even by the more rigorous \u201cright or wrong\u201d standard of review. <em>A fortiori, </em>his decision cannot fail to be affirmed by the far more deferential \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d standard. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Resiliently, however, the appellants continue to squirm even when they are clearly down. Out of thin air, they attempt to confect an additional criterion for measuring joinder/severance \u2014 \u201chostility between the defenses.\u201d Ingeniously, they have combed the case law and uncovered four instances where, in passing <em>dicta, </em>the phrase \u201chostile defenses\u201d has actually been uttered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those passing utter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>anees, however, had been in the context of mutually inadmissible and damaging evidence actually introduced. In context, of course, the phrase did not articulate some new and different test but simply described long settled Maryland law. What the appellants are attempting to do is to treat the adjective \u201chostile\u201d as a free-floating phenomenon \u2014 to remove it from the context of mutually hostile actual evidence and then to build around it, as it floats free, a new context consisting of mutually hostile jury arguments, mutually hostile insinuations, and mutually hostile tones on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Of the four opinions relied upon by the appellants as ostensible authority for the very existence of an additional joinder/severance criterion simply because of their inconsequential inclusion of the phrase \u201chostile defenses,\u201d it must be pointed out that in three of them the denial of a severance was summarily affirmed as non-error. <em>Jones v. State, </em>185 Md. 481, 487, 45 A.2d 350 (1946); <em>Williams v. State, </em>226 Md. 614, 621, 174 A.2d 719 (1961); <em>Laws and Dorman v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 243, 248, 251 A.2d 237 (1969). In the fourth, <em>Day v. State, </em>196 Md. 384, 76 A.2d 729 (1950), the decision that severance had been erroneously denied turned upon the fact that inadmissible hearsay (confessions of a codefendant) was admitted into evidence to the extreme prejudice of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Laws and Dorman, </em>moreover, makes it very clear that when <em>Day v. State </em>used the notion of hostile defenses, it was referring to nothing beyond the actual introduction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>inadmissible and prejudicial evidence. In distinguishing <em>Day v. State, </em>it held that the appellants in its case could not avail themselves of a severance argument for the sole reason that they had not presented any evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u201cThe appellants rely on <em>Day v. State </em>... where the Court of Appeals found abuse of discretion where the codefendants had defenses <em>hostile </em>to each other <em>in that each tended to blame the other </em>for the killing during a felony. <em>Since neither Laws nor Dorman presented any evidence at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case it is apparent that Day v. State, supra, has no application here.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">6 Md.App. at 248, 251 A.2d 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Sye v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 356, 468 A.2d 641 (1983), one of the appellants made the very argument made by the appellants here \u2014 that severance was necessary \u201cbecause his version of the altercation that led to the killing differed from the versions given by his codefendants.\u201d 55 Md.App. at 361, 468 A.2d 641. We rejected the argument, observing at 55 Md.App. 362, 468 A.2d 641:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cWhere the codefendant who gives the damaging version actually takes the stand and testifies ... there is no problem. The testimony, though damaging to be sure, is competent and, therefore, admissible. Prejudice as a term of art means damage from inadmissible evidence, not damage from admissible evidence.\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">The mere fact that a joint trial may place a defendant in an uncomfortable or difficult tactical situation does not compel a severance. Only the threat of damaging inadmissible evidence does that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201cThe pertinent question is not whether the State might have had, in some other procedural configuration, a more difficult time in obtaining the testimony of Brooks and Sye. The pertinent question rather is whether the testimony of Brooks and Sye was competent and admissible. It clearly was. Bates was damaged but the damage was legitimate. He received a fair trial with the State using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>only admissible evidence. The State did not offer any evidence admissible against the others but inadmissible against Bates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">55 Md.App. at 363, 468 A.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The same argument was also before us on yet an earlier occasion. We rejected it, speaking through then Chief Judge Murphy, in <em>Lipscomb v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 500, 248 A.2d 491 (1968). In a joint trial of two codefendants for rape, one claimed that the sexual intercourse was completely consensual. He was understandably chagrined by his codefendant\u2019s starkly contrasting testimony that the victim had struggled and the codefendant had been enlisted to help hold her down. Lipscomb claimed that the testimony of the codefendant was prejudicial. We pointed out that prejudice consists not of being damaged or incriminated by the evidence but only of being damaged or incriminated by evidence that is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Our decision in <em>Moore v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 165, 578 A.2d 304 (1990) is dispositive. Two codefendants, joined for trial over their objections, claimed that \u201ctheir defenses were incompatible (i.e., each defendant attempted to prove at trial that the other was solely responsible) and, therefore, prejudicial.\u201d 84 Md. at 169. In rejecting the argument, Chief Judge Gilbert held for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\"><em>\u201cEach appellant contends </em>that he was prejudiced by the joinder because <em>each had defenses hostile to the other. The case law in Maryland, however, does not sweep as broadly as appellants think it does. </em>A defendant is deemed to have been prejudiced by a joint trial when the joining of a co-defendant or co-defendants (1) permits the State to introduce, against a particular defendant, otherwise inadmissible evidence, and (2) that otherwise inadmissible evidence tends to contradict the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">The permitted joinder in both <em>Day </em>and <em>Erman </em>allowed the State to introduce evidence against one defendant that could not have been introduced against him had he been tried separately. Moreover, the evidence which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>otherwise inadmissible contradicted the defendant\u2019s evidence, thereby prejudicing him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">The joinder in the case at bar did not produce that result. The evidence admitted at trial would have been admissible against each co-defendant, irrespective of whether they received separate trials____\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">84 Md.App. at 169, 578 A.2d 304. Judge Johnson did not abuse his discretion in denying the severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Tyler argued, incidentally, that because of the joint trial, \u201cthe jury was so confused that it returned a verdict which was inconsistent externally as between the defendants---- While Tyler was found guilty of first-degree premeditated murder, Eiland was found to have aided and abetted in a second-degree specific intent murder____ Thus, even though Tyler has been found guilty of first-degree premeditated, the jury found Eiland guilty only of aiding and abetting a second-degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">What was in the second degree, of course, was not a \u201cmurder\u201d (an act of homicide itself has no level of moral blameworthiness) but rather Eiland\u2019s \u201caiding and abetting\u201d of it. Eiland\u2019s level of guilt and Tyler\u2019s level of guilt were totally independent of each other <em>Cf. State v. Raines, </em>326 Md. 582, 606 A.2d 265 (1992). There was nothing incongruous in Eiland\u2019s being guilty of murder in the second degree as an aider and abettor to Tyler\u2019s, the triggerman\u2019s, murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">When a single crime has different levels of blameworthiness dependent upon the level of moral depravity of the perpetrator, all participants, at whatever level, share in a single and immutable <em>actus reus; </em>their individual mind sets or <em>mentes reae, </em>however, may rise or fall quite independently of each other. Thus, the triggerman may have premeditated the killing (first degree); one aider and abettor may have formed the intent to kill only at the last moment or, indeed, have intended only grievous bodily harm (second degree); while a second aider and abettor, a cue<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>kolded spouse perhaps, may have been acting in hot-blooded response to provocation (manslaughter). As we move from triggerman to accomplice, moreover, the levels of blameworthiness may be ascending as well as descending. Among mutual participants, the only expected common denominator is the <em>actus reus. </em>Their intents may be randomly idiosyncratic.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>The Dying Words: An Implied Assertion of a Deteriorating Condition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AFi\">Immediately after the shooting, Campbell raced the Toyota toward the Leland Memorial Hospital. The trip took \u201cno more than three minutes.\u201d By the time the car reached the hospital, however, Jay Bias could no longer respond verbally. \u201cHe had like foam coming out of his mouth.\u201d Both Campbell and Mathis described Bias\u2019s utterances in the course of that three-minute ride.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Mathis had been hit in the face by flying glass and dropped to the floor of the back seat, thinking he himself might have been shot. When asked \u201cWhat happened next?,\u201d he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cAt that point Jay started replying that he had got shot. He asked Tydus to take both of us to the hospital, \u2018Get us to the hospital. Get us to the hospital.\u2019 And then he started saying that he\u2019s not going to make it. \u2018We ain\u2019t going to make it.\u2019 And then he said he loved his mother and his father, and then he said the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\u201d Campbell described Bias\u2019s first words after the shooting:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtR\">\u201cAt the time he was saying, \u2018Take me to the hospital. Take me to the hospital.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">He went on to testify that by the time they got to East-West Highway, the tone of Bias\u2019s statements had changed dramatically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cHe had stated to me at that time, he said, \u2018Just tell my mother and father and my sister and brother and Shelley that I love them,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Jay, don\u2019t talk like that. Don\u2019t you die on me. Hang in there. We\u2019re going to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>at the hospital in a few minutes.\u2019 And then he started reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer, and from there I just stepped on the gas because I felt like he knew.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Both appellants objected to the accounts of Bias\u2019s last words on the grounds that they were inadmissible hearsay, were irrelevant and were inflammatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Several questions are involved. Were those out-of-court utterances hearsay at all? Were the utterances actually assertions of anything? If so, what were those assertions offered to prove? Were they relevant to prove it? Were there sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to support the declarant\u2019s credibility?</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">To begin with credibility, there were redundantly overlapping guarantees of trustworthiness. One can in this case readily understand the nostalgic tug of the now discredited and much maligned term \u201cres gestae.\u201d <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. 1, 9-16, 536 A.2d 666 (1988). More sophisticated modern analysis, of course, has unravelled that previously undifferentiated umbrella concept into between seven and ten separate evidentiary rules. <em>Cassidy, </em>74 Md.App. at 12-14, 536 A.2d 666. The dying words of Bias would qualify as trustworthy under as many as four of those now autonomous exceptions, none of them ironically being the dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The declarations, made while racing to the hospital within a minute or two of being mortally wounded and while in the grips of both physical pain and despair of impending death, are a textbook example of every type of excitement that could ever inhere in an excited utterance. L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(2).l, at 349-352 (1987 &amp; Supp.1990); <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. at 16-23, 536 A.2d 666. Beginning with \u201cI\u2019ve been shot\u201d through \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d the declarations are also quintessential present sense impressions. <em>Booth v. State, </em>306 Md. 313, 508 A.2d 976 (1986); <em>State v. Jones, </em>311 Md. 23, 532 A.2d 169 (1987); L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(1).1, at 343-346. The assertions, express and implied, are, more<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>over, classic illustrations of a statement of present bodily condition, sometimes referred to as a statement of pain and suffering. L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(3).2, at 363-364; <em>Cassidy v. State, </em>74 Md.App. at 23-25, 536 A.2d 666; <em>Geiselman v. Schmidt, </em>106 Md. 580, 584, 68 A. 202, 204 (1907); <em>Pennsylvania R.R. v. Simmons, </em>159 Md. 114, 121, 150 A. 263, 265-266 (1930). As expressions of an awareness of immediately impending death, the utterances are also statements of a present mental or emotional state. L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 803(3).l, at 356-363; <em>Nash v. State, </em>69 Md.App. 681, 690-691, 519 A.2d 769, 773 (1987). The credibility or trustworthiness hurdle is cleared with room to spare in four separate ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Quite aside from credibility, however, were the utterances actually hearsay? Even to be characterized as hearsay, of course, the statements must be assertive and must, furthermore, be offered to prove the truth of the thing asserted. The dying words of Jay Bias certainly were not <em>direct </em>assertions within the contemplation of the hearsay rule. \u201cI\u2019ve been shot\u201d and \u201cTell my mother and father that I love them,\u201d though assertions in a sense, were not here offered for the truth of the things directly asserted. The fact that Bias had been shot was not in dispute and his love for his parents was not in issue. The Lord\u2019s Prayer, moreover, is not assertive at all but is, rather, a series of exaltations of praise and appeals to divine grace.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Those utterances nonetheless qualify as hearsay as instances of the far less frequently observed evidentiary phenomenon of the implied assertion. L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.4, at 275:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201cAt common law, out-of-court \u2018statements\u2019 within the hearsay definition also include implied assertions. When evidence of either verbal or nonverbal conduct is offered to prove that the declarant or actor had a particular belief and that that belief was correct, the hearsay rule will apply.\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>See also Wright v. Tatham, </em>7 Adolph &amp; 313, 112 Eng.Rep. 488 (Exch.Ch.1837) and 5 Cl. &amp; F. 136 (H.L.1838). <em>And see Waters v. Waters, </em>35 Md. 531, 544-45 (1872) (expressly adopting the holding of <em>Wright v. Tatham </em>as part of Maryland law). The implied assertion may be verbal or non-verbal. The sea captain\u2019s taking on board of his wife and children is an implied assertion of his belief in his vessel\u2019s seaworthiness. <em>See </em>L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 801.4, at 275. The raising of an umbrella is an implied assertion that it is raining. <em>See </em>Falknor, <em>The \u201cHear-Say\u201d Rule as a \u201cSee-Do\u201d Rule: Evidence of Conduct, </em>33 Rocky Mountain L.Rev. 133 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">By parity of reasoning, a last wish to a companion to pass on one\u2019s final expression of love to a mother and a father and then the reciting of the Lord\u2019s Prayer are implied assertions of the fact \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d particularly when they closely follow an earlier and more optimistic \u201cGet me to the hospital\u201d countered shortly by the growing apprehension \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Even credible hearsay, however, must also be relevant. What relevance, finally, had Jay Bias\u2019s implied assertion, tragically quite accurate, that he was dying. Though not medically expert, to be sure, Jay Bias\u2019s direct observations of his own condition \u2014 his pain, his sense of where the bullets hit, his sinking feeling, his waning consciousness\u2014 were, albeit non-expert, some relevant evidence of that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">In terms of materiality, that condition was placed squarely in issue by the appellant Tyler. At a pretrial motions hearing on April 11, 1991, Tyler requested a continuance in order to pursue his intended \u201cintervention defense.\u201d The thrust of that defense was clear. As Tyler\u2019s counsel explained it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201cWe have taken the medical records from the hospital dealing with the treatment of Mr. Bias, we have taken the autopsy report, and we have presented them to a distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>guished forensic pathologist, and he has given me the following opinion:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">- He has basically stated that when Mr. Bias was taken to the hospital, he was a wounded man who could have and should have survived, and <em>it was not the bullet that killed Mr. Bias, it was the medical treatment that he received at Leland Memorial Hospital that killed him, </em>that took his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">There is in the law, with respect to homicide prosecutions, a defense known as, \u201cIntervention,\u201d and if we can establish and convince the trier of fact that Mr. Bias was a wounded man who could have and should have survived, but that because of the treatment he received at the hospital, and as a result of the treatment he received at the hospital, he didn\u2019t survive, that would be a valid and bona fide defense of this case.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AbN\">At another hearing just prior to the start of the trial, the issue arose of whether Tyler would be permitted to allude to his intervention defense in his opening statement to the jury. Three times Tyler\u2019s counsel was pressed as to whether he intended to raise the intervention defense. Twice he avoided the question. The third time, he equivocated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Houlon, I\u2019m not going to get into an argument with you. My question is do you intend to raise that issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">MR. HOULON: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be able to at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Tyler\u2019s counsel did indicate, however, that his potential use of the defense was still a very real possibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">\u201cI did speak with an individual who is a former medical examiner and who is a general surgeon. He did review the autopsy report. He did review the hospital medical records, and his preliminary theoretical feeling about the case was the same as that of the forensic pathologist that I spoke with prior to the motions hearing week before last, and that was <em>that perhaps but for the medical care, Mr. Bias would be alive today. </em>And he last evening told me that he would see what he could do about either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>making a decision to testify, or perhaps find a shock trauma specialist who would take an interest in the case, and look at the medical records.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC\">With no expert yet subpoenaed, Tyler was not permitted to raise the defense in his opening statement. Tyler indicated that he might well try to establish the defense through his cross-examination of the medical examiner and the hospital physician. He did not, moreover, completely back off from the possibility of injecting it somehow into his opening statement to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201cMR. HOULON: Your Honor, these are the State\u2019s witnesses: The medical examiner, and I assume that the State is expecting to call the hospital physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">THE COURT: Your first question was whether or not you would be able to bring it up in your opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">MR. HOULON: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">THE COURT: All right. I don\u2019t mind your cross examining anyone on what they have testified on, so long as it is within the scope of their direct testimony. That is no problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">MR. HOULON: That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">MR. HOULON: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">THE COURT: But <em>I still don\u2019t see how you\u2019re going to bring it up as an affirmative defense in your opening statement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-13\">MR. HOULON: <em>Well, I\u2019ll just have to reach down into my creativity box, Your Honor, and see what I can do.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">At trial, Tyler\u2019s counsel cross-examined the State\u2019s medical witnesses \u2014 including Dr. Alzamora, the attending physician at Leland Memorial Hospital \u2014 extensively in an effort to support the intervention defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">Notwithstanding Tyler\u2019s protestation in his reply brief that \u201cthe issue was never raised by Defendant\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>before the jury,\u201d he nonetheless sought, unsuccessfully, a jury instruction on the intervention defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\">\u201cMR. HOULON: <em>We would ask for an intervention instruction </em>based on the following: Dr. Alzamora\u2019s theory was that the hilum of the lung was smashed, and that allowed the air and the blood to mix together in enormous quantities, and most likely an air bubble went to the brain or the heart muscle and killed Mr. Bias.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">Dr. Golle testified that the hilum was intact, and that the gentleman bled to death, and I think it\u2019s almost axiomatic that you don\u2019t have a punctured lung while you\u2019re in a hospital and bleed to death, and <em>we think that that is sufficient grounds for an intervention instruction.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Faced throughout the trial with the ever present menace of that defense being developed and/or asserted, the State was well advised to try to forfend it by offering evidence (Bias\u2019s belief that he was dying) from which it might be inferred that Bias was dying even as he sped toward the hospital. This was evidence to counter Tyler\u2019s threatened argument that it was not Tyler\u2019s bullets but medical malpractice that killed Jay Bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Eiland, for his part, would like to have his cake and eat it too. On April 23, he asserted, \u201cI\u2019m not raising that defense,\u201d although on April 11, he had taken a very different tack:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you have anything you want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, but if he develops this defense, I would sincerely join in it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The issue was there in Eiland\u2019s case, however, whether he affirmatively raised it or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">In his reply brief, Eiland protests that the evidence of Bias\u2019s dying words was not \u201cin any way probative of Eiland\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d To be sure, it did not establish his criminal agency. It most definitely had a bearing, however, upon the establishment of the <em>corpus delicti. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Proof of Eiland\u2019s guilt was inexorably intertwined with proof of Tyler\u2019s guilt. The success of the intervention defense would not have benefitted Tyler alone. Eiland would necessarily have \u201cpiggybacked\u201d upon it. If the cause of death had been determined to have been not Tyler\u2019s bullets but medical malpractice, Eiland would have \u201cwalked\u201d out of the courtroom with Tyler. As a principal in the second degree, Eiland only aided and abetted in whatever Tyler\u2019s <em>actus reus </em>may have been. Self-evidently, Eiland did not aid and abet the attending physicians at the Leland Memorial Hospital. Eiland did not need to raise the defense. It was there in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Batson v. Kentucky Gender-Based, Peremptories</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Both appellants claim that the State unconstitutionally used peremptory challenges to strike prospective female jurors solely on the basis of their gender in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to the use of peremptory challenges by <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The appellants\u2019 factual predicate is correct. Although the intimations in the appellate briefs are that the petit jury that was ultimately seated was more heavily female than male, the actual makeup of the jury is not before us in this record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was nonetheless clear that gender was one of the factors guiding the State\u2019s exercise of its peremptories. It seems to be uncontested that the State used 16 of its 20 peremptory challenges to strike females. The other four were used to strike males. Of the sixteen women who were challenged by the State, incidentally, eleven were black, four were white, and one was Asian.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The number of peremptories used means nothing, of course, standing alone. <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 332-333, 579 A.2d 774 (1990). A pattern does emerge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>however, when the 16 strikes are viewed in relation to the apparently uncontested compilation made by counsel for Eiland. After the challenges for cause had been completed, 80 venire panel members remained in the available jury pool. Forty-four, or 55% of them, were female. Thirty-six, or 45%, were male. We can only use the remaining available jury pool as an approximate common denominator because we have no breakdown according to gender of the prospective jurors actually called to be accepted or challenged. Using that admittedly imprecise denominator, however, we do have the State using 16 challenges where random selection would have predicted only 11. 80% of its challenges directed against 55% of the jury pool is a proportion of challenges against a particular group 50% greater than random selection would suggest. A pattern clearly was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Quite candidly, moreover, the State acknowledged its purpose: \u201cAs a general theory of the State\u2019s case, the State wanted more men on this case, and wanted older as opposed to younger;\u201d \u201cI was trying to get older people in the jury, and more men.\u201d Although the State attributed none of its strikes to gender alone, gender appeared some six or seven times as one of the factors in a two or three-factored strike. Four or five times the explanation was the double-barreled combination of the prospective juror\u2019s being \u201ca young female.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>A. The Federal Issue:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">The key issue here, however, is not factual but legal. Neither <em>Batson </em>nor any of its progeny have thus far dealt with any limitation on the otherwise unfettered nature of peremptory challenges except those based on race. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, supra; Powers v. Ohio, </em>499 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991); and <em>Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 2077, 114 L.Ed.2d 660 (1991) all involved peremptories aimed at black jurors. <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>1859,114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991) involved peremptories aimed at Latino or Hispanic jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">As a matter of intellectual conjecture, it is hard to imagine how the scrutiny of the Equal Protection Clause could stop at discrimination aimed only at blacks and Hispanics rather than being aimed at racially motivated peremptories used against members of any race. It is hard to imagine why it should not also be aimed at gender-based peremptories directed at women \u2014 or at men. It is hard to imagine that it should not be aimed at peremptories based upon a juror\u2019s religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">By the same token, it is difficult to reconcile the potentially grand sweep of the Equal Protection Clause with the Supreme Court\u2019s repeated protestations that it was carving out a limited exception to the otherwise peremptory character of the peremptory challenge and the Supreme Court\u2019s continuing homage to the value of the peremptory challenge. \u201c[T]he peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our trial procedures.\u201d <em>Batson v. </em>Kentucky, 476 U.S. at 98, 106 S.Ct. at 1724. \u201c[W]e do not agree that our decision today will undermine the contribution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.\u201d 476 U.S. at 98-99, 106 S.Ct. at 1724. One cannot help but wonder whether the Supreme Court, when it unlimbered the heavy artillery of the Equal Protection Clause against one particular and invidious social problem in <em>Batson, </em>fully realized the forces it was unleashing and the possible repercussions in fields far removed from race. Did the Supreme Court intentionally venture out onto a slippery slope that has no principled stopping place short of the effective elimination of the peremptory challenge despite its continued lip service to the peremptory challenge or will the Court draw a line, even if it turns out to be an arbitrary line? The obvious answer is that no one knows.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Some jurisdictions have, indeed, anticipated that the Supreme Court will extend the strictures of <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>to gender-based peremptory challenges. The most recent is the <em>en banc </em>decision of the United States Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>United States v. De Gross, </em>960 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir.1992). It struck down as unconstitutional both the female defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge of a male juror <em>and </em>the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenge of a female juror. <em>See also People v. Blunt, </em>162 A.D.2d 86, 561 N.Y.S.2d 90 (App.Div.1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Hyatt, </em>409 Mass. 689, 568 N.E.2d 1148 (1991); <em>State v. Gonzales, </em>111 N.M. 590, 808 P.2d 40 (App.1991); <em>DiDonato v. Santini, </em>232 Cal.App.3d 721, 283 Cal.Rptr. 751 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Other jurisdictions, however, have held that <em>Batson </em>applies only to peremptories based upon race. <em>State v. Oliviera, </em>534 A.2d 867, 869-870 (R.I.1987); <em>State v. Pullen, </em>811 S.W.2d 463 (Mo.App.1991); <em>Dysart v. State, </em>581 So.2d 541 (AIa.Cr.App.1990); <em>State v. Culver, </em>233 Neb. 228, 444 N.W.2d 662 (1989); <em>Hannan v. Commonwealth, </em>774 S.W.2d 462 (Ky.App.1989). In <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>850 F.2d 1038 (1988), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declined to extend <em>Batson </em>to gender-based peremptories. In trying to fathom the intent of the Supreme Court, it distinguished equal protection law generally from the \u201cunique situation\u201d involved with peremptory challenges and racial discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-6\">\u201cAlthough the Court in Batson relaxed the evidentiary burden of Swain, it offered no intimation that it was extending the equal protection safeguards involving peremptory strikes to gender: \u2018By requiring trial courts to be sensitive to the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, our decision enforces the mandate to equal protection and furthers the ends of justice.\u2019 106 S.Ct. at 1724 (emphasis added). While the strictures of the Equal Protection Clause undoubtedly apply to prohibit discrimination due to gender in other contexts, <em>there is no evidence to suggest that the Supreme Court would apply normal equal protection principles to the unique situation involving peremptory challenges.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">850 F.2d at 1042. Taking the Supreme Court\u2019s homage to the value of the peremptory challenge at its word, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Fourth Circuit could not conclude that the Supreme Court intended, in effect, to destroy the peremptory challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKO\">\u201cClearly, if the Supreme Court in Batson had desired, it could have abolished the peremptory challenge or prohibited the exercise of the challenges on the basis of race, gender, age, or other group classification. A careful examination of the Batson opinion, however, leads this Court to the firm conclusion that, in light of the important position of the peremptory challenge in our jury system, <em>the Court intended Batson to apply to prohibit the exercise of peremptory challenges on the basis of race only.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1042-1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In the last analysis, it is a decisipn of the Supreme Court that we are dealing with. To enlarge dramatically the contours of that decision and to push out its rationale into new and uncharted waters would be presumptuous on our part. We find comfort instead in the cautious discretion counseled by the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Gorman, </em>315 Md. 402, 415-416, 554 A.2d 1203, 1209 (1989), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1613, 113 L.Ed.2d 712 (1991), in dealing with a slightly different but analogous invitation to \u201cpush out the envelope\u201d of <em>Batson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">\u201cWe have learned that it is not wise to prophesy what the Supreme Court will do or anticipate how it will rule when an unresolved question comes before it. We are content, as was the Supreme Court, to leave the determination of issues unresolved in <em>Batson </em>to future litigation. It is apparent that what spurred <em>Batson </em>was the Court\u2019s belief \u2018that the practice of peremptorily eliminating <em>blacks </em>from petit juries in cases with <em>black defendants </em>remains widespread____\u2019 It was this discriminatory practice which the Court addressed and sought to remedy. The venerable concept of the peremptory challenge in other respects was left intact. The majority expressed its recognition \u2018that the peremptory challenge occupies an important position in our trial procedures____\u2019 It did \u2018not agree that [its] decision today will undermine the contri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>bution the challenge generally makes to the administration of justice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">We decline to go further than did the Supreme Court. The circumstances here were unlike those in <em>Batson.\u201d </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\n<em>B. The State Issue:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The appellants also invite us to rule that peremptory challenges based on gender are unconstitutional under Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">\u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied because of sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">If we were persuaded that the glare of equal protection should properly focus upon the use of peremptory challenges in the context of a single case, we would not hesitate to declare that gender bias is just as invidious as racial bias. The appellants may not merely invite us, however, to extend <em>Batson. </em>They must first persuade us to adopt <em>Batson </em>as a part of Maryland law. We are not persuaded to do so. We follow <em>Batson </em>because we must, not because we are persuaded that it was a well-advised decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">If an act of the Maryland Legislature, providing for the selection of grand or petit jurors, denied or abridged the equality of rights because of sex, we would not hesitate to strike it down. <em>Cf. Strauder v. West Virginia, </em>100 U.S. (10 Otto) 303, 25 L.Ed. 664 (1879). If a prosecuting attorney on a recurring and systematic basis abused the use of peremptory challenges, using them persistently even when it damaged his tactical position, in order to perpetuate a regime of inequality based on sex, we would not hesitate to strike it down. <em>Cf. Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965). Unlike the Supreme Court, however, we are not persuaded that the use of peremptories, on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, to gain a hoped-for tactical advantage in the context of a single case will always offend notions of equal protection. When mere trial tactics rather than systematic oppression are involved, today\u2019s target group may be tomor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>row's favored group with random interchangeability. That is inherent in the very nature of the peremptory challenge and that is not an equal protection concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The <em>Batson </em>principle, arguably ill-advised if for no other reason than because of its tendency to over-breadth, is not and never has been a part of Maryland law. We cannot extend what we have never adopted. <em>Stanley v. State, </em>313 Md. 50, 542 A.2d 1267 (1988); <em>Tolbert v. State, </em>315 Md. 13, 553 A.2d 228 (1989); <em>State v. Gorman, </em>315 Md. 402, 554 A.2d 1203 (1989); <em>Chew v. State, </em>317 Md. 233, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989); and <em>Gray v. State, </em>317 Md. 250, 562 A.2d 1278 (1989) have applied federal law. The decisions of this Court have similarly confined themselves to the mandate of <em>Batson. Chew v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 681, 527 A.2d 332 (1987); <em>Parker v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 610, 531 A.2d 1313 (1987); <em>Simpkins v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 687, 558 A.2d 816 (1989); <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 579 A.2d 774 (1990); <em>Stanley v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 92, 582 A.2d 532 (1990); <em>Adams v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 377, 586 A.2d 810 (1991); <em>Mejia v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 31, 599 A.2d 1207 (1992), <em>cert, granted, Mejia v. State, </em>326 Md. 435, 605 A.2d 137 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Even two <em>pre-Batson </em>decisions, <em>Lawrence v. State, </em>295 Md. 557, 457 A.2d 1127 (1983) and <em>Evans v. State, </em>304 Md. 487, 499 A.2d 1261 (1985), that flirted with forsaking <em>Swain v. Alabama </em>relied upon, even for that flirtation, the \u201cfair cross-section\u201d notion of the Sixth Amendment that had, since <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment by <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">To find the unique and parochial Maryland view of the peremptory challenge, one begins with <em>Turpin v. State, </em>55 Md. 462 (1881), which traced the history of the challenge in this commonwealth. By the acts of 1737, ch. 2, the colonial Legislature extended to defendants the right to make peremptory challenges in capital cases. By the Act of 1841, ch. 162, the right was broadened to include all crimes. It was only by the Act of 1872, ch. 40, that peremptory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>challenges were first made available to the prosecutor. In <em>Biddle v. State, </em>67 Md. 304, 10 A. 794 (1887); <em>Rogers v. State, </em>89 Md. 424, 43 A. 922 (1899); <em>Whittemore v. State, </em>151 Md. 309, 134 A. 322 (1926); and <em>Parker v. State, </em>227 Md. 468, 177 A.2d 426 (1962), the Court of Appeals dealt with various procedural incidents of the use of peremptories in this State. We ourselves discussed peremptory challenges in Maryland in <em>Bever v. State, 4 </em>Md.App. 436, 243 A.2d 634 (1968) and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 143, 148-151, 262 A.2d 792 (1970). The Maryland view of the appropriately and truly peremptory nature of the peremptory challenge was well expressed by Judge Barnes for the Court of Appeals in <em>Brice v. State, </em>264 Md. 352, 366, 286 A.2d 132 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cIn short, the right to exercise the peremptory strike is unfettered and may be exercised by either party for any reason or indeed for no reason. Hunch, passing impression, appearance of the prospective juror, or any other consideration may lead to the exercise of the peremptory challenge and no inquiry may be made in regard to why it is exercised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Even <em>post-Batson, </em>the more exalted view of the peremptory challenge continues to be the Maryland view. As Judge Orth so well expressed it in <em>State v. Gorman, </em>315 Md. 402, 405-406, 554 A.2d 1203, 1204 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">\u201cIn providing for jury trial in criminal causes, Maryland, in general, adheres to the common law system of trial by an impartial jury of 12 persons who must unanimously agree on a verdict____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">In the empaneling of a petit jury the system provides, not only for challenges for cause, but for peremptory challenges. \u2018The peremptory challenge has been in use without scrutiny into its basis for nearly as long as juries have existed.\u2019 It was a venerable fixture at the common law and crossed the sea to become one of the most important of the rights in our federal and state systems. Although the federal and Maryland Constitutions do not confer a right to peremptory challenges, \u2018those challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>traditionally have been viewed as one means of assuring the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury.\u2019 ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">Throughout its long history, the description of the challenge as \u2018peremptory\u2019 meant precisely what that adjective connoted in common usage \u2014 \u2018conclusive or absolute; decisive.\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In holding against the appellants on this point, it is not so much a case of finding that these facts do not constitute a violation of Maryland law. It is rather the case that we find no <em>Maryland </em>law that these facts could violate.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>Batson v. Kentucky: Racially Based Peremptories</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The appellant Tyler alone charges that the State violated the constitutional command of <em>Batson v. Kentucky </em>by using racially motivated peremptories. The prosecutor explained, peremptory by peremptory, that his challenges were not motivated by racial considerations but by other non-racial considerations. The trial judge, \u201cwho enjoy[ed] the immeasurably superior vantage point to sense the mood and to catch the tone of the entire proceeding,\u201d <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 328, 579 A.2d 774 (1990), believed the prosecutor was telling the truth and accepted his explanations. That is really all there is to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Fourteen of the prosecutor\u2019s twenty challenges were used to excuse black prospective jurors. Eleven of those fourteen challenges were directed at black females. The explanations for those eleven challenges were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">1. Juror # 20 \u2014 \u201cBoth [she] and her husband work at the Post Office. I find this is a job, frankly, that sometimes they\u2019re not the most motivated government employees. As a general theory of the State\u2019s case, the State wanted more men on this case, and wanted older as opposed to younger, and this was a female. It was the first person I struck, and I struck her because of her occupation, not her sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>2. Juror # 26 \u2014 \u201cHer husband was a lawyer. I like to keep people who have a legalistic background, or a spouse [who has], off the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">3. Juror # 31 \u2014 \u201cThis woman was the one who came to the bench and indicated that her cousin had been shot by the police, indicated that there hadn\u2019t been a trial for either one, suggesting the police might have done something wrong. In addition to that, she is a professor at the University, and appeared to be a liberal, as opposed to a conservative, thinker, and I struck her for all those reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">4. Juror # 60 \u2014 \u201cI struck this woman because of her age [28 years old].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">5. Juror #92 \u2014 \u201cThis woman was unemployed. Her brother had been convicted of armed robbery, and she was a woman, and for all those reasons, I struck her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">6. Juror # 99 \u2014 \u201c[A]t the time, its the State\u2019s memory that the jury in the box was approximately nine women and three men, and the State ... was trying to get older people in the jury, and more men, and this was a young black female. Race had nothing to do with it, but she was young and female, and that was the reason I struck her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">7. Juror # 110 \u2014 \u201c[The juror] was a black woman, and she was struck (a) because of her sex, and (b) she had served on a jury last week in front of Judge Femia, and had compromised a very strong case. I had been aware of that through my office and for those two reasons, I struck her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">8. Juror # 127 \u2014 \u201cThis was a young female, and was struck for that reason.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">9. Juror #128 \u2014 \u201cAnother woman, and at this stage ... although we were coming very close to running out of jurors, the State was trying to get down to Juror # 130, who is a black male, Traverne Barts, and it was basically a decision that I made that either we\u2019re going to end up with exactly 12 or they\u2019re going to exercise their strikes, and I struck Miss Petty, who was Number 128, and Miss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Watts, which is 129, in order to get to the male, who was Mr. Barts, a black male.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">10. Juror # 129 \u2014 [Same reason as above in the case of Juror <em># </em>128].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">11. Juror # 19 (from a different panel) \u2014 \u201cI struck her and the juror before her, Miss Levine, who is a white female, in order to get to Juror # 20, who was a white male, Mr. Parsly, and at that time I knew that everyone else was out of strikes and if I exercised my last two strikes in that fashion, I could get Mr. Parsly on the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">A variety of non-racial reasons were given for those eleven strikes. The most frequently recurring reason was that the challenged jurors were female. For immediate purposes of considering the particular contention now before us, a challenge based upon gender (whatever its propriety) is not a challenge based upon race.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Three additional peremptories were exercised by the State against black males. The State gave Judge Johnson its reasons for having exercised them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-9\">1. Juror # 33 \u2014 \u201c[I]t was because of his age, 26, and [his] job in and of itself didn\u2019t show any particular career orientation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-10\">2. Juror #119 \u2014 \u201cThis is an individual who came to the bench, and I wrote down on my sheet when I was striking him that I did not like the look he gave me, and occasionally he gave bad body language, and therefore I did strike him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">3. Juror # 122 \u2014 \u201c[The juror] was sloppily dressed, and gave the general appearance of not taking the Court seriously because of his appearance, his hair, and for those reasons, I struck him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">After hearing argument from counsel, Judge Johnson ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-13\">\u201cI think Mr. Foley has given cogent reasons for his use of the strikes, and I find that he has not unconstitutionally or impermissibly used his peremptory [challenges] based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>on race; and I think he has very good reasons, tactical and strategic, for doing what he did, and that those reasons were not based on race.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">In urging us to substitute our judgment for that of Judge Johnson on the believability of the State\u2019s explanations, Tyler relies upon <em>Chew v. State, </em>317 Md. 233, 244-245, 562 A.2d 1270 (1989), which did speak of appellate review in terms of \u201can independent constitutional appraisal concerning the existence of neutral, non-racial reasons for the striking of a juror.\u201d That reliance, however, is totally misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">More recently, the Supreme Court has, in <em>Hernandez v. New York, </em>500 U.S.-, 111 S.Ct. 1859, 114 L.Ed.2d 395 (1991), treated definitively the proper standard of appellate review of a trial judge\u2019s <em>Batson </em>decisions. There cannot be, by its very nature, an independent constitutional review at the appellate level because the exclusive thing that is being reviewed is the credibility of the prosecutor when he gives his reasons for challenging. If he is believed, that ends the analysis. We do not assess whether his reasons are good or bad, wise or foolish, logical or illogical, generous or mean-spirited. We only assess whether he is telling the truth when he claims that his reasons are based upon something other than race. In all other regards, his reasons, laudatory or appalling, are none of our business.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In <em>Hernandez, </em>the Supreme Court expressly rejected independent, <em>de novo </em>review in favor of the more deferential \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. It explained that this has to be the standard when the issue is one of credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">\u201cThe trial judge in this case chose to believe the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanation for striking the two jurors in question, rejecting the petitioner\u2019s assertion that the reasons were pretextual. In <em>Batson, </em>we explained that <em>the trial court\u2019s decision on the ultimate question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact </em>of the sort accorded great deference on appeal____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Batson\u2019s </em>treatment of <em>intent to discriminate as a pure issue of fact, </em>subject to review under a deferential standard, <em>accords with our treatment of that issue in other equal protection cases.\" </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 111 S.Ct. at 1868-1869, 114 L.Ed.2d at 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The Supreme Court stressed, at \u2014 U.S. -, at 111 S.Ct. 1866, at 114 L.Ed.2d 406, that a prosecutor\u2019s reasons do not have to be good reasons or persuasive reasons in order to be race-neutral reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">\u201cA neutral explanation in the context of our analysis here means an explanation based on something other than the race of the juror. At this step of our inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed to be race neutral.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The <em>Hernandez </em>decision explained fully that an evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s credibility will turn largely on such things as the trial judge\u2019s ability to observe the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cdemeanor\u201d as he exercises his challenges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-11\">\u201cDeference to trial court findings on the issue of discriminatory intent makes particular sense in this context because, as we noted in <em>Batson, the finding will \u2018largely turn on evaluation of credibility. \u2019 </em>... In the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the decisive question will be whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and <em>the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge. </em>As with the state of mind of a juror, <em>evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies \u2018peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u2019\u201d </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u2014 U.S. at\u2014, 111 S.Ct. at 1869, 114 L.Ed.2d at 409. The Supreme Court explained how there cannot be independent appellate review of a trial judge\u2019s decision that hinges upon the trial judge\u2019s assessment of credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cPetitioner advocates \u2018independent\u2019 appellate review of a trial court\u2019s rejection of a <em>Batson </em>claim. <em>We have difficulty understanding the nature of the review petitioner would have us conduct </em>Petitioner explains that \u2018[independent review requires the appellate court to accept the findings of historical fact and credibility of the lower court unless they are clearly erroneous. Then, based on these facts, the appellate court independently determines whether there has been discrimination.\u2019 ... But <em>if an appellate court accepts a trial court\u2019s finding that a prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanation for his peremptory challenges should be believed, we fail to see how the appellate court nevertheless could find discrimination. The credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation goes to the heart of the equal protection analysis, and once that has been settled, there seems nothing left to review.\u201d </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">\u2014 U.S. at-, 111 S.Ct. at 1870, 114 L.Ed.2d at 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Indeed, our own analysis in <em>Bailey v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 323, 328-329, 579 A.2d 774 (1990), of the appropriate standard of appellate review anticipated <em>Hernandez v. New York </em>and is in complete harmony with it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">\u201cIt is the trial judge who is in close touch with the racial mood, be it harmonious or be it tense, of the local community, either as a general proposition or with respect to a given trial of high local interest. The trial judge is positioned to observe the racial composition of the venire panel as a whole, a vital fact frequently not committed to the record and, therefore, unknowable to the reviewing court. The trial judge is able to get the \u2018feel\u2019 of the opposing advocates \u2014 to watch their demean- or, to hear their intonations, and to spot their frequently unspoken purposes. It is a total process in which nonverbal communication may often be far more revealing than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the formal words on the type-written page. The standard of review, therefore, is perforce that of whether the trial judge\u2019s fact finding ... is clearly erroneous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Judge Johnson\u2019s finding that the prosecutor truthfully set out racially neutral explanations for his peremptory challenges was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>Apparently Inconsistent Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">The appellant Eiland alone complains that his sentence for murder was unlawful because the jury, inconsistently, found him guilty of both murder and of being an accessory after the fact to that same murder. Under the law of Maryland prevailing at the time of his trial, it was true that one could not, consistently, be convicted of both murder and with being an accessory after the fact. <em>Osborne v. State, </em>304 Md. 323, 327 n. 3, 499 A.2d 170 (1985). We note in passing that the recently decided case of <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 604 A.2d 489 (1992) changed the Maryland common law in this regard so that, if the evidence is legally sufficient to support both convictions, there will be in the future nothing inconsistent about convicting a defendant for both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">In Eiland\u2019s case, for instance, there would be nothing <em>logically </em>inconsistent in convicting him of both offenses. In aiding and abetting Tyler in the course of the murder, he was a principal in the second degree as to the murder. In subsequently driving Tyler away from the scene, he, quite independently, was an accessory after the fact to Tyler\u2019s murder. <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>does, indeed, prohibit multiple punishments for the two closely related crimes. It simply eliminates the notion that the two convictions are necessarily doctrinally inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Under the law prevailing at the time of Eiland\u2019s trial, however, the convictions were inconsistent and both, therefore, could not stand. They both, of course, did not stand. Recognizing the inconsistency, Judge Johnson vacated the conviction for accessoryship after the fact. Accordingly, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>did not sentence Eiland for that offense and there were, therefore, no multiple punishments imposed upon Eiland.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Eiland relies upon our earlier decision of <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 195, 589 A.2d 524 (1991), which had held that a trial judge could not break the deadlock created by inconsistent verdicts and that a new trial was, therefore, mandated. At the very least, he maintains that he was entitled to a remand for resentencing, with the \u201ccap\u201d on that sentencing being the maximum penalty that could be imposed for accessoryship after the fact. <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>however, reversed our decision in that regard and held that \u201cthe gnarl may be untangled short of the ultimate action resorted to by\u201d us.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that the fault lay in not instructing the jury that if it found a guilty verdict as to murder, it should not go on to consider the accessory charge. The erroneous instruction in failing so to advise, however, would only have impact after the murder verdict had already properly been reached, uncontaminated by the erroneous omission from the instruction. \u201c[T]he prejudice devolved only on the verdict of guilty of the crime of accessory after the fact. The prejudice did not reach the murder verdict; that verdict was proper in all respects and remained unsullied.\u201d We hold as did the Court of Appeals in <em>State v. Hawkins:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">\u201cInasmuch as the defective instruction despoiled only the accessory after the fact verdict and left the murder verdict chaste and pure, there is no good cause to wash out the judgement entered on the murder conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEY\">All the Court of Appeals did in <em>State v. Hawkins </em>was to vacate the inconsistent conviction for accessoryship. Here, Judge Johnson has already done that and nothing remains for us but to affirm his action in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\n<em>The Motion to Strike Appendices</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">With respect to each appellant, the State has filed a Motion to Strike all those parts of the Appendix to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Appellant\u2019s Brief not expressly authorized by Maryland Rule 8-504(b). Although the motions are to some extent mooted by the assessment of all costs against the appellants in any event, the problem of the swollen appendix is becoming sufficiently epidemic to warrant official comment.</p>\n<p id=\"AoO\">Rule 8-504(b) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cIn criminal cases in the Court of Special Appeals, the appellant shall reproduce, as an appendix to the brief, the pertinent part of any jury instructions or opinion of the lower court that deals with points raised by the appellant on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Thus, the appellant shall reproduce, provided it deals with points raised on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">1. The pertinent part of any jury instruction; and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">2. The pertinent part of any opinion of the lower court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9_\">Eiland\u2019s appendix, by contrast, contains 1) transcript excerpts of the State\u2019s closing argument, 2) defense counsel\u2019s argument on the Motion for New Trial, and 3) the transcript of the hearing on the defense\u2019s challenge to the State\u2019s use of peremptories. Tyler\u2019s appendix contains copies of various pleadings filed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The State\u2019s position is that Rule 8-504(b) limits the possible contents of an Appellant\u2019s Appendix to the two items expressly authorized. Nothing else is permitted. The appellants, on the other hand, view the two items expressly mentioned in the rule as the mandatory minimum. Those two items, according to the appellants, <em>must </em>be included. Other things, moreover, <em>may </em>be included, with the rule expressing no prohibition in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">We reject the appellants\u2019 reading of the rule. Rule 8-504(b) must be read in conjunction with Rule 8-501(b)(3). That rule provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">\u201cA record extract shall <em>not </em>be filed ... in a criminal case in the Court of Special Appeals, unless otherwise ordered by the Court.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The Record Extract and the Appendix to the Brief both perform, in longer and shorter ways, essentially the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>function. Rule 8-504(b) is a limited exemption from the otherwise foreclosing language of Rule 8-501(b)(3). The two items expressly spelled out in Rule 8-504(b), which ordinarily might appear in a Record Extract before the Court of Appeals or in a Record Extract in the appeal of a civil case to this Court, may, when pertinent, appear in an Appellant\u2019s Appendix. Nothing else is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Accordingly, we grant the State\u2019s Motions to Strike the Appellants\u2019 Appendices where those appendices go beyond the limited authorization of Rule 8-504.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">.

The definitive treatment of this chronically confusing notion is found in the insightful, as well as thorough, analysis by Judge Bloom in <em>Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 465-478, 468 A.2d 353 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">. In <em>Jones v. State, </em>185 Md. 481, 487, 45 A.2d 350 (1946), the denial of a severance was a passing and peripheral \u201cother\u201d contention.

Noting that the same lawyer represented both codefendants, it observed with no further comment, \"There was no intimation that the defense of the respective defendants was hostile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\"><em>Day v. State, </em>196 Md. 384, 76 A.2d 729 (1950) was a pre-Bruton case with a Bruton problem. <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). In a capital case, two co-defendants gave a total of five confessions. Neither defendant took the stand, creating classic confrontation problems. Each defendant, in his confessions, cast full blame on the codefendant. The primary evidence of guilt against each defendant was the inadmissible (as to that defendant) confession of the codefendant. The denial of a severance was clearly erroneous under settled law and the occasional use of the adjective \"hostile\u201d on several occasions in the course of a lengthy narrative and discussion did not remotely suggest some additional or alternative test.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>Williams v. State, </em>226 Md. 614, 621, 174 A.2d 719 (1961) was another occasion where the severance issue was a passing \"other\u201d contention disposed of summarily by a brief paragraph.
