In fact, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>interesting questions are of only academic concern. At the time the Critical Area Commission appealed directly to the circuit court, another statute clearly controlled appeals from the planning commission\u2019s orders and provided an administrative remedy which the Critical Area Commission failed to exhaust prior to its appeal to the circuit court. After the issuance of the order of the Circuit Court and entry of the notice of appeal, the Kent County Zoning Ordinance was amended to provide for direct appeal to the Circuit Court from orders of the Planning Commission. The amended ordinance does not apply retroactively, but it does make remand for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pointless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Kent County, albeit for reasons different than those relied upon below.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">By the early 1980s, the Chesapeake Bay was a natural resource in rapid decline. As found by the General Assembly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">(2) The shoreline and adjacent lands constitute a valuable, fragile, and sensitive part of this estuarine system, where human activity can have a particularly immediate and adverse impact on water quality and natural habitats;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">(3) The capacity of these shoreline and adjacent lands to withstand the continuing demands upon shoreline and adjacent lands without further degradation to water quality and natural habitats is limited;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">* * * * # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">(5) Those portions of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries within Maryland are particularly stressed by the continuing population growth and development activity concentrated in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan corridor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-10\">(6) The quality of life for the citizens of Maryland is enhanced through the restoration of the quality and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ductivity of the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\">(7) The restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries is dependent, in part, <em>on minimizing further adverse impacts to the water quality and natural habitats of the shoreline </em>and adjacent lands; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">(8) The cumulative impact of current development is inimical to these purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Section 8-1801(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the General Assembly enacted the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Protection Program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">(1) To establish a Resource Protection Program for the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries by fostering more sensitive development activity for certain shoreline areas so as to <em>minimize damage to water quality and natural habitats; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">(2) To implement the Resource Protection Program on a cooperative basis between the State and affected local governments, <em>with local governments establishing and implementing their programs in a consistent and uniform manner subject to State criteria and oversight.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Section 8-1801(b) (emphasis added). To establish the cooperative local/state relationship, to address the many environmental problems it had identified, and to implement a wide ranging Resource Protection Program, in 1984 the General Assembly created a new State agency, the Critical Area Commission, and specifically assigned responsibilities to it and to local governments. Section 8-1803. Local jurisdictions were assigned \u201cprimary responsibility for developing and implementing a program, subject to review and approval by the [Critical Area] Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">The Critical Area Commission was directed in \u00a7 8-1808(d) to develop \u201ccriteria for program development and approval which are necessary or appropriate to achieve the standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>stated in [\u00a7 8-1808(b) ].\u201d The Commission developed these criteria after 16 public hearings, 16 Commission meetings, and 48 subcommittee meetings. <em>See </em>Gerald Winegrad, <em>The Critical Area Legislation: A Necessary Step to Restore the Chesapeake Bay, </em>17 University of Baltimore Law Forum 3 (1986) (\u201cWinegrad\u201d). The criteria promulgated by the Critical Area Commission were subject to approval by the General Assembly. 1984 Md.Laws Ch. 794, \u00a7 3. This was given in the 1986 session in the form of Joint Resolutions 36 and 37; the criteria became effective on May 13, 1986 and are found at Md.Regs.Code (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) title 14, \u00a7 15.01 <em>et seq. </em>(1979) (\u201ccriteria\u201d). Under the blueprint for program development set forth in \u00a7 8-1809(a) of the Natural Resources Article, a local jurisdiction then had the option to develop a program. If a county \u201cfails to adopt and implement an approved program,\u201d however, the Commission \u201cmay act for the county in doing so.\u201d Winegrad at 4. Almost all local jurisdictions, including Kent County, elected to develop a program. By necessity, many of these programs, including Kent County\u2019s, closely mirrored and, in some respects, were identical to the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Kent County\u2019s local critical area program was approved by the Critical Area Commission on January 20, 1988 and became effective on April 12, 1988; it is incorporated into Kent County\u2019s current zoning ordinance (\u201cOrdinance\u201d) which was adopted by the Kent County Commissioners on August 1, 1989 and amended December 5, 1989. The Ordinance requires that development undergo site plan review before it is undertaken. Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4.1.1. Such review is required to \u201censure that new development complies with all <em>Comprehensive Plan, </em>Zoning Ordinance, and agency requirements thereby promoting the health, safety and general welfare of Kent County residents.\u201d Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4 (emphasis in original). One of the principal concerns is \u201cthe protection of historic and natural environmental features on the site under review, and in adjacent areas.\u201d Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4.2.3.d.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The process for plan review is set forth in the Ordinance as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\">The following agencies will review plans according to their specified area of responsibility only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u2014Planning Office</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">\u2014Planning Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">\u2014County Roads and/or State Highway Administration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">\u2014Soil Conservation Service</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">\u2014Health Department</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">\u2014Critical Area Commission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-12\">\u2014Any other State or local agency as requested by the Planning Director</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4.2.2. Thus, the Critical Area Commission\u2019s plan review addresses <em>only </em>issues such as the Critical Area Buffer preservation, compliance with the local critical area program, and the natural environmental features of a site as they affect the Chesapeake Bay. In contrast, the Planning Commission\u2019s plan review must address <em>only </em>those issues that relate to the County\u2019s Comprehensive Plan. As clearly provided in the Ordinance, a reviewing agency may not stray from its field of expertise. The Ordinance provides explicitly that reviewing agencies shall review site plans according to their <em>\u201cspecified area of responsibility only.\u201d </em>Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4.2.2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-14\">Before site plan approval is granted it must be determined \u201cthat the activity meets all required environmental standards.\u201d Ordinance, Art. VI, \u00a7 4.3.F.10. Article X, \u00a7 1.3 of the Ordinance provides: \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 is always mandatory. The word \u2018may\u2019 is permissive.\u201d Accordingly, certain mandatory standards may not be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-15\">(u)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-16\">The Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, appellant herein (\u201cthe Wharf\u201d), owns approximately 4.6 acres in Kent County which has been, or is intended to be, developed by the Wharf as part of its marina complex. All of the property is located entirely within.the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and the sensitive Critical Area Buffer. A 54 slip, full-service marina, complete with parking, boat storage, and travel lift, exists on the northern half of this property; the southern half is at present undeveloped. On May 7, 1990, the Wharf submitted an application to the Kent County Planning Commission (\u201cPlanning Commission\u201d) for a boat storage facility and an additional parking area on the southern half of this property.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In a letter to the Kent County Planning Office dated May 25, 1990, Mr. Ren Serey, Chief of the Critical Area Commission\u2019s Project Evaluation Division at the time, detailed the numerous reasons why the Commission objected to the Wharf\u2019s application. For example, Mr. Serey asserted that the project \u201cwould severely impact sensitive portions\u201d of the Critical Area Buffer, a designated habitat protection area, by permitting development not necessarily associated with water development facilities; improperly disturb steep slopes; remove all trees in a two-acre area, possibly adversely impacting a forest interior dwelling, bird habitat, etc., all in violation of the State\u2019s Critical Area Criteria and Kent County\u2019s Local Program. These objections were repeatedly reiterated by a Critical Area Commission staff planner. Moreover, a conservationist at the Maryland Soil Conservation Service and the staff of the Kent County Planning Office itself recommended denial of the application for many of the same reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Nevertheless, on August 2, 1990, the Planning Commission granted preliminary approval of the Wharf\u2019s site plan. The application was re-evaluated by the Critical Area Commission; it continued to recommend denial of the approval. Despite the continuing objections of the Critical Area Commission, the Planning Commission issued final site plan approval on October 4, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The Chairman of the Critical Area Commission appealed this decision to the Circuit Court for Kent County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Wharf moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the Chairman had no statutory right to appeal and so the circuit court lacked jurisdiction. On October 11, 1990, the Circuit Court denied the motion to dismiss, finding that \u00a7 8-1812 gave the Chairman a statutory right of appeal. Two months later, on December 10, 1990, the lower court remanded the matter to the Planning Commission with instructions that it review the application, consider any new evidence, and render specific findings of fact. The Chairman of the Critical Area Commission again outlined to the Planning Commission in detail the Critical Area Commission\u2019s numerous continuing objections to the project. Several other interested state and local governmental units and private parties also submitted comments to the Planning Commission in support of the position of the Critical Area Commission. On January 3, 1991, the Planning Commission, after a public hearing on the matter, made specific findings of fact as directed by the circuit court. The Planning Commission then voted again to approve the final site plan for the Wharf.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">On January 9, 1991, the Chairman of the Critical Area Commission appealed the Planning Commission\u2019s action to the circuit court. The Wharf moved to dismiss this appeal on the same ground that it moved to dismiss the initial appeal and the additional ground that if the Chairman had a right to appeal granted no other party, this would raise \u201csignificant\u201d constitutional questions. After denying the motion to dismiss on March 20,1991, the circuit court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order reversing the Planning Commission\u2019s grant of final site plan approval and finding that the Kent County Ordinance and \u00a7 8-1811(a) of the Natural Resources Article are \u201cmandatory and all encompassing. Their effect is that a project cannot be approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>unless it meets <em>all </em>criteria. The project in question here has failed to do so in several respects.\u201d (emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">On appeal, the Wharf did not, in any way, contest the correctness of the circuit court\u2019s March 20, 1991 Memorandum Opinion and Order on the merits. Rather, it only raised the following two issues as to the Critical Area Commission\u2019s right to appeal to the circuit court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">1. Whether the circuit court had jurisdiction over the Critical Area Commission\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeal of the Planning Commission\u2019s site plan approval for the Wharf when the Critical Area Commission has no statutory right to appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">2. If the circuit court had jurisdiction over the Critical Area Commission\u2019s appeal, whether this right to appeal would be unconstitutional as a result of being unilateral.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">In its brief, the Critical Area Commission similarly addressed only these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">The parties focused their attention on \u00a7 8-1812 of the Natural Resources Article, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKJ\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 After the [Critical Area] Commission has approved or adopted a program, the chairman of the Commission has standing and the right and authority to initiate or intervene in any administrative, judicial, or other original proceeding or appeal in this State concerning a project approval in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>(c) <em>Appeal authorized,. </em>\u2014 The chairman may appeal an action or decision even if the chairman was not a party to or is not specifically aggrieved by the action or decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApJ\">The Critical Area Commission argued, and the circuit court found, that this statute provided the Critical Area Commission the right to appeal a planning commission decision directly to the circuit court. The Wharf argued that this statute provided the Critical Area Commission no such right. Critical to the position of both sides was agreement on the premise that, <em>if </em>\u00a7 8-1812 did not give the Critical Area Commission this power, then neither the Critical Area Commission, nor any other party, had the power to appeal decisions of a county planning commission. This was so, the parties believed, because the Kent County Zoning Ordinance did not provide for direct appeal to the Circuit Court from decisions of the Planning Commission. <em>See </em>Md.Ann. Code art. 66B, \u00a7 4.08(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">This Court, however, became convinced that the parties\u2019 argument was grounded on a false premise, that they had totally ignored another state statute, which in fact provides all aggrieved parties the right to appeal planning commission orders. When the parties were questioned on this point at oral argument, they were surprised by the concept and not prepared to respond to it. Accordingly, in the interests of fairness, after oral argument, we requested that the parties brief and argue the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">1. Do Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) of the Maryland Annotated Code and the Kent County Zoning Ordinance provide the Kent County Board of Appeals with the power to hear appeals from a decision of the county planning commission approving a site plan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">2. If so, must this administrative remedy be exhausted prior to any judicial review of the county planning board decision approving the site plan for the Wharf?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In their supplemental briefs and argument, the Wharf and the Critical Area Commission agreed that <em>if the </em>answer to the first of these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d then the answer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the second must also be \u201cyes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That is, if Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) and the Kent County Zoning Ordinance provide the Kent County Board of Appeals with the power to hear appeals from orders of the County Planning Commission approving a site plan, then the Critical Area Commission in failing to appeal to the Board of Appeals had failed to exhaust an administrative remedy. Because \u201can administrative remedy must be invoked and exhausted before judicial relief is available,\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. Park &amp; Planning Comm. v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 13, 511 A.2d 1079 (1986), reversal presumably would be required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the critical question before us would seem to be whether Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) and the Kent County Zoning Ordinance provided the Kent County Board of Appeals with the power to hear an appeal from the order of the Planning Commission approving the Wharfs site plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(a) of the Maryland Annotated Code provides that: \u201cThe local legislative body shall provide for the appointment of a board of appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 4.07(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>(d) <em>General powers. </em>\u2014 The board of appeals <em>shall </em>have the following powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">(1) To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this article or of any ordinance adopted pursuant thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">(emphasis added.) In <em>Miller v. Pinto, </em>305 Md. 396, 504 A.2d 1140 (1986), the Court of Appeals reiterated \u201c[t]he local legislative body in a code county is required to enact local laws authorizing the county\u2019s board of appeals to exercise the powers provided in \u00a7 4.07(d) of Article 66B.\u201d 305 Md. at 403 n. 4, 504 A.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Pursuant to the authority granted to them in Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d), the County Commissioners of Kent County have provided in the Zoning Ordinance that the Board of Appeals shall have the power: \u201c[t]o hear and decide appeals of any decision or determinations made by the <em>Administrator </em>in the enforcement and administration of this Ordinance.\u201d Ordinance, Art. IX, \u00a7 2.1 (emphasis in original). The Zoning Ordinance defines that \u201cAdministrator\u201d as \u201c[t]he Zoning Administrator of Kent County.\u201d Thus, as the Wharf candidly concedes, the import of the powers vested by the Zoning Ordinance in the Board of Appeals is \u201cfar from clear.\u201d That is, it is not clear whether a \u201cdecision\u201d made by the \u201cAdministrator\u201d is intended to include decisions made by the Planning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The parties agree, however, that regardless of what was intended by the County Commissioners in the Zoning Ordinance, Article 66B, \u00a7 4.07(d) controls here. <em>See Miller v. Pinto, supra, </em>305 Md. at 403, 504 A.2d 1140 (\u201cthe local legislative body in a code county <em>is required </em>to enact local laws authorizing the county\u2019s board of appeals to exercise the powers provided in \u00a7 4.07(d)\u201d); <em>Boulden v. Mayor, </em>311 Md. 411, 535 A.2d 477 (1988) (local ordinance which directly of indirectly contravenes a public general law is invalid).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The Critical Area Commission maintains that \u00a7 4.07(d) does not provide the Board of Appeals with the power to decide appeals from the Planning Commission. Specifically, the Critical Area Commission, relying on the fact that \u00a7 4.07(d) only provides the Board of Appeals with the power to decide appeals from decisions of \u201can administrative official,\u201d argues that \u201can administrative official\u201d should not be construed to include the multimember Planning Commission. Unfortunately for the Critical Area Commission, very similar arguments have been carefully considered and rejected by the Court of Appeals and the Commission\u2019s own counsel, the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">At issue in <em>Howard Research v. Concerned Citizens, </em>297 Md. 357, 466 A.2d 31 (1983), was the Howard County Code (1977) \u00a7 16.301, which provided that the Board of Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide appeals from determinations \u201cmade by any administrative official.\u201d 297 Md. at 365, 466 A.2d 31. The petitioners argued that \u00a7 16.301 \u201cdoes not authorize an appeal from an action of the Planning Board because the Planning Board is an administrative agency composed of five members and, therefore, is not an \u2018administrative official.\u2019 \u201d 297 Md. at 363, 466 A.2d 31. The Court of Appeals soundly rejected this argument. Relying on the fact that the Howard County Code expressly provided that \u201cwords used in the singular shall include the plural,\u201d Howard County Code \u00a7 16.106(4), the Court held that \u201cthe words \u2018administrative official\u2019 contained in \u00a7 16.301 mean administrative official or officials.\u201d 297 Md. at 366, 466 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Critical Area Commission\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Howard Research </em>and make an elaborate \u201clegislative history\u201d argument that \u00a7 4.07(d) should not be similarly interpreted, is based on the fact that Howard County is a charter county and Kent County is not. The Critical Area Commission argues that, \u201cas to a county commissioner or code home rule county the term an \u2018administrative official\u2019 in \u00a7 4.07(d)(1) does not include the county\u2019s planning commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In 64 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 349, 355 n. 4 (1979), the Critical Area Commission\u2019s counsel, the Attorney General, opined to the contrary. There, the Attorney General construed \u00a7 4.07(d) in a situation involving Cecil County, which is not a charter county, but a county commissioner county, and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">On the whole, we think the term \u201cadministrative official\u201d is most reasonably read as embracing whatever administrative mechanism a local jurisdiction in Maryland sets up to enforce its planning and zoning laws and ordinances, including a multi-member body such as a local planning commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\"><em>Id. </em>The Attorney General, anticipating the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning in <em>Howard Research, </em>pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA\">Article 1, \u00a7 8 of the Maryland Code provides that, in interpreting statutes, \u201c[t]he singular always includes the plural, and vice versa, except where such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Id. </em>He also pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">Courts in other states have construed statutory language similar to \u00a7 4.07(d)(1) ... to give boards of appeals or boards of adjustment jurisdiction to entertain appeals from actions of local planning commissions in some instances. <em>Ackerman v. City of Creve Coeur, </em>553 S.W.2d 490, 493 (Mo.App.1977) (approval of development plans by planning and zoning commission appealable to board of adjustment); <em>Royal Atlanta Development Corp. v. Staffieri, </em>[236 Ga. 143], 223 S.E.2d 128, 130 (Ga.1976) (some planning commission actions appealable to county board of appeals, but not approval of planned unit development scheme).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\"><em>Id. </em>The Attorney General reaffirmed this conclusion in 1982. <em>See </em>67 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 409, 413 (1982). The reasoning of the Court of Appeals in <em>Howard Research </em>and of the Attorney General in these opinions is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the term \u201can administrative official\u201d in \u00a7 4.07(d) includes the Kent County Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Commission. Thus, \u00a7 4.07(d) does provide the Kent County Board of Appeals with the power to hear appeals from orders of the Planning Commission, including the decision at issue here, approving the Wharfs site plan. The Critical Area Commission\u2019s failure to avail itself of this right to appeal the Planning Commission\u2019s order to the Board of Appeals means, of course, that the Critical Area Commission failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Because administrative remedies must be exhausted before judicial relief is possible, reversal would seem to be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">(v)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Critical Area Commission, however, points out in its supplemental brief that, while this case was on appeal, the Kent County Zoning Ordinance was amended in June 1991 to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">Appeal \u2014 Within thirty days of the decision any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Commission or Planning Director may file a notice of appeal with the circuit court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Examination of the legislative history of this amendment reveals that the Kent County Planning Commission, at its November 1, 1990 meeting, unanimously voted to recommend this amendment to the County Commissioners. The Planning Commission did this in response to its attorney\u2019s recommendation that \u201cthe Circuit Court [presumably in the initial appeal to it of the case at hand] found that there is a \u2018right of appeal,\u2019 however it is not clear in the ordinance and this amendment will make the appeal process clearer.\u201d In a letter dated November 5, 1990, the Planning Commission recommended to the County Commissioners that it enact this amendment to the Zoning Ordinance. A bill containing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>this amendment was introduced by the President of the Board of County Commissioners on May 7, 1991. After a public hearing on May 28, 1991, the amendment was enacted on June 4, 1991 to \u201cbecome effective upon approval by the Critical Area Commission.\u201d The Critical Area Commission apparently approved it on June 14, 1991. Thus, there is nothing in the legislative history of the amendment specifically indicating whether it is to apply retroactively or prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The parties agree that this amendment works a change in procedural law. <em>See Mraz v. County Commissioners, </em>291 Md. 81, 90, 433 A.2d 771 (1981); <em>County Commissioners v. Stephans, </em>286 Md. 384, 397, 408 A.2d 1017 (1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is well-established that, when no contrary legislative intention is expressed, \u201ca statute governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending when the statute becomes effective.\u201d <em>WSSC v. Riverdale Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 564, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>520 A.2d 1319 (1987). <em>See also Starfish Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Yorkridge Service Corp., </em>295 Md. 693, 705, 458 A.2d 805 (1983) (\u201cordinarily a change affecting procedure only, and not substantive rights made by statute ... applies to all actions ... whether accrued, pending or future, unless a contrary intention is expressed\u201d); <em>Mraz v. County Commissioners, </em>291 Md. 81, 90, 433 A.2d 771 (1981) (same); <em>Winston v. Winston, </em>290 Md. 641, 650, 431 A.2d 1330 (1981) (same); <em>Aviles v. Eshelman Elec. Corp., </em>281 Md. 529, 533, 379 A.2d 1227 (1977) (same); <em>Holmes v. Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd., </em>278 Md. 60, 63 n. 2, 359 A.2d 84 (1976) (\u201clegislative changes affecting only procedural rights generally apply to pending actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">This does not mean, however, that a legislative change in circuit court procedure, enacted <em>after </em>a final circuit court order, is to be applied by an appellate court to change the procedural rules in the circuit court for that case. None of the cases cited above so holds. In none did the Court of Appeals even suggest that a legislative change which is made after an appeal from a final circuit court order has been perfected in any way affects the procedure in the circuit court in that case. Rather, the Court has merely held that the circuit court could and should apply changes in the procedural law when those changes become effective <em>while </em>a case is pending in the circuit court, <em>i.e., before </em>there is a final circuit court decision. <em>See Starfish Condominium, </em>295 Md. at 704, 458 A.2d 805; <em>Mraz, </em>291 Md. at 85-86, 433 A.2d 771; <em>Winston, </em>290 Md. at 649-50, 431 A.2d 1330; <em>Aviles, </em>281 Md. at 533, 379 A.2d 1227; <em>Holmes, </em>278 Md. at 63 n. 2, 359 A.2d 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In only one case, <em>Luxmanor Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Burkart, </em>266 Md. 631, 296 A.2d 403 (1972), has the Court of Appeals dealt with a situation factually similar to that involved here. There, a county ordinance was amended to provide that the votes of four, rather than three, members of a county board of appeals were needed in order to approve a zoning special exception. 266 Md. at 644, 296 A.2d 403. The appellees had been granted a special exception by the vote of only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>three members of the board. Relying on a number of prior Court of Appeals decisions, appellants argued that \u201cthe decision of the Board of Appeals ... should be held ... void because of the provisions of the amendatory legislation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals found that this contention was \u201cunsound\u201d and not required by prior precedent. <em>Id. </em>The Court carefully pointed out that no prior case had held that amendatory legislation must be applied to invalidate a judicial or administrative decision made <em>before </em>the new legislation was enacted. 266 Md. at 645-46, 296 A.2d 403. The <em>Luxmanor </em>court expressly refused to hold that the newly amended ordinance \u201cmust be applied to invalidate a decision of the Board made some six and one-half months <em>prior </em>to its enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, 296 A.2d 403 (emphasis in original). Similarly, in <em>In re Michael W., </em>53 Md.App. 271, 452 A.2d 1278 (1982), we held that a change in the Maryland rules making \u201can order waiving juvenile jurisdiction ... interlocutory\u201d would not be applied \u201cto make an appeal improper when the appeal\u201d was \u201cperfected before the effective date of the change\u201d in the rule. 53 Md.App. at 277, 452 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The rationale in <em>Luxmanor </em>and <em>In re Michael W. </em>is persuasive. Although the situation presented in those cases is not identical to that here,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we see no reason why the rule enunciated there is not applicable here. Accordingly, the June 1991 amendment to the Kent County Zoning Ordinance, which was enacted months <em>after </em>an appeal was noted from the March 10, 1991 circuit court order in this case, does not apply retroactively to give the Critical Area Commission the right to appeal directly to the circuit court. Ordinarily, we would remand this case to the Circuit Court for Kent County with instructions to remand it to the Planning Commission. <em>See Board of Education v. Hub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number><em>bard, </em>305 Md. 774, 792, 506 A.2d 625 (1986) (when parties failed to exhaust administrative remedy, case is remanded to circuit court with instructions that parties then exhaust their administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">We do not do so because of the peculiar circumstances of this case. To remand here would require the parties and the courts to engage in a time-consuming and costly process that would serve no purpose and would benefit no one. If we remanded, the Critical Area Commission would then exercise its rights, under the amended Zoning Ordinance, to appeal directly to the circuit court. (There is no question that the June 1991 amendment of the Zoning Ordinance would be applicable to this case after remand. <em>See WSSC v. Riverdale Fire Co., </em>308 Md. at 564, 520 A.2d 1319 and the cases cited therein.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Circuit Court would then be called upon to review precisely the same administrative record which it had already reviewed and so would be required to reverse the Planning Commission again. <em>See, e.g., Fertitta v. Brown, </em>252 Md. 594, 251 A.2d 212 (1969) (circuit court\u2019s final judgment which denied relief from Zoning Commissioner\u2019s order that property owner cease using his property as a marina was binding adjudication on property owner who, like the Wharf here, did not appeal case on the merits). Thus, the parties would be back in precisely the same position; remand would have served no purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>It is well-recognized that, even if the judgment of the lower court is technically in error, it may be affirmed on appeal \u201cif reversal would be ineffectual and of no benefit to the party seeking it, as where the same result would inevitably be reached a second time.\u201d 5B C.J.S.2d <em>Appeal &amp; Error </em>\u00a7 852 at p. 290. <em>See, e.g., Mayor of City of Annapolis v. Harwood, </em>32 Md. 471, 481 (1870) (\u201cdecree of the circuit court was error\u201d which would require reversal and remand \u201cif the appellants could be benefitted by any further proceedings that could be taken\u201d but since \u201cno further proceeding would change the final result\u201d decree is affirmed); <em>Washington v. Williamson, </em>23 Md. 233, 252 (1865); <em>Benson v. Atwood, </em>13 Md. 20, 57 (1859).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID ONE HALF BY APPELLANT AND ONE HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-11\">.

The Chairman did not appeal or attempt to appeal the Planning Commission\u2019s decision approving the site plan to the Kent County Board of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-11\">. The Wharf ignores the fact that the statute provides a right to appeal to the <em>Chairman </em>of the Critical Areas Commission, not to the Commission itself. This difference is, however, of no significance here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b695-6\">. It is clear that, if the answer to this second question is \"yes,\u201d then the two questions raised and discussed in the original briefs are indeed moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. The Critical Area Commission asserts that, if this Court concludes that an administrative remedy has not been exhausted, this \"would mean that the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction to entertain appellee\u2019s appeal.\u201d The Court of Appeals has rejected the view that failure to exhaust administrative remedies is jurisdictional, explaining: \"the requirement that administrative remedies must be exhausted is not ordinarily a limitation upon the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court. But, because of the public policy underlying this requirement, it is for some purposes treated <em>like </em>a jurisdictional issue.\u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. Park &amp; Planning Comm., supra, </em>307 Md. at 13-14, n. 4, 511 A.2d 1079 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\">. Notwithstanding this all-inclusive language, the provisions of Article 66B do not generally apply to chartered counties. <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 66B, \u00a7 7.03. Instead, chartered counties obtain their zoning powers from the Express Powers Act, Md.Ann.Code art. 25A, \u00a7 5(S).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">. The Wharf has expressly conceded that \u201cthe Kent County Commissioners clearly have the authority ... to provide an appeal\u201d directly to the circuit court \u201cfrom Planning Commission site plan review.\" <em>See </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 66B, \u00a7 4.08(f). Thus, the Wharf makes no argument that the June 1991 amendment to the Zoning Ordinance is not authorized by state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\">. At oral argument, counsel for the Critical Area Commission conceded, in response to questions from the Court, that if the Court should find, as we have in section iv above, that it was clear that an administrative remedy had to be exhausted before the circuit court could hear the Commission\u2019s appeal, this amendment would not provide the circuit court with <em>ex post facto </em>power to hear the direct appeal. ' In light of this concession, it is difficult to understand precisely what the Critical Area Commission\u2019s claim is as to the effect of the Zoning Ordinance amendment. The only clue is the Critical Area Commission's citation to <em>\u201cEnviro-Gro v. Bockelmann, 88 </em>Md.App. 323, 337-341 [594 A.2d 1190] (1991), <em>citing Yorkdale v. Powell, </em>237 Md. 121 [205 A.2d 269] (1964).\" The proposition for which we cited <em>Yorkdale </em>in <em>Enviro-Gro </em>was that in zoning cases involving changes in <em>substantive </em>law, not affecting vested rights and absent a contrary legislative intent, a \u201cchange in the law after a decision below and before final decision by the appellate court will be applied by that Court.\" <em>Enviro-Gro, 88 </em>Md.App. at 339, 594 A.2d 1190 <em>(quoting Yorkdale, </em>237 Md. at 124, 205 A.2d 269). We need not here reach the question of whether this portion of <em>Yorkdale </em>is still good law. <em>But see Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Riverdale Heights Vol. Fire Co., </em>308 Md. 556, 565, 520 A.2d 1319 (1987) (specifically disapproving the very similar fourth rule in <em>Janda v. General Motors, </em>237 Md. 161, 168, 205 A.2d 228 (1964)). This is so because <em>Yorkdale </em>is, in any event, inapplicable to the case at hand which involves a change in <em>procedural </em>rather than substantive law. <em>See Luxmanor Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Burkart, </em>266 Md. 631, 645, 296 A.2d 403 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>. </em>In <em>Luxmanor </em>and <em>In re Michael W., </em>retroactive application of the amendatory legislation would have <em>invalidated </em>a judicial or administrative decision made prior to enactment of the amendment. Here, retroactive application of the amendatory legislation would <em>validate </em>a judicial decision made prior to enactment of the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b703-5\">. The Zoning Ordinance provides that a \"person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Commission\u201d must exercise this right to appeal directly to the circuit court within \"thirty days of the decision.\u201d Here, however, the Critical Area Commission had no right to appeal to the circuit court at the time of the decision of the Planning Commission. Accordingly, it could hardly have availed itself of that right within thirty days of the Planning Commission\u2019s decision. In similar circumstances, it is well-established that \"the period prescribed\u201d (here thirty days) will be counted so that a party whose \"rights accrued before passage\" of the new legislation can have the \"same time to bring his action as those whose rights accrued after the passage\u201d of the new legislation. <em>Kelch v.
