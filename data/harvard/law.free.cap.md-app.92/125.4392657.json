(Island), appeals from a decision of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denying Island\u2019s motion to vacate the ratification of a foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On July 19, 1989, Island loaned money to Gregory S. Rogers and Yolanda A. Rogers, husband and wife. The loan was secured by a second deed of trust on 5 Daimler Drive in Seat Pleasant, Maryland. Payments on the second deed of trust fell in arrears, and on November 7, 1990, appellant\u2019s trustees initiated a foreclosure proceeding in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. In the process of foreclosing, the trustees learned that the property had already been sold by appellees, B. George Ballman and Sherri E. Turner, substitute trustees for Trustbank Savings, F.S.B., as a result of the foreclosure of the first deed of trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Island received no notice of the sale and was, therefore, unable to attend the sale or otherwise endeavor to protect its interest in the property. Island moved to intervene in the foreclosure proceeding and, on December 5, 1990, permission to intervene was granted. The court auditor filed his account of the sale which showed a surplus of only $321.33 payable to Island. Subsequently, Island filed ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ceptions to the auditor\u2019s account and moved to vacate the ratification of the sale. After a hearing, the circuit court denied Island\u2019s motion to vacate and overruled its exceptions. This appeal followed, and Island raises one issue for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">Did the circuit court\u2019s action in denying Island\u2019s motion and overruling its exceptions deprive Island of property in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Appellees aver that they correctly followed the procedures set forth in Md.Rule W74 regulating foreclosure sales. In addition, appellees contend that Island itself did not exercise due diligence, because it failed to record, in accordance with the provisions of Md.Real Prop.Code Ann. \u00a7 7-105(c), a request for notice of foreclosure. Section 7-105(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">(c) <em>Notice to holder of subordinate mortgage, etc. </em>\u2014 (1) The holder of a superior recorded mortgage or deed of trust shall give written notice of any proposed foreclosure sale to the holder of any subordinate recorded mortgage, deed of trust, or other subordinate recorded or filed interest, including a judgment, in accordance with the requirements of the Maryland Rules applicable to the giving of notice to the mortgagor or grantor of the mortgage or deed of trust being foreclosed, if the holder of the subordinate interest has recorded in the land records office of each county where the property is located a request for notice of sale at least 30 days prior to the date of a foreclosure sale which is actually held. A request for notice of sale shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(i) Be recorded in a separate docket or book which shall be indexed under the name of the holder of the superior mortgage or deed of trust and under the book and page numbers where the superior mortgage or deed of trust is recorded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">(ii) Identify the property in which the subordinate interest is held;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>(iii) State the name and address of the holder of the subordinate interest; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">(iv) Identify the superior mortgage or deed of trust by stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">1. The names of the original parties to the superior mortgage or deed of trust;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">2. The date the superior mortgage or deed of trust was recorded; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">3. The office, docket, or book, and page where the superior mortgage or deed of trust is recorded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Island admits that it failed to comply with \u00a7 7-105(c)(l) and that appellees complied with the Md.Rules with respect to the foreclosure. Island\u2019s contention is that the Fourteenth Amendment requires that adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard must be provided before any state action may be taken to deprive one of his or her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The Fourteenth Amendment provides in part that no state shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.\u201d The Supreme Court in recent decisions has tempered the harshness of foreclosure and tax sales by requiring that the states protect an individual\u2019s property interests through procedural due process. The Fourteenth Amendment is implicated when there is \u201ca sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., </em>419 U.S. 345, 351, 95 S.Ct. 449, 453, 42 L.Ed.2d 477 (1974). The appellees do not contest that State action is involved. <em>See McCann v. McGinnis, </em>257 Md. 499, 505, 263 A.2d 536 (1970) (citing <em>Warfield v. Dorsey, </em>39 Md. 299, 307 (1874)), in which the Court of Appeals stated, \u201cThe court is the vendor in the case of a sale under the power contained in a mortgage, just as it is a vendor in any other chancery sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">In <em>Mennonite Board of Missions v. Adams, </em>462 U.S. 791, 103 S.Ct. 2706, 77 L.Ed.2d 180 (1983), the Court set out a two part analysis to determine whether an individual\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>property interest had been violated without due process. The first prong of the test is to determine whether the party holds a legally protected property interest and the second prong requires a balancing of needs between the interest holder\u2019s right to notice and the burden of providing that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Although <em>Mennonite </em>involved a tax sale, the language has been read broadly to encompass foreclosure sales. In <em>Mennonite, </em>the Mennonite Board of Missions held a purchase money mortgage on Indiana property on which the mortgagor failed to pay real property taxes. Under Indiana law, before the property was sold at a tax sale, notice was published for three weeks, posted in the county courthouse and a certified mail copy of the notice was sent to the owner. As mortgagee, Mennonite Board of Missions was not entitled to notice under the statute and subsequently was not notified of the tax sale. Under the statute, after two years free of any interest claims on the property, the tax sale purchaser obtained the property free and clear of all encumbrances, even prior recorded mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Mennonite </em>held that failure to give the mortgage holder actual notice of the pending tax sale violated procedural due process. The Supreme Court relied on its earlier decision in <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950), to illustrate the proper form of required notice. In <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. at 657, the Court stated that procedural due process protection requires a State to provide \u201cnotice reasonably calculated, under all circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d Specifically in <em>Mullane, </em>339 U.S. at 318, 70 S.Ct. at 659, the Court found that published or posted notice did not meet the standard of procedural due process when the address of an interested party is reasonably ascertainable. Under <em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 798, 103 S.Ct. at 2711, procedural due process protects \u201cpersons\u201d holding a legally protected property interest by requiring actual or mailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>notice of a proceeding if the person\u2019s name and address are \u201creasonably identifiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Our first task is to determine whether Island, an inferior lienholder, has a legally protected property interest under <em>Mennonite. </em>There is no doubt that a first mortgage holder is protected. <em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 798, 103 S.Ct. at 2711 (\u201ca mortgagee clearly has a legally protected property interest\u201d). Second mortgagees also have a significant, constitutionally protected property interest. <em>See Fuentes v. Shevin, </em>407 U.S. 67, 82, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 1995, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Morrison, </em>747 F.2d 610, 614 (11th Cir.1984). In <em>Davis Oil Co. v. Mills, </em>873 F.2d 774 (5th Cir.1989), Davis was a mineral lessee whose interest was extinguished by a mortgage foreclosure sale. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held, \u201cThe termination of Davis\u2019 lease by FNB\u2019s foreclosure and the subsequent seizure and sale of the subject property \u2018deprived\u2019 Davis of a legally protected property interest within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment.\u201d <em>Davis Oil, </em>873 F.2d at 787. Other states similarly construed the language of <em>Mennonite </em>to encompass foreclosure actions. <em>See Dossett v. Hub City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>546 So.2d 597 (La.App. 3 Cir.1989); <em>City of Boston v. Shirley James, </em>26 Mass.App.Ct. 625, 530 N.E.2d 1254 (1988). It is clear that Island\u2019s interest is protected, because the ratification of the foreclosure sale has the ultimate effect of nullifying Island\u2019s interest in the property (Island would receive only $321.33 of its loaned money) \u2014 the same effect that the tax sale in <em>Mennonite </em>had upon the mortgagee\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The second prong of the <em>Mennonite </em>test is to determine whether the foreclosing party would be unfairly burdened with providing notice to holders of subordinate property interests. The Court in <em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 800, 103 S.Ct. at 2712, stated, \u201c[Njotice by mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice is a minimum constitutional precondition to a proceeding which will adversely affect the liberty or property interests of <em>any </em>party, whether unlettered or well versed in commercial practice, if its name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>address are reasonably ascertainable.\u201d The mortgage on file in <em>Mennonite </em>identified the mortgagee as \u201cMENNONITE BOARD OF MISSIONS a corporation, of Wayne County, in the state of Ohio\u201d, but the corporation\u2019s address was not provided. The Court, however, concluded that it would not have been a difficult task to find the address and to mail notice of the proceeding to the mortgagee. <em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 798 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. at 2711 n. 4. It is also apparent that it is not a difficult task to locate a junior lienholder, such as Island, which has corporate offices or a place of residence within the State of Maryland. A simple title scan from the time that the property was acquired by the current owner to the initiation of the foreclosure proceedings would have provided notice of Island\u2019s interest in the property. Also, Island\u2019s name and address appear on the top page of the deed of trust which is recorded in the land records of Prince George\u2019s County. Certainly, this process is not oppressive to the foreclosing party in terms of the amount of time, money or effort expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Appellees argue that the burden of providing notice to Island is equivalent to the burden of providing notice to a junior mineral lessee as described by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Davis Oil. </em>The <em>Davis </em>court described the search to discover the junior mineral lessee as requiring the creditor to \u201cwend its way through a potentially complex maze of leases and assignments in order to identify interested parties ... [and] concluded that under the circumstances \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 did not require that FNB search the conveyance records to ascertain the identities of the mineral lessees.\u201d <em>Davis Oil, </em>873 F.2d at 790. The Fifth Circuit held that such a record search heavily burdened the creditor, and the court did not want to discourage creditors from bringing foreclosure actions. The <em>Davis </em>court, however, noted that \u201ca reviewing court could easily conclude that the search of property records required to identify a third possessor or second mortgagee is less burdensome than that required to identify parties with mineral interests in the same land.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>873 F.2d at 790 n. 24. We do not believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>title scan required to discover junior mortgage holders of property located in the State of Maryland is nearly as lengthy and time consuming as that described in the search required to discover a junior mineral lessee in Louisiana. Consequently, the court\u2019s holding in <em>Davis </em>is not persuasive with respect to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><em>Mid-State Homes, Inc. v. Portis, </em>652 F.Supp. 640 (W.D.La.1987), involved a second mortgagee that brought suit against the first mortgagee of the property for failing to give adequate notice to the second mortgagee of the pending foreclosure action. Upon foreclosure, the second mortgagee lost its interest in the property. The District Court of Louisiana held that the principles of due process extend to second mortgagees and entitle them to adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard before its property interest is impaired. The court followed the <em>Mennonite </em>analysis and concluded that the first mortgagee provided adequate notice to the second mortgagee. The court reasoned that since the second mortgagee\u2019s address was not \u201creasonably ascertainable,\u201d it was not unconstitutional for the first mortgagee to provide only constructive notice of the foreclosure action. The court determined that the identity of the second mortgagee was not reasonably ascertainable since it was not named in the body of the mortgage (the body of the document still referred to the previous mortgage holder), and its name only appeared at the top and bottom of the mortgage in the place where the previous mortgage holder\u2019s name had been crossed-out. Also, the court noted that the document did not contain the second mortgagee\u2019s address nor was the mortgagee listed in the city or phone directories of that area. The court also reasoned that the second mortgagee was constitutionally protected by the statute that required interest holders in property to file a request for notice. This holding, however, was expressly overruled in <em>Davis, </em>873 F.2d at 788 (\u201cto the extent that the district court\u2019s holding [in <em>Mid-State Homes </em>] ... implies that [required notice statute] would be constitutionally adequate as the sole determinant of parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>entitled to notice of the seizure of property, we expressly reject that reasoning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Although Island has a protected interest under <em>Mennonite, </em>appellees aver that Island may not assert this right, because it failed to submit a request for notice of sale as required under Md.Real Prop.Code Ann., \u00a7 7-105(c). The Supreme Court did not specifically address this issue in <em>Mennonite </em>even though Indiana had recently enacted a request for notice of sale statute similar to Section 7-105(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUc\">Indiana Code Section 6-1.1-24-4.2 (1982), added in 1980, provides for notice by certified mail to any mortgagee of real property which is subject to tax sale proceedings, if the mortgagee has annually requested such notice and has agreed to pay a fee, not to exceed $10, to cover the cost of sending notice. Because the events in question in this case occurred before the 1980 amendment, the constitutionality of the amendment is not before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACS\"><em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 793 n. 2, 103 S.Ct. at 2708 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">After <em>Mennonite, </em>however, states with similar statutes addressed this issue. The Court of Appeals of Indiana, in <em>Reeder &amp; Associates v. Locker, </em>542 N.E.2d 1371 (Ind.App. 3 Dist.1989), decided that even though the mortgagee in a tax foreclosure proceeding had not followed the procedures under the request for notice of sale statute, the mortgagee was nonetheless denied due process because he did not receive actual notice of the sale through the mail or through personal service. The Indiana court followed <em>Mennonite </em>which provided for \u201cactual notice\u201d to an interested party if the party\u2019s address was \u201creasonably ascertainable.\u201d <em>Mennonite, </em>462 U.S. at 799, 103 S.Ct. at 2711. The Indiana court ruled that the statute did not protect the mortgagee\u2019s due process rights and that \u201cafter <em>Mennonite </em>a mortgagee is required to receive actual notice of a tax sale unless the mortgagee\u2019s address is not reasonably identifiable.\u201d <em>Reeder, </em>542 N.E.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The New Jersey Supreme Court, in <em>Jefferson Tp. v. Block 447A, Lot 10, </em>228 N.J.Super. 1, 548 A.2d 521 (1988), held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>that a tax certificate holder was denied due process when he was not given actual notice of a tax foreclosure sale. New Jersey also has a statute that provides for notice if an interested party files a request with the tax collector stating his name and address. The court ruled that the statute did not satisfy due process since the name and address of the certificate holder was easily ascertainable in another record book and that <em>\u201ca </em>person\u2019s entitlement to the notice required by due process cannot be conditioned on the requirement that he request it.\u201d <em>Jefferson Tp., </em>228 N.J.Super. at 8, 548 A.2d 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The Fifth Circuit held that a Louisiana statute \u201cacts only to supplement Louisiana\u2019s preexisting constructive notice scheme in Louisiana foreclosure actions. The provision gives property owners, whose identities a reasonably diligent, responsible state actor could not reasonably ascertain, the opportunity to request such notice and thereby become ascertainable.\u201d <em>Small Engine Shop, Inc. v. Cascio, </em>878 F.2d 883 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Although Massachusetts does not have a similar request for notice of sale statute, the Appeals Court was unpersuaded when the city, seeking to foreclose rights of redemption after a tax sale, argued that the property owners bore the duty of leaving a forwarding address. The court concluded, \u201c[S]hifting of responsibility is impermissible even when the persons deprived of notice are sophisticated and knowledgeable.\u201d <em>City of Boston v. James, </em>26 Mass.App.Ct. 625, 530 N.E.2d 1254 (1988). Other courts have held that similar statutes are not sufficient to supplant a person\u2019s due process rights in a tax sale. <em>See Wylie v. Patton, </em>111 Idaho 61, 720 P.2d 649 (Idaho Ct.App.1986); <em>United States v. Malinka, </em>685 P.2d 405 (Okla.Ct.App.1984); <em>Alliance Property Management and Dev., Inc. v. Andrews Avenue Equities, Inc., </em>133 A.D.2d 30, 518 N.Y.S.2d 804 (N.Y.App. Div.1987); <em>Seattle First National Bank v. Umatilla County, </em>77 Or.App. 283, 713 P.2d 33 (Or.App.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Constitutional due process protection does not exist only for those who follow the notice statute but encompasses all interests that may be affected by state action. Consequently, in construing Md.Real Prop.Code Ann., \u00a7 7-105(c) in light of the holding in <em>Mennonite, </em>we conclude that \u00a7 7-105(c) is meant to protect those whose interests are difficult to identify or whose addresses are difficult to ascertain. The statute is designed to go hand in hand with constitutional protection so that no property interest will be unfairly extinguished. In this instance, Island did not. receive notice solely for the reason that it had not filed a request for notice of sale. It is clear, however, that with little effort or diligence the appellees could have obtained Island\u2019s address and mailed notice to the corporation. After taking into consideration the holdings of <em>Mennonite </em>and its progeny, we believe that Section 7-105(c) protects the due process rights of those parties whose interests and addresses are not \u201creasonably ascertainable,\u201d by providing a mechanism through which such parties can be assured that they will receive notice. If an interest of a party is reasonably ascertainable, however, the minimum requirements of due process dictate that actual notice be given without a formal request for notice being filed. We are, therefore, remanding the within cause to the circuit court with instructions to order a resale of the subject property. Costs of resale to be charged to proceeds of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
