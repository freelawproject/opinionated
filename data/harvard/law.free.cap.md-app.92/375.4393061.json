The issue presented is whether appellants, depositors of an insolvent savings and loan association, stated a claim that may be brought individually against former officers and directors of the savings and loan and others. The circuit court held that appellants had failed to do so. For reasons we shall explain, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">These consolidated cases arise out of the failure of Old Court Savings &amp; Loan, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cOld Court\u201d), a state-chartered savings and loan association, and the attendant collapse of Maryland Savings-Share Insurance Corporation (hereinafter \u201cMSSIC\u201d), a state-chartered insurer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>deposits in Maryland savings and loan associations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Old Court was placed into conservatorship on 13 May 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 8 November 1985 the conservatorship was converted into a receivership<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund (hereinafter \u201cMDIF\u201d), a Maryland governmental corporation, was appointed receiver. MDIF is also the successor-in-interest of MSSIC; all of the assets and liabilities of MSSIC were transferred to MDIF in the wake of MSSIC\u2019s collapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Appellants are depositors of Old Court who have recovered, largely due to MDIF\u2019s efforts, the principal of their Old Court investments but have not recovered all of the interest. Appellees are former directors, officers and accountants of Old Court (hereinafter \u201cOld Court appellees\u201d), former directors and officers of MSSIC (hereinafter \u201cMSSIC appellees\u201d), the law firm of Venable, Baetjer and Howard, which acted as outside counsel to both Old Court and MSSIC, and MDIF, in its capacities as receiver of Old Court and successor-in-interest of MSSIC:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Appellants allege violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (hereinafter \u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968 (1988), as well as state law claims of fraud, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and conversion. According to the complaint, appellees attracted depositors by holding Old Court out to the public as a well-managed and financially sound savings and loan association and by promoting high-yielding, risk-free investments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>through advertisements, letters, brochures, responses to telephone inquiries and other means. According to the complaint, Old Court was in fact a \u201cnotorious violator of MSSIC regulations as well as state statutory law and regulations\u201d and Old Court appellees had mismanaged the savings and loan and misappropriated its funds. The complaint further alleges that MSSIC appellees, despite their awareness of Old Court\u2019s extensive regulatory violations, failed to regulate Old Court in the manner in which they were obligated, while at the same time representing to the public that MSSIC was carrying out its regulatory functions and that Old Court investments were fully insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The circuit court dismissed both cases, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that dismissal was required under the rule of <em>Pritchard v. Myers, </em>174 Md. 66, 197 A. 620 (1938). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We shall include additional facts as necessary in our discussion of the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The appropriate standard of review of the grant or denial of a motion to dismiss is whether the well-pleaded allegations of fact contained in the complaint, taken as true, reveal any set of facts that would support the claim made. <em>Flaherty v. Weinberg, </em>303 Md. 116, 135-36, 492 A.2d 618 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">In <em>Pritchard v. Myers, </em>174 Md. 66, 197 A. 620 (1938), the Court of Appeals held that a claim by depositors of an insolvent bank for \u201cdamages\u201d caused by mismanagement of the bank\u2019s assets belonged to the bank itself, rather than to the individual depositors, and could only be brought by the bank\u2019s receiver. \u201cThe equities of the corporate creditors [depositors] are to be sought and obtained through the medium of the corporate entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, 197 A. 620 (citations omitted). The <em>Pritchard </em>rule is an example of the well established principle that \u201cthe courts will not entertain a derivative suit by a stockholder on behalf of a corporation unless it appears that the intra-corporate remedies have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>been unsuccessfully pursued by the complaining stockholder.\u201d <em>Parish v. Milk Producers Assn., </em>250 Md. 24, 81-82, 242 A.2d 512 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">The reason for this rule is that the cause of action for injury to the property of a corporation or for impairment or destruction of its business is in the corporation, and such an injury, although it may diminish the value of the capital stock, is not primarily or necessarily a damage to the stockholder, and hence the stockholder\u2019s derivative right can be asserted only through the corporation. The rule is advantageous not only because it avoids a multiplicity of suits by the various stockholders, but also because any damages so recovered will be available for the payment of debts of the corporation, and, if any surplus remains, for distribution to the stockholders in proportion to the number of shares held by each.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-I\"><em>Waller v. Waller, </em>187 Md. 185, 189-90, 49 A.2d 449 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Appellants assert that the requirements of a demand on the receiver and petition to the receivership court set forth in <em>Pritchard, </em>174 Md. at 78-79, 197 A. 620, should not apply in the instant case because they are not asserting derivative claims. Appellants argue that the gravamen of their complaint is that appellees fraudulently induced them to deposit their money in Old Court and, therefore, they have stated a claim of direct injury since they, rather than Old Court, were injured by appellees\u2019 fraud. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In <em>In re Sunrise Securities Litigation, </em>916 F.2d 874 (3rd Cir.1990), a federal court was presented with the same argument as appellants present in the instant case, and similarly rejected the contention of depositors of an insolvent savings and loan institution that they had stated a claim that could be brought individually. The court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-8\">Although the allegations are cast in terms of defendants\u2019 misrepresentation of and failure to disclose information, we believe that under the distinct circumstances of this case, such allegations do not state a claim of direct injury founded on fraud. The essence of the complaint is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>defendants misrepresented the financial condition of Old Sunrise by failing to disclose that they had mismanaged Old Sunrise rendering the institution insolvent\u2014 The asserted injury emanated from mismanagement, not fraud. Furthermore, in this case, the depositors\u2019 loss cannot be separated from the injury suffered by the institutions and all other depositors, and the damages recoverable are assets of the institutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Other federal courts have likewise held that the remedy for fraudulent representations affecting all depositors of an insolvent savings and loan association belongs to the institution\u2019s receiver for the benefit of all depositors. <em>See, e.g., Downriver Community Federal Credit Union v. Penn Square Bank, </em>879 F.2d 754 (10th Cir.1989); <em>Brandenburg v. Seidel, </em>859 F.2d 1179 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We find these decisions to be persuasive. Appellees\u2019 alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of Old Court funds are assertable by MDIF in its capacity as Old Court\u2019s receiver \u2014 the damages recoverable for appellees\u2019 mismanagement and wrongdoing are assets of MDIF as receiver of Old Court and successor-in-interest of MSSIC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants have alleged no special damages not common to other depositors. They allegedly relied upon misleading information available to all depositors. Appellants\u2019 allegations of fraudulent representations are not distinct from the injury sustained by Old Court and all its depositors as a result of appellees\u2019 mismanagement and wrongdoing. <em>See Sunrise Securities, </em>916 F.2d at 887 (\u201cThe injury \u2014 loss of principal or interest \u2014 is sustained by all depositors and is incidental to and dependent on injury to the institution.\u201d). Under the circumstances, we think the requirements of a demand on the receiver and petition to the receivership court are applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The alternative, permitting depositors to bring individual actions for such injuries, would invariably impair the rights of other general creditors and claimants with superior interests. In our view, the fact that ... fraud may have induced all of the depositors to make their original deposits does not justify bypassing this equitable and common-sense system for recovery[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><em>Sunrise Securities, </em>916 F.2d at 887. <em>See also Pritchard, </em>174 Md. at 79, 197 A. 620 (\u201cIn this manner, the jurisdiction of the court will be retained, a multiplicity of suits averted, and the rights and interests of all parties concerned enforced and protected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Appellants rely upon <em>University of Maryland v. Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co., </em>923 F.2d 265 (3rd Cir.1991). We find <em>Peat Marwick </em>to be distinguishable from the instant case. In that case, the policyholders of an insolvent insurer brought an action against an independent auditor of the insurer\u2019s books, seeking damages allegedly resulting from the auditor\u2019s false and misleading certification of the insurer\u2019s financial statements. The court held that the policyholders\u2019 claims were not derivative of the insolvent insurer\u2019s claims. In <em>Peat Marwick, </em>however, the policyholders\u2019 claims were not premised on conduct that had injured the institution. In other words, the allegations did not link the auditor\u2019s actions to injury to the bank. Accordingly, the policyholder\u2019s claims were not assertable by the insolvent insurer itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">We recognize that the above distinction does not apply in the instant case with respect to MSSIC appellees. The complaint does not allege that MSSIC appellees actually participated in the mismanagement of Old Court, but rather that they failed to fulfill their own regulatory duties and thus abetted Old Court appellees in their fraudulent misrepresentations. Accordingly, appellants\u2019 claims against MSSIC appellees are not assertable by Old Court or by MDIF in its capacity as receiver of Old Court <em>See United Wire v. Bd. of Savings &amp; Loan, </em>316 Md. 236, 245-46, 558 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>A.2d 379 (1989) (recognizing general rule that insurer has no actionable duty to regulated institutions).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">While appellants\u2019 claims against MSSIC appellees are not assertable by MDIF as receiver of Old Court, they are assertable by MDIF in its capacity as successor-in-interest of MSSIC. Appellants claim that MSSIC appellees\u2019 misrepresentations induced them to deposit their money in Old Court. Nevertheless, we understand the gravamen of appellants\u2019 claim against MSSIC appellees to be that they failed to utilize their power and positions to supervise or regulate Old Court in the manner in which they were obligated under MSSIC\u2019s charter, by-laws and regulations, while representing to the public that MSSIC was carrying out its regulatory functions and that Old Court investments were fully insured. Thus, appellants\u2019 losses due to MSSIC appellees\u2019 alleged fraudulent representations are incidental to and flow from breaches of duties to MSSIC itself. <em>See United Wire v. Bd. of Savings &amp; Loan, </em>316 Md. 236, 243, 558 A.2d 379 (1989) (MDIF, in its capacity as insurer, had claim against the former officers and directors of MSSIC for breaches of duties they owed to MSSIC). The losses to MSSIC on account of those breaches are recoverable by MDIF. Accordingly, MDIF in its capacity as successor-in-interest of MSSIC is the proper party to sue for the benefit of all depositors.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Appellants contend that application of the <em>Pritchard </em>rule against them is barred by the supremacy clause of the federal constitution. We reject this contention. The two cases relied on by appellants are distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Testa v. Katt, </em>330 U.S. 386, 67 S.Ct. 810, 91 L.Ed. 967 (1947), the Supreme Court overturned a state court\u2019s flat refusal to enforce a federal law. In <em>Felder v. Casey, </em>487 U.S. 131, 108 S.Ct. 2302, 101 L.Ed.2d 123 (1988), the Supreme Court invalidated the application of a state\u2019s time limits for \u00a7 1983 civil rights claims against the state, ruling that the time limits conflicted with the remedial purpose of the federal statute and that their enforcement would likely produce different outcomes in state courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>based solely on whether the claim was asserted in federal or state court. The <em>Pritchard </em>rule neither forecloses RICO actions against the directors, officers and others of savings and loan institutions nor conflicts with or impedes RICO\u2019s goals. The <em>Pritchard </em>rule merely requires that derivative claims relating to an insolvent savings and loan association be brought under the supervision of the receivership court in order to assure equitable distribution of recovered claims. Such a neutral rule does not conflict with the purpose of RICO, but rather comports with the federal policy of deterrence underlying RICO. <em>See In re Sunrise, </em>916 F.2d at 881-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Appellants also maintain that the <em>Pritchard </em>rule does not apply with respect to outsiders, that is, anyone other than former directors and officers of Old Court. We disagree. Appellants offer no authority for their contention. The purpose of the <em>Pritchard </em>rule is to insure that the assets of an insolvent institution are divided equally among its creditors in an orderly fashion. If appellants\u2019 claims are derivative, then the <em>Pritchard </em>rule applies, regardless of whether the individuals sued are corporate \u201cinsiders\u201d or \u201coutsiders.\u201d As we have already made clear, appellants\u2019 claims against appellees are derivative of Old Court\u2019s and MSSIC\u2019s claims against appellees. Accordingly, it makes no difference that some of the defendants are \u201coutsiders.\u201d <em>Cf In re Sunrise </em>(barring RICO action against directors, officers, attorneys and auditors of insolvent savings and loan institution because action was derivative).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Appellants finally argue that the <em>Pritchard </em>rule does not bar actions against institutions in conservatorship, so that it does not apply to the Graves appellants. Appellants offer no authority for their contention. Whatever differences may exist between conservatorship and receivership, we do not think they have significance with respect to the <em>Pritchard </em>rule. <em>See Finci v. American Casualty, </em>82 Md.App. 471, 477, 572 A.2d 1092 (1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>323 Md. 358, 593 A.2d 1069 (1991) (a conservator and a receiver have equivalent status in legal actions).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>We need not address or consider the other grounds relied upon by the trial court in support of its rulings in view of our opinion as to the application of the <em>Pritchard </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CASES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\">.
