Murray F. TurEy, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-12\" pgmap=\"528(71) 529(244)\">The appellee filed his bill in the circuit court of Cook county against appellants to enjoin the expenditure of $150,-000 for the year 1905 by the board of local improvements for the purchase of improvement bonds issued upon special assessments. The bill alleged that pursuant to the Local Improvement act of 1897 the city of Chicago made many local improvements and issued bonds from time to time for the purpose of paying therefor, amounting to many hundreds of thousands of dollars, which are known as special assessment or improvement bonds, and which state upon their face that they are payable solely out of the funds collected by special assessment. On April 9, 1903, an ordinance was passed authorizing the creation of a special fund, to be known as the \u201cimprovement bond fund,\u201d to be used for the purchase of improvement bonds, coupons and vouchers issued since July 1, 1897, when the respective funds against which the bonds had been issued had been exhausted and deficiencies existed on account of delays in the collection of the special assessment. The bonds thus purchased were to be deposited.with the comptroller as a part of the fund, to be reimbursed by the payment of the bonds and interest when the corresponding special assessment had been collected and the deficiency made good. During the years 1903 and 1904 appropriations to the amount of $50,000 for each year were made from miscellaneous receipts, and in the year 1905 $150,000 was appropriated for the same purpose. The bill alleges that the payment of said bonds by the said city was an illegal diversion of the funds belonging to the city, raised by taxation, and would diminish the funds in the city treasury applicable to the future legitimate expenses and appropriations of said city for permanent improvements. The prayer was for an injunction to restrain such expenditures.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-3\" pgmap=\"529(108) 530(99)\">The answer of appellants alleged that the finance committee of the city council, after a thorough investigation of the outstanding special assessment accounts, found that $150,000 would be sufficient to purchase special assessment bonds and coupons liable to be temporarily defaulted by reason of delay in the collection of assessments, and that the ultimate loss would not exceed one-half of one per cent thereof; that the fund provided by ordinance was not used for the payment of said local improvement bonds, coupons and interest, but that it was merely used to purchase such of said paper as was in danger of being defaulted, and that such purchased paper was placed in the fund in lieu of the money, and the fund was reimbursed when the special assessment had been collected; that the city of Chicago is interested in maintaining the commercial integrity of the bonds, and may, as a matter of policy, in its discretion, in order to preserve its credit, purchase the bonds from its general fund or from moneys derived from other sources than taxation and hold the same until the special assessment is collected, and may then pay the bonds out of the special assessment fund when the same is so replenished.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-3\" pgmap=\"530\">The circuit court granted an injunction according to the prayer of the bill, and by agreement the hearing upon that motion was taken as a final hearing of the cause, and a final decree entered finding the equities in favor of the complainant and making the injunction perpetual. The Appellate Court has affirmed the decree of the circuit court, and a further appeal has been prosecuted to this court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-4\" pgmap=\"530\">Robert Redfield, and Frank Johnston, Jr., (James H.

In the case of Wilson v. Board of Trustees, 133 Ill. 443, we held that this section was adopted for the purpose of removing restrictions which had been placed upon the legislature by the constitution of 1848 and to authorize the making of local improvements by the levy of assessments on contiguous property according to frontage, and that the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d were used in the section for the purpose of excluding the possibility of misapprehension that because only cities, towns and villages could be authorized to make local improvements by special assessment or special taxation, they could not be authorized to make them by general taxation.</p> <p id=\"b533-6\" pgmap=\"533(146) 534(38)\">Prior to 1897, section 1 of the Local Improvement act passed under the above section of the constitution vested cities with authority to make local improvements by special assessment or by special taxation, or both, or by general taxation, or otherwise, as might be prescribed by ordinance. (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1893, chap. 24, sec. 116, p. 268.) In the case of Kuehner v. City of Freeport, 143 Ill. 92, we held that the language of the above section was not directed to the mode of making a single improvement, but to the making of improvements in the plural, and that its purpose was to vest in the corporate authorities power to make improvements both by special assessment and special taxation, but that in case of a single improvement the city or village must decide by ordinance which of the modes it would pursue, and that the words \u201cor both\u201d did not authorize a city or village to combine the two modes in a single assessment, but that they might combine general taxation with special assessment or with special taxation in the same proceeding.</p> <p id=\"b534-3\" pgmap=\"534\">On July i, 1897, an amendment to section 1 of the Local Improvement act went into effect, conferring power on cities and villages to make local improvements by special assessment or special taxation of contiguous property, or by general taxation, or otherwise, as the city or village by ordinance might prescribe. This act was substantially the same as the one in effect prior to July 1, 1897, except that the words \u201cor both\u201d were omitted. Thus it will be seen that the omission of these words limited the application of the statute, and in no way could it be implied under this provision that an assessment might be made by special taxation and special assessment in the same ordinance. Outside of the sections above referred to, no provision of the statute has been called to our attention authorizing the two systems to be adopted in the same ordinance.</p> <p id=\"b534-4\" pgmap=\"534\">In the Kuehner case, supra, we held that the provision of section 9 of article 9 of the constitution, being an exception to the general rule and policy of the State and the dominant principle of the constitution, should not be extended beyond the clear import of the language employed. That rule may also apply to the statutes passed under that section of the constitution. Those statutes should receive no more liberal interpretation than the provisions of the constitution, upon which they are based.</p> <p id=\"b534-5\" pgmap=\"534(78) 535(152)\">The appellants contend that, notwithstanding the above provision, they may by ordinance prescribe that a certain local improvement may be paid for by special assessment, and then afterwards pay a portion of the same out of a general fund raised by general taxation. This method might open a way to great injustice. If the special assessment had been levied and paid by a portion of the property owners, and the city were permitted to purchase outstanding improvement bonds and afterwards a portion of those bonds should not be paid, some method would have to be devised which would equalize the payments so that the tax would be just and uniform, otherwise one property .owner would have to pay his full share of the assessment as levied against him, while another might be required to pay only a part or escape entirely. The city council, by its original ordinance, may provide that an improvement is to be paid for in part out of the general fund and in part by special taxation, but after that ordinance has been passed and the assessment levied and the work completed and the bonds issued, there is no statutory provision which has been called to our attention authorizing the city council to change the method' of payment, and we do not think the city council-has any discretion outside of express statutory provisions.</p> <p id=\"b535-3\" pgmap=\"535(217) 536(92)\">It is next contended that the . city has the power to purchase special assessment or improvement bonds, coupons and vouchers out of moneys derived from miscellaneous sources, where there is a delay in the collection of assessments in the corresponding special assessment fund, and reimburse itself by paying such bonds out of the special assessment when collected. In support of this contention it is insisted that paragraph 2 of section 62, article 5, chapter 24, of the statute, authorizes the city council to appropriate money for corporate purposes only, and provides for the payment of debts and expenses of the corporation, and that under this section the city has power to authorize the purchase of the bonds in the manner above described on the ground that such purchase is a corporate purpose. The sections of the statute providing for the making of local improvements are complete in themselves. They provide the manner in which the assessment shall be originated, how the contract shall be let, how the work shall be done, how the bonds shall be issued and how the collections shall be made. As we have already said, this method of levying a special assessment is contrary to the dominant policy of the State and should not be construed beyond the clear import of the language used. Section 73 of the Local Improvement act (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1903, p. 408,) provides that in case it shall appear that the assessment can not be collected, the municipality shall nevertheless not be in any way liable to the contractor in case of failure to collect the same, but it shall, so far as it can legally do so, with all reasonable diligence cause a valid assessment to be levied to defray the cost of the work until the contractor shall be fully paid.</p> <p id=\"b536-4\" pgmap=\"536\">Section 90 of the same chapter provides that no person- or persons accepting vouchers or bonds shall have any claim or lien upon the city for the payment of such voucher or bonds, or the interest thereon, except from the collection of the assessment against which the voucher or bonds are issued, and the municipality shall nevertheless be in no way liable to the holders of said voucher or bonds in case of failure to collect the same, but the city shall use reasonable diligence to cause the assessment to be made and collected and the bonds and vouchers to be fully paid.</p> <p id=\"b536-5\" pgmap=\"536\">It will be seen from these provisions of the statute that it was the evident purpose and intention of the legislature to in no way hold the city responsible or liable for the vouchers, bonds or interest. This is a positive statutory provision, which would have priority over paragraph. 3 of section 62, article 5, chapter 24, as quoted by appellants. The city is powerless, by any ordinance which it might pass, to make itself liable in the face of the express provisions of the statute'. While it might be of advantage to the city, and save money to the property owners and tax-payers, for the city to assume responsibility for the bonds thus issued, yet in the absence of legislative authority it is powerless so to do.</p> <p id=\"b536-6\" pgmap=\"536\">We find no reversible error, and the decree of the circuit court and the judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"AOk\" pgmap=\"536\">Judgment .affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
