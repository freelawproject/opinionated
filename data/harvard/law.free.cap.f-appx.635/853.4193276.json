(Trinity) brought a diversity action based on Florida state law against appellant Jose E. Lopez.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Lopez did not respond to Trinity\u2019s complaint, leading to an entry of default. The district court then issued an order notifying Lopez that it would enter a final default judgment against him if he did not respond to the complaint and/or move to set aside the entry of default within a certain period of time. Lopez failed to take any action during the allotted- time period. As a result, the court entered a final default judgment against him. Subsequently, Lopez moved the court to set aside the final default judgment, but the court denied Lopez\u2019s motion. Lopez now appeals the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the default judgment, arguing that the court erred in denying his motion because his failure to timely respond to Trinity\u2019s complaint and the district court\u2019s order was the result of excusable neglect. We are unconvinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-23\">\u201cWe reverse the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment only if the district court abused its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>tion in denying the motion.\u201d <em>Fla. Physician\u2019s Ins. Co. v. Ehlers, 8 </em>F.Sd 780, 783 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam). A district court \u201cmay set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b)\u201d of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Fed. R.Civ.P. 55(c). Rule 60(b) provides that \u201cthe court may relieve a party ... from a final judgment\u201d based on' \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>60(b). \u201cThe excusable neglect standard that courts apply in setting aside a default judgment is more rigorous than the good cause standard that is utilized in setting aside an entry of default.\u201d <em>EEOC v. Mike Smith Pontiac GMC, Inc., </em>896 F.2d 524, 528 (11th Cir.1990).' \u201cIn order to establish ... excusable neglect, the defaulting party must show that: (1) it had a meritorious defense that might have affected the outcome; (2) granting the motion would not result in prejudice to the non-defaulting party; and (3) a good reason existed for failing to reply to the complaint.\u201d <em>Ehlers, </em>8 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Lopez has not shown that he had good reason for failing to timely respond to Trinity\u2019s complaint and the district court\u2019s order notifying him that he was at risk of an adverse final default judgment. Lopez attempts to meet his \u201cgood reason\u201d burden by arguing that he did not respond to the complaint or order because he \u201cmistakenly believed that he could work with Trinity\u2019s counsel ... and that doing so would take care of [this] dispute.\u201d. However, this mistaken belief is not a \u201cmeaningful justification for engaging in the dilatory conduct which caused the default to be entered.\u201d <em>See Mike Smith Pontiac GMC, </em>896 F.2d at 529. \u201cHad [Lopez] desired the [district court] to consider the fact that settlement negotiations had precluded [him] from responding to the complaint, [he] should have raised the issue\u201d with the court prior to the entry of the final default judgment. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 529 n. 5. Instead, Lopez took no action to protect his interests, despite the district court providing him \u201cample opportunity\u201d to do so. <em>See Compania Interam-ericana Exp.-Imp., S.A. v. Compania Dominicana de Aviaci\u00f3n, </em>88 F.3d 948, 951-52 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that the appellants failed to show \u201cgood cause\u201d where they were \u201cgiven ample opportunity to comply with court orders but fail[ed] to effect any compliance\u201d). \u201cSuch inaction demonstrates a lack of diligence\u201d and supports a finding that Lopez did not have a \u201cgood reason\u201d for his actions. <em>See Ehlers, </em>8 F.3d at 783-84 (determining that the appellant \u201cfailed to establish good cause for his default\u201d because the record showed that he did not act diligently). Accordingly, we cannot conclude that \u25a0 the district court abused its discretion in refusing to set aside the final default judgment against Lopez. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-15\">. As a threshold matter, this court previously issued a \"jurisdictional question\u201d to the parties based on the concern that Trinity\u2019s complaint did not sufficiently allege Lopez\u2019s citizenship to establish subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, After consideration of the parties\u2019 responses, we conclude that Trinity's complaint adequately pled Lopez\u2019s citizenship and we have subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
