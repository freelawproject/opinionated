Rolle, who was convicted in 2009 of illegal re-entry of a deported alien under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), argues that the motion, which the district court construed as an unauthorized successive motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, was not a request to vacate the conviction, but a request to correct the indictment, which he contends incorrectly charged him with both entry and attempting to enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2255, a prisoner in federal custody may move the court that imposed his sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence if it was imposed in violation of federal constitutional or statutory law, was imposed without proper jurisdiction, is in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). However, when a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Rolle\u2019s motion, which explicitly requested that the district court vacate his sentence, was more aptly construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. Therefore, as Rolle already had filed a prior \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied on the merits, the district court did not err in denying the instant motion as successive and unauthorized by this Court. <em>See McIver v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 1327, 1329 (11th Cir.2002) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a \u00a7 2255 motion as second or successive).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
