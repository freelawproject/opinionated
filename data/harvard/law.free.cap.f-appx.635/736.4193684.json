According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Thornton and a codefen-dant, Lewis Flagg, committed thirteen robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in Georgia over roughly a one-month period in the summer of 2013. Thornton and Flagg each were indicted on the same thirteen counts in November 2013. Flagg pled guilty under a negotiated plea agreement in August 2014. Thornton entered his non-negotiated guilty plea in January 2015. Flagg was sentenced to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment; Thornton was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment..</p>\n<p id=\"b757-17\">On appeal, 'Thornton argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because it was substantially dissimilar to Flagg\u2019s sentence. He contends that both he and Flagg have similar criminal histories and pled guilty to the exact same charges, and that the factors the district court considered in sentencing Flagg do not justify the 111-month disparity between their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-18\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>that the district court committed no significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We then examine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The district court must impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than' necessary, to comply with the purposes listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, among other factors. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). We will vacate a sentence only if \u201cwe are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>home) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Here, Thornton has not met his burden of showing that his 151-month sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Thornton primarily argues that the disparity between his and Flagg\u2019s sentences is unwarranted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). \u201cA well-founded claim of disparity, however, assumes that apples are being compared to apples.\u201d <em>United States v. Docam-po, </em>573 F.3d 1091, 1101 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted). While it is true that Thornton and Flagg pled guilty to the same charges from the same indictment, Flagg is not a valid comparator for \u00a7 3553(a)(6) purposes for two primary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">First, Thornton and Flagg were not \u201cdefendants <em>with similar records </em>who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (emphasis added). Thornton\u2019s criminal record was more extensive than Flagg\u2019s. Based on his criminal history, Thornton was designated a career offender, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, while Flagg was not. Even aside from this enhancement, Thornton\u2019s criminal-history points placed him in criminal-history category VI. By contrast, Flagg\u2019s criminal-history points placed him in criminal-history category III.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The disparity in criminal histories, in turn, led to a disparity in guideline ranges. Thornton\u2019s guideline range was 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on an offense level of 29; Flagg\u2019s was 78 to 97 months, based on an offense level of 26. At the outset, therefore, Flagg\u2019s guideline range was nearly half of Thornton\u2019s based primarily on their respective criminal records.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">Second, Flagg is not a valid comparator because he cooperated with the government and received the benefit of a down<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ward departure for substantial assistance, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. A defendant who provides substantial assistance to the government . is not similarly situated with a defendant who does not. <em>See Docampo, </em>573 F.3d at 1101; <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2008). The government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion requested a 35% reduction in Flagg\u2019s guideline range because he cooperated immediately, and his assistance led to Thornton\u2019s arrest. The court granted the motion, reducing Flagg\u2019s guideline range to 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because Thornton did not receive a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure and only entered a guilty plea the day before trial was scheduled to begin, there was no \u201cunwarranted\u201d disparity between his and Flagg\u2019s sentence. Consequently, Flagg is not a valid comparator for \u00a7 3553(a)(6) purposes because he did not have a similar criminal record, and, unlike Thornton, Flagg provided substantial assistance to the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Other factors discussed by the district court likewise support its decision to sentence Thornton and Flagg disparately. The court found that Flagg had a significant record of mental impairment and sentenced him to 40 months\u2019 imprisonment after granting his motion for a downward departure due to diminished mental capacity, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.3. By contrast, the court concluded that Thornton was an \u201cintelligent, reasonably educated person\u201d who, due to his extensive criminal record, knew what he was facing by committing the offenses. In addition, the court reasoned that Thornton\u2019s \u201crepetition of the conduct\u201d in this case, viewed in the context of his prior criminal history, was \u201cglaring\u201d and justified a within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In sum, Thornton has not shown an \u201cunwarranted\u201d disparity between his and Flagg\u2019s sentences. The district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and sufficiently justified its decision to sentence Thornton to a significantly longer term of imprisonment than Flagg. Moreover, Thornton\u2019s sentence is at the low end of the guideline range of 151-188 months, and we ordinarily expect that a sentence within the guideline range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). Thornton has not otherwise shown that his sentence is outside of the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190; <em>Tome, </em>611 F.3d at 1378. Accordingly, we affirm Thornton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-6\">. Thornton claims that his criminal record is not as severe as Flagg\u2019s because Flagg had a prior conviction for armed robbery. However, this has no bearing on the extensiveness of Thornton\u2019s criminal history or Thornton's and Flagg\u2019s respective criminal history categories.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
