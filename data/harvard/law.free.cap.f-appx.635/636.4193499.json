Nordelo, whose conviction was final in 1992, argued that his petition was timely filed within one year of discovering that trial counsel had been ineffective for misadvising him about the penal consequences of rejecting an offer to plead guilty. We issued a certificate of appeala-bility to address whether Nordelo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance was barred by the statute of limitation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1). Because we conclude, like the district court, that \u201cthe factual predicate of [Nor-delo\u2019s] claim ... could have been discovered [earlier] through the exercise of due diligence,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), we affirm the dismissal of Nordelo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">In 1991, a Florida jury found Nordelo guilty of two charges of armed robbery. Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 777.011, 787.01, 812.13. A Florida court sentenced Nordelo, an habitual violent offender, to concurrent terms of imprisonment for life. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 775.084. At sentencing, Nordelo\u2019s attorney stated that with a sentence to \u201clife as a habitual, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you are talking about at least 15 years on up,\u201d and the trial court responded, \u201cGood.\u201d Later, the trial court amended Nordelo\u2019s sentence <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to reflect that he had a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 775.084(4)(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">Nordelo successfully challenged one of his convictions. On direct appeal, the Third District Court of Appeals vacated one count of armed robbery on the ground that Nordelo\u2019s two charges stemmed from \u201cone comprehensive transaction to confiscate the sole victim\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Nordelo v. State, </em>603 So.2d 36, 38-39 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1992).' Later, Nordelo moved to vacate his remaining conviction, <em>see </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850, but the trial court denied Nordelo\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Nordelo contested the length of his sentence. In 1995, Nordelo filed a motion to correct his sentence, which the district court denied. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.800. In his motion, Nordelo alleged that he was \u201csentenced to life in prison\u201d; he was \u201csuffering an unnecessary punishment, thinking that he will die in prison\u201d; \u201c[t]he unlawful sentence imposed (natural life in prison) ... [was] a miscarriage of justice\u201d; and he was erroneously \u201csentenced ... to life in prison as a violent habitual offender\u201d and \u201cshould be re-sentenced to ... 12 to 17 years.\u201d In 1996, Nordelo moved to vacate his sentence and requested a reevaluation of \u201cwhether life imprisonment is just for [him],\u201d but the trial court denied Nordelo\u2019s motion as successive and lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">On November 30, 2005, Nordelo wrote a letter \u201crequesting the [trial] court to reconsider and mitigate [his] sentence to the original offer by the state (25 years as a habitual offender).\u201d Nordelo stated that he was \u201clocked up in prison for life for one count of armed robbery\u201d; \u201csentenced to life in prison\u201d; and was '\u201cdoomed to spend the rest of [his] life in prison.\u201d Nordelo mailed the letter to a prosecutor in the State Attorney\u2019s Office, who forwarded the letter to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">In 2008, Nordelo moved unsuccessfully for postconviction relief based on newly-discovered evidence. <em>See </em>Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850(b)(1), (c). Nordelo argued that his codefendant had provided an affidavit ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>onerating him and that the prosecutor had presented false and misleading evidence at trial, but the trial court denied Nordelo\u2019s motion. Although the Third District Court of Appeals affirmed, <em>Nordelo v. State, </em>47 So.3d 854 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2010), the Supreme Court of Florida quashed the decision that denied Nordelo\u2019s motion and remanded for the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing about the affidavit, <em>Nordelo v. State, </em>93 So.3d 178, 187 (Fla. 2012). On remand, after Nordelo\u2019s code-fendant disavowed his affidavit and testified that Nordelo had participated in the armed robbery, the trial court denied Nor-delo\u2019s motion to vacate. Nordelo did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">On March 15, 2013, Nordelo filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Relevant to this appeal, Nordelo argued, for the first time, that his trial counsel was ineffective for misadvising him that he might be paroled in 15 years, which caused him to reject an offer to plead guilty and receive a sentence of 25 years. The State of Florida answered that Nordelo\u2019s petition was barred by the federal statute of limitation, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d), and that Nor-delo\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance was unexhausted and procedurally defaulted. Nordelo replied that his petition was timely because he did not discover his claim of ineffective assistance until February 2013 when, after being transferred to a new prison, his classification officer told .him that he was ineligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">A magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss Nordelo\u2019s petition as untimely. The magistrate judge determined that Nordelo \u201cwas sentenced on April 2,1991, with credit for 286 days of time served\u201d and \u201ccompleted fifteen years of his sentence on June 20, 2005,\u201d and that he \u201cshould have reasonably discovered that he was not eligible for parole, at the latest, on June 20, 2005.\u201d Nordelo failed within \u201cone year from that date ... to seek habeas relief based on counsel\u2019s alleged misadvice\u201d and that made his \u201cpetition more than six years late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Nordelo objected to the report and rear-gued that the statute of limitation accrued in February 2013 when he was told that he was ineligible for parole and knew that he rejected a more favorable plea agreement based on the faulty advice of his trial counsel. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Nordelo alleged that he thought he would be eligible for parole after \u201cfifteen (15) minimum mandatory years were completed on June 20, 2005,\u201d and that \u201c[djuring his yearly progress review, [he] asked his classification officer about his parole interview now that he completed the mandatory portion of his sentence,\u201d but he \u201cwas instructed to have patience, that at this time he did not have a parole date.\u201d According to Norde-lo, \u201c[e]very year [he] ... inquired about his parole interview date and was always given a negative answer, but was never told that he was not under the parole system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\u201cAfter a thorough review of the record and consideration of the [report and recommendation]\u201d and Nordelo\u2019s objections, the district court decided that the report was \u201cwell-reasoned and accurately state[d] the law of the case.\u201d The district court adopted the report and dismissed Norde-lo\u2019s petition as barred by the one-year statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely, and we review related factual findings for clear error. <em>Cole v. Warden, Ga. State Prison, </em>768 F.3d 1150, 1155 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1905, 191 L.Ed.2d 773 (2015). \u201cWe have squarely held that a determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>tion regarding a party\u2019s diligence is a finding of fact that will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Carr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). That \u201cstandard requires us to affirm a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless the record lacks substantial evidence to support [its] determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The timeliness of Nordelo\u2019s petition turns on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of [his] claim ... could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Nordelo argues that he discovered in February 2013 that his counsel had misadvised him about his eligibility for parole. That information, the State of Florida argues, could have been discovered years earlier when Lawrence thought, based on his counsel\u2019s representations, that he was eligible for parole. After careful review, we conclude that, had Nordelo acted with due diligence, he could have discovered in June 2005 that he was ineligible for parole and sought collateral relief based on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"A6J\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act gives state prisoners, like Nordelo, one year to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Generally, the statutory period runs from the date the prisoner\u2019s conviction \u201cbec[omes] final by the conclusion of direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Because Nordelo\u2019s conviction became final before the effective date of the Act, April 24, 1996, he had a one-year grace period, or until April 24, 1997, to file his federal petition. <em>See Moore v. Campbell, </em>344 F.3d 1313, 1319 (11th Cir.2003). Nordelo filed his petition on March 15, 2013, more than 15 years after the grace period expired. Although Nordelo\u2019s petition is untimely under section 2244(d)(1)(A), he is not necessarily barred from pursuing habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">The Act provides four specified events from which the statute of limitation can be measured. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). One such event is the discovery of facts that support a claim that the state prisoner has suffered a violation of a constitutional right, such as the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel. ' <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), 2254(a). \u201cSection 2244(d)(1)(D) gives [state prisoners] the benefit of a later start if [the] vital facts could not have been known by the date the appellate process ended.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>768 F.3d at 1155 (quoting <em>Owens v. Boyd, </em>235 F.3d 356, 359 (7th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Section 2244(d)(1)(D) provides that \u201c[t]he limitation period ... run[s] from ... the date on which the factual predicate of the claim .,. could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). That \u201c[t]ime begins when the prisoner knows (or through diligence could discover) the important facts, <em>not when the prisoner recognizes their legal significance.\u201d Cole, </em>768 F.3d at 1157 (quoting <em>Owens, </em>235 F.3d at 359). And because \u201cdue diligence is equivalent to a rule of inquiry notice,\u201d the prisoner is obligated to make reasonable efforts to discover the facts relevant to his claim for habeas corpus relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that Nordelo could have discovered the factual predicate for his claim \u2014 that he was ineligible for parole \u2014 by June 20, 2006. Nordelo collaterally attacked his sentence in 1995 and 1996 as \u201cunlawful\" and \u201c[un]just\u201d and alleged that he had been \u201csentenced to life in prison\u201d for the span of his \u201cnatural life\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>and thought \u201cthat he [would] die in prison.\u201d Nordelo asked his classification officer about a parole hearing because he knew that he would complete his mandatory minimum sentence on June 20, 2005. By that date, Nordelo possessed \u201cthe important facts\u201d about his sentence and his prospect for parole that he needed to discover whether he was eligible for parole. <em>See id. </em>at 1157. Nordelo\u2019s classification officer said that he did not have a parole interview date and to be \u201cpatient,\u201d But a reasonably diligent prisoner in Nordelo\u2019s shoes would have inquired why he was not scheduled for a parole interview and when he would be interviewed. <em>See id. </em>at 1156. Nordelo does not argue that he was prevented from ascertaining his eligibility for parole, only that the information was not volunteered by his classification officer. Had Nordelo conducted any investigation, such as questioning the officer further or requesting information from prison officials, he \u201ccould have discovered\u201d that he was ineligible for parole. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). And the district court could have found that Nordelo knew he was ineligible for parole by November 2005 when he wrote a letter asking the trial \u201ccourt to reconsider and mitigate [his] sentence.\u201d In that letter, Nordelo stated that he was \u201clocked up in prison for life for one count of armed robbery\u201d; \u201csentenced to life in prison\u201d; and was \u201cdoomed to spend the rest of [his] life in prison.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the finding that Nordelo possessed by June 20, 2005, all the facts vital to discovering that he was ineligible for parole and needed to pursue collateral relief based on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The district court correctly dismissed Nordelo\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely. \u201cSection 2244(d)(1)(D) runs the statute-of-limitations clock from the date on which the factual predicate of the claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Cole, </em>768 F.3d at 1155 (brackets, ellipses, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). Nordelo knew or.could have discovered by June 20, 2005, that he was ineligible for parole and used that information to collaterally attack his sentence based on the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. Nordelo had one year, or until June 20, 2006, to file his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), but failed to do so. In an attempt to salvage his petition, Nordelo argues that he is entitled to statutory tolling for the period that his motion for a new trial was pending in the state courts, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2), but the statute of limitation expired before he filed the motion in August 2008. \u201c[0]nce a deadline has expired, there is nothing left to toll.\u201d <em>Sibley v. Culliver, </em>377 F.3d 1196, 1204 (11th Cir. 2004). As the district court stated, when Nordelo filed his federal petition in March 2013, it was \u201cmore than six years late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Nordelo\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
