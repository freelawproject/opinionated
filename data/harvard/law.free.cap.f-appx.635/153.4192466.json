He contends that the district court erred by imposing the eight-level aggravated felony enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on a finding that his 2011 Texas felony convictions for theft were aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). Del Angel argues that the Texas theft statute encompasses conduct broader than the generic, contemporary definition of theft because it includes theft by deception, which can be committed by the appropriation of property with the owner\u2019s consent, and we have defined generic theft as the taking of property without the owner\u2019s consent. He eoficedes that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d 437, 438 (5th Cir.2014), in which we held that the Texas theft statute, Texas Penal Code \u00a7 31.03, does not deviate from the generic crime of theft. However, Del Angel contends that <em>Rodriguez-Salazar </em>conflicts with our earlier decision in <em>Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 540-41 (5th Cir.2008), in which we held that the federal bank fraud statute does not meet the ge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>neric definition of theft. He asserts that, under the rule of orderliness, <em>Martinez </em>is the governing rule of decision for this issue. Del Angel further maintains the district court\u2019s error was not harmless because the adjusted advisory guidelines range would have been anywhere from two to eight months less than the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>we specifically addressed any possible conflicts with our earlier decision in <em>Martinez. Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>768 F.3d at 438. We reiterated our holding in <em>Martinez </em>and emphasized that the question of a theft crime was not before this court in that case and, therefore, <em>Martinez </em>was not controlling precedent. <em>Id. </em>In light of this distinction and our analysis of consent in <em>Rodriguez-Salazar, </em>Del Angel has failed to show that we violated the rule of orderliness by not adhering to our previous holding in <em>Martinez. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance. Summary affirmance is not- appropriate, and the Government\u2019s motion is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found, for Relief and Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a reply brief is also DENIED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AQu\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. 47.5,4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
