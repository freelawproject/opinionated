(\u201cCSXT\u201d) on Plaintiffs negligence claim. This ease arises out of a collision between a car driven by Plaintiffs wife \u2014 a car in which Plaintiff was also a passenger \u2014 and a CSXT train at a railway crossing in Covington, Georgia (\u201cEmory Street Crossing\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">The Emory Street Crossing consists of a two-lane road that runs in a north-south direction across the CSXT rail lines. Before 1974, the Emory Street Crossing was comprised of four railroad tracks (from north to south: the northern track, the pass track, the main line, and the house track) and was equipped with flashing lights and bells. In 1974, CSXT\u2019s predecessor and the Georgia Department of Transportation entered into an agreement (\u201c1974 Agreement\u201d) to remove the unused northern track and to install new crossing signals and automatic gates on either side of the Emory Street Crossing. In conformance with the design specifications attached to the 1974 Agreement, the new protective devices were installed 15 feet north of the pass track (then northernmost track) and 15 feet south of the house track (the southern-most track).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">Sometime before the mid-1980\u2019s CSXT removed the house track: the southernmost track. No corresponding change was made to the location of the protective devices south of the Emory Street Crossing. As a result, at the time of the collision, the protective devices \u2014 which included flashing lights, bells, and an .automatic gate\u2014 were located 36 feet south of the then southern-most track: the main line.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">On the day of the collision, a westbound train activated the protective devices at the Emory Street Crossing just as Plaintiffs wife approached the crossing from the south. Plaintiffs wife slowed down in response to the flashing lights and bells but came to a full stop only after she had already driven past the automatic gate. The automatic gate then lowered directly behind Plaintiffs car. The car\u2019s front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>bumper was 17 feet from the nearest track. After remaining stopped for about 30 seconds, Plaintiffs wife began driving forward across the track and was struck by the oncoming train. As a result of the collision, Plaintiffs wife died; and Plaintiff suffered severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Plaintiff filed this civil action against CSXT<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in state court, alleging, in pertinent part, that CSXT was negligent for failing to relocate the protective devices after taking away the house track.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> CSXT removed the case to federal court. The district court granted CSXT\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that CSXT owed no duty to relocate the protective devices at the Emory Street Crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836-37 (11th Cir.2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record presents no genuine issue of material fact and where the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Plaintiff contends that CSXT had a contractual duty, pursuant to the 1974 Agreement, to relocate the protective devices south of the Emory Street Crossing after removing the house track. Plaintiff relies on the design specifications attached to the 1974 Agreement, which specify, among other things, that the protective devices were to be constructed 15 feet from the center of each of the then-contemplated northern-most (the pass track) and southern-most (the house track) tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Under Georgia law, \u201cthe cardinal rule of contract construction is to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent, and where the contract terms are clear and unambiguous, the court will look to that alone to find the true intent of the parties.\u201d <em>Parris Props., LLC v. Nichols, </em>305 Ga.App. 734, 700 S.E.2d 848, 853 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">The 1974 Agreement provides that, after the protective devices are installed and \u201cfound to be in satisfactory working order,\u201d the devices \u201cshall be immediately put into service, <em>operated and maintained </em>by [CSXT] so long as [CSXT] operate[s] trains across\u201d the Emory Street Crossing, or until the parties agree that the signals are no longer necessary, the crossing is abandoned, or until \u201cother legal requirements necessitate cessation of <em>operation and maintenance </em>of signals thereat.\u201d In addition, CSXT \u201cwill <em>operate and maintain </em>at its sole expense any grade crossing protective devices that are installed or modified pursuant to this agreement.\u201d (emphasis added)-.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">In determining the parties\u2019 intent, we look first to the plain meaning of the terms used in the contract. In this context, the term \u201coperate\u201d means \u201cto cause or direct the functioning of; to control the working of\u2019; and the term \u201cmaintain\u201d means \u201cto take action to preserve in working order.\u201d <em>See operate, v., </em>Oxford English Dictionary, http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/131741 (2015); <em>maintain, v., </em>Oxford English Dictionary, http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/ 112562 (2015). Given these definitions, and considering the phrase \u201coperate and maintain\u201d in context, the 1974 Agreement imposes unambiguously a duty on CSXT to control the working of, and to keep in working order, the protective devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">We reject Plaintiffs contention that CSXT\u2019s contractual duty to \u201coperate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>maintain\u201d the protective devices also encompasses an additional duty: a duty to \u201cmaintain\u201d at all times the 15-foot distance between the protective devices and whatever might become in the future the presently existing nearest track. Nothing in the 1974 Agreement or the attached design specifications can be interpreted reasonably as imposing such ongoing duty. Nor does the plain language of the 1974 Agreement or the attached design specifications require CSXT to relocate the protective devices upon future removal of a track or for any other reason. The contract terms in the 1974 Agreement are clear and unambiguous, imposing no duty on CSXT to keep on relocating protective devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Plaintiff also argues that CSXT had a common law duty to relocate the protective devices. Even if we assume\u2014 without deciding \u2014 that CSXT had a duty at common law related to the installation of protective devices at railroad crossings, we have accepted that the common law duty has been preempted by the Georgia Code of Public Transportation (\u201cGCPT\u201d), O.C.G.A. \u00a7 32-1-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Trism Specialized Carriers, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 788 (11th Cir.1999), we addressed the effect of the GCPT on a railroad\u2019s common law duty to install protective devices at a railroad crossing. We concluded \u2014 based on the Georgia Court of Appeals\u2019s decision in <em>Evans Timber Co., Inc. v. Cent. of Ga. R.R. Co., </em>239 Ga.App. 262, 519 S.E.2d 706 (1999) \u2014 that the GCPT \u201coverrule[s] the state common law cause of action against railroads for negligent failure to install adequate warning devices at public grade crossings.\u201d <em>Trism, </em>182 F.3d at 792; <em>see Evans Timber, </em>519 S.E.2d at 709 (\u201cThe GCPT precludes a common-law cause of action against a railroad for the failure to install adequate protective devices at a grade crossing on a public road where the railroad has not been requested to do so by the appropriate governmental entity.\u201d). Because the Georgia Supreme Court had not yet decided the issue and because no \u201cpersuasive indication [existed] that the state\u2019s highest court would rule otherwise,\u201d we determined that we were \u201cbound to apply the law as decided by the Georgia Court of Appeals\u201d in <em>Evans Timber. Trism, </em>182 F.3d at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">Plaintiff contends that the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fortner v. Town of Register, </em>278 Ga. 625, 604 S.E.2d 175 (2004), must alter our conclusions. We disagree. <em>Fortner </em>overruled <em>Evans Timber </em>only \u201c[t]o the extent that the holding of <em>Evans Timber </em>is based on ... dicta [in the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kitchen v. CSX Transp., </em>265 Ga. 206, 453 S.E.2d 712 (1995) ].\u201d <em>Fortner, </em>604 S.E.2d at 178. But the Georgia Court of Appeals did not see itself as bound by dicta in the <em>Kitchen </em>opinion; the decision about protective devices in <em>Evans Timber </em>is based on a number of other factors, including the statutory language, trial testimony, and the legislative intent. <em>See Evans Timber, </em>519 S.E.2d at 709-10. Furthermore, the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Fortner </em>never says it overruled the ultimate conclusion about protective devices in <em>Evans Timber </em>(that the GCPT preempted the railroad\u2019s common law duty to install protective devices). Thus, <em>Evans Timber </em>and <em>Trism </em>remain good law to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In addition, to the extent that <em>Fortner </em>speaks about a railroad\u2019s common law duty to install protective devices, that language in the <em>Fortner </em>opinion is itself nonbinding dicta. The issue before the state court in <em>Fortner </em>was whether the GCPT preempts a railroad\u2019s common law duty \u201cto prevent vegetation from obstructing vision at a railroad crossing\u201d: an issue that the Georgia Supreme Court distinguished expressly from the issue raised in this appeal. <em>See Fortner, </em>604 S.E.2d at 177-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number><em>Evans Timber </em>is like this case and is the only Georgia state appellate decision to address directly the issue presented in this appeal. And nothing in Fortner which is not like this case persuades us it is reasonably certain that the Georgia Supreme Court would reach a different decision. Thus, we conclude \u2014 consistent with Evans Timber and with our decision in Trism\u2014 that the GCPT preempted the common law duty CSXT might have had to relocate the protective devices at the Emory Street Crossing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that CSXT owed a duty to relocate the protective devices, as track was removed. Plaintiffs claim for negligence fails as a matter of law. <em>See Johnson v. Am. Nat\u2019l Red Cross, </em>276 Ga. 270, 578 S.E.2d 106, 108 (2003) (To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must show, among other things, that defendant owed plaintiff a duty).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">.
