On appeal, Crane argues that the district court erred in instructing the jury that the prosecution was required to prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence only. He acknowledges that the district court\u2019s instruction was consistent with circuit precedent, but he alleges that our precedent is in conflict with <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 313, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2543, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), which, he asserts, held that every fact \u201clegally essential to punishment\u201d must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The Constitution guarantees defendants the right to be tried in the state and district where the crime was committed. U.S. Const, art. III, \u00a7 2, cl. 3; U.S. Const, amend. VI; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 18 (\u201cUnless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed.\u201d). An offense committed in more than one district may be \u201cprosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun, continued, or completed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3237(a). \u201cIn a conspiracy case, venue is proper in any district where an overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy[,]\u201d even if the act was not committed by the particular defendant. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1990). Here, the government contends that venue in the Middle District of Alabama was proper because co-conspirators took overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy in the Middle District.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Among its burdens at trial, the government generally must prove venue. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 866 (11th Cir.2010). But, as Crane acknowledges, our precedent does not require the government to prove venue beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stickle, </em>454 F.3d 1265, 1271 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt has long been settled that when the government is proving a non-essential element of a crime, like venue, the prosecution is not required to meet the reasonable doubt standard.\u201d). Instead, the government must prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence only. <em>Id.; see also United States v. De La Cruz Suarez, </em>601 F,3d 1202, 1217 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201cFor purposes of venue, the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the crimes occurred within the district of trial.\u201d); <em>Smith, </em>918 F.2d at 1564 (\u201cThe government must support its choice of venue only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Rivamonte, </em>666 F.2d 515, 517 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Crane contends that our precedent requiring proof of venue by a preponderance of the evidence only conflicts with the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Blakely. </em>\u201cThe Court in <em>Blakely </em>held that a state trial court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by increasing his sentence, above the maximum applicable to the facts to which he admitted in his guilty plea, based upon the trial court\u2019s own finding that the crime involved \u2018deliberate cruelty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 304-05, 124 S.Ct. at 2537-38. In reaching that result, the Court applied the rule of <em>Apprendi v, New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000): \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Crane relies on the following statement from <em>Blakely: </em>\u201cAs <em>Apprendi </em>held, every defendant has the <em>right </em>to insist that the prosecutor prove to a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at 313, 124 S.Ct. at 2543 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Crane\u2019s position is that venue is such a fact \u201clegally essential to the punishment,\u201d which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Our precedent holds otherwise. Though we have stated that venue is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cessential element\u201d of an offense .\u201cin the sense that the burden is on the prosecution to prove its existence,\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>611 F.2d 531, 536 (5th Cir.1980)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, we have- treated venue as a \u201cnon-essential element of a crime\u201d that does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Stickle, </em>454 F.3d at 1271. <em>Cf. In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d). Venue has no direct bearing on a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of an offense, <em>see Haney v. Burgess, </em>799 F.2d 661, 663 (11th Cir.1986), or the length of the sentence that may lawfully be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Under the prior-precedent rule, we are bound by a prior panel\u2019s holding \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc,\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>581 F.3d 1847, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). No <em>en borne </em>decision is applicable. Where an appellant relies on a Supreme Court decision to evade the pri- or-precedent rule, the proffered decision must be \u201csquarely on point\u201d and must \u201cactually abrogate or directly conflict with, as opposed to merely weaken, the holding of the prior panel.\u201d <em>United States v. Holey, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\"><em>Blakely </em>is not \u201csquarely on point,\u201d as Crane admits<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, nor does it \u201cactually abrogate or directly conflict with\u201d our longstanding precedent. <em>See id. </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Blakely did not in any way address venue, nor did <em>Appren-di </em>before it. Rather, both cases addressed \u201csentencing scheme[s] that allow[ ] a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant,\u201d <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 274-75, 127 S.Ct. 856, 860, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007). No similar sentencing scheme is at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">In any case, our 2006 decision in <em>Stick-le </em>\u2014 reaffirming our precedent that proof of venue beyond a reasonable doubt is not required \u2014 was issued two years after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely. </em>Thus, even if we were convinced (which, to be clear, we ar\u00e9 hot) that the prior panel reached an incorrect result because it overlooked <em>Blakely, </em>we still would be bound by <em>Stickle, See Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1308 (11th Cir.2001) (categorically rejecting \u201cany exception to the prior panel precedent rule based upon a perceived defect in the prior panel\u2019s reasoning or analysis as it relates to the law in existence at that time\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1317-18 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cUnder our pri- or precedent rule, a panel cannot overrule a prior one\u2019s holding even though convinced it is wrong.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">Consequently, the district court did not err by instructing the jury that the prosecution must prove venue by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See Stickle, </em>454 F.3d at-1271-72. We affirm Crane\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">.
