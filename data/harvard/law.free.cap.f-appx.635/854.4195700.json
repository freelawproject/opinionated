The district court\u2019s decision was partly based on its finding that Ment\u00f3 violated the conditions of his release by: (1) dealing in stolen property, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.019, and (2) fraudulently verifying ownership to a secondhand dealer, in violation of Florida Statutes \u00a7 538.04.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ment\u00f3 now challenges, the district court\u2019s revocation, solely arguing that the court erred because the Government did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he broke Florida law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After carefully considering the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United, States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). We defer to the factual findings made by a district court in reaching such a decision unless those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). A district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s term of supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of his release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). One of the conditions of Mento\u2019s supervised release was that he refrain from breaking state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">Here, the district court did not err in finding that Ment\u00f3 violated a condition of his supervised release by infringing Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 812.019 and 538.04. Florida Statutes \u00a7 812.019 makes it a felony to sell property that one knows or should know has been the subject of any criminally wrongful taking. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.019(1) (\u201cAny person who traffics in ... property that he or she knows or should know was stolen shall be guilty of a felony of the second degree____\u201d); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 812.012(8) (defining trafficking to include selling); Fla. Stat; \u00a7 812.012(7) (defining \u201cstolen property\u201d as \u201cproperty that has been the subject of any criminally wrongful taking\u201d). And, under Florida Statutes \u00a7 538.04, it is a felony to \u201cknowingly give[] false verification of ownership\u201d when selling goods to a secondhand dealer. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 538.04(4). A preponderance of the evidence demonstrated that Ment\u00f3 committed both of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-17\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court determined that: (1) a third party authorized Ment\u00f3 to possess a diamond ring for the sole purpose of delivering the ring to a former girlfriend of the third party; (2) the third party did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>give Ment\u00f3 legal title to the ring, nor did the third party authorize Ment\u00f3 to sell the ring; (3) instead of giving the ring to th'e third party\u2019s former girlfriend, Ment\u00f3 sold the ring to a secondhand dealer for several thousand dollars; (4) Ment\u00f3 knew he did not have authority to sell the ring; (5) in selling the ring, Ment\u00f3 intended to permanently deprive the third party of the ring; and (6) Ment\u00f3 certified to the secondhand dealer that he fully owned the ring. These factual findings were supported by documentary evidence from the secondhand dealer, as well as testimony from the third party, the third party\u2019s former girlfriend, and an investigating officer who interviewed Ment\u00f3. In light of such evidence, the findings were not clearly erroneous, and we must defer to them. <em>See Almand, </em>992 F.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The district court\u2019s factual findings provide ample support for its conclusion that Ment\u00f3 violated Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 812.019 and 538.04. First, by selling a ring that he knew he did not have legal authority to sell, Ment\u00f3 knowingly sold property that was subject to a criminally wrongful taking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 812.019, 812.012(7), 812.012(8). Second, Ment\u00f3 \u201cknowingly provided false verification of ownership\u201d of the ring during the sale to the secondhand dealer when he certified to the dealer that he owned the ring. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 538.04. Accordingly, the district court did not err in determining that Ment\u00f3 violated Florida Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 812.019 and 538.04, and we cannot con-elude that the court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-11\">. The district court also concluded that Ment\u00f3 did not meet the terms of his release because he failed to notify his probation officer within 72 hours of being arrested or questioned by law enforcement. However, Ment\u00f3 does not challenge this determination on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AE1l\">.. Notably, Ment\u00f3 'does not contest the district court\u2019s finding that the violations at issue, if proven, warrant revocation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b876-5\">. Ment\u00f3 argues that the ring was not subject to any criminally wrongful \u201ctaking\u201d because he did not unlawfully take the ring from the third party \u2014 rather, the third party simply gave him the ring, subject to certain conditions. However, this argument is without merit. As the district court concluded, the ring was subjected to a wrongful criminal taking when Ment\u00f3 formed the intent to permanently deprive the third party of it. <em>See Isenhour v. State, </em>952 So.2d 1216, 1221 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2007) (\"[Rjegardless of how the property is acquired, <em>if </em>the defendant has the requisite intent, he is guilty of the crime of theft.\u201d (quoting <em>Brewer v, State, </em>413 So.2d 1217, 1219 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1982))). That is to say, once Ment\u00f3 formed such intent and undertook efforts to sell the ring to the secondhand dealer, he exercised unlawful ownership over the ring, thereby depriving the third party of legal possession. <em>See Isenhour, </em>952 So.2d at 1221.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
