After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">A. Foster\u2019s 2008 Arrest and 2009 Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">In 2008, Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents arrested Foster at his home in Georgia, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued in the Eastern District of North Carolina on a charge of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. With Foster\u2019s consent, the agents searched his home and car and seized $4,303 in cash, a .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol that Foster said belonged to his wife, a laptop computer, a digital camera, and several cell phones.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">In August 2009, a jury in the Eastern District of North Carolina convicted Foster of the cocaine conspiracy charge. On January 4, 2010, Foster was sentenced to 324 months\u2019 imprisonment. On direct appeal, the Fourth Circuit affirmed Foster\u2019s conviction. <em>See United States v. Foster, </em>406 Fed.Appx. 690 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>B. Foster\u2019s 2011 Motion for Return of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">On November 3, 2011, Foster filed the instant <em>pro se </em>motion for the return of the seized property, citing Rule 41(g). Foster argued that his family was entitled to the return of these items because the items were not used as evidence in his prosecution and were \u201cnot part of a[n] order of forfeiture\u201d or fine in his federal criminal case. Foster also asked for an evidentiary hearing if there was a factual dispute. Foster attached a copy of the DEA\u2019s \u201cReport of Investigation\u201d containing, <em>inter alia, </em>a list of items seized from Foster\u2019s residence and car on March 13, 2008 and two letters, dated June 2011, that Foster said he and his mother sent to the DEA asking for the return of the seized items.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In November 2013, the district court directed the government to respond to Foster\u2019s motion. The government\u2019s response indicated that it no longer had possession of the items because the cash and firearm had been administratively forfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 and then the firearm and the other items had been destroyed. The government submitted declarations of forfeiture and DEA \u201cDisposition of Nondrug Evidence\u201d forms confirming that the cash was forfeited in June 2008, the firearm was forfeited in August 2008 and approved for destruction in December 2009, and the cell phones, camera, and laptop were approved for destruction in March 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The district court, stressing deficiencies in the government\u2019s documentary evidence, directed the government to supplement the record with sworn declarations \u201cto demonstrate that the property was in fact destroyed\u201d and \u201cto demonstrate that the Taurus pistol and the currency were legally forfeited under the applicable law.\u201d The district court gave Foster leave to \u201crespond to the government\u2019s submissions and argument in writing within thirty days thereafter.\u201d The district court also directed Foster to \u201caddress any legal or equitable relief that he is seeking with respect to the property that is at issue on this motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The government\u2019s supplemental response included declarations from DEA Agent Frederick Swoope, Sr. and DEA Forfeiture Counsel Vicki Rashid. According to this evidence, the DEA\u2019s non-drug evidence custodian in fact destroyed the cell phones, camera, and laptop on March 9, 2010, as reflected on the DEA forms. Further, on April 1, 2008, the DEA pursued administrative forfeiture of the $4,303 and the pistol under to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609. To that end, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(a) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a), the DEA mailed written notices by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Foster, his wife, his son, and someone named Brittany Cresfield, all of which were signed as received on April 3, 2008. The DEA also published notices in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>on April 14, 21, and 28, 2008. When no properly executed claims were filed before the stated deadlines, the DEA administratively forfeited the currency on June 13, 2008 and' the pistol on August 15, 2008. Attached to the government\u2019s declarations were copies of the mailed notices, the signed return receipt cards, and the published legal notices, as well as a case inventory from the non-drug evidence custodian.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">Foster filed a response arguing that there was no court order permitting the destruction of the seized items, and that the administrative forfeiture of the pistol and currency was improper because there was no proof those items were derived from proceeds traceable to the commission of his cocaine conspiracy. Foster sought $8,022.95, which he claimed was the value of the seized items. Foster did not allege, much less attempt to prove, that he failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>to receive notice of the administrative forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">C. District Court\u2019s Denial of Foster\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The district court adopted the report of the magistrate judge and denied Foster\u2019s motion. The district court found that although Foster had a possessory interest in the seized items, his laptop, cell phones, and camera had been destroyed and were no longer in the government\u2019s possession. The currency and pistol, meanwhile, \u201cwere the subject of forfeiture proceedings by the government under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(b), 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a) and were forfeited, after notice and publication as required under the applicable statutory authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The district court concluded that money damages were not available under the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that, given the circumstances, equitable relief was not warranted. The district court found that the government had complied with the notice and other requirements of forfeiture law and that Foster was given notice of the administrative forfeiture proceedings and advised of his right to make a claim. Thus, Foster \u201cwas afforded an adequate remedy at law to contest the forfeitures under the forfeiture law.\u201d As to his destroyed personal property, traditional equitable remedies of injunction and specific performance would not \u201cafford Mr. Foster any relief.\u201d Foster appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">A. Post-Conviction Motions for Return of Property</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Rule 41(g) permits \u201c[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property\u201d to \u201cmove for the property\u2019s return.\u201d Fed,R.Crim.P. 41(g). \u201cIn order for an owner of property to invoke Rule 41(g), he must show that he had a possessory interest in the property seized by the government,\u201d and that he has \u201cclean hands\u201d with respect to the property. <em>United, States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 974 (11th Cir.2005). The government may rebut the movant\u2019s allegations with evidence that it has a legitimate reason to retain the property, that it does not possess the property, or that the property has been destroyed. <em>United States v. Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2001). Rule 41(g) requires the court to \u201creceive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">A Rule 41(g) motion, however, is not an appropriate avenue for relief when, as here, the property owner \u201cinvokes Rule 41(g) after the close of all criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974. In these circumstances, \u201cthe court treats the motion for return of property as a civil action in equity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Equitable jurisdiction \u201cmust be exercised with caution and restraint\u201d and is appropriate only when necessary to \u201cprevent manifest injustice\u201d in light of the movant\u2019s conduct and the merits of his request. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>241 F.3d 1329, 1331 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Rule 41(g) also is unavailable when, as here, property has been \u201cretained pursuant to civil forfeiture, instead of for use as evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>120 F.3d 254, 255 (11th Cir.1997). While \u201cfederal courts under limited circumstances may exercise equitable jurisdiction over agency forfeiture decisions,\u201d <em>United States v. Eubanks, </em>169 F.3d 672, 674 (11th Cir.1999), they lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the administrative forfeiture. <em>Mesa Valderrama v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1189, 1196 (11th Cir.2005). Instead, review is limited to whether the agency followed the \u201cproper procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Even so, federal courts may invoke their equitable jurisdiction over administrative forfeitures only in \u201cexceptional cases where equity demands intervention.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 1197 (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Eubanks, </em>169 F.3d at 674 (\u201c[Jurisdiction is appropriate only when the petitioner\u2019s conduct and the merits of his petition require judicial review to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d). This Court has concluded that it is inappropriate to exercise equitable jurisdiction when a property owner received lawful notice of civil forfeiture proceedings by mail and publication and \u201celected to forego the procedures for pursuing an adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>Eubanks, </em>169 F.3d at 674.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">B. Foster\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"A2i\">The district court did not err in denying Foster\u2019s motion for the return of property. With respect to the pistol and $4,303 in currency, the record shows that these items were administratively forfeited through a civil forfeiture proceeding under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1609 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As such, Rule 41(g) was not an appropriate avenue for relief from those administrative forfeitures. <em>See Watkins, </em>120 F.3d at 255. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e), the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for \u201cany non-judicial civil forfeiture proceeding under a civil forfeiture statute\u201d is to file a motion to set aside the forfeiture. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(e)(1), (5) (permitting a person entitled to written notice \u201cwho does not receive such notice\u201d to file a motion to set aside a declaration of forfeiture). But, Foster did not file such a motion and does not contend that he did not receive proper notice of the civil forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Moreover, the district court properly declined to exercise equitable jurisdiction to review the DEA\u2019s administrative forfeiture of the pistol and currency. Foster did not allege that the DEA failed to follow proper procedural safeguards in seeking administrative forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881, nor did Foster show \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d such that equity demanded intervention. <em>See Mesa Valderrama, </em>417 F.3d at 1196-97. Foster has never argued that he lacked proper notice of the administrative forfeiture proceedings. Further, the government submitted affirmative evidence showing that written notice was mailed to, and signed for by someone at, Foster\u2019s residence, in compliance with 18 U.S.C; \u00a7 983(a). The written notice advised Foster of his right to contest the forfeiture and of how to do so. In addition, notice was published for three consecutive weeks in the <em>Wall Street Journal, </em>in compliance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1607(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Despite receiving proper notice that the pistol and currency were subject to civil forfeiture, Foster failed to pursue his claims in the civil forfeiture proceedings, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 983(a)(2). Instead, Foster waited until three years after the forfeitures to file this motion for return of property. Under these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>stances, it would have been inappropriate for the district court \u201cto exercise equitable jurisdiction to review the merits of [the] forfeiture matter.\u201d <em>See Eubanks, </em>169 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The district court also properly denied Foster\u2019s motion with respect to the laptop, cell phones, and camera. These items were not subject to administrative forfeiture. Nonetheless, Rule 41(g) was not available to Foster to recover them because Foster\u2019s criminal proceedings had terminated by the time he filed his motion. <em>See Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">This Court has suggested that, in appropriate circumstances, a district court may exercise equitable jurisdiction and fashion an equitable remedy, \u201ceven if the property at issue has been lost or destroyed.\u201d <em>See Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1315. Foster, however, does not ask for any equitable relief. Foster seeks only money damages. But, sovereign immunity protects the government from money damages sought under Rule 41(g). <em>Id. </em>at 1315-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">In any event, the district court did not err when it determined that equitable relief was not warranted as to the laptop, cell phones, and camera. As the district court noted, Foster\u2019s November 3, 2011 motion was filed \u201cmore than three and a half years after the property was seized on March 13, 2008,\u201d almost two years after Foster\u2019s January 4, 2010 sentencing, and more than ten months after his conviction was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit on December 28, 2010. The DEA\u2019s non-drug custodian held these items throughout Foster\u2019s criminal proceedings and for two months after his sentencing, until March 2010, but Foster never asked for their return. In other words, had Foster not delayed, the items he now seeks could have been preserved and perhaps returned to him- or his family. Yet, Foster offers no explanation for his delay. Indeed, Foster\u2019s own allegations and evidence indicate that he did not ask the DEA to return his property until June 2011. <em>See id. </em>at 1315 (stating that \u201cthe doctrine of laches is pertinent and should be considered\u201d in evaluating'whether a claimant is entitled to an equitable remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Finally, the district court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on Foster\u2019s motion. The district court gave the parties the opportunity to submit evidence, and the material facts were not in dispute. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g) (requiring the district court to \u201creceive evidence\u201d but only as to \u201cany factual issue necessary to decide the motion\u201d); <em>Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1314 (concluding district court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion based on the government\u2019s unsupported allegation that the property had been destroyed). Specifically, it is undisputed that Foster had a possessory interest in the items the DEA seized at the time of his arrest, but that Foster did not file a claim in the administrative forfeiture proceedings or seek the return of the seized items until well after his conviction and sentencing, by which time the remaining items had been destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Further, Foster has not explained what additional evidence he would have presented at an evidentiary hearing. The only \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d Foster identifies on appeal is \u201chis Docket Sheet,\u201d which he says shows that \u201cthere was neither a court order to destroy the property, [n]or was there a forfeiture hearing conducted by [a] court.\u201d The fact that neither the forfeiture of the pistol and the currency nor the destruction of the remaining items was pursuant to a court order is not disputed and, in any event, is immaterial to whether the district court should exercise equitable jurisdiction in Foster\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>For all these reasons, the district court properly denied Foster\u2019s post-conviction motion for return of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-5\">. We review questions of law relating to the district court's denial of a Rule 41(g) motion <em>de novo, </em>and its fact findings for clear error. <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 973.
