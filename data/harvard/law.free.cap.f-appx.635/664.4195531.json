He filed an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Dr. Franck Papillon, the jail\u2019s medical director, and Al Lamber-ti, Broward County\u2019s former sheriff, alleging that they had violated his Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference to his medical needs. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>district court granted summary judgment to Papillon and Lamberti (collectively \u201cdefendants\u201d). Because Leigh has shown only a disagreement over the appropriate means of treating his ailments, rather than actual indifference to his condition, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Leigh was sent to a Florida state prison in 2005 for drug trafficking and conspiracy. In 2006, Dr. Gonzalo Aguilar, an outside medical consultant, diagnosed him with spasmodic dysphonia. In a January 29, 2010 report, Aguilar noted that Leigh\u2019s condition had not responded to Botox injections. In the same report, Aguilar recommended that Leigh have selective laryngeal adductor denervation reinnervation (SLADR) surgery and wrote \u201curgent\u201d just below the recommendation. Leigh did not have the surgery. Instead, he received two more Botox injections in February 2010, neither of which improved his condition. According to a grievance Leigh filed, he visited another specialist on March 23, 2010 and was told that SLADR surgery wouldn\u2019t improve his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Leigh eventually filed a state habeas motion. To enable him to attend an evi-dentiary hearing in that proceeding, he transferred to Broward County Jail on October 4, 2011. Comments on an intake form reflect that Leigh had no visible injuries, was unable to speak loudly due to a medical condition, and reported a history of spasmodic dysphonia. Leigh remained at Broward County Jail until December 25, 2012, when he returned to state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Papillon was the medical director at Broward County Jail during Leigh\u2019s time there. According to Papillon, he never met Leigh and was involved with Leigh\u2019s healthcare on just two occasions. First, on May 4, 2012, Papillon reviewed Leigh\u2019s medical chart as part of a random inmate chart review. Second, on May 16, 2012, after Leigh wrote a grievance requesting SLADR surgery for his spasmodic dyspho-nia, Papillon reviewed the grievance and Leigh\u2019s medical records. Papillon was aware that SLADR surgery was not recognized as the appropriate treatment for spasmodic dysphonia. It was his professional medical opinion that there was no risk of serious harm if Leigh did not get the surgery and that the surgery might actually make Leigh\u2019s condition worse. Papillon thus declined to approve Leigh\u2019s request for surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Leigh filed this suit in July of 2012, alleging that defendants had knowingly kept him from getting the SLADR surgery that Aguilar had recommended. At his deposition, Leigh admitted that his suit boiled down to a disagreement over the proper course of medical care in his case\u2014 he wanted the SLADR surgery even though medical personnel at Broward County Jail believed it was the wrong way to treat his spasmodic dysphonia. He acknowledged that, since filing the suit, he had concluded that Aguilar had committed malpractice by misdiagnosing him and unnecessarily taking a biopsy of his vocal cord tissue. Despite his new belief that he did not have spasmodic dysphonia, Leigh maintained that he needed the SLADR surgery to alleviate troubles with his voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">The defendants got an affidavit from Dr. Neil Chheda, a specialist in medical conditions affecting the voice. He reviewed Leigh\u2019s medical records and concluded that Papillon had been right to advise against Leigh\u2019s request for surgery. According to Chheda, SLADR surgery is not the primary means of intervention against spasmodic dysphonia, in part because it can result in permanent, negative changes to the patient\u2019s voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Based principally on testimony from Leigh, Papillon, and Chheda, the defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Leigh had failed to establish: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>that they had been deliberately indifferent to his needs; and (2) that they had actually harmed him. Leigh filed a sparse cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge, who recommended denying Leigh\u2019s motion and granting Papillon and Lamberti\u2019s. .In particular, the magistrate judge found that Leigh had not presented sufficient evidence to establish conscious or callous indifference to his serious medical needs, which is required for a deliberate indifference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The magistrate judge\u2019s report, issued on January 27, 2014, expressly advised the parties that objections to it were due within two weeks. Leigh did not respond until March 12, 2014. In his response, he requested a 30-day extension of the filing period because he had not received the report until February 26, 2014. He also sought leave to file a \u201cproper amendment.\u201d The district court granted Leigh\u2019s request for an extension, giving him until April 21, 2014 to file objections to the report. The court concluded, however, that he was not entitled to further amend his complaint. Nevertheless, on April 23, 2014, Leigh filed a \u201cMotion Affidavit in Support of Summary Judgment,\u201d reframing his complaint and attaching documents purporting to show that genuine issues of material fact remained in the case. He followed that up with a \u201cThird Motion to Amend\u201d\u2014 a 106-page document, filed on May 7, 2014, requesting leave to amend his complaint and including documentary evidence he had not previously submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The defendants opposed both of Leigh\u2019s motions, arguing that they were meritless and untimely. The district court agreed. It construed Leigh\u2019s \u201cMotion Affidavit\u201d as an objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and summarily denied it. The district court also denied Leigh\u2019s \u201cThird Motion to amend\u201d because it sought -to advance a new claim against Aguilar, was untimely, and failed to allege facts sufficient to support a claim of deliberate indifference. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report in full and ordered summary judgment in the defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Leigh makes essentially the same argument on appeal as he did at the district court and it is no more compelling here than it was there. To prevail on a claim of deliberate indifference, a plaintiff must show that the defendant intentionally or recklessly disregarded his serious medical needs in a way that injured him. <em>See Hinson v. Edmond, </em>192 F.3d 1342, 1345 (11th Cir.1999). Leigh hasn\u2019t shown that. The record makes clear that staff at Bro-ward County Jail did not deny Leigh\u2019s request for SLADR surgery because they were indifferent to his condition and needs, but instead because medical personnel at the jail determined that the surgery was not a good way to treat his spasmodic dysphonia. Leigh disagrees with the views of those medical personnel, but a difference in medical opinion is not a sufficient basis for a deliberate indifference claim. <em>See Goebert v. Lee Cnty., </em>510 F.3d 1312, 1326 (11th Cir.2007). Because Leigh hasn't shown that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs, his claims fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
