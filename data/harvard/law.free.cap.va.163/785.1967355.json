The petition is filed by Harry Wooding, as mayor of the city of Danville, against Honorable Henry G. Leigh in his official capacity as judge of the corporation court of that city. It prays that a mandamus be issued commanding the defendant to enter an order calling an election at which there shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the city of Danville the question, Shall bonds to the amount of $2,225,000 be issued by that city for the purpose of constructing a municipal hydro-electric plant at the Pinnacles of the Dan river, in Patrick county, Virginia, and a transmission line and other facilities incident thereto?</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The pertinent facts, as shown by the stipulation of the parties, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Danville has for some years owned and operated a municipal electric light and power plant at which electric current is generated by steam power.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">After the National Industrial Recovery Act was enacted on June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 195), the city, acting through its council, made application to Honorable Harold L. Ickes, Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, for a loan from and a grant of funds by the United States for the purpose of constructing a hydro-electric plant at the Pinnacles of the Dan river, a transmission line from there to Danville, and other facilities incident to such a plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">On or about December 20, 1933, the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works submitted to the city council a proposed draft of an agreement, to be dated as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>January 12, 1934, between the city and the United States. By this agreement the United States agreed to purchase bonds of the city of Danville to an amount not to exceed $2,344,500, the proceeds thereof \u201cto be used for the construction by the borrower (the city) of a hydro-electric light and power plant and transmission line * * * on a site known as the \u2018Pinnacles Mountain Tract\u2019 in Patrick county.\u201d It further agreed to \u201cgrant to the borrower an amount not to exceed thirty per centum of the cost of labor and materials employed on the project,\u201d but stipulated that the total of the loan and grant should not exceed the cost of the project, and should in no event exceed $3,000,000. This agreement contained a number of conditions precedent to the making of the loan and grant by the United States. It is a long document, containing many terms and provisions, which need not be set out here.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In accordance with a resolution of the city council, the mayor of the city executed this agreement in the name of the city. Harold L. Ickes, Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, executed it in the name of the United States of America. It was executed by these officers at some time between December 20, 1933, and January 24, 1934, and on the latter date a copy thereof was printed at length by order of the city council in one of the daily papers published in the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">On January 27, 1934, an ordinance was adopted by the city council and approved by the mayor which, omitting only the schedule of the installment payments mentioned in section 2, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">\u201cBe it ordained by the council of the city of Danville as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">\u201cSection 1. In order to enable the city of Danville to carry on more economically and adequately the undertaking of generating and supplying electric current to the city and its inhabitants, it is expedient for the city to borrow two million three hundred and forty-four thousand five hundred dollars ($2,344,500) and to issue $2,344,500 principal amount of electric revenue bonds of the city for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>money so borrowed, such bonds to be payable exclusively from the receipts of the undertaking for which they are issued, without recourse against the general credit or taking power of the city. Accordingly, such borrowing and bond issue are hereby authorized. The proceeds of the sale of said bonds shall be used for the purpose of enlarging the present electric plant and system of the city of Danville.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\u201cSection 2. The said bonds shall be dated April 1, 1934. They shall bear interest at the rate of four per centum (4%) per annum, payable semi-annually. The principal of said bonds shall be payable in annual installments on the first day of April in each year, as follows: (Here follows a schedule of installments payable each year during the period 1935-1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\u201cSection 3. The said bonds shall be issued under and in compliance with clause (b) of section 127 of the Constitution of Virginia, and shall not be included in determining the limitation of the power of the city of Danville to incur indebtedness. The principal and interest of said bonds shall be payable exclusively from the receipts of the undertaking for which they are issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">\u201cSection 4. No bonds shall be issued under the authority of this ordinance until said bonds shall have been approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the city of Danville voting upon the question of their issuance. The city clerk is hereby directed to present forthwith a certified copy of this ordinance to the Corporation Court of the city of Danville, or to the judge thereof in vacation, and said court or judge is hereby authorized to enter an order directing the proper election officials of the city of Danville to take such steps and prepare such means as may be necessary to submit to the qualified voters of the city the question of whether said bonds shall be issued, and to make such order as may be proper to give due publicity to such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">\u201cSection 5. This ordinance shall take effect in the manner provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">A copy of this ordinance was duly presented to the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the corporation court of the city, who on January 29, 1934, entered an order calling an election to be held on February 26, 1934, in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">A majority of the qualified voters who voted at this election voted against the issuance of bonds, the vote being 1,498 for the bond issue and 1,684 against it; and on April 20, 1934, the judge of the corporation court entered an order so finding and certifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Neither the ordinance, the order of the judge calling this election, nor the notice of the election made any reference to the fact that the construction for which it was proposed to issue bonds was the construction of a hydro-electric plant at the Pinnacles of the Dan. But the council in its advocacy of the proposed bond issue publicly, through the newspapers and in other ways, told the voters of the city that this was the purpose for which the bond issue was proposed, and that it was proposed to sell the bonds to and procure a grant of aid for this purpose from the United States in accordance with the agreement heretofore mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Some of the citizens of Danville were not satisfied with the decision of the majority of the voters at this election, and continued to agitate for the construction by the city of a hydro-electric plant at the Pinnacles of the Dan.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">On October 10, 1934, the city council passed and the mayor approved an ordinance, the material parts of which read as follows, the italics being ours:</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">\u201cBe it ordained by the council of the city of Danville as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">\u201cWhereas, the committee of citizens appointed to make a study of Danville\u2019s power problem has, upon the advice of Charles T. Main, Incorporated, consulting engineers, recommended the proposed hydro-electric development at the Pinnacles of the Dan as the most economical source of power available to Danville.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">\u201cSection 1. In order to enable the city of Danville to carry on more economically and adequately the undertaking of generating and supplying electric light and power to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>city and its inhabitants, it is deemed expedient for the city to borrow two million two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ($2,225,000) and to issue its bonds in the same principal amount for the money so borrowed. Accordingly, such borrowing and bond issue are hereby authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\u201cSection 2. The proceeds from the sale of said bonds (exclusive of any accrued interest and premiums, which accrued interest and premiums may be used for the service of said bonds), together with any and all sums which the United States of America, acting through the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works or such other similar agency or agencies as may be designated or created, may grant to the city of Danville for the purpose, shall be used for the construction of a hydro-electric light and power plant and transmission lines and the structures and facilities, including dams, incidental thereto and for the acquisition of lands, easements or rights in lands, all as part of the city\u2019s electric light and power generating and distribution system.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\u201cSection 3. Said bonds shall bear interest at the rate of four per centum (4%) per annum, payable semi-annually, and shall mature within a period of thirty (30) years from their date at such time or at such times and in such amounts as the city council by ordinance or resolution shall determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\u201cSection 4. * * '* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"ACp\">\u201cSection 5. It is the purpose of this ordinance to authorize the borrowing of money and issuing of bonds under the provisions of clause (b) of section 127 of the Constitution of Virginia for a specific undertaking from which the city may derive a revenue, and said bonds herein authorized shall be issued under and in compliance with said clause and shall not be included within the otherwise authorized indebtedness of the city of Danville. Said bonds shall be payable as to both principal and interest from the gross revenues, receipts and income derived from the city\u2019s generating and distribution system of electric light and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>power and from the amounts to be paid by the city for all electric light and power taken from the system by the city for its own uses and purposes, and for such power so taken the city shall pay reasonable rates. The city shall covenant and agree to take from the system all power and light needed for its own uses and purposes and to pay reasonable rates for the power and light so taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">\u201cSection 6. Said bonds <em>may </em>be issued and sold at public sale, or at private sale to the United States of America, acting through the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works or other similar agency or agencies pursuant to the provisions of chapter 26 of the laws of 1933 of Virginia. They <em>may </em>be issued under resolution or ordinance providing for their payment and security and for the remedies of the holders of the bonds in accordance with the terms of any agreement or agreements with the United States of America, acting through the said Administrator of Public Works, into which the city council <em>may </em>determine to enter; and such agreement or agreements <em>may </em>contain such terms, conditions or provisions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance or of clause (b) of section 127 of the Constitution of Virginia, as in the discretion of the city council may be necessary, proper or advisable for the purpose of obtaining a grant or loan or both from the said administrator. The bonds <em>may, </em>if so provided by ordinance or resolution of the city council, be secured by a deed of trust or a mortgage on the new hydro-electric plant and transmission line and on all or any part of the revenues of its electric light and power generating and distribution system.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">\u201cSection 7. The new hydro-electric light and power plant and transmission lines shall be constructed for the use of the city and its inhabitants; and <em>should </em>it issue any of said bonds to the Federal Emergency Administrator, the city shall agree that it will maintain and operate such plant and transmission lines with the necessary distribution lines within the city as a municipally owned and operated public utility and that the city will take, use and distribute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>current generated thereby and that it will charge reasonable and adequate rates for such current.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">\u201cSection 8. The city may use and apply to any other city purpose all surplus revenues from its electric light and power system over and above those required by any agreement between the city and the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works to be set aside and applied solely to the maintenance, operation, repair and insurance of the system and to the payment of the principal of and interest on said bonds and to the accumulation of reserve funds for said purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">\u201cSection 9. The city shall not, so long as any bonds authorized pursuant to this ordinance are outstanding, grant any competitive electric light or power franchise or purchase or take current from any source other than from its own system, unless and to the extent that at any time the light or power supply by such system is not available or is inadequate. <em>If </em>any of said bonds are sold to and so long as any may be held by the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, or other similar agency or agencies of the United States, the city shall furnish to the original purchaser or purchasers, not later than thirty days after the close of each six months\u2019 fiscal period, complete operating and income statements of the system in reasonable detail covering such six months\u2019 period; and, not more than sixty days after the close of each fiscal year, complete financial statements of the system and of the city covering such fiscal year, certified by independent auditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\u201cSection 10. No bonds shall be issued under the authority of this ordinance until the issuance thereof shall have been approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the city of Danville, voting upon the question of their issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">\u201cSection 11. The city clerk is hereby directed to present forthwith a certified copy of this ordinance to the Corporation Court of the city of Danville, or to the judge thereof in vacation, and said court or judge is hereby authorized and requested to enter an order directing the proper election <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>officials of the city of Danville to take such steps and- prepare such means as may be necessary to submit to the qualified voters of the city the question whether said bonds shall be issued, and to make such order as may be proper to give due publicity to such election.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">\u201cSection 12. The ballot for the use of the voters in such election shall be in substantially the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201cBallot</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201cSpecial Election 6th Nov., 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">\u201cShall the city of Danville issue its electric revenue bonds in the amount of $2,225,000, to bear interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, pursuant to an ordinance adopted by the city council on the 10th day of October, 1934; apply the proceeds of such bonds, together with the proceeds of such grant as is made for the purpose by the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works pursuant to the National Industrial Recovery Act, to the construction of a hydro-electric power plant at the Pinnacles of the Dan, with necessary transmission line, as part of the city\u2019s electric light and power generating and distribution system; * * * secure said bonds, in the discretion of the city council, by such undertakings with respect to the new hydro-electric plant and transmission line and with respect to all or any part of the revenues of the city\u2019s electric light and power generating and distribution system as the city council may determine (which undertakings shall provide that all surplus revenues over and above bond interest and principal requirements and reserving therefor and operation, maintenance, repair and insurance charges may be applied by the city for any other of its purposes) : take from said system power and light for all its own uses and purposes and pay reasonable rates therefor as long as any of said bonds are outstanding; and, from the revenues to be derived from said system, pay off said bonds in not to exceed thirty years; all pursuant to said ordinance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>\u201cFor </em>Bond Issue \u201cAgainst Bond Issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">When this ordinance was presented to the Honorable Henry C. Leigh, judge of the Corporation Court of the city of Danville, he refused to enter an order calling an election to submit the question, whether the bonds proposed in the ordinance of October 10, 1934, should be issued. As stated by him in a memorandum opinion prepared at the time, his reason for refusing to enter the order was that the bond issue proposed by the ordinance of October 10, 1934, was for a purpose \u201csimilar\u201d to that of the bond issue proposed by the ordinance of January 27, 1934, which was defeated at the election held on February 26, 1934, and that section 3088, Code Va. 1919, provides that where a proposed bond issue is defeated at an election duly called and held, \u201cno other election for a similar purpose shall be held within one year after such election.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">The petitioner contends that for two reasons the judge was wrong in his conclusion that section 3088 prohibits the calling of an election in accordance with the ordinance of October 10, .1934, to be held prior to February 26, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">(1) He contends that the purposes of the bond issues proposed by the ordinances of January 27th and October 10th are not \u201csimilar\u201d purposes within the meaning of section 3088. We agree with Judge Leigh that they are \u201csimilar\u201d purposes within the meaning of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">(2) He contends that it is sought to issue the bonds proposed by the ordinance of October 10th, under the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>visions of chapter 26, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.), page 47, and that section 3088 has no application to bonds issued in pursuance of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The title and the pertinent parts of chapter 26, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.) read as follows (italics ours) :</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\u201cChap. 26.\u2014An Act to enable counties, cities and towns to secure the benefits of an act of the Congress of the United States of America, approved June 16, 1933, known as the National Industrial Recovery Act, and any acts amendatory thereof and any acts supplemental thereto and revisions thereof, and any further act of the Congress of the United States of America delegating powers to undertake any purpose or purposes in aid of the financing of which the President of the United States or any other Federal agency is now or hereafter authorized and empowered, through the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works or through such other agencies as may be designated or created, to make grants or loans; delegating powers to contract debts, borrow money and issue bonds therefor; prescribing the mode of procedure, for, and regulating the issuance of such bonds, and providing for the payment thereof; authorizing agreements with the holders of such bonds and providing for the remedies of such holders; and repealing inconsistent provisions of all laws general or special of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">\u201cApproved September 7, 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">\u201cBe it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">\u201c1.

Except as may be otherwise provided in any contract theretofore entered into by any county, city or town with any Federal agency, no county, city or town shall undertake any project, contract any debt, borrow any money or issue any bonds pursuant to this act on and after two years and six months from the day on which this act becomes effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">\u201cProvided, however, that in the cities of Roanoke and Danville no money shall be borrowed and no bonds issued and no indebtedness incurred hereunder until and unless the proposal so to do shall have been submitted to the qualified voters of such city at a special election and approved by a majority of the qualified voters who vote in said special election. Said special election shall be ordered by the corporation court of such city upon request of the city council and shall be held according to the general laws applying to special elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">\u201c15. An emergency existing, this act shall be in force from its passage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">The bonded indebtedness of the city of Danville now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>amounts to about $3,000,000. Its debt limit based upon eighteen per centum of the assessed value of its real estate is $3,725,984. Therefore, as is recognized by chapter 26, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.), section 127 of the Constitution of Virginia prohibits the issuance of a bond issue of the amount proposed in the ordinance of October 10, 1934, without the affirmative vote of a majority of the qualified voters of the city voting upon the question at an election duly called and held for that purpose, regardless of what may be the correct construction of chapter 26, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The text of chapter 26, Acts 1933 (Ex. Sess.), as enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, is broad enough to authorize a city to issue bonds thereunder for any \u201cproject\u201d for which the National Industrial Recovery Act <em>authorizes </em>the President to make grants or loans through the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works or any other Federal agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The General Assembly of Virginia apparently was not ready to go so far. It prefixed to the act a title which effectually restricts the application of the act to the issuance of bonds issued \u201cto enable counties, cities and towns to secure the benefits of\u201d the National Industrial Recovery Act and other acts empowering the President to make grants or loans to counties, cities, and towns. In so far as the text of the act undertakes to authorize the issuance thereunder of bonds for purposes other than to enable a county, city, or town to secure the benefits of the Federal statutes mentioned it is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">Section 52 of the Constitution of Virginia declares that \u201cno law shall embrace more than one object, which shall be expressed in its title.\u201d The title to an act sets the bounds of the act; and to the extent that its provisions exceed those bounds- they are void. <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Com., </em>124 Va. 817, 97 S. E. 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The ordinances of January 27th and October 10th are both so drawn as to authorize the issuance of bonds for this project regardless of whether the Federal government shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>make a grant or loan in aid thereof or not. If there be no impediment to the submission to the voters of the bond issue proposed in the ordinance of October 10th, and it should be submitted to them and carried by the vote required by law to authorize an ordinary bond issue' for the construction of such a plant, the city council would be empowered to issue the bonds and use the proceeds thereof for the construction of a hydro-electric plant, etc., whether the Federal government made any grant or loan in aid thereof or not. Having sought a bond issue which is not limited in its purposes to those contemplated by the act of 1933 (as restricted by its title), the laws (including section 3088) applicable to ordinary bond issues are applicable; and for this reason the judge of the corporation court was right in refusing to enter an order calling an election at which the proposed bond issue should be submitted to the voters of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">The briefs of counsel for both parties also consider at length these questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">(a) Is the proviso with reference to the cities of Dan-ville and Roanoke, contained in section 14 of the act of 1933, unconstitutional and void, or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">(b) Has the provision of section 3088, which provides that \u201cno other election for a similar purpose shall be held within one year after such election,\u201d any application to a proposal to issue bonds limited to the purpose of enabling a county, city or town to secure the benefits of the Federal statutes mentioned in the title to the Virginia act of 1933 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">In view of the conclusion above stated, it is not necessary here to pass upon these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">The mandamus prayed will be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">\n<em>Mandamus refused.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">Gregory, J., concurs in result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-9\"> \u201cSection 3088. Order to be entered by judge.\u2014If it shall appear from said returns that a majority of the qualified voters voting at such election shall be against such proposed bond issue, an order shall be entered of record accordingly, and no other election for a similar purpose shall be held within one year after such election. But if a majority of the qualified voters at such election shall be in favor of such bond issue, the court or judge thereof shall enter an order accordingly, a copy of which shall be forthwith certified by the clerk of such court to the council, or to the board of control, and the municipal authorities shall be thereupon fully authorized and empowered to prepare and issue and to sell or to negotiate bonds of such municipality to the amount so authorized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
