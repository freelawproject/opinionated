We are thus brought to a consideration of this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The rules of the court have a salutary purpose, and their requirements must be adhered to. It is perfectly patent that the petition in this case does not conform to the rule in the respect mentioned and accordingly it is our duty to dismiss the writ heretofore granted as improvidently \u25a0 awarded, which we do.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
