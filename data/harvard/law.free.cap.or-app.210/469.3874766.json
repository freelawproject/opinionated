The issue is whether claimant\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We take the facts as found by the ALJ and adopted, with supplementation, by the board. Employer is a grinding company that grinds steel plates and fixtures and occasionally grinds eight- to nine-foot-long industrial knives. Employer\u2019s work facility consists of two buildings \u2014 an office located in a house and a shop located across the driveway from the house. The owner, Rasmussen, and the longtime office manager, Armstrong, have offices in the house. The grinding is performed in the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Claimant, a part-time employee, ultimately wanted to become a sword and knife maker. Claimant described \u201cknife-grinding\u201d as an \u201cexperiment for me for my own educational purposes\u201d and \u201ca personal project\u201d done in his \u201cspare time.\u201d Employer permitted claimant to use its shop and grinding equipment to work on knives and swords when he was not otherwise working. Claimant had access to all the shop equipment and worked on personal items during lunch breaks and his days off. Claimant kept some of those personal items at the shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Claimant\u2019s job duties included receiving deliveries of steel. Employer received deliveries of various weights and sizes. The larger deliveries were off-loaded by a crane operated by Rasmussen, a grinder, or a helper. Although there was a sign posted outside indicating that no deliveries were accepted during the lunch hour, deliveries were occasionally made during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">On May 19, 2004, claimant was not scheduled to work, and he received no wages that day. Claimant called employer that morning and received permission to grind a butcher knife that he had purchased the previous weekend. Employer did not grind that kind of knife as part of its business. Claimant came into the shop and began working on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>knife. Later in the morning, Rasmussen told claimant that he was leaving for lunch and that a steel delivery might arrive while he was gone. Rasmussen asked claimant if he would mind unloading the shipment if it arrived while Rasmussen was at lunch. Rasmussen told claimant to call him on his cell phone if claimant decided to leave while Rasmussen was still at lunch. Claimant agreed. Rasmussen commented, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have you work on your day off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Afp\">When Rasmussen left for lunch, claimant was sanding the butcher knife. When claimant completed work on the butcher knife, he began working on a second knife of his own that he had stored at the shop. Claimant set up a hand grinder and began grinding that knife. After claimant had been grinding for about 15 minutes, the knife broke, launching a piece of the blade through claimant\u2019s safety glasses and into claimant\u2019s eye, rupturing the globe.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Claimant ran into the office and Armstrong called for emergency assistance. While paramedics were tending to claimant, Armstrong overheard one of the paramedics ask claimant, \u201cDo you work here?\u201d Claimant answered, \u201cYes, but I\u2019m on my own time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">SAIF denied claimant\u2019s injury claim. After an evi-dentiary hearing, an ALJ found that claimant had met his burden to show that the injury arose out of his employment, although she opined that the work connection was \u201cweak.\u201d However, the ALJ upheld SAIF\u2019s denial on the ground that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur in the course of employment. The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision but held that claimant\u2019s injuries neither arose out of nor in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">On review, claimant argues that his injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment. He asserts that the circumstances of his injury satisfied, at least to some degree, each prong of the governing test and, therefore, the relationship between his injury and his employment was sufficient to justify compensation. Employer replies that \u201cpersonal factors\u201d produced claimant\u2019s injury and that the additional circumstances that the injury occurred in the work place while claimant was permissively using employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>equipment did not make the injury sufficiently related to claimant\u2019s employment to warrant compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Because the pertinent facts are undisputed, we review the question whether claimant\u2019s injury was sufficiently connected to work to be compensable as one of law. <em>American Medical Response v. Gavlik, </em>189 Or App 294, 298-99, 76 P3d 117 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 376 (2004). In order for an injury to be compensable under the workers\u2019 compensation law, it must \u201caris[e] out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of employment.\u201d ORS 656.005(7)(a). We view the two prongs of that compensability test as two parts of a unitary \u201cwork connection\u201d inquiry that asks whether the relationship between the injury and the employment has a sufficient nexus so that the injury should be deemed compensable. <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 596, 943 P2d 197 (1997). The requirement that the injury occur \u201cin the course of\u2019 the employment relates to the time, place, and circumstances of the injury. <em>Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>323 Or 520, 526, 919 P2d 465 (1996). The \u201carising out of\u2019 prong tests the causal link between the worker\u2019s injury and his or her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 525-26. Both prongs must be satisfied to some degree, but neither is dispositive. <em>Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>325 Or at 596. The work-connection test may be satisfied if the factors supporting one prong of the statutory test are weak while factors supporting the other prong are strong. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We first address the issue of whether claimant\u2019s injury \u201carose out of\u2019 his employment. \u201c[A] worker\u2019s injury is deemed to \u2018arise out of employment if the risk of the injury results from the nature of his or her work or when it originates from some risk to which the work environment exposes the worker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">As to the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201c[C]laimant\u2019s injury did not arise out of his employment. An injury is deemed to arise out of employment if the risk of the injury results from the nature of his or her work, or when it originates from some risk to which the work environment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>exposes the worker. We acknowledge claimant\u2019s argument that being struck in the face with metal is an inherent workplace risk when grinding metal. The employer did not grind butcher knives; claimant did not grind butcher knives as part of his employment. As such, the record does not establish that being struck with a broken butcher knife blade was a workplace risk in a shop that did not, as part of its business, grind butcher knives.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">(Internal citation and quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Claimant asserts that, because he was on the employer\u2019s premises and permissively using its equipment when he was injured, the injury arose out of his employment. Claimant relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Arnold, </em>142 Or App 98, 919 P2d 1192 (1996). The claimant in that case worked for the employer, a truck cab manufacturer, as a painter\u2019s helper. His job required regular use of sprayed acid primer and other organic compounds that are capable of causing respiratory irritation. The claimant and other workers did not regularly use respiratory protective equipment while spraying primers in the open work area, which had fresh air ventilation. The claimant\u2019s job also required him to work in close proximity to an enclosed paint booth. He had access to the interior of the booth but was neither trained nor authorized to use it, nor had he been fitted for a fresh air supply mask to be used while inside the booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The claimant brought a helmet to work. During his shift, he sanded the helmet and prepared it for painting. The employer had a practice of allowing employees to complete personal work during work hours if the nature of the personal work was of the type the employees typically performed on the job and a policy of requiring a work order to do this. The claimant and his supervisor spoke briefly about the helmet while the claimant was sanding it during a break. The supervisor told the claimant to hurry up and to do the work on the claimant\u2019s own time. Between that break and the lunch break that followed, the claimant painted the helmet with acid primer. While doing so, the claimant did not wear a respirator. In the course of spraying the primer, the claimant shot a burst of primer that surrounded him with a cloud of spray exceeding by four times his normal exposure to acid spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The claimant then obtained permission from a coworker to use the paint booth and related equipment to finish painting the helmet. He used the coworker\u2019s equipment, including the coworker\u2019s respirator, which did not fit well, and he completed the painting on his next break. He returned to his regular work and completed painting one or two more truck cabs before leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">On the way home, the claimant began experiencing chills. Other symptoms developed during the night. The next day, he sought medical treatment. The employer denied his claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The board set aside the denial, concluding that the claimant had established that his occupational disease claim arose out of and in the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">On review, we upheld the board\u2019s decision. As to the \u201carising out of\u2019 component, we concluded that substantial evidence supported the board\u2019s finding that the risks associated with the claimant\u2019s employment included exposure to irritating vapors from sanding and priming work. Although the claimant was injured while on a personal project, the injury occurred by means of the use of the employer\u2019s equipment in accordance with an employer policy permitting employees to use work equipment for personal projects.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Relying on <em>Freightliner Corp., </em>claimant challenges the board\u2019s conclusion that his injury did not arise out of employment because \u201cbeing struck with a broken butcher knife blade was a workplace risk in a shop that did not, as part of its business, grind butcher knives.\u201d Claimant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201cIn <em>[Freightliner Corp.], </em>the risk of harm was exposure to chemicals while painting truck cabs, not helmets. In the case at bar, the \u2018risk of harm\u2019 inherent in a grinding shop is being hurt by flying <em>metal </em>\u2014 wherever <em>it came from </em>\u2014 including claimant\u2019s \u2018incidental\u2019 use of the equipment for a permitted task. If Arnold\u2019s respiratory problems \u2014 caused by his use of employer\u2019s equipment on <em>his personal </em>helmet\u2014 \u2018arose out of his employment with Freightliner, [claimant\u2019s] injury to his eye, also using his employer\u2019s equipment on his personal knife, \u2018arose out of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Employer counters that, unlike in <em>Freightliner Corp., </em>here, claimant\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">\u201cpersonal knife presented a risk that was significantly different from that associated with the regular work claimant performed for employer. The employer did not grind swords or knives as part of its business. Rather, it performed grinding of much larger surfaces \u2014 steel plate, fixtures, and industrial blades that were eight or nine feet long.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">For that reason, and because claimant acknowledged that he was performing the task for his own educational purposes, employer asserts that the injury did not arise out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Although there is some merit to employer\u2019s argument, on balance we agree with claimant that this case is similar to <em>Freightliner Corp. </em>with respect to the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong. In both cases, the claimants\u2019 injuries arose from permissive use of the employer\u2019s equipment to perform a task on personal items that the claimants had introduced into the workplace. If those circumstances were sufficient to satisfy the \u201carising out of\u2019 prong in <em>Freightliner Corp., </em>they also suffice here. However, we agree with the ALJ that the connection is weak because claimant\u2019s avocational activity played a significant role in his injury. It follows that the factors supporting the \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment prong must be strong for claimant\u2019s injury to be compensable. <em>See Phil A. Livesly Co. v. Russ, </em>296 Or 25, 28, 672 P2d 337 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">We next address whether claimant\u2019s injury occurred \u201cin the course of\u2019 his employment. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">\u201c[a]n injury occurs \u2018in the course of employment if it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where a worker reasonably may be expected to be, and while the worker reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment or is doing something reasonably incidental to it. \u2018In the course of employment also includes a reasonable period of time after work for the worker to leave the employer\u2019s premises, including the employer\u2019s parking lot. By \u2018reasonably incidental to\u2019 employment, we include activities that are personal in nature \u2014 such as a telephone call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>home or a brief visit with a coworker \u2014 as long as the conduct bears some reasonable relationship to the employment and is expressly or impliedly allowed by the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 598-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">With respect to the \u201cin the course of\u2019 prong, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">\u201cClaimant was on the employer\u2019s premises at the time of his injury. However, he was not on the employer\u2019s premises for any work-related reason. Rather, he chose on that day to go to the employer\u2019s shop for a purely personal reason. He was not scheduled to work and was not compensated for his time spent in the shop that day. Claimant\u2019s knife-grinding activity bore no reasonable relationship to the employment, although it was expressly allowed by the employer. Consequently, we do not find that claimant\u2019s injury occurred \u2018in the course of his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Claimant asserts that the board erred in its conclusion because \u201c[e]mployer\u2019s request that claimant engage in work activity <em>for the benefit of the employer </em>transformed claimant\u2019s presence on employer\u2019s premises from that of \u2018guest\u2019 to that of\u2018employee.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) According to claimant, his injury was sufficiently related to the time, place, and circumstances of his employment to justify compensation, because the injury occurred on employer\u2019s premises, claimant was on those premises with permission, employer supplied the equipment claimant was using when he was injured, employer permitted the injury-producing activity, employer asked plaintiff to perform work, if necessary, claimant agreed to perform that work, claimant\u2019s injury was of a type that was a risk of using grinding equipment, and employer\u2019s business is grinding steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Employer replies that the character of claimant\u2019s presence did not change, because he was free to leave employer\u2019s premises at any time before the steel shipment arrived or Rasmussen returned from lunch. Instead, employer argues, the injury occurred in the course of a personal activity on claimant\u2019s personal time and without any significant relationship to claimant\u2019s employment. Claimant rejoins that, whether he was free to leave is immaterial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>because all employees are ultimately \u201cfree to go.\u201d What matters, claimant says, is that he agreed to unload the steel delivery if it arrived while Rasmussen was at lunch; that agreement transformed him from \u201cguest\u201d to \u201cworker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We disagree with claimant\u2019s argument. Although the injury occurred on employer\u2019s premises while claimant was permissively using employer\u2019s equipment, the other pertinent circumstances point in a different direction. The injury-producing activity was not performed for employer\u2019s benefit, it was performed on a day off, it was not an activity for which claimant was paid, and it was an activity as to which employee was on a personal mission of his own. Claimant\u2019s agreement to remain on the employer\u2019s premises was subject to the understanding that he was free to leave \u2014 without performing any work for employer \u2014 when his personal mission ended. Stated differently, claimant\u2019s reason for being and remaining on employer\u2019s premises was personal; it was not \u201creasonably incidental\u201d to his waiting for a possible steel delivery. <em>See Fred Meyer, Inc., </em>325 Or at 598 (An injury occurs \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment if it takes place \u201cwhile the worker reasonably is fulfilling the duties of the employment or is doing something reasonably incidental to it.\u201d). Although employer permitted claimant to engage in the personal activity, it lacked a \u201creasonable relationship to the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598-99. Accordingly, the board correctly concluded that claimant\u2019s injury did not occur in the course of employment and that the injury was not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> Employer also argues that claimant\u2019s injury is not compensable because it occurred during a \u201crecreational activity\u2019 under ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B). The hoard did not reach that issue and, likewise, we find it unnecessary to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
