We affirm, without discussion, the trial court\u2019s disposition of petitioner\u2019s claims predicated on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). <em>See Miller v. Lampert, </em>340 Or 1, 125 P3d 1260 (2006); <em>Lutz v. Hill, </em>205 Or App 252, 134 P3d 1003, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 140 (2006). We write only to address petitioner\u2019s claims predicated on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004). In particular, we conclude that (1) <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a new \u201cwatershed rule\u201d of criminal procedure and, thus, does not apply on collateral review; and (2) the post-conviction court correctly rejected petitioner\u2019s alternative claim that his criminal defense counsel were constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise a Crawford-like challenge to the admission of hearsay statements at the time of petitioner\u2019s trial in 1998 and in his ensuing appeal. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The material procedural circumstances are undisputed. In January 1998, petitioner was tried and convicted of multiple sex offenses following a jury trial in Josephine County Circuit Court. Petitioner appealed; we reversed one of his convictions but affirmed the others, <em>State v. Peed, </em>168 Or App 236, 4 P3d 82 (2000); and the appellate judgment issued in 2000. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was denied, and the appellate judgment affirming that disposition issued in 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">On March 8, 2004, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Crawford. </em>In June 2005, petitioner brought this action. As pertinent to our review, the operative formal petition for post-conviction relief included the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cThis petition is not being filed within two years of the date that Petitioner\u2019s appeal was final in the Oregon appellate courts because the specific claims asserted herein could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition because they are based upon the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in * * * <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>* * *. The claims asserted herein were not recognized at the time of Petitioner\u2019s original petition, and controlling law at the time of Petitioner\u2019s original petition would have barred the claims asserted herein, making the assertion of said claims a futile act, which the law does not require.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u00ab&gt;J: ^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s convictions are void because Petitioner\u2019s rights of confrontation and cross-examination under Article I, \u00a7 11 of the Oregon Constitution and the 6th Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, were substantially denied when the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay statements by declarants whom Petitioner had no opportunity to confront or cross-examine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">&gt;j? ifi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s convictions are void because Petitioner\u2019s right to adequate and effective assistance of trial counsel, to a fair and impartial trial, and to Due Process of Law, Fundamental Fairness, and Equal Protection of the Laws under Article I, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11 and 20 of the Oregon Constitution and the 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution * * * were substantially denied in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201cb.

ORCP 21 A(8). With respect to petitioner\u2019s Crawford-based allegations, defendant argued that (1) those allegations were precluded by both the two-year statute of limitations of ORS 138.510(3)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the \u201csuccessive petition\u201d bar of ORS 138.550(3);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) in all events, <em>Crawford </em>is not retroactively applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Petitioner responded that ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3) were not preclusive because <em>Crawford </em>departed so dramatically from controlling precedent at the time of the criminal proceedings, particularly <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 US 56, 100 S Ct 2531, 65 L Ed 2d 597 (1980), that petitioner\u2019s Crawford-based allegations \u201ccould not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\u201d ORS 138.510(3); ORS 138.550(3). Further, invoking the analysis of <em>Bockting v. Bayer, </em>399 F3d 1010, <em>opinion amended on denial of panel reh\u2019g, </em>408 F3d 1127 (9th Cir 2005), <em>cert granted sub nom Whorton v. Bockti</em>ng, _ US _, 126 S Ct 2017, 164 L Ed 2d 778 (2006), petitioner contended that <em>Crawford </em>announced a new \u201cwatershed rule\u201d of criminal procedure that must be given effect in collateral proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, adopting each of defendant\u2019s arguments: \u201cSuccessive petition filed too late. ORS 138.510(3). * * * Moreover, petitioner\u2019s claims either were or could have been raised in his original petition. * * * <em>Crawford </em>* * * [is] not retroactive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">On appeal, the parties reiterate their arguments. We reject petitioner\u2019s claim that the admission of testimonial hearsay at his trial violated his confrontation rights, rendering his convictions void. ORS 138.530(1)(a). As explained below, we conclude that, consistently with the strictures of <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 US 288, 109 S Ct 1060, 103 L Ed 2d 334 (1989), and <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 US 348, 124 S Ct 2519, 159 L Ed 2d 442 (2004), <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a retroactively applicable \u201cwatershed rule\u201d of criminal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The retroactive applicability of newly announced federal constitutional rules to Oregon post-conviction relief proceedings is governed by the federal retroactivity principles expressed in <em>Teague </em>and elaborated in, <em>inter alia, Schriro. See Miller, </em>340 Or at 7; <em>Page v. Palmateer, </em>336 Or 379, 84 P3d 133, <em>cert den, </em>543 US 866 (2004). The United States Supreme Court has summarized the federal retroac-tivity methodology as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cFirst, the court must determine when the defendant\u2019s conviction became final. Second, it must ascertain the legal landscape as it then existed, and ask whether the Constitution, as interpreted by the precedent then existing, compels the rule. That is, the court must decide whether the rule is actually \u2018new.\u2019 Finally, if the rule is new, the court must consider whether it falls within either of the two exceptions to nonretroactivity [set out in Teague].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\"><em>Beard v. Banks, </em>542 US 406, 411, 124 S Ct 2504, 159 L Ed 2d 494 (2004) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">Here, as noted, petitioner\u2019s convictions became final in 2000, four years before <em>Crawford. </em>Further, we do not understand the parties to dispute that the rule announced in <em>Crawford </em>was, in fact, \u201cnew\u201d \u2014 and we share that understanding. In <em>Teague, </em>the Court explained, \u201c[A] case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>final.\u201d 489 US at 301 (emphasis in original). Here, <em>Crawford, </em>far from being \u201cdictated\u201d by then-existing precedent, <em>viz., Roberts, </em>dramatically deviated from, and effectively disavowed, that precedent. <em>See Murillo v. Frank, </em>402 F3d 786, 790 (7th Cir 2005) <em>(Crawford </em>\u201cassuredly (and explicitly) jettisoned the <em>Roberts </em>standard\u201d); <em>Lave v. Dretke, </em>444 F3d 333, 335 (5th Cir 2006) (\u201cBecause <em>Crawford </em>changed the test for the admissibility of certain out-of-court statements, it imposes new obligations on state and federal courts and qualifies as a new rule of criminal procedure.\u201d); <em>accord Crawford, </em>541 US at 75 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) (\u201cIn choosing the path it does, the Court of course overrules <em>Ohio v. Roberts[.]\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Thus, the analysis devolves to the third step of the federal retroactivity analysis, <em>viz., </em>whether the new procedural rule falls within either of the <em>Teague </em>exceptions to the bar against retroactive application. Here, only the second of those exceptions \u2014 for rules that \u201crequire [ ] the observance of those procedures that * * * are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 US at 307 (internal quotation marks omitted; ellipsis in original) \u2014 is arguably implicated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Very recently, in <em>Miller, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court cogently described the content and contours of the second <em>Teague </em>exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">\u201cThe plurality in <em>Teague </em>explained * * * that the second exception includes only those watershed rules of criminal procedure that \u2018 \u201calter our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements\u201d \u2019 </em>essential to the fairness of a proceeding. <em>[Teague, </em>489 US] at 311 (quoting <em>Mackey v. United States, </em>401 US 667, 693-94, 91 S Ct 1160, 28 L Ed 2d 404 (1971)) (emphasis in original). The plurality observed that, for a new rule of procedure to fall within this exception, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>must be a rule that is both an \u2018absolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness\u2019 and one \u2018without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 313-14.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">\u201cThe plurality envisioned that few rules would meet those criteria, stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">\u201c \u2018Because we operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt, we believe it unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\"><em>\u201cId. </em>at 313. Since <em>Teague, </em>the Court has not identified any new rule that would qualify as a watershed rule under the second exception, and it has pointed \u2018only\u2019 to the right to counsel recognized in <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 US 335, 83 S Ct 792, 9 L Ed 2d 799 (1963), as the kind of rule that would qualify. <em>See Beard v. Banks, </em>542 US 406, 417-18, 124 S Ct 2504, 159 L Ed 2d 494 (2004) (describing second <em>Teague </em>exception). The rule in <em>Gideon </em>would qualify as a watershed rule, the Court explained, because that decision \u2018alter [ed] our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements </em>essential to the fairness of a proceeding.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 418 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted). To date, no other rule has had \u2018the primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in <em>Gideon.\u2019 Id. </em>at 420.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-7\">\u201cConsistently with that view of the second <em>Teague </em>exception, the Court has explained that the fact that a new rule advances the \u2018accuracy and fairness of capital sentencing judgments\u2019 is not enough to make it a watershed rule. <em>Sawyer v. Smith, </em>497 US 227, 242, 110 S Ct 2822, 111 L Ed 2d 193 (1990). \u2018More is required. A rule that qualifies under [the second] exception must not only improve accuracy, but also must alter our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements </em>essential to the fairness of the proceeding.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-8\"><em>* </em>}*&lt; * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-9\">\u201c* * * [Thus,] to qualify as a \u2018watershed\u2019 rule of criminal procedure under <em>Teague, </em>it is not enough that the rule enhances the accuracy of a criminal proceeding. <em>Sawyer, </em>497 US at 242. The rule \u2018also must alter our understanding of the <em>bedrock procedural elements </em>essential to the fairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>of the proceeding.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">340 Or at 9-11. In sum, <em>Teague\u2019s </em>second exception \u201cgive[s] retroactive effect to only a small set of \u201c \u2018watershed rules of criminal procedure\u2019 \u201d implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Schriro, </em>542 US at 352 (quoting <em>Saffle v. Parks, </em>494 US 484, 495, 110 S Ct 1257, 108 L Ed 2d 415 (1990)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Before directly addressing the applicability of <em>Teague\u2019s </em>second exception to <em>Crawford, </em>we offer two preliminary observations. <em>First, </em>we have not previously addressed the retroactive application of <em>Crawford </em>with respect to the admission of \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay during a criminal trial. In <em>McDonald v. Belleque, </em>206 Or App 655, 138 P3d 895, <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 392 (2006), for example, we explicitly deferred that determination. There, the post-conviction petitioner contended only that the use, in sentencing, of hearsay statements in a presentencing investigative report \u201c Violated [his] rights under the Confrontation Clause, as explained in <em>Crawford \u2019 \u201d </em>and we rejected that contention, concluding that <em>\u201cCrawford\u2019s </em>requirements do not apply to sentencing proceedings.\u201d 206 Or App at 658, 659. In so holding, we assumed, without deciding, that <em>Crawford </em>announced a \u201cwatershed rule\u201d of criminal procedure \u2014 but characterized that proposition as \u201cdubious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659 n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Second, </em>with the exception of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Bockting, </em>it appears that every appellate court that has addressed the question has determined that <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a retroactively applicable \u201cwatershed rule.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Although that near consensus of opinion is not conclusive, it is, at least, cautionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">We return, then, to <em>Crawford </em>itself. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> bars the admissibility in criminal trials of \u201ctestimonial\u201d out-of-court statements by declarants who are not available to testify at trial unless the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. 541 US at 50-52. In so holding, the Court disavowed <em>Roberts, </em>in which it had held that the admissibility of all hearsay evidence in criminal trials was conditioned on whether the evidence fell under \u201ca \u2018firmly rooted hearsay exception\u2019 or bears \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 60 (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 US at 66). Thus, in <em>Crawford, </em>the Court concluded, \u201cWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d 541 US at 68-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In <em>Bockting, </em>the lead opinion held that <em>Crawford </em>announced a \u201cwatershed rule.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The premise of the lead opinion\u2019s analysis was that, because <em>Crawford </em>repeatedly emphasized the centrality of cross-examination in validating the \u201cbedrock principles\u201d embodied in the Confrontation Clause, it announced a requirement \u201cwithout which the likelihood of accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d 399 F3d at 1016-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Conversely, the appellate courts that have concluded that <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a \u201cwatershed rule\u201d have done so for one or more of four reasons. <em>First, </em>several courts have concluded that, although the Confrontation Clause itself embodies a \u201cbedrock procedural guarantee,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 US at 42, <em>Crawford </em>merely redefined procedures for effectuating those core protections with respect to the admission of hearsay evidence. <em>In re Moore, </em>133 Cal App 4th 68, 76-77, 34 Cal Rptr 3d 605, 610-12 (2005), exemplifies that approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\"><em>\u201cCrawford </em>does not rise to the level of <em>Gideon, </em>under the watershed rule test. Although it is important, being based upon the confrontation clause which is recognized as a bedrock procedural guarantee, this does not mean that the rules concerning its implementation necessarily constitute bedrock procedural rules. <em>Crawford </em>does not introduce any fundamentally new concepts to address the fairness or accuracy of a trial; instead it calls for a complete implementation of a protection that already exists \u2014 the Confrontation Clause. For decades, this clause has been recognized as providing an essential component of trials in American courts, the right to confrontation. <em>Crawford </em>does not alter this right. Nor does it define new rights or constitutional guarantees. Rather <em>Crawford </em>simply sets out a new standard for the admission of hearsay evidence, which may or may not improve the accuracy of convictions. Essentially, the difference between the rule in <em>Crawford </em>as compared to that in <em>Roberts </em>is the manner in which each effectuates a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. Thus, similar to a rule that shifts the factfinding responsibility from a judge to the jury, a rule that redefines the way a court admits evidence does not so seriously diminish accuracy that there is an impermissibly large risk of punishing conduct the law does not reach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>See also Brown v. Uphoff, </em>381 F3d 1219, 1226 (10th Cir 2004), <em>cert den, </em>543 US 1079 (2005) (\u201cUnlike <em>Gideon, Crawford </em>does not \u2018alter [ ] our understanding of what constitutes basic due process,\u2019 but merely sets out new standards for the admission of certain kinds of hearsay.\u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Mora, </em>293 F3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir), <em>cert den, </em>537 US 967 (2002)); <em>Edwards v. People, </em>129 P3d 977, 988 (Colo 2006) (\u201cWhile the [Confrontation] Clause\u2019s guarantee of an accused\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>confront witnesses is undoubtedly fundamental to a fair trial, the rule set forth in <em>Crawford </em>does not create that right. Rather, by changing its interpretation of what constitutes an indicia of reliability, the <em>Crawford </em>Court redefines how the confrontation right is to be implemented.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><em>Second, </em>several courts have emphasized that, although cross-examination is constitutionally required, that requirement is not one \u201cwithout which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 US at 313. That is so both because of the rigors of <em>Roberts\u2019s </em>reliability requirements and because preclusion of otherwise manifestly \u201creliable\u201d testimonial hearsay may subvert, not enhance, the accuracy of the criminal trial process. In that regard, the observations of the Second and Seventh Circuits are particularly instructive. In <em>Mungo v. Duncan, </em>393 F3d 327, 335-36 (2d Cir 2004), <em>cert den, </em>544 US 1002 (2005), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-5\">\u201cTo the extent that <em>Crawford </em>requires the exclusion of unreliable hearsay that would have been admitted under the prior law, it is likely to improve accuracy. * * * Because <em>Crawford </em>bars the admission of testimonial statements that would have been countenanced by the old rules, and because some such evidence is unreliable, <em>Crawford </em>will in those instances improve the accuracy of the process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cAt the same time, however, <em>Crawford </em>also precludes admission of highly reliable testimonial out-of-court statements that would have been admissible under the old rules. In such instances, juries will be deprived of highly reliable evidence of guilt, and cases that otherwise would have resulted in well-deserved convictions will now result in acquittals or hung juries. We recognize that <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>rule derives from the principle that cross-examination is a better engine of truth-determination than a judge\u2019s assessment of the reliability of uncross-examined hearsay. We do not question this principle. But it does not necessarily follow that the <em>Crawford </em>rule will improve the accuracy of the process. For the requirement of cross-examination will, in cases where the declarant is not available to be called for cross-examination, simply result in the exclusion of the testimony altogether. Where the testimony was admissible under the old rules precisely because it was reliable, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>applications of <em>Crawford </em>will diminish, rather than increase, the accuracy of the process.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Similarly, in Murillo, the Seventh Circuit observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-6\">\u201cIndeed, it would be a close question whether <em>Crawford </em>helps or hinders accurate decisionmaking. Live testimony is preferable to affidavits and transcribed confessions, because cross-examination can probe its weaknesses, but recorded testimony may be better than silence, when death or incapacity or threats or loyalty to one\u2019s confederates keeps witnesses off the stand. The point of <em>Crawford </em>is not that only live testimony is reliable, but that the sixth amendment gives the accused a right to insist on live testimony, whether that demand promotes or frustrates accuracy. Like the self-incrimination clause and other provisions in the Bill of Rights, the Confrontation Clause can be invoked to prevent the conviction of persons who are guilty in fact. What <em>Crawford </em>holds is that defendants enjoy this right <em>even when the hearsay is trustworthy.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">402 F3d at 790-91 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). <em>See also Lave, </em>444 F3d at 335-36 (adhering to rationale of Second and Seventh Circuits: <em>\u201cTeague </em>analysis is at least partially comparative and requires assessing the risk of false conviction under the old rule against that risk under the new rule.\u201d); <em>Drach v.

In <em>Edwards, </em>the Colorado Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">\u201cJustice Scalia\u2019s eloquent rendering of the Confrontation Clause\u2019s fundamental role in providing a fair trial creates the impression that <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>holding could be at the level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of <em>Gideon\u2019s </em>watershed ruling. However, <em>Crawford </em>read in conjunction with <em>[Schriro\\ </em>appears to present an insurmountable hurdle to a determination that <em>Crawford </em>meets the watershed exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><em>\u201c[Schriro] </em>explains that the watershed \u2018class of rules is extremely narrow, and it is unlikely that any * * * has yet to emerge.\u2019 The plain language of this statement, combined with the fact that it was written by Justice Scalia during the same term in which he authored <em>Crawford, </em>creates a context in which we deem it impossible to hold that <em>Crawford </em>constitutes a watershed rule. And the <em>[Schriro] </em>holding, itself, further indicates that the Court does not consider <em>Crawford </em>a watershed rule. The Court\u2019s refusal in <em>[Schriro] </em>to apply the watershed exception to the <em>Ring </em>[v. <em>Arizona, </em>536 US 584, 122 S Ct 2428, 153 L Ed 2d 556 (2002)] holding, which subsumes the weighty matter of whether a defendant receives the death penalty or not, is a strong implication that <em>Crawford, </em>which regulates the admissibility of evidence, is not a watershed rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">129 P3d at 987 (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Schriro, </em>542 US at 352).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">We regard each of the four foregoing considerations to be persuasive \u2014 and the first two to be especially compelling. Accordingly, we conclude that <em>Crawford </em>does not announce a new \u201cwatershed rule\u201d of criminal procedure that must be given retroactive application in collateral review proceedings. The trial court thus properly dismissed petitioner\u2019s \u201cunlawful conviction\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">We proceed, then, to petitioner\u2019s alternative claim\u2014 <em>viz., </em>that his criminal defense counsel were constitutionally inadequate for having failed to anticipate <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>analysis and to have raised challenges to the admission of hearsay based on that analysis. That claim, with petitioner\u2019s concomitant invocation of the \u201cescape clauses\u201d of ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3), fails for the same reasons that we affirmed the dismissal of a <em>Blakely-based </em>claim of inadequate assistance of counsel in <em>Lutz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">In <em>Lutz, </em>the petitioner\u2019s criminal conviction had become final in 1998 and he had unsuccessfully prosecuted a prior petition for post-conviction relief. <em>Lutz, </em>205 Or App at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>254. In March 2005, the petitioner filed a successive post-conviction relief petition, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that his criminal trial and appellate counsel had been constitutionally inadequate for failing to raise <em>Blakely-like </em>challenges to the imposition of an upward departure sentence. <em>Id. </em>The defendant moved for summary judgment on the ground that that claim was time-barred under either ORS 138.510(3), ORS 138.550(3), or both. <em>Id. </em>at 255. The post-conviction court granted summary judgment, and we affirmed. In so holding, we explained, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-4\">\u201c[T]he factual premise of petitioner\u2019s invocation of the \u2018escape clauses\u2019 in ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3), <em>viz., </em>that his present claim \u2018could not reasonably have been raised\u2019 before <em>Blakely, </em>is irreconcilable with the factual premise of his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel, <em>viz., </em>that, as of 1998, reasonable criminal defense counsel would have anticipated <em>Blakely </em>and raised a Blakely-like challenge to the imposition of the departure sentence and the consecutive sentences. Although it <em>may </em>be abstractly possible, in some case, that an otherwise time-barred claim of inadequate assistance of counsel could be cognizable under the \u2018escape clauses,\u2019 this is not such a case. Bluntly, post-conviction petitioners in this petitioner\u2019s position are statutorily \u2018whipsawed.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 256 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The same reasoning is dispositive here. As noted, petitioner\u2019s conviction became final in 2000, and he filed this petition in June 2005, beyond the two-year statute of limitations prescribed in ORS 138.510(3). Petitioner had also filed a previous petition for post-conviction relief. Thus, like the petitioner in <em>Lutz, </em>to avoid the statute of limitations and the \u201csuccessive petition\u201d bar of ORS 138.550(3), petitioner must successfully invoke the \u201cescape clauses\u201d of ORS 138.510(3) and ORS 138.550(3). But, like the petitioner in <em>Lutz, </em>petitioner\u2019s invocation of the \u201cescape clauses\u201d is \u201cirreconcilable with the factual premise of his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Lutz, </em>205 Or App at 256. In particular, the factual premise of petitioner\u2019s claim of inadequate assistance of <em>counsel </em>\u2014 viz., that, notwithstanding <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>competent criminal defense counsel in the late 1990s should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>reasonably have raised <em>Crawford-like </em>evidentiary challenges \u2014 contradicts the premise of his invocation of the \u201cescape <em>clauses\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., that his present claim of inadequate assistance of counsel \u201ccould not reasonably have been raised\u201d before <em>Crawford,.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The post-conviction court properly dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\"> The present record does not disclose the substance of petitioner\u2019s claims in his first petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-9\"> ORS 138.510(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cA petition pursuant to ORS 138.510 to 138.680 must be filed within two years of the following, unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">&lt;(\u2021 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021 $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">\u201c(b) If an appeal is taken, the date the appeal is final in the Oregon appellate courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b752-13\"> ORS 138.550(3) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">\u201cAll grounds for relief claimed by petitioner in a petition pursuant to ORS 138.510 to 138.680 must be asserted in the original or amended petition, and any grounds not so asserted are deemed waived unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted therein which could not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b754-7\"> <em>But see Bockting, </em>399 F3d at 1023-24 (Noonan, J., concurring) (asserting that <em>Crawford </em>did not announce a \u201cnew\u201d rule).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> The first exception is for rules that \u201c \u2018place [ ] certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Teague, </em>489 US at 307 (internal quotation marks omitted).
