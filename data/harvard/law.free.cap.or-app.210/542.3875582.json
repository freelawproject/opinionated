Petitioners have also sought judicial review in the circuit court. In response, DLCD filed a motion in this court seeking a summary determination of which court has jurisdiction to review the order. We grant the motion and determine that we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Petitioners Virginia Corey and Bergis Road, LLC, each own undivided one-third interests in a 23-acre parcel of land located in rural Clackamas County. In January 2005, they filed a claim seeking $4,985,000 in compensation for the asserted reduction in the fair market value of their property caused by land use regulations restricting its use. ORS 197.352(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> DLCD determined that application of those laws to petitioners\u2019 property would result in a loss of fair market value and, on that basis, that petitioners had a valid claim under Measure 37. In lieu of paying compensation, DLCD decided to forgo applying certain land use regulations affecting petitioners\u2019 use of their property, as permitted by ORS 197.352(8).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agency also determined, however, that each petitioner\u2019s use of the property would remain subject to certain regulations because the statute required waiver only insofar as necessary to allow \u201cthe owner to use the property for a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Petitioners do not agree with DLCD\u2019s determination of which regulations need to be waived, and they consequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>seek judicial review. The question now before us on DLCD\u2019s motion is where jurisdiction for judicial review of DLCD\u2019s order lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">That question might be resolved by one of several statutes. One possibility is ORS 183.482, which vests jurisdiction for judicial review of orders in contested cases in this court. Whether that statute applies depends on whether the proceeding before DLCD should have been treated as a contested case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as defined by ORS 183.310(2)(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-5\">\u201c \u2018Contested case\u2019 means a proceeding before an agency:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c(A) In which the individual legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by statute or Constitution to be determined only after an agency hearing at which such specific parties are entitled to appear and be heard;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c(B) Where the agency has discretion to suspend or revoke a right or privilege of a person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c(C) For the suspension, revocation or refusal to renew or issue a license where the licensee or applicant for a license demands such hearing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c(D) Where the agency by rule or order provides for hearings substantially of the character required by ORS 183.415,183.425,183.450,183.460 and 183.470.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Subparagraphs (B) and (C) clearly do not apply, because DLCD did not have authority to suspend, revoke, or refuse to renew anything. Subparagraph (D) does not apply, because the procedure that DLCD employed to deal with petitioners\u2019 claim bears no resemblance to a hearing as required by the statutes cited in that subparagraph, that is, an Administrative Procedures Act contested case hearing with notice by personal service, live testimony under oath, depositions, cross-examination of witnesses, and a decision based exclusively on the record. Rather, the rules governing DLCD\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>treatment of Measure 37 claims, OAR 125-145-0030 to 125-145-0100, provide only for written comment and no other procedural formalities. Thus, the only arguably relevant subpar-agraph is (A), under which a proceeding is a contested case if it is one \u201c[i]n which the individual legal rights, duties or privileges of specific parties are required by statute or Constitution to be determined only after an agency hearing at which such specific parties are entitled to appear and be heard.\u201d Further, as no statute requires notice and a hearing, and the Oregon Constitution contains no provision guaranteeing procedural rights in noncriminal cases, the question reduces to this: Does anything in the United States Constitution require DLCD to provide a Measure 37 claimant with notice and a hearing before DLCD decides not to waive certain land use regulations for the benefit of the claimant?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Before a governmental entity applies pre-existing legislative or quasi-legislative standards in such a way as to deprive a person (or small group of persons) of an interest in property, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the government to provide notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <em>Bi-Metallic Investment Company v. State Board, of Equalization, </em>239 US 441, 445, 36 S Ct 141, 60 L Ed 372 (1915); <em>Londoner v. Denver, </em>210 US 373, 386, 28 S Ct 708, 52 L Ed 1103 (1908). DLCD is a governmental entity; Measure 37 is a pre-existing legislative standard; petitioners are a small group of people. The question whether they were entitled to notice and a hearing, then, reduces to whether or not DLCD purported to deprive them of a property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Petitioners\u2019 interest in this case is not property in the traditional sense; DLCD is not attempting to deprive them of their actual real estate. Rather, what is at stake for petitioners here is their interest in a waiver of regulations that will result in an expansion of permissible uses of their land. That fact, however, does not necessarily mean that petitioners have no property interest. In a number of cases beginning with <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 US 254, 90 S Ct 1011, 25 L Ed 2d 287 (1970), the United States Supreme Court expanded the definition of constitutionally protected property interests beyond tangible real estate and objects. The \u201cnew property\u2019 includes certain governmental benefits to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>which an individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement. As the Court explained in <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 US 564, 577, 92 S Ct 2701, 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">\u201cProperty interests * * * are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law \u2014 rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits. Thus, the welfare recipients in <em>[Goldberg v. Kelly] </em>had a claim of entitlement to welfare payments that was grounded in the statute defining eligibility for them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Thus, at least since 1972, to determine whether a particular interest amounts to constitutionally protected property, we look to state law and ask whether that law entitles certain persons to specific benefits. We have no difficulty concluding that Measure 37 creates, in some real property owners, a claim of entitlement either to compensation or to the waiver of restrictive regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">However, that does not end our inquiry. <em>Goldberg, Roth, </em>and other United States Supreme Court cases dealing with procedural due process left unanswered for many years the question whether persons (such as petitioners here) initially <em>applying for </em>a benefit, as opposed to persons who have already qualified for a benefit, have a claim of entitlement to that benefit. Some language in <em>Roth </em>suggests that applicants for benefits, as well as possessors of them, have an entitlement: \u201cThe recipients [in Goldberg] had not yet shown that they were, in fact, within the statutory terms of eligibility. But we held that they had a right to a hearing at which they might attempt to do so.\u201d <em>Roth, </em>408 US at 577. A number of scholars argued that the law created an entitlement to a benefit whenever the law spelled out nondiscretionary criteria, the attainment of which qualified an applicant to receive the benefit, even when the person seeking the benefit was an applicant and not an established possessor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Many cases from the state and lower federal courts reached the same conclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the Supreme Court never espoused that theory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and, in fact, it later repudiated its <em>dictum </em>from <em>Roth </em>and rejected the theory outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">That occurred in <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 US 40, 119 S Ct 977, 143 L Ed 2d 130 (1999) <em>(Sullivan). </em>Applicants for workers\u2019 compensation benefits challenged the constitutional adequacy of procedures used by the state to determine the validity of their claims. The Court held that the applicants did not have a constitutionally protected interest in the benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201cIn [both <em>Goldberg </em>and <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 332, 96 S Ct 893, 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976)], an individual\u2019s entitlement to benefits had been established, and the question presented was whether predeprivation notice and a hearing were required before the individual\u2019s interest in <em>continued </em>payment of benefits could be terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">\u201cRespondents\u2019 property interest in this case, however, is fundamentally different. * * * [F]or an employee\u2019s property interest in the payment of medical benefits to attach under state law, the employee must clear two hurdles: First, he must prove that an employer is liable for a work-related injury, and second, he must establish that the particular medical treatment at issue is reasonable and necessary. Only then does the employee\u2019s interest parallel that of the beneficiary of welfare assistance in <em>Goldberg </em>and the recipient of disability benefits in <em>Mathews.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cRespondents obviously have not cleared both of these hurdles. While they indeed have established their initial <em>eligibility </em>for medical treatment, they have yet to make good on their claim that the particular medical treatment they received was reasonable and necessary. Consequently, they do not have a property interest \u2014 under the logic of their own argument \u2014 in having their providers pay for treatment that has yet to be found reasonable and necessary. To state the argument is to refute it[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\"><em>Sullivan, </em>526 US at 60-61 (emphasis in original). The teaching of <em>Sullivan, </em>then, is that a person obtains a protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>property interest in a benefit only when the person has actually proven that he or she is fully entitled to it; only at that point must denial be accompanied by due process. In reaching that conclusion, the Court appears to emphasize that the line is drawn so as to exclude mere applicants. Under that reading of the case, petitioners here would have no protected property interest in the waiver because they have not yet established that they are entitled to it. Consequently, they would have no right to notice and a hearing under the United States Constitution and no right to a contested case hearing under ORS 183.482.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Were we writing on a clean slate, we might interpret <em>Sullivan </em>as described above. However, we are not free to apply the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment as we see fit when our own Supreme Court has applied it otherwise. That has happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><em>In Koskela v. Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>331 Or 362, 15 P3d 548 (2000), the claimant was injured on the job and submitted a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. His employer accepted the claim, and, after surgeries, the plaintiffs physician declared him to be medically stationary. That, in turn, \u201ctriggered the claim closure process conducted by the Department of Consumer and Business Services.\u201d Id at 365-66. That process resulted in the claimant receiving 29 percent permanent <em>partial </em>disability (PPD) benefits. The claimant, however, believed that the process should have resulted in a finding that he was permanently <em>totally </em>disabled. On judicial review, he argued that the claim closure process was flawed because it did not allow him the procedural protections required by the Due Process Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether that clause entitled the claimant to present evidence on all aspects of the claim, to rebut adverse evidence, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">To resolve that question \u2014 \u201cHow much process is due?\u201d \u2014 the court first had to decide whether the claimant had a constitutionally protected property interest in the benefit that he sought. If he did, then the court had to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>whether the procedures provided by statute adequately protected that interest. It is the first question that is relevant to our inquiry here because the dispositive question in this case is not how much process petitioners are entitled to but whether they are entitled to any process at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The court held that the claimant had a protected property interest in the benefits, even though he had not fully qualified for them. That outcome seems to contradict <em>Sullivan, </em>which, as noted, held that a workers\u2019 compensation claimant does not have a property interest in benefits until the person has established entitlement. The court had to distinguish <em>Sullivan, </em>and it did so as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201cAccording to employer, workers\u2019 compensation claimants in Oregon do not have a protected property interest in permanent disability benefits until they establish through the claim closure process that they are entitled to receive such benefits. Underlying employer\u2019s argument is the assumption that workers have no property interest in benefits until they meet their burden of demonstrating the extent of their permanent disability. <em>See </em>ORS 656.266 (setting out burden). That assumption misapprehends the nature of a worker\u2019s property interest and the purpose of the claim closure process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cIn Oregon * * * a claimant needs to clear only one hurdle to establish entitlement to compensation benefits. Acceptance of a claim signifies that the worker has met the burden of proving a compensable injury. The claim closure process begins after a claim has been accepted and a claimant has been declared medically stationary. The purpose of claim closure is to \u2018determine the <em>extent </em>of the worker\u2019s permanent disability,\u2019 ORS 656.268(1) (emphasis added), not, as employer would have it, the worker\u2019s <em>entitlement </em>to compensation. Because a claimant whose claim has been accepted is entitled to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits, that claimant has a protected property interest in receiving compensation. <em>Sullivan </em>is not a barrier to reaching claimant\u2019s constitutional challenge in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71 (emphasis in original; citations omitted). According to the court, then, the <em>Sullivan </em>claimants had no property interest because, under Pennsylvania law, they had not established that their medical expenses were both work-related and reasonable and necessary. <em>See Sullivan, </em>526 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>at 61. The claimant in <em>Koskela, </em>however, <em>had </em>met all of the prerequisites for benefits. That occurred when his claim was accepted. <em>Koskela, </em>331 Or at 371. What he had <em>not </em>established was only the <em>extent </em>of the benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Thus, under <em>Sullivan </em>as interpreted in <em>Koskela, </em>there is an important difference between establishing initial general qualification for, or entitlement to, benefits under a government program such as workers\u2019 compensation, and establishing qualification for, or entitlement to, a particular quantity or extent of benefits within that program. Nobody has a property interest in gaining admission; once admitted, a property interest in the extent of benefits arises. Thus, the claimant in <em>Koskela, </em>having been accepted as a workers\u2019 compensation recipient, was entitled to a due process hearing to determine whether he qualified for permanent total disability benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Applying <em>Koskela </em>to this case leads inexorably to the conclusion that petitioners here have a property interest in the waivers. Like the claimant in <em>Koskela, </em>petitioners\u2019 claim was accepted. That happened when DLCD determined that laws and rules currently in effect reduced the fair market value of petitioners\u2019 property relative to how the property could have been used at the time that petitioners or a family member acquired the property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Final Staff Report and Recommendation, Claim No. Ml19478, </em>2 (July 20, 2005) (DLCD staff \u201chas determined that the claim is valid\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 9 (staff \u201crecommends that the claim be approved\u201d); <em>Final Order, Claim No. M119478, </em>1 (approving claim; accepting Final Report). Thus, the part of DLCD\u2019s decision of which petitioners seek judicial review does not deal with petitioners\u2019 entitlement to a remedy; it deals, like the claimant\u2019s claim for permanent total disability in <em>Koskela, </em>only with the <em>extent </em>of the remedy. Put another way: Just as the Department of Consumer and Business Services in <em>Koskela </em>created an entitlement to benefits \u2014 including the disputed permanent <em>total </em>disability benefits \u2014 when it accepted the claimant\u2019s claim in <em>Koskela, </em>so too did DLCD create an entitlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to benefits \u2014 including the disputed waivers \u2014 when it accepted petitioners\u2019 Measure 37 claim. That being the case, petitioners have a protected property interest in the waivers. <em>Roth, </em>408 US at 577. Consequently, they were entitled to notice and a meaningful hearing before DLCD could deny them the waivers. <em>Londoner, </em>210 US at 386. It necessarily follows that, under ORS 183.310(2)(a), the DLCD procedure should have been conducted as a contested case, and therefore, under ORS 183.482, jurisdiction for judicial review lies in this court. <em>Patton, </em>293 Or at 366-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Motion granted; judicial review to proceed; record to be filed within 28 days of the date of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> ORS 197.352(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201cIf a public entity enacts or enforces a new land use regulation or enforces a land use regulation enacted prior to December 2,2004, that restricts the use of private real property or any interest therein and has the effect of reducing the fair market value of the property, or any interest therein, then the owner of the property shall be paid just compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> ORS 197.352(8) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c[I]n lieu of payment of just compensation under this section, the governing body responsible for enacting the land use regulation may modify, remove, or not to apply [sic] the land use regulation or land use regulations to allow the owner to use the property for a use permitted at the time the owner acquired the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b587-11\"> DLCD argues that, because petitioners did not receive a contested case hearing, this court does not have jurisdiction.
