At issue is whether the UCUA acted lawfully in terminating plaintiffs\u2019 fixed term employment contracts as part of a restructuring to meet the fiscal crisis prompted by federal decisions declaring unconstitutional New Jersey\u2019s solid waste flow orders. We hold that the UCUA\u2019s decision was incidental to the exercise of its statutory powers, and that plaintiffs\u2019 complaints were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">The UCUA administers Union County\u2019s solid waste management system. The system includes a resource recovery facility owned by the UCUA and operated by Ogden Martin Systems of Union, Inc., an ash residue disposal landfill owned by Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc., and a countywide recycling program.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">In 1988, the UCUA hired Miskowitz as a bookkeeper. She was promoted to assistant comptroller in 1994. As assistant comptroller, Miskowitz\u2019s duties included billing hauler and municipal accounts, scheduling maintenance on UCUA\u2019s vehicles, keeping employee attendance records and supervising assistants.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In 1996, the UCUA appointed Pappas to the position of deputy executive director. His duties included assisting the executive director in day-to-day operations, serving as acting executive director in his absence, attending meetings, dealing with vendors and consultants, overseeing bid specifications and invoices, and acting as liaison with UCUA commissioners and representatives of local governments.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Both Miskowitz and Pappas were given five-year contracts. Miskowitz\u2019s contract ran from March 9, 1994 to March 8, 1999. Pappas\u2019 contract was to run from January 2, 1997 to January 1, 2002. As we will note more fully later in our opinion, these contracts were inartfully drafted. Read literally, the agreements purport to guarantee that the plaintiffs\u2019 respective positions would not be abolished, and their duties would not be altered during the five-year fixed terms, at least in the absence of some act of misfeasance.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The operative contractual language in Miskowitz\u2019s employment agreement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\"><em>Termination </em>\u2014 EMPLOYER shall not abolish or alter EMPLOYEE\u2019S position or duties and EMPLOYEE shall not be discharged, disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in status, rank, or compensation, or deprived of any professional or employment advantage, or given any adverse evaluation of her(/his] performance without just cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">The termination of the EMPLOYEE\u2019S employment shall be deemed to have been for \u201cCause\u201d if termination of her[/his] employment shall have been the result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">(i) an act or acts of dishonesty on the part of the EMPLOYEE constituting a felony or resulting or intended to result directly or indirectly in gains or personal enrichment at the expense of the EMPLOYER;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">(ii) the continued willful failure by the EMPLOYEE to perform substantially her duties with the EMPLOYER (other than any such failure resulting from her incapacity due to physical injury or physical or mental illness) for a period of thirty (30) days after a demand for substantial performance is delivered to the EMPLOYEE in the form of a resolution adopted by the Authority\u2019s Commissioners which specifically identifies the manner in which the EMPLOYEE has not substantially performed her[/his] duties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">(iii) The EMPLOYEE\u2019S drug or alcohol addiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\"><em>Savings Clause </em>\u2014 Should any valid federal or state law or final determination of any court or administrative agency affect any provision of this AGREEMENT, the provision or provisions so affected shall be automatically conformed to the law or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>determination and otherwise the AGREEMENT shall continue in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The contractual language in Pappas\u2019 contract is essentially the same, but there is one subtle difference. In Pappas\u2019 contract, the opening paragraph pertaining to termination is set forth in two separate sentences, the first prohibiting the employer from \u201cabolish[ing] or altering] the employee\u2019s position or duties\u201d and the second barring the employer from making adverse employment decisions without \u201cjust cause.\u201d Pappas\u2019 agreement states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\"><em>Termination </em>\u2014 EMPLOYER shall not abolish or alter EMPLOYEE\u2019S position or duties. EMPLOYEE shall not be discharged, disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in status, rank, or compensation, or deprived of any professional or employment advantage, or given any adverse evaluation of herl/hisl performance without just cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The five-year contracts were authorized by the Municipal and County Utilities Authority Law <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-1 to -78), which states that a municipal authority may appoint such personnel as it \u201cmay determine necessary for its efficient operations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A . </em>40:14B-18. The statute further provides that an authority \u201cshall determine [the] qualifications, ... duties and compensation\u201d of its employees \u201cas it deems necessary,\u201d but that the terms of office and periods of such contracts may not exceed five years. <em>Ibid. </em>Employees hired by an authority are not subject to civil service laws or regulations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:14B-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In 1995, after Miskowitz\u2019s contract term had begun but before Pappas was hired, the Third Circuit rendered its initial decision in <em>Atlantic Coast Demolition v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>48 <em>F.3d </em>701 (3d Cir.1995), finding that New Jersey\u2019s solid waste management system discriminated against interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at 717. The matter was remanded to the District Court for a determination as to whether New Jersey\u2019s statutory and regulatory scheme served a legitimate local purpose, and, if so, whether there were nondiscriminatory alternatives that would enable the State to accomplish its legitimate objectives. <em>Id. </em>at 717-18. On July 15, 1996, the District Court concluded that nondiscriminatory alternatives existed to control solid waste flows, and that New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Jersey's system violated the Commerce Clause. <em>Atlantic Coast Demolition v. Chosen Freeholders, </em>931 <em>F.Supp. </em>341, 358 (D.N.J. 1996). The District Court permanently enjoined the enforcement of New Jersey\u2019s statutory and regulatory scheme, but stayed'the judgment for two years following exhaustion of all appeals to afford the State the opportunity to devise a nondiscriminatory alternative to its solid waste flow system. <em>Ibid. </em>The State appealed. The Third Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s judgment, but modified the stay. <em>Atlantic Coast Demolition v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, </em>112 F.3d 652, 669 (3d Cir.1997). Under the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment, the stay was not to extend beyond the exhaustion of the State\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>Ibid. </em>On November 10, 1997, the United States Supreme Court denied New Jersey\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Immediately after the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to review the Third Circuit\u2019s judgment, the UCUA applied to the Union County Local Finance Board for the issuance of solid waste revenue bonds designed to restructure its $296 million debt. We need not describe the UCUA\u2019s application in detail. Suffice it to say, the UCUA proposal was prompted by the \u201ccrisis\u201d precipitated by judicial abrogation of New Jersey\u2019s solid waste management system. The Local Finance Board\u2019s approval of the UCUA\u2019s plan was required under the Local Authorities Fiscal Control Law (Fiscal Control Law) <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5A-1 to -27).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The Fiscal Control Law was enacted in 1983. Its articulated objective is to \u201cpromote the financial integrity of local authorities.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:5A-2. The statute requires local authorities \u25a0 to submit their annual budgets to the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, and empowers the Local Finance Board to \u201ctake remedial action to address an emergency situation with respect to the financial conditions and operations\u201d of such local authorities. <em>Ibid. </em>Upon the request of the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, the Local Finance Board may order \u201cimplementation of a [fiscal] plan to assure the payment of debt service on. the obligations of [an] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>authority, or provide relief from [a] financial burden\u201d upon a finding that the authority faces serious continuing financial difficulty. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A.-5A-7; <em>see also Senate County and Municipal Government Committee Statement, </em>Assembly, No. 144 L.1983, c. 313 (Local Finance Board should intervene if the local unit has not undertaken a remedial plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Although the UCUA\u2019s plan did not specifically propose a reduction in force, it described in detail the urgency of the fiscal crisis resulting from the exhaustion of the federal stay. In November 1997, for example, the UCUA predicted that it could accommodate its debt for a little over a year before running out of funds. The UCUA represented that it would default on its bonds by 1999 unless it substantially restructured its operations. The Local Finance Board approved the UCUA\u2019s financial plan in April 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Like other solid waste management districts, Union County faced substantial financial problems as a result of the <em>Atlantic Coast </em>decisions. Among other options, the Union County Board of Freeholders considered abandonment of the UCUA\u2019s solid waste system, a shutdown of its waste-to-energy facility, dissolution of the solid waste franchise with a restructured alternative based on economic flow control, and establishment of a system to recover stranded investments. A report submitted to the Board recommended renegotiation of the UCUA\u2019s service contract with Ogden Martin, termination or replacement of the UCUA\u2019s power sales agreement with Public Service Electric &amp; Gas, restructuring of the UCUA\u2019s debt service, elimination of the UCUA\u2019s State loan bonds, and the sale of its waste-to-energy facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In response to the federal decisions, Union County amended its solid waste management plan in December 1997 and submitted it to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for its approval. The proposal recommended reduction of the UCUA\u2019s budget from over $5 million to $1,685,770. To meet the more competitive market demands caused by the federal judiciary\u2019s invalidation of district solid waste flow orders, the proposal recommended a substantial reduction in tipping fees. The DEP condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>tionally approved the amended Union County plan. In addition to the cost-cutting retrenchment proposed by the County, the DEP ordered the UCUA to privatize its resource recovery facility by leasing it to Ogden Martin, and to transfer the UCUA\u2019s recycling and solid waste enforcement programs to county agencies. The purpose of these modifications was to shift the UCUA\u2019s solid waste management responsibilities to private and public entities in order to reduce the UCUA\u2019s administrative budget. The amended solid waste management plan envisioned a $550,675 reduction in the UCUA\u2019s salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The Department of the Treasury audited the UCUA\u2019s budget in 1997. Among other recommendations, the Department proposed the elimination of five-year employment contracts and the reduction of its executive staff to three positions \u2014 executive director, finance officer, and executive secretary. In its report, the Department observed that this restructuring was necessary \u201cto achieve the ... goal of establishing a tipping fee consistent with market rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">In February 1998, the UCUA created an ad hoc committee to study the UCUA\u2019s staffing needs. The committee consisted of Commissioners Edward Jackus, Richmond Lapolla, and John Kubish, as well as County Manager Michael Lapolla and Director of Finance Lawrence Caroselli. All of these individuals were later named as defendants in this case. The committee recommended elimination of numerous positions, including that of assistant comptroller and deputy executive director. Under the committee\u2019s restructuring plan, the assistant comptroller\u2019s position was unnecessary because Odgen Martin was to assume management of hauler accounts, and because the substantial reduction of the UCUA\u2019s vehicle fleet eliminated the need for elaborate maintenance schedules. The minuscule duties that remained in the assistant comptroller\u2019s job description were to be performed by a bookkeeper. In a similar vein, the deputy executive director position was to become extinct because all tipping, weighing, environmental and operational functions were to be transferred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Ogden Martin, and the UCUA\u2019s recycling responsibilities were to be transferred to county agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On May 13, 1998, the UCUA conducted a public meeting to consider the committee\u2019s recommendation. Although concern was expressed for the plight of discharged employees, a majority of the commissioners approved the committee\u2019s recommendation, noting that the UCUA was losing $60,000 a day and soon would be unable to fund its payroll. The following day, the UCUA hand-delivered letters to the plaintiffs informing them that their positions had been abolished and that their employment would end on June 14, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Miskowitz immediately sued the UCUA for breach of contract, requesting a restraining order and a permanent injunction. Pap-pas brought suit several weeks later by filing an order to show cause and a multi-count complaint. Named as defendants in Pappas\u2019 suit were the UCUA, its commissioners, and the county manager and finance director of Union County. Pappas alleged breach of contract, breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, deprivation of constitutional property rights, tortious interference with economic advantage, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation and conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The defendants filed motions for summary judgment and a request to be heard on short notice on the return day of Pappas\u2019 order to show cause. Following oral argument, Judge Beglin dismissed Pappas\u2019 complaint against the individual defendants because the committee members neither participated in the vote nor had any decision-making authority to terminate plaintiffs employment. The judge dismissed the complaint against the individual commissioners because they had acted, in their official capacities and in good faith. The complaint against Union County was dismissed because it was not involved in the decision to terminate plaintiffs\u2019 employment. The judge denied the UCUA\u2019s motion on the ground that factual issues required further exploration.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>After discovery was completed, Judge Beglin granted the UCUA\u2019s motion. In a comprehensive oral opinion, the judge concluded that the UCUA acted lawfully in abolishing plaintiffs\u2019 positions notwithstanding their fixed term employment agreements. The judge reasoned that all \u201ccontract[s] of public employment\u201d are subject to an \u201cimplied covenant,\u201d allowing for \u201ctermination for reasons of economy.\u201d As phrased by Judge Beglin, \u201cso long as the governmental unit is exercising its statutory powers, promoting its legitimate objectives, and ... does so in good faith, it may lawfully terminate a fixed term or tenured employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Plaintiffs characterize the issue presented as one of contractual interpretation. They argue that local authorities, just as private persons, must adhere to the tenets of general contract law. <em>See, e.g., Greenberg v. Fornicola, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 178 A.2d 339 (1962); <em>Borough of West Caldwell v. Borough of Caldwell, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>9, 22, 138 A.2d 402 (1958); <em>Hankin v. Hamilton Township Board of Education, </em>47 <em>N.J.Super. </em>70, 78, 135 A.2d 329 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>489, 137 A.2d 114 (1957). So posited, plaintiffs contend that we should merely apply the well-recognized common law rule allowing an employee to obtain compensatory damages for the employer\u2019s breach of a fixed term employment contract. <em>See, e.g., Stopford v. Boonton Molding </em>Co., 56 <em>N.J. </em>169, 189, 265 A.2d 657 (1970); <em>Meyers v. Potoker, </em>3 <em>N.J. Misc. </em>450, 450-51, 128 A. 601 (Sup.Ct.1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">We note parenthetically that resolution of the issue presented would not be an easy task even if we were to accept plaintiffs\u2019 somewhat facile approach. Miskowitz\u2019s contract permits the UCUA to terminate her position for \u201cjust cause.\u201d The contract does not define that term, but instead states that \u201ccause\u201d for termination exists where the employee commits an act as specified in the agreement. It is unclear whether \u201cjust cause\u201d and \u201ccause\u201d were intended to be equivalent terms, and whether the grounds for termination specified in the contract were intended to be all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>inclusive. These problems are compounded by additional ambiguities in Pappas\u2019 contract, caused by the change in punctuation, which arguably grants an ironclad guaranty against abolishment of the employee\u2019s position or alteration of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We do not believe that the issue before us can fairly be resolved by contractual interpretation. Realistically, the question presented cannot be circumscribed so narrowly. We would be myopic were we to see only the case before us. The issue must be considered within the broader context of New Jersey\u2019s historical efforts to control and regulate the flow of state-generated solid waste. In reliance on the regulatory scheme invalidated by the <em>Atlantic Coast </em>decisions, New Jersey\u2019s solid waste management districts had incurred substantial debt to plan and construct state-of-the-art facilities to minimize pollution. As of December 31, 1994, that public debt aggregated approximately 1.65 billion dollars, a result of fifty-three separate bond issues by New Jersey Counties and local authorities. <em>In re Passaic County Utilities Auth., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>270, 276, 753 A.2d 661 (2000). The unanticipated invalidation of New Jersey\u2019s statutory and regulatory scheme permitted waste generators to bypass the sophisticated facilities operated by the counties and local authorities in favor of cheaper out-of-state landfills. <em>Ibid. </em>Deprived of what had been a captive market, the counties and authorities experienced a drastic reduction in revenue, threatening the default of millions of dollars in outstanding public debt. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The complex \u00e1nd unanticipated events that resulted in the invalidation of New Jersey\u2019s carefully crafted solid waste management system produced the need for a new funding source to address the stranded debt of counties and local authorities. Our Supreme Court addressed that issue in <em>In re Passaic County Utilities Auth. </em>There, the Court said that \u201clegislative intervention [was] essential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306, 753 A.2d 661. At least in a tangential sense, this case concerns the opposite side of the coin, <em>i.e., </em>the need of counties and local authorities to slash their solid waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>management budgets to meet the demands of a competitive market.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Against this factual backdrop, we perceive the issue presented in slightly different terms than those articulated by Judge Beglin. We need not, and do not, determine whether a governmental entity may, under ordinary circumstances, terminate a fixed term employment contract merely to effectuate economies or promote efficiency. As we have emphasized, the circumstances confronting the UCUA were extraordinary and unprecedented. Under the Fiscal Control Law, it would have been incumbent on the Local Finance Board to intervene had the UCUA defaulted in its obligation to reduce drastically its budget and to transfer its solid waste management functions to other public and private entities. After judicial abrogation of New Jersey\u2019s solid waste management system, the UCUA was not the same public agency that had hired Miskowitz in 1988 and had promoted her to assistant comptroller in 1994. By the time of her discharge, the UCUA was eviscerated; it was a mere image of what it had once been.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The issue is slightly different with respect to Pappas. At the tim\u00e9 of his appointment in December 1996, the District Court had already entered a permanent injunction that was to take effect two years after the State had exhausted all of its appeals. Despite this ominous foreboding, the employment contract is silent with respect to what the parties\u2019 respective rights would be in the event the District Court\u2019s judgment was affirmed. Perhaps the parties envisioned that the Commerce Clause issue would not be authoritatively resolved within the five-year term of Pappas\u2019 contract, or that New Jersey would ultimately prevail. The record is wholly uninformative in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Putting that issue aside, the fact remains that the UCUA was a going concern when Pappas was appointed, but was a mere shell after the <em>Atlantic Coast </em>decisions were rendered. At the time of his discharge, Pappas\u2019 services were unneeded. His position was no more useful than a vestigial organ. Pappas and Miskowitz were thus in the same sinking boat when their positions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>abolished. We know of no jurisprudential principle that would compel public featherbedding under these circumstances. Nor is it responsible to say that the UCUA could discharge the vestigial employees but remain answerable in damages for the loss of their salaries. We are concerned here with public funds. The taxpayers should not be required to underwrite such a feckless policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">We thus conclude that the UCUA acted within its express and implied statutory powers when it abolished plaintiffs\u2019 positions. In the face of a dire financial emergency, the local authority was within its rights in terminating plaintiffs despite their fixed term contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Although we have been unable to find a reported opinion dealing with the precise issue presented, we do not write on a blank slate. In <em>Stone v. Old Bridge Tp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>110, 543 A.2d 431 (1988), the executive director of a municipal utilities authority brought an action challenging the termination of his fixed term contract. The authority discharged the plaintiff when it was dissolved and replaced by a new governmental entity. The Chancery Division dismissed the plaintiffs complaint, holding that the Fiscal Control Law, under which the authority had been dissolved and the new agency created, did not mandate the continuation of any employment contract. Instead, the court found that the dissolution statute guaranteed the payment only of \u201ccreditors\u201d and \u201cobligees,\u201d which did not include employees with fixed term contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">We reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment over a vigorous dissent. 215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 521 A.2d 1329 (App.Div.1987). The majority did not consider the Fiscal Control Law controlling. Instead, it concluded that \u201cengrafted upon all public contracts are the propositions that one is not paid for work that is unperformed,\u201d (citing <em>In re Williams, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 77-80, 486 A.2d 858 (App.Div.1984)), and \u201cthat positions may be abolished for reasons of economy\u201d (citing <em>McCartney v. Franco, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 297, 209 A.2d 329 (App.Div.1965)). 215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 367, 521 A.2d 1329. The dissenting opinion asserted that public entities must adhere to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ordinary contractual principles in their dealings with their employees, and that the \u201cjudicial remedy for breach [of an employment agreement] should ... protect [the] promisee\u2019s expectation interest in having the benefit of its bargain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373, 521 A.2d 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The Supreme Court reversed our determination and reinstated the Chancery Division\u2019s judgment. <em>Stone v. Old Bridge Tp., </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>110, 123, 543 A.2d 431 (1988). The Court concluded that the Fiscal Control Law, and more particularly, the dissolution section, required only that an authority\u2019s debt obligation be enforced and honored, not an employee\u2019s fixed term contract. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 543 A.2d 431. Specifically, the Court held, \u201cthe enforceability of an employment contract on the successor local municipal utilities authority ... is a matter governed by the Fiscal [Control] Law, and under that law, the assumption of such contracts is not mandated but is remitted to the sound governmental discretion of the Authority, subject, of course, to the exercise of that discretion in good faith for legitimate governmental purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 543 A.2d 431. Justices Clifford and Stein dissented. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 543 A.2d 431. They would have affirmed the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment \u201csubstantially for the reasons set forth in [its] majority opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 543 A.2d 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Subsequent decisions have interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stone </em>as standing for the proposition that \u201c[e]ven when a governmental agency has the statutory authority to enter into a fixed term employment contract, it still in some circumstances may abolish the position in order to promote economy and efficiency in governmental operations.\u201d <em>Walsh v. State, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 17 n. 4, 674 A.2d 988 (App.Div.1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>595, 689 A.2d 131 (1997); <em>see also DiPaolo v. Passaic Bd. of Freeholders, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 493, 731 A.2d 519 (App.Div.1999), <em>aff'd, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>572, 745 A.2d 540 (2000); <em>Geraghty v. Berkeley Heights Tp., </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 357, 613 A.2d 497 (Law Div.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 613 A.2d 485 (App.Div.1992); <em>see also Voges v. Borough of Tinton Falls, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>279, 287, 633 A.2d 566 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>135 <em>N.J. </em>466, 640 A.2d 848 (1994). As argued by plaintiffs, perhaps that is too broad a reading of the Court\u2019s actual holding, which to a large extent was grounded in an interpretation of the Fiscal Control Law. We nevertheless note that in a somewhat related context, it is a well-established principle that a tenured civil service position may be abolished for reasons of economy as long as it is done in good faith. <em>See City of Cape May v. Coldren, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 6, 746 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.2000); <em>McCartney v. Franco, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 297, 209 A.2d 329 (App.Div.1965); <em>Greco v. Smith, </em>40 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 189, 122 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1956); <em>Stone v. Camden Cty., </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 438, 435 A.2d 143 (Ch.Div.1981). Similarly, it has long been recognized that tenured teacher positions may be abolished for reasons of economy. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:28-9; <em>see also Old Bridge Tp. Bd. of Educ. v. Old Bridge Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>523, 531, 489 A.2d 159 (1985); <em>Carpenito v. Board of Educ., </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>522, 531, 731 A.2d 538 (App.Div.1999). While these decisions are by no means on point, they are premised on the principle that governmental efficiency and economy may in some circumstances trump private contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We hold that the UCUA lawfully terminated plaintiffs\u2019 fixed term contracts in a good faith effort to deal with the unprecedented financial crisis it confronted. Our conclusion comports with the Fiscal Control Law. It also advances the important public policy of assuring the financial integrity of local authorities. And finally, our holding advances the interests of taxpayers who should not be required to fund the salaries of unnecessary public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining arguments are essentially derivative of their principal claim that the UCUA acted unlawfully in discharging them \u2014 an argument that we have rejected. We merely add that we find no merit in their additional contentions. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
