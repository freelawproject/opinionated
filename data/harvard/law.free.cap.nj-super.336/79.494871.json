Peiffer, II. She sustained injuries when the motorcycle collided with a vehicle owned by Kenneth Udowiczyk and operated by Natalie Vacca. Owens and her mother, Carol Jean Powell, instituted suit against Peiffer and Vacca. They alleged that Peiffer\u2019s and Vacca\u2019s negligent operation of their vehicles proximately caused their collision and her resulting injuries. They also alleged that Peiffer negligently and carelessly \u201cprovided and entrusted\u201d to Owens a defective, \u201cunapproved\u201d and \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d helmet, which Owens was wearing at the time of the accident, resulting in her \u201cenhanced personal injuries.\u201d Peiffer had purchased the \u201cdefective\u201d helmet several days before the accident and had given it to Owens.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Plaintiffs settled with Vacca and Udowiczyk for $250,000. Vac-ca\u2019s automobile insurance carrier paid its policy limits of $100,000 as part of the settlement. Plaintiffs filed this declaratory judgment action against defendant Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company of New Jersey (PRUPAC) which provided homeowner\u2019s coverage to Peiffer at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">The policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>If a claim is made or suit is brought against any insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies, we will:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">a. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">b. provide a defense at our expense____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">An exclusion under the policy provides that \u201c[w]e do not cover bodily injury or property damages ... arising out of ... the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of any ... motor vehicle.... \u201d The motorcycle in question falls within the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as defined in the policy. Plaintiffs claim that the act of \u201cnegligently or recklessly providing the helmet to Plaintiff\u2019 constituted a covered act.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">On the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, finding that \u201cthe accident in question was a motor vehicle accident, whether the injuries were expected or enhanced, the injuries arose out of the use of a motor vehicle.\u201d Acknowledging that there may be instances where there may be concurrent coverage under an automobile and homeowner\u2019s policy, the court nevertheless found that this was not such an instance because \u201ca non-party vehicle related cause\u201d did not contribute to or enhance the damages suffered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the negligent act of providing and entrusting the motorcycle helmet to Owens \u201cis a separate and distinct tort from any negligence associated with operating the motor vehicle.\u201d Thus, concurrent coverage must be provided under Vacca\u2019s automobile policy and PRUPAC\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy issued to Peiffer. We reject the contention and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">We have construed the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 in this context in a broad and comprehensive sense to mean \u201coriginating from\u201d or \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 the use of the automobile. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Cos., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 38, 312 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-11\">[T]here need be shown only a substantial nexus between the injury and the use of the vehicle____The inquiry should be whether the negligent act which caused the injury, although not foreseen or expected, was in the contemplation of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>to the insurance contract a natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the automobile ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Generally, the \u201carising out of\u2019 language in automobile and homeowner\u2019s policies \u201cis mutually exclusive and that, as used in the homeowner\u2019s policy, is specifically designed to exclude the coverage provided under language in the standard family automobile policy for injuries arising out of the use of the motor vehicle insured thereunder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41-42, 312 A.2d 664. Nevertheless, relying on <em>Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 607 A.2d 138 (1992), plaintiffs argue for concurrent coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\"><em>Salem </em>involved a carrier\u2019s duty to defend under a homeowner\u2019s policy where the plaintiff, a minor, consumed alcoholic beverages provided by the insured and was thereafter injured while operating the insured\u2019s all-terrain vehicle (ATV). <em>See Salem Group v. Oliver, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265, 267, 590 A.2d 1194 (App.Div.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>1, 607 A.2d 138 (1992). The Court held that the carrier owed a duty to defend against the fifth count of plaintiffs complaint charging social-host liability. 128 <em>N.J. </em>at 3, 607 A.2d 138. The Court found that the carrier had a general obligation to defend against the social-host liability claim despite the fact that \u201coperation of the all-terrain vehicle ... constitutes an additional cause of the injury\u201d to plaintiff. <em>Ibid. </em>It distinguished cases which held that claims of negligent supervision or entrustment of a vehicle fall within the \u201carising out\u201d exclusion under the homeowner\u2019s policy, <em>id. </em>at 4-5, 607 A.2d 138, observing that \u201c[tjhose opinions proceed on the assumption that the negligent entrustment or supervision of a motor vehicle is intertwined with the ownership and operation of the motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In contrast:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">the serving of alcohol to a minor does not depend on the insured\u2019s ownership of a motor vehicle or its entrustment to another. One need not own a motor vehicle to serve alcohol to another. If [the insured] had provided alcohol to [the minor] knowing that [the minor] was about to operate [his] own vehicle or that of a third party, [the insured] could still be exposed to social host liability. In the present case, the fifth count of [the minor\u2019s] complaint does not allege negligent entrustment or supervision or any other act that depended on [the insured\u2019s] ownership or use of the ATV. Instead, that count alleges a basis for liability in addition to [the minor\u2019s] use of the ATV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>[Id, </em>at 5, 607 A.2d 138.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Unlike the facts in <em>Salem, </em>we are not dealing here with an independent, discrete act of negligence (such as service of alcohol to a minor) unrelated to the use or operation of a motor vehicle. Peiffer\u2019s entrustment of the \u201cdefective\u201d helmet to Owens was directly related to the use of a motor vehicle; it was provided to her with the expectation that she would wear it while occupying a moving motorcycle. The helmet had no other purpose. In fact, the operation or riding upon a motorcycle is prohibited unless the user is wearing a protective helmet. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-76.7. Therefore, while one \u201cneed not own a motor vehicle to serve alcohol to another,\u201d <em>Salem, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 607 A.2d 138, one must wear a protective helmet to ride on a motorcycle. Owens adhered to the mandate of the motor vehicle laws and sustained her injuries in an accident arising out of the use and operation of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The facts before us are more akin to cases where the insureds had negligently entrusted their vehicle to another. Indeed, in plaintiffs\u2019 underlying complaint against Peiffer, they claimed that he had negligently and carelessly \u201cprovided and <em>entrusted </em>\u201d to Owens the defective helmet. (Emphasis added). For example, in <em>Williamson v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>95, 492 A.2d 1028 (App.Div.1985), we found no coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy where the claim was that the insured negligently entrusted his vehicle to his son who struck plaintiff while operating the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 492 A.2d 1028. We observed that the father\u2019s negligent entrustment of the vehicle to his son \u201cwas an aspect of [the father\u2019s] ownership or use of the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99, 492 A.2d 1028. Because there would be no liability on the father\u2019s part for negligent entrustment but for the son\u2019s negligent use of the car, the negligent entrustment claim was subsumed in the acts of use and operation of the vehicle, acts clearly falling within the exclusion clause under the homeowner\u2019s policy. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 492 A.2d 1028. <em>Accord Allstate Ins. Co. v. Moraca, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>5, 7-10, 581 A.2d 510 (App.Div.1990); <em>Scarfi v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 515-16, 559 A.2d 459 (App.Div.1989); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>Home State Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 593, 713 A.2d 557 (App.Div.) (student\u2019s injuries from assault by other passengers on school bus arose out of ownership or use of motor vehicle), <em>aff'd, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>104, 726 A.2d 1289 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">So here. \u201c \u2018Coverage does not turn on the legal theory under which liability is asserted, but on the cause of the injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scarfi, supra, </em>233 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 519, 559 A.2d 459 (quoting <em>Fidelity &amp; Guar. Ins. Underwriters, Inc. v. McManus, </em>633 S.W.2d 787 (Tex.1982)). Proximate cause has a different meaning in insurance cases from the meaning applied in tort actions. The court does not concern itself with the question of culpability or why the injury occurred, \u201cbut only with the nature of the injury and how it happened.\u201d 43 Am.Jur.2d <em>Insurance, </em>\u00a7 463 at 526 (2d ed.1982). Here, the \u201ccause\u201d of the accident was rooted in the negligent operation or use of a car or motorcycle, or both. As such, a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d existed between the claimant\u2019s injuries and operation and use of a motor vehicle. <em>Westchester, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
