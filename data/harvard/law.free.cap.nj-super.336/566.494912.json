Roe possesses a \u201cCertificate of Exemption\u201d as a result of his service as a firefighter with the Mahwah Fire Department from August 1971 to December 1978. Plaintiff Harry D. Hansen, similarly, possesses a \u201cCertificate of Exemption\u201d as a result of his service as a firefighter with the Ridgefield Park Fire Department from August 1962 to August 1969. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-56, -59. Both plaintiffs, subsequent to obtaining their certificates, were employed by defendant Upper Saddle River; Roe as a fire subcode official and Hansen as a plumbing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>subcode official.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each had occupied their respective positions for more than three consecutive years and, thus, possessed tenure in those positions pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-64.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In January 1998, Upper Saddle River entered into an Interlocal Agreement with Hillsdale, pursuant to the Interlocal Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:8A-1 to -11, for the provision of construction code services through the Hillsdale Construction Code Office. One of the effects of this governmental action was the abolishment of plaintiffs\u2019 positions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the ensuing litigation that has generated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>this appeal, plaintiffs, as well as amicus, contend the abolition of their positions was violative of the tenure protections accorded them under the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-GO to -65, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Based upon the evidence presented during the nonjury trial, Judge Lawrence D. Smith concluded that Upper Saddle River\u2019s actions were entirely motivated by concerns for economy and efficiency and that plaintiffs\u2019 loss of their positions was an unfortunate by-product of good faith governmental action. He found no malice or personal animus towards either plaintiff. Most importantly, he found that the governmental actions challenged by plaintiffs were not taken for the purpose of terminating their services. In this respect, the judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">[Plaintiffs\u2019 positions with the Borough were not abolished and plaintiffs\u2019 employment were not terminated for any reasons related to plaintiffs themselves or their performance. Plaintiffs were not terminated by Upper Saddle River based on the thought that their salary could be avoided. They were not terminated for any reasons that focused on them as individuals. In fact, the Town was quite pleased with their services, although there may have been a few minor complaints....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">These findings are clearly supported by the record; indeed they are not disputed by plaintiffs. Rather plaintiffs and amicus focus upon <em>N.J.S.A </em>40A: 14-65 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\"><em>No </em>department of the State government, nor any board of chosen freeholders of a county, <em>governing body of a municipality </em>or board of education <em>shall abolish, </em>change the title or reduce the emoluments of <em>any office held by an exempt fireman having tenure therein, </em>for economy reasons or otherwise, for the purpose of terminating his services, <em>except in time of widespread economic depression or mandatory retrenchment, </em>but in any such case, the termination or reduction shall be made in the same ratio as in the case of other employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">It is the emphasized language upon which plaintiffs and the amicus rely. It is agreed that neither \u201cwidespread economic depression\u201d nor \u201cmandatory retrenchment\u201d existed here. They, therefore, read <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65 to preclude the abolition of plaintiffs\u2019 positions by virtue of the language \u201c[n]o ... governing body of a municipality ... shall abolish ... any office held by an exempt fireman having tenure therein ... except in time of widespread economic depression or- mandatory retrenchment.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>This reading of subsection 65, of course, ignores the phrase which immediately precedes the reference to economic depression and which states \u201cfor the purpose of terminating his service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Acts such as the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act, and its counterpart for war veterans, the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:16-1 to -6, are designed \u201cto remove governmental employees from the shifting political currents in order to ... protect those who also give additional service without compensation to their communities.\u201d <em>Smith v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Bergen, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 238, 353 A.2d 153 (Law Div.1976), <em>aff'd, </em>146 <em>N.J.Super. </em>45, 368 A.2d 964 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>74 <em>N.J. 266, 377 A.2d 671 (1977). </em>It has <em>consistently been recognized, </em>however, that governmental bodies \u201cacting in good faith and in the public interest, ha[ve] the power to abolish ... offices ... [This] is too firmly settled to admit of doubt.\u201d <em>Doyle v. Town of Secaucus, </em>10 <em>N.J.Misc. </em>334, 335, 159 A. 399 (Sup.Ct.1932), <em>aff'd, </em>110 <em>N.J.L. </em>62, 163 A. 893 (E. &amp; A.1933). <em>See Reck v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of N. Bergen, </em>110 <em>N.J.L. </em>173, 177, 164 A. 468 (E. &amp; A.1933); <em>Geraghty v. Township of Berkeley Heights, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>350, 357, 613 A.2d 497 (Law Div.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 613 A.2d 485 (App.Div.1992). <em>Cf. Miskowitz v. Union County Util. Auth., </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>183, 196, 764 A.2d 455 (App.Div.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">For as long as the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act in its various forms has been in effect, the protections accorded thereunder have never been applied to prevent a <em>bona fide, </em>good faith governmental action, the coincidental effect of which may be the abolition of a position held by an exempt fireman who otherwise would be protected from termination. That is to say, the long-standing and consistent enforcement of the protections accorded by the various provisions of the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act has always been in the context of governmental action ostensibly labeled for economy or other good faith basis but which, in fact, has been aimed at removing the exempt fireman or veteran. <em>See Smith, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 238-39, 353 A.2d 153; <em>Maxwell v. Board of Comm\u2019rs </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number><em>of City of Wildwood, </em>111 <em>N.J.L. </em>181, 186, 168 A. 143 (Sup.Ct.1933), <em>aff'd, </em>113 <em>N.J.L. </em>404, 174 A. 709 (E. &amp; A.1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Nonetheless, focusing upon the previously underlined portions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65, plaintiffs and amicus posit that when the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act was enacted in a somewhat different form in 1938 and which for the first time included <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:47-66,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the predecessor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65, the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>intended to sharply curtail what amicus characterizes as the judicial \u201cgutting of the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act\u201d which it claims occurred between 1911 and 1938. The Legislature did this, contend plaintiffs and amicus, by way of the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:47-66 (now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65) that an exempt fireman who has obtained tenure in his or her municipal office pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:47-63 (now <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A14-64) may not have his or her job abolished for any reason short of widespread economic depression or mandatory retrenchment. Under this interpretation, abolishment of positions occupied by exempt firemen for reasons of \u201ceconomy or efficiency,\u201d that had been upheld under prior judicial interpretations of the 1911 Act, would not pass muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We do not think this was the Legislature\u2019s intent when the predecessor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65 was enacted in 1938. There is no illuminating legislative history to assist us. But the entire thrust of the protections afforded under the original 1911 Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act, as well as the subsequent 1938 enactment and the present 1971 recodification, was directed at an intended removal of an exempt fireman, whether as a direct dismissal or indirectly through the abolishment of a position where the sole purpose is to accomplish the removal of the protected exempt fireman. We are convinced <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:47-66 was simply a legislative acceptance of the proposition, as expressed for instance in <em>Maxwell v. Board of Comm\u2019rs of City of Wildwood, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J.L. </em>181, 168 <em>A. </em>143, that even if a municipal employer posits economy or other good faith reasons for the abolishment of a tenured exempt fireman\u2019s position, it cannot do so if the real object is to remove the individual. We consider the language relied upon by plaintiffs and amicus to have been added by the Legislature to provide for an exception to the prohibited illusory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>abolishment where \u201ctimes of widespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment\u201d exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">We recognize that, at first blush, such a reading of the statute might be considered somewhat irrational since it suggests that the Legislature in 1938 condoned bad faith abolishment of protected firemen in \u201ctimes of widespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment.\u201d At closer look, however, we are convinced there is an acceptable rationale for the \u201cwidespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment\u201d exception. Prior to that time, governmental abolishment of positions held by exempt protected employees had generated a good deal of litigation over whether the governmental action was prompted by a good faith motivation or simply to dispense with a particular otherwise protected employee. Given the severe economic crisis faced by governmental entities in the 1930\u2019s, and according such entities the assumption that they will ordinarily not act in bad faith, the Legislature may well have intended to preclude costly and unnecessary litigation over abolishment of positions held by protected employees in times of \u201cmandatory\u201d retrenchment. We do not think that is an unreasonable basis for the addition of the exception in the 1938 Act which otherwise continued the main focus of the various provisions of the Act, that is prohibition against abolishment of a position occupied by a protected fireman where the proffered economic or other good faith rationale was illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We will not assume that the Legislature\u2019s intent in 1938 was otherwise in light of the then existing longstanding judicial interpretation given the 1911 Act and the absence of an express legislative disavowal of that interpretation. <em>Greenfield v. Passaic Valley Sewerage Comm\u2019rs, </em>126 <em>N.J.L. </em>171, 176, 17 A.2d 489 (Sup.Ct.1941); <em>Bialkowski v. Borough of Ridgefield, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>354, 358, 287 A.2d 479 (Law Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>194, 293 A.2d 671 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>79, 299 A.2d 76 (1972) (\u201cIn light of the foregoing decisions it is evident that plaintiff herein could not claim tenure during good behavior under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:47-63. The language and context of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>64 do not reveal such a radical departure from the spirit of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:47-63 that plaintiff can now claim a different status.\u201d). As to the 1971 recodification, it has been recognized that the protection offered to exempt fireman certificate holders under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-60 to -65 is substantively the same as that provided under the predecessor 1938 version. <em>Muccio v. Cronin, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 320, 343 A.2d 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-65 proffered by plaintiffs and amicus is, indeed, a radical departure from the historical and longstanding judicial construction given the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act insofar as governmental actions prompted by good faith reasons such as economy or efficiency. Their construction is not facially evident, nor does it square with the additional 1938 language, \u201cso that it results in the termination of the services of said exempt fireman or the reduction in the emoluments therefor,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which precedes the reference to \u201cwidespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment\u201d, or the 1971 counterpart phrase \u201cfor the purpose of terminating his services.\u201d We, moreover, generally will read legislation sensibly rather than literally, particularly where such literalism results in a radical departure from existing precedent without express legislative intent to do so. <em>Smith v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of Bergen County, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 237-38, 353 A.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Not only is the construction proffered by plaintiffs and amicus a radical departure from the overall thrust of the various other sections of the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act, but it would result in a dramatic difference between exempt firemen qualifying for protection under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-65 and veterans who are accorded protections under the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>38:16-1 to -6. That Act contains no language comparable to the \u201cwidespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment\u201d language relied upon by plaintiffs and amicus in N.J.S.A 40A:14-65. There is no basis in the legislative history of either the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act or the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act to even hint that the Legislature intended to treat certain exempt firemen more favorably than veterans. Both statutes have judicially been considered \u201cequatable ... [in] form and substance.\u201d <em>Muccio v. Cronin, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 321, 343 A.2d 158. \u201cWhile there may be some minor variation in arrangement, phraseology and sentence structure between the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act and the Exempt Firemen\u2019s Tenure Act, these two statutes are clearly <em>in pari materia </em>and must be so construed in order to achieve a singular legislative purpose.\u201d <em>In re Fitzgerald, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 482, 457 A.2d 1208. No provisions of the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act have ever been read to prevent the abolishment of a protected veteran\u2019s position where the governmental action is \u201cfor reasons of efficiency or economy, in good faith.... \u201d <em>Moresh v. Bd. of Educ. of Bayonne, </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>105, 109, 144 A.2d 897 (App.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 and amicus\u2019 construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>4QA14-65 would give an Upper Saddle River subcode official who is a qualifying exempt fireman greater protection than that given nonexempt subcode officials in Upper Saddle River who do not qualify but who have otherwise obtained tenure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Had the Legislature so intended, surely it would have expressly so provided, as it has in other contexts. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-61b; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>11A:5-4,-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Furthermore, we note that from 1938 to 1971, when the Act was recodified to \u201celiminat[e] duplication and inconsistency,\u201d (Governor William T. Cahill, Conditional Veto of Senate Bill No. 626 (March 8, 1971)), we have found not a single case which has construed the protections afforded under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-60 to - 65, insofar as governmental good faith action that results in the incidental abolishment of a protected exempt fireman\u2019s position, any differently than under the 1911 Act. Thus, when the Legislature recodified the Act in 1971 using the same or substantially the same terms, we presume that, as in 1938, it adopted the theretofore judicial construction in the absence of legislative expression to the contrary. <em>E.g., Muccio v. Cronin, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 343 A.2d 158. <em>See In re Fitzgerald, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 457 A.2d 1208; <em>Bialkowski v. Borough of Ridgefield, supra, </em>118 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 358, 287 A.2d 479. Not only did the Legislature in 1971 not provide for a different construction, but the changes that were made further undercut plaintiffs\u2019 and amicus\u2019 position. The new phrase <em>\u201cfor the purpose </em>of terminating [the exempt fireman\u2019s] service,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which immediately precedes the \u201cwidespread economic depression and mandatory retrenchment\u201d language, makes even clearer that the protections under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-65 arise only in the event of a governmental objective to terminate the protected exempt fireman, even where ostensibly there is asserted a good faith rationale. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> Plaintiffs' appointment to these positions was pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-126a which provides in part that \"the appointing authority of any municipality shall appoint a construction official and any necessary subcode officials 1o administer and enforce the [Uniform Construction Code Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-119 to-141].\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b595-8\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-64 provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">Whenever an exempt fireman holds a ... municipal ... office ..., he shall hold such office during good behavior and shall not be removed unless for good cause after a fair and impartial hearing, provided he has or shall have served in said office for a term of 3 consecutive years....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A: 14-60 provides comparable tenure status to exempt fireman certificate holders occupying a state, county, municipal or school board \"office, position or employment\" for an indeterminate term.
