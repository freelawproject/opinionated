Burford, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>16, 746 A.2d 998 (2000); <em>State v. Austin, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 762 A.2d 1052 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Mosley, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 761 A.2d 130 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>512, 731 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1999). The case bears some similarity to <em>Burford, </em>where the Court held NERA inapplicable to one driving recklessly while attempting to elude the police. However, the facts here are significantly different. Defendant used his automobile intentionally, as a battering ram to try to move a police vehicle which had blocked him in to effect his arrest. Under those circumstances we are satisfied that, unlike <em>Burford, </em>the defendant was using his vehicle as a \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d Thus, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that NERA applies, and accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The case arose when two Newark police officers received a report of a stolen vehicle being driven from South Orange into Newark. Shortly thereafter, the officers saw a vehicle meeting the description of the stolen car, driven by a man subsequently identified as defendant. The police approached the vehicle, pulled across the road in front of it, and thus blocked its continued passage in the direction it had been moving. Defendant\u2019s vehicle then reversed and proceeded backwards at a high speed for several hundred feet before it turned right and headed away from the officers. The police pursued the vehicle which soon struck a tree. The police officers, in their vehicle, then approached the defendant\u2019s automobile and, as one of the officers described it, they pinned defendant against the tree, with the idea of preventing him from moving away. Defendant, however, proceeded to move his car rapidly, first into reverse and then into forward gear, striking the police vehicle, with the officers in it, in an attempt to move it out of the way so he could make his escape. Defendant continued those movements several times \u201ctrying to ram his way out of the block,\u201d but was unable to move the police car. Eventually, when defendant was no longer able to move his vehicle, some of the officers who had by then gotten out of their vehicles, were able to seize defendant and place him under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Defendant was indicted on eight counts, which included receiving stolen property, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7 and a charge of second degree eluding of the police, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b. Thereafter, he pleaded guilty to those counts under a plea agreement by which the other counts against him were dismissed, and defendant was to be sentenced to not more than five years in prison. The plea agreement also provided that at sentencing, the court would hold a hearing to determine whether NERA applied to the second degree eluding offense. Defendant was advised that if NERA did apply, he would be required to serve eighty-five percent of his sentence before being eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">At the hearing held by the trial court, the facts emerged essentially as set out above. The court concluded that NERA applied, defendant was sentenced accordingly, and he now appeals that sentence, alleging that the court erred in its NERA conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Application of NERA depends upon a finding that a defendant committed a first or second degree offense which is a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2a. The term \u201cviolent crime\u201d is defined in subsection d of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2 to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany crime in which the actor ... uses ... a deadly weapon.\u201d The term \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d is, in turn, defined in a second paragraph of subsection d as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">Any firearm or other weapon, device, instrument, material or substance, ... which in the manner it is used or is intended to be used, is known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Since defendant here was charged with second degree eluding of the police, the initial requirement of NERA \u2014 that the crime be one of the first or second degree \u2014 is obviously satisfied. The significant issue is whether the other qualifying NERA element'\u2014 that the offense be a \u201cviolent crime\u201d \u2014 has also been satisfied. The State claims it has because, in his attempt to elude the police, defendant used \u201ca deadly weapon.\u201d The deadly weapon, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>is said to be the automobile which defendant employed as a battering ram.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In <em>State v. Burford, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 746 A.2d 998, the Court noted that \u201cdeadly weapons\u201d clearly include firearms and other \u201cobjects that, by their nature, have no apparent use or purpose other than the infliction of death or serious bodily harm.\u201d However, said the Court, the term may also include \u201ca class of objects \u2018having a wide variety of lawful uses but ... which may take on the character of a deadly weapon\u2019 depending on the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from the Appellate Division decision in <em>State v. Burford, </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>360, 729 A.2d 52, which in turn quoted from <em>State v. Riley, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 147, 703 A.2d 347 (App.Div.1997). In dealing with that second \u201cclass of objects as deadly weapons,\u201d said the Court, the question of whether the object was used as a deadly weapon is \u201cin every case, entirely circumstantial' \u2014 that is, did a particular defendant possess a particular object at a particular time and in a particular situation with the intention of using it as a weapon.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In the case before it, the Court concluded that, although the defendant had driven his vehicle recklessly, he \u201cdid not possess the automobile with the intent to use it as a weapon ... \u201d, and thus he did not qualify for a NERA sentence. However, the Court added,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">On the other hand, an automobile can be used as a deadly weapon under certain circumstances; the most obvious example being where it is driven directly at a law enforcement officer who is positioned to stop the vehicle. Thus, there may be circumstances where an automobile can be used as a deadly weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 19, 746 A.2d 998.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">As noted, the facts here are critically different from those in <em>Burford. </em>Indeed, defendant\u2019s conduct falls squarely within the description in the Court\u2019s final comments in <em>Burford, </em>noting that there are cases when an automobile can be used as a deadly weapon, \u201cthe most obvious example being where it is driven directly at a law enforcement officer who is positioned to stop the vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>That is precisely what happened here. Defendant did not simply drive recklessly, as in <em>Burford. </em>Rather, the trial court found, and it is patently clear, that the defendant intention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ally drove directly at the police vehicle, with the officers in it, in an unsuccessful attempt to ram the vehicle out of his path so he could make his escape. Certainly, used in that manner, defendant\u2019s automobile constituted a \u201cdevice Tor] instrument ... which in the manner it [was] used ... [was] known to be capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d. The conduct falls squarely within the definition of a \u201cviolent crime\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, because defendant was using a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as that term is defined within the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Finally, we are satisfied that the procedure followed by the trial court here complied with the requirements set out in <em>Burford </em>and also those outlined in this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State v. Mosley, supra. </em>We also note that the substantive offense here included a necessary finding that defendant had created \u201ca risk of death or injury\u201d to others.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the employment of NERA is consistent with the requirement set out in <em>Mosley, </em>that defendant be convicted \u201ceither by a jury or by a guilty plea, of a crime one of whose elements is a counterpart to or inclusive of a NERA predicate fact.\u201d 335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159, 761 A.2d 130. The plea was to a crime which involved a counterpart to a \u201cNERA predicate fact\u201d an action which created \u201ca risk of death or injury.\u201d While the definition of the substantive offense itself did not necessarily implicate NERA, the subsequent hearing held by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>trial court established NERA\u2019s applicability by demonstrating defendant\u2019s utilization of the requisite \u201cdeadly weapon.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\"> We note lhat the trial court found the facts essentially as they are outlined above, but concluded that defendant had employed his vehicle for the purpose of damaging the police vehicle or injuring the police officers themselves. We find no basis for that conclusion as to defendant's intent, since it seems more likely that defendant had no particular intention to damage the vehicle or injure officers but was using his vehicle as a battering ram to move the police vehicle and make his escape. Under either hypothesis, however, with the police officers in the vehicle, we are satisfied that NERA applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> One is guilty of second degree eluding if he or she \"flees or attempts to elude any police or law enforcement [and] ... if the flight or attempt to elude creates a risk of death or injury to any person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
