This subsection shall also not apply to any person in his home who is of the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages who offers or serves or makes available an alcoholic beverage to a person under the legal age for consuming alcoholic beverages or entices that person to drink an alcoholic beverage in the presence of and with the permission of the parent or guardian of the person under the legal age for consuming alcoholic beverages if the parent or guardian is of the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">The issue before us is whether a juvenile can be adjudicated delinquent for violating the statute. We hold that he can.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The State alleges that D.J.F. served alcoholic beverages to other juveniles at his home, or allowed other juveniles to consume alcohol there. The trial judge dismissed the complaint,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">I reviewed STATE [v. ]HA[ARDE], 230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605[, 554 A.2d 872], and my reading of the case is that although the Appellate Division cited that part of Subsection (a) that states that \u201canyone\u201d who purposely or knowingly offers or serves alcohol to an underage person is in violation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">The Appellate Division then found that the Legislature intended that the statute apply to adults. The Court referenced the legislative history, which said that the purpose of the bill was to discourage drinking by persons under the legal age to consume alcohol by placing more responsibilities on adults.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">And the Court stated that the underlying purpose of the statute is to discourage drinking by persons under the legal age of 21, and \u2014 but is applied to prohibit all adults 18 years of age or older.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">They seem to imply that the statute does not apply to everyone, but only adults, and adults are defined as being individuals 18 years of age or older. So that was the way I interpreted the HA[ARDE] case, that it \u2014 anyone doesn\u2019t mean everyone; it means adults, and adults are 18 years of age or older.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">So I\u2019ll grant the defendant\u2019s \u2014 pardon me, the juvenile\u2019s motion to dismiss Count ].<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Because the statute provides that \u201canyone\u201d who violates its provisions is guilty of a disorderly persons offense, we could rest our determination on the plain meaning of the statute, <em>see Board of Chosen Freeholders of Morris County v. State, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>565, 576, 732 A.2d 1053 (1999); <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hosp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 418, 730 A.2d 327 (1999); <em>State v. Butler, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>220, 226, 445 A.2d 399 (1982), and the acknowledged principle that the violation of a statute by a juvenile constitutes an act of delinquency. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-23 which expressly provides that \u201c \u2018delinquency\u2019 means the commission of an act by a juvenile which if committed by an adult would constitute ... (b) [a] disorderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>persons offense ...\u201d The same section of the Code of Juvenile Justice, in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-23, excepts certain statutes from its purview. Specifically, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-23 provides that the violation of certain statutes, by juveniles, does not constitute an act of \u201cdelinquency.\u201d However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-17 is not one of those excluded statutes. Given the longstanding New Jersey law that a statutory violation, which would constitute a crime, disorderly persons offense or penal statute also constitutes \u201cdelinquency\u201d (as more detailed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-23), we cannot attribute to the Legislature any intent to provide otherwise in this case absent a clear expression to the contrary, such as by inclusion of an exception in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-23, by making the penal violation subject to a particular age or age disparity, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The juvenile contends that this case is different because a sponsor of the bill made a specific statement that the statute was designed \u201cto discourage drinking by persons under the legal age to consume alcoholic beverages by placing more responsibility on adults.\u201d The trial judge agreed with the juvenile, relying upon <em>State v. Haarde, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>605, 554 A.2d 872 (App.Div.1989), which referred to that statement in holding that the statute \u201capplied to prohibit all adults 18 years of age and older from serving alcoholic beverages to underage persons,\u201d notwithstanding that he or she was under the legal drinking age. <em>Id. </em>at 608, 554 A.2d 872.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-17 (Gann 2000-01). However, holding that the statute applies to someone eighteen to twenty-one years of age is far different than holding that it does not apply to someone under eighteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The principal intent of the legislation was to deter teenage and under age drinking, clearly a problem particularly when understood in the context of the legal driving age which was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>recently raised from seventeen to eighteen. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>39:3-10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-17(a), adopted in 1985, makes express exceptions from its coverage. There is no reference to a juvenile therein. We thus hold that a juvenile, who purposely or knowingly serves or gives an alcoholic beverage to another juvenile, or to someone \u201cunder the legal age for consuming alcoholic beverages,\u201d can be prosecuted for \u201cdelinquency.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the complaint and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-12\"> Another count of the complaint charging a violation of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:29-3 remained open at the time of the State\u2019s appeal. The appeal was therefore from an interlocutory order, and leave to appeal was required. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>134, 137 n. 1, 336 A.2d 481 (1975). After a communication from the Clerk of this court, the State moved for leave to appeal, and we granted the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\"> With respect to the legal drinking age, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-15; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:17B-1b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> The statute referred to in <em>Haarde </em>became <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-17(a) when N.J.S.A. 2C:33-17(b) was adopted in L. 1995, <em>c. </em>31, \u00a7 1, eff.
