The Bank and its predecessor banks have served since 1968 as the trustee under a Trust Agreement created by Geoffrey Mears. Several years ago, Geoffrey Mears employed a housekeeper, Eileen Addonizio, who in early 1998 came under suspicion of attempting to exercise undue influence over him and trying to become the object of his donative wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>George Mears, the son of Geoffrey Mears, brought this action against Addonizio and joined the Bank as a defendant to prevent Addonizio from carrying out her alleged plan. The parties eventually settled the litigation and the Bank applied for approval of its commissions and attorneys\u2019 fees. George Mears joined the Bank as a formal party, but it was not then the object of allegations of wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">This appeal arises from the Chancery Division\u2019s denial of the Bank\u2019s application seeking the court\u2019s approval of payment to it of $19,067.43, which the Bank had already paid to itself from assets of the Trust. This total included requested trustee commissions of $2,904.74. The Bank requested the balance of $16,762.69 for attorneys\u2019 fees it incurred, much of it for the litigation. The Bank\u2019s application was opposed by Geoffrey Mears, who died in October 1999, after the court rendered its decision on the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In its oral decision on July 23,1999, the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">Fleet Bank took the position early in the case through its counsel, which was the correct one .. under the circumstances, that its obligation was to preserve the assets of the trust and await the determination of the disputes that have arisen between plaintiff, Mears, the younger!,] and defendant Mears, the elder, and Eileen Addonizio, the defendant who was ... allegedly unduly influencing the elder Mr. Mears.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">It found the Bank took \u201cno position with respect to the control dispute, which was whether the older Mr. Mears was being unduly influenced,\u201d and the Bank \u201cwas just sitting back waiting for the conclusion as to that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">The court noted that although \u201c[o]ne would have thought that that would have been the end of Fleet Bank\u2019s serious involvement in this case ...,\u201d the Bank, \u201cduring the life of this case thereafter, incurred approximately nineteen or $20,000 worth of counsel fees, which it now seeks to have paid <em>from </em>the trust____\u201d The court described as follows the two-part objection interposed to this fee request: (1) \u201cthe trust instrument does not permit for the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ment of such fees, according to its very terms,\u201d and (2) \u201ceven if it did,\u201d it was \u201cinappropriate for ... [the] Bank to incur such extensive legal fees in a ease where it essentially should have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the smoke to clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">With respect to the first objection, the judge noted that, under the terms of the trust instrument, the Bank was \u201centitled\u201d to employ attorneys \u201cfor the administration of the trust estate.\u201d He found, however, that \u201cin light of the peculiar circumstances of this case,\u201d the Bank had employed attorneys to engage in \u201clitigation beyond the administration of the trust estate,\u201d in that the Bank was named as a party in plaintiffs litigation simply \u201cbecause it is the trustee\u201d and \u201cholding the funds that were the res\u201d that plaintiff, defendant and Addonizio were \u201cfighting over.\u201d He concluded that the Bank was not administering the trust estate but rather \u201cmerely monitoring this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">With respect to the second objection, the court concluded, \u201ceven if it could be determined that the trust should bear the fees of Fleet Bank pursuant to the provision of the trust instrument,\u201d it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the Bank \u201cto incur possibly close to $20,000 in fees\u201d for \u201ca dispute that really does not involve them,\u201d and is \u201c... not the trust\u2019s problem.\u201d \u201cWhile it might have been fair and reasonable for the Bank ... [to] have appeared initially, to determine exactly where the case was going, and to state its position,\u201d the court indicated that it could not endorse a course of conduct in which the Bank \u201cwould have continued to expend so much time and energy on this case,\u201d by being \u201cinvolved every step of the way.\u201d He saw \u201cno apparent reason\u201d for the Bank having done so, \u201cconsidering its neutral position in the ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Addressing the efforts of the Bank\u2019s attorneys, the court noted that although there was \u201cno question and no doubt that the law firm did in fact do the work,\u201d the Bank must pay its own attorneys\u2019 fees in this litigation. The essence of the court\u2019s ruling was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">Fleet should bear its own fees. It was not open season on this trust, to hire an attorney and to direct that attorney to so deeply immerse themselves in this action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>that there would be in excess of 100 hours lawyer time invested in this matter, for the situation that merely required the monitoring of the litigation in the most superficial way, to simply await any direction from the Court as to what should happen with the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">So, for those reasons I find that the fees of the law firm will have to be borne by Fleet Bank. That is a matter between the law firm and Fleet Bank. They are not to be borne by the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">I understand that contrary to prior order, Fleet Bank already helped itself to the payment of a portion of those fees. Those should be reimbursed to the trust and the claim for attorneys\u2019 fees beyond that is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The Bank contends that the judge committed \u201cplain error\u201d in \u201cfailing to approve the accounting submitted by the trustee\u201d because \u201cthere was no opposition to the accounting.\u201d It asserts that the decision should be reversed and urges that the second intermediate accounting should be approved. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In fact, there was opposition to approval of the Bank\u2019s accounting request, specifically to the \u201cattorneys\u2019 fee component\u201d of the second interim accounting, which was \u201can integral part of the accounting itself.\u201d Even the Bank acknowledges this in these passages from its appellate brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">The defendant, Geoffrey Mears, filed opposition to the motion. His opposition to the accounting did not object to the accounting, except that the attorneys\u2019 fees should not be payable from the trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">Fleet moved on June 25, 1999, for approval of an accounting for the period April 25,1998 to June 10,1999____ Counsel for Geoffrey Mears opposed the motion, not the accounting, but only the portion of the motion dealing with approval of attorneys\u2019 fees to be paid from the trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">We thus reject as contrary to fact the Bank\u2019s contention that the judge committed plain error in failing to approve its second interim accounting because there was no opposition to that accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b505-17\">When we consider on appeal the Chancery Division\u2019s denial of a trustee\u2019s application to charge its attorneys\u2019 fees against the trust estate, we conduct our review, as did Judge Goldmann in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Bush v. Riker, </em>77 <em>N.J.Super. </em>243, 248, 186 A.2d 117 (App.Div.1962), pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard. We find no abuse of discretion by the Chancery Division here insofar as its ruling pertained to fees for the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As we understand the court\u2019s decision, it did not conclude that engaging in litigation could never be part of administration of the trust estate. Rather, it concluded that incurring \u201cextensive legal fees in a case\u201d that was \u201cnot the trust\u2019s problem\u201d could not be used to justify a determination \u201cthat the trust should bear fees of the Bank pursuant to the provision of the trust instrument\u201d authorizing the Bank to employ attorneys \u201cfor the administration of the trust estate.\u201d Thus, there is not an issue of fact as to whether the Trust Agreement authorizes the trustee to retain litigation counsel, who may be paid out of the trust estate. There was no question that such authority existed under appropriate circumstances. But there was a question whether, under the circumstances presented, it would be an appropriate exercise of the court\u2019s discretion to authorize such a payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Trustees are \u201centitled to the advice and help of counsel in the performance of their duties.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Baldi, </em>24 <em>N.J.Super. </em>228, 232, 93 A.2d 644 (Ch.Div.1952), but a trustee has \u201cno right to subject the trust fund unnecessarily to charges for counsel and attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Holcombe v. Executors of Holcombe, </em>13 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>413, 415 (Ch. 1861). <em>See </em>generally, Austin W. Scott, <em>III Scott on Trusts </em>\u00a7 188.4 (3d ed.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Here, the court noted that it was \u201cclear from the complaint and the amendments to it that defendant Fleet Bank was brought into the matter because obviously it is the party who would ultimately have to be directed by the Court to do one thing or the other in light of the allegations that have been raised.\u201d Finally, the court observed that on March 25, 1998, the Bank notified the court and the other parties that it was \u201ctaking no position with respect to the control dispute,\u201d that is, whether defendant and the trust beneficiary \u201cwas incompetent, or was being unduly influenced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Accordingly, because the Bank had \u201cidentified the issue and indicated to the court at the early stage of the case ... that it would stand by the sidelines and await further direction as to what should happen once these issues were resolved,\u201d the court found that should have been the \u201cend of Fleet Bank\u2019s serious involvement in this case.\u201d \u201cDespite that,\u201d the court found, the Bank, \u201cduring the life of this case thereafter,\u201d had incurred \u201cextensive legal fees in a case where it essentially should have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the smoke to clear from the dispute between the younger and elder Mr. Mears.\u201d To the judge, it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d for the Bank to incur \u201cpossibly close to $20,000 in fees when its expressed intent at the ... [outset] of the case ... was to merely ... await the outcome of the disputes between father and son.\u201d The court stated that it was \u201cnot satisfied, in light of the fee that is sought, that any fee should be awarded,\u201d and it determined that the \u201cfees of the law firm have to be borne by Fleet Bank.\u201d It does not escape us that the trustee was seeking to persuade the court to exercise its discretion favorably despite the court\u2019s knowledge that \u201ccontrary to prior order, Fleet Bank already helped itself to the payment of a portion of those fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The Bank also asserts that the \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees sought were reasonable\u201d and, therefore, it contends that the \u201cdetermination that the fees sought were unreasonable is a manifest abuse of ... discretion.\u201d The court made no such determination. Instead, it held that it was \u201cnot satisfied, in light of the fee that is sought, that any fee should be awarded.\u201d As we view the record, the court did not specifically reach the question of whether the \u201ctrustee\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees were reasonable,\u201d because it had decided that the Bank \u201cshould bear its own fees.\u201d On the particular facts of this case, we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of fees concerning the litigation and affirm that part of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The court commented that the Bank had, \u201cduring the life of this case ..., incurred approximately nineteen or $20,000 worth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>counsel fees.\u201d The court assumed that the total amount of $19,067.43 in \u201cAdministrative Expenses Chargeable to Principal\u201d stated in Schedule C of the second interim accounting was the total amount of \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d In fact, $2,904.74 of the $19,067.43 was trustee\u2019s commissions and $16,162.69 was attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Because the court erred in ordering the Bank to return $2,904.74 attributable to the Bank\u2019s claim for trustee\u2019s commissions, we vacate that portion of the court\u2019s order and remand to the Chancery Division for a determination of what, if any, commissions are properly allowable to the Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The Bank further asserts that a \u201ctrustee is entitled to have an attorney assist it in bringing accountings before the court,\u201d and, therefore, contends that the judge erred in failing to allow \u201cits attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d associated with \u201cbringing the accountings ... \u25a0before the court\u201d to be \u201cpaid from the trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The \u201cusual rule\u201d is one denying payment from the trust for \u201cfees to bookkeepers or lawyers for keeping trustee\u2019s books or for preparing an account,\u201d because such services are the \u201cresponsibility of the fiduciary.\u201d <em>In re Trust of Brown, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 494, 517 A.2d 893 (Law Div.1986). Consequently, \u201ca law firm representing a corporate fiduciary\u201d (as is the ease here) \u201ccannot be paid for estate <em>accounting </em>services\u201d from the trust, \u201cunless payment is charged against the fiduciary\u2019s commissions, <em>i.e., </em>paid by the fiduciary.\u201d <em>Ibid. See In re Wharton, </em>47 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 46, 135 A.2d 187 (App.Div.1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">A determination is thus required as to whether some of the Bank\u2019s legal services in connection with the accountings are fairly chargeable to the trust under the foregoing principles. The court found that the \u201cfees of the law firm will have to be borne by Fleet Bank\u201d because its attorneys were \u201cnot administering the estate, but ... merely monitoring this litigation.\u201d But it acknowledged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that some portion of the fees of the Bank\u2019s law firm must have been associated with legal services entailed in bringing the Bank\u2019s two interim trust accountings before the court for its approval, which in appropriate circumstances may be awardable as counsel fees out of the trust. Unfortunately, there was no determination as to the specific amount that was allocable to such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">If we could resolve this aspect of the dispute here and now we would do so, but we note that with respect to a similar issue, when it confronted the court in <em>In re Wharton, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 47-48, 135 A.2d 187, Judge Goldmann, writing for himself and for Judges Conford and Freund, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">Wc are, of course, aware ... that we may exercise original jurisdiction under <em>R.R. </em>l:5-4(a), and that it would not only be worthwhile but desirable for us to make findings of fact and adjudicate the merits of the appeal, thereby saving additional costs to the trust. However, we have no satisfactory factual basis to go on; there are too many voids which require further testimony or affidavits. In the <em>Bloomer </em>case the County Court, upon our remand, made specific findings and determined the exact basis for the award of counsel fees. This provided us, upon a second review of the propriety of the award, with a sound basis upon which to decide the case. <em>In re Bloomer\u2019s Estate, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>414, 129 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1957).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">These proceedings must therefore be remanded, with the direction that the County Court fully rehear the application for counsel fees, to the end that appropriate findings and an award thereon be entered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">We follow the same course for the same reasons. Accordingly, we vacate so much of the order appealed from as denied said attorneys\u2019 fees for work not attributable to the litigation and we remand to the Chancery Division for a determination as to whether any attorneys\u2019 fees of the Bank not so attributable should be paid by the Trust and, if so, the amount thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">We are satisfied that, except as to the issues of trustees\u2019 commissions and of attorneys\u2019 fees unrelated to the litigation, the court\u2019s reasons for its decision were sound and appropriate, and did not represent an abuse of discretion, and accordingly we affirm substantially for those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>In summary, we vacate so much of the order appealed from as denied trustee\u2019s commissions and denied an attorneys\u2019 fee for work unconnected with this litigation. We remand this matter to the Chancery Division for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion to determine whether any amounts for such commissions and fees should be awarded to the Bank for payment .out of the Trust, and if so, what amounts. We affirm all other aspects of the order. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
