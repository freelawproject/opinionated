(Mother) and P.R. (Father) are the birth parents of two children (S.R. and C.R.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Child and Family Services Division of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) first became involved with S.R. and C.R. (then\n   ages four and ten respectively) under Title 41, ch. 3, MCA, in October 2016 upon information that Mother and Father were using and distributing dangerous drugs (unauthorized prescription drugs, methamphetamine, and marijuana) in and out of the family home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Department initially worked with the parents on a voluntary basis under a voluntary protection plan but later filed district court petitions seeking emergency protective services (EPS), adjudication of the children as youth in need of care, and temporary legal custody (TLC). The petitions essentially alleged that the children were neglected, or in danger of neglect, based on the parents' illegal drug use and activity, and related concerns regarding the cleanliness of the family home. The Department's supporting affidavits further alleged that, to the best of the Department's knowledge and belief, the children were not Indian children as defined by the federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201901\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On December 21, 2016, Mother and Father respectively appeared, personally and through assigned counsel, for the initial show cause hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through counsel, Mother asserted that S.R. and C.R. may be Indian children for the purposes of ICWA based on Mother's belief that she may be eligible for enrollment in the Crow Indian Tribe. Father's counsel similarly asserted that the children may be eligible for tribal enrollment. The Department social worker responded that she had no reason to believe that the children were Indian children due to the parents' lack of cooperation and her assertion that the paternal grandparents had told her that neither parent was eligible for tribal enrollment. The Department thus moved the District Court to proceed on a non-ICWA basis pending further information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 The parents did not dispute the central allegations of neglect set forth in the Department's petitions. However, as an alternative to proceeding to youth in need of care adjudications and TLC, Mother requested that the court instead grant the Department temporary investigative authority (TIA) pending notice and receipt of conclusive Crow Tribe determination of the enrollment eligibility of the children. The Department opposed the interim TIA proposal, asserting that it\n   would serve no purpose other than to delay adjudication, TLC, and imposition of reunification-oriented treatment plans. The Department social worker nonetheless assured the court that she would meet with Mother after the hearing to discuss Mother's asserted Crow Tribe affiliation and then make inquiry as appropriate. The District Court thus rejected the interim TIA proposal and instead elected to proceed with adjudications as requested by the Department. By subsequent stipulation, the court granted the Department EPS, adjudicated the children as youth in need of care as defined by \u00a7 41-3-102(34), MCA, and granted the Department TLC for a period of six months. At the subsequent dispositional hearing on February 8, 2017, the court adopted and imposed Department-proposed treatment plans for the parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Four months later, on June 12, 2017, the Department petitioned the court to extend\n   TLC for an additional six months to allow the parents more time to work on their treatment plans.\n   <em>\n    Inter alia\n   </em>\n   , and without reference to what efforts, if any, the Department had made to obtain determinations of enrollment eligibility from the Crow Tribe, the Department's supporting affidavit again asserted that the children were not Indian children to the best of its knowledge. The District Court subsequently granted the requested extension of TLC at hearing on July 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In November 2017, the Department petitioned the court for termination of the parents' respective parental rights and permanent legal custody based on alleged treatment plan failure. At the termination hearing on February 28, 2018, the District Court admitted into evidence a March 2017 letter from the Crow Tribe informing the Department that the child C.R. was neither enrolled nor enrollable in the Tribe based on the fact that neither parent was enrolled or enrollable. The letter did not reference S.R. The Department social worker testified that the Department had received a separate letter from the Crow Tribe stating that S.R. was similarly not enrolled or eligible for tribal enrollment. However, the Department did not offer the purported letter into evidence at the hearing. The social worker explained that she did not bring the letter regarding S.R. to court because she thought the letter regarding C.R. would suffice since the children had the same parents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 On the evidence presented at hearing, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and judgments terminating the parents' respective parental rights to the children due to treatment plan failure and thus granted the Department permanent legal custody. In pertinent part, the written judgments indicated that the\n   court terminated the parents' respective parental rights based on the non-ICWA standard of proof (clear and convincing evidence) specified by \u00a7 41-3-609(1), MCA. The court's findings, conclusions, and judgments did not reference ICWA or include any finding regarding the tribal enrollment eligibility of either child.

I specially concur, however, because I agree with the Court's ultimate decision to affirm the District Court. Portions of the Court's legal analysis are unclear and overlook the fact that the interaction between ICWA and Montana's child abuse and neglect statutes, Title 41, chapter 3, MCA (Chapter 3), depends greatly on the specific facts of each case. I further disagree with the Court's application of the law in this case, specifically its unwarranted criticism of the Department's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b631 While not directly at issue here, the Court's general statements about which Montana proceedings constitute \"emergency removals\" and \"foster care placement proceedings\" under ICWA are confusing and may lead to misunderstanding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion, \u00b6 14. I therefore feel the need to clarify when ICWA's emergency removal exception applies to child abuse and neglect proceedings in Montana before addressing the specific facts of this case. The Court states that \"[e]xcept where not involving a temporary removal and placement of the child,\" an EPS proceeding is a \" 'foster care placement' proceeding.\" Opinion, \u00b6 14. The Court then clarifies in a footnote that \"[a]n emergency removal pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA,\"-the statute entitled, \"Emergency protective service,\" or \"EPS\"-\"is not an ICWA-defined 'child custody proceeding' subject to ICWA's pre-hearing tribal notice and kinship placement requirements.\" Opinion, \u00b6 14 n.9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b632 I agree with the Court's conclusion that EPS removals pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-301, MCA, are emergency removals that ICWA shall not be construed to prevent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201922\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's explanation is confusing, however, because the term EPS, and the various Montana statutes explaining EPS, encompass actions that are both emergency removals and foster care placement proceedings under ICWA. The point at which\n   an EPS removal pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-301(1), MCA, ceases to constitute an emergency removal under \u00a7 1922 varies from case-to-case. Once a foster care placement proceeding commences and the court knows or has reason to know that a child is an Indian child, the court should ensure the Department provides notice to the tribe and then wait the obligatory ten days from when the tribe received the notice before holding a foster care placement proceeding.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201912\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That ICWA requirement may not be construed, however, to limit the court's ability to make interim decisions to provide for a child's care on an emergency basis.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201922\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b633 Chapter 3 contains Montana's child abuse and neglect statutes. Relevant to the discussion here, Chapter 3 includes part 3, \"Protective Care,\" and part 4, \"Abuse or Neglect Proceedings.\" In many cases, the Department utilizes part 3's protective care statutes as a precursor to\n   part 4's abuse or neglect proceeding statutes. Part 3 provides for the emergency removal of a child in danger: if a Department social worker \"has reason to believe any child is in immediate or apparent danger of harm,\" she \"may immediately remove the child and place the child in a protective facility.\" Section 41-3-301(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b634 Those types of emergency removals are not limited by ICWA's notice and kinship placement requirements- \u00a7 1922 provides, \"Nothing in [ICWA] shall be construed to prevent the emergency removal of an Indian child ... from his parent ... or the emergency placement of such child in a foster home ... under applicable State law, in order to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.\" Accordingly, ICWA shall not be construed to prevent the emergency removal of a child in Montana under \u00a7 41-3-301(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b635 Within five working days of the emergency removal, the county attorney must file an abuse and neglect petition. Section 41-3-301(6), MCA. In many cases, a foster care placement proceeding, as defined by ICWA, will begin once the county attorney files that petition: \"\n   <em>\n    Proceedings\n   </em>\n   under [Chapter 3] must be initiated by the filing of a petition. A petition may request ... immediate protection and emergency protective services, as provided in 41-3-427.\" Section 41-3-422(1)(a)(i), MCA (emphasis added). If the circumstances of the case meet the definition of a \"foster care placement proceeding\" under ICWA, and if the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved in the proceeding, the case is subject to \u00a7 1912 's notice requirement-the court must ensure the Department notifies the child's tribe of the pending proceedings and wait the requisite ten days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b636 However, \u00a7 1922 's emergency removal exception does not necessarily end the moment the county attorney files a petition initiating a foster care placement proceeding. Section 1922 's emergency removal exception terminates \"when such removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201922\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shortly after the Department removes a child on an emergency basis pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-301(1), MCA, the county attorney must file a petition for immediate protection and EPS. Section 41-3-301(6), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b637 In many cases, the emergency removal and placement will still be necessary at that time to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. ICWA shall not be construed to limit the court's ability to continue to protect the child on an emergency basis after the county attorney initiates a foster care placement proceeding by filing a petition for immediate protection and EPS. The court may make decisions to ensure the child is protected and cared for after the\n   emergency removal or placement until the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201922\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That moment will be different in each case and is, by definition, not tied to the commencement of a foster care placement proceeding. ICWA does not limit the court's ability to make decisions while the removal or placement is still necessary to prevent imminent damage or harm to the child and the Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, creates confusion by failing to clearly identify the court's authority after an emergency removal.\n   \u00b638 Having clarified the way ICWA should apply in EPS removals in Montana, I turn to the facts of this case and take issue with how the Court applied the law. On October 11, 2016, the Department received a report expressing concerns with the parents' drug use and distribution, lack of child supervision, and the cleanliness of the family's home. The Department struggled to contact the parents for multiple days, and eventually spoke with them on October 18, 2016, after visiting S.R. at school. At that time, Mother and Father agreed to work with the Department on a voluntary basis and they both signed a protection plan. The Department placed the children in their paternal grandparents' care. Thereafter, the Department struggled to contact the parents and Father's drug test came back positive for amphetamines and methamphetamines. The Department tested the children's hair follicles for substances. S.R. tested negative but C.R. tested positive for opiates, methamphetamine, morphine, and amphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b639 On November 14, 2016, the Department filed a petition for EPS, adjudication of the children as youths in need of care (YINC), and TLC based on concerns about drug use, concerns that the parents were selling drugs out of the family home, and lack of contact with the Department to work on the voluntary protection plan. The court continued the show cause hearing once at Father's request but eventually held it on December 21, 2016. At the hearing, the parents stipulated to the children being found YINC but suggested TIA was more appropriate than TLC. The Department maintained it needed TLC to ensure the children's safety. The Department's social worker (Burk) testified about all of the events leading up to its request for TLC. Burk stated that TIA was inappropriate in this case because the Department did not need an investigatory period-it had already obtained enough information to demonstrate the children's circumstances required TLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b640 The Department asked Burk, \"Do you feel that ... return of the children to the home would create a substantial risk of harm to the\n   children?\" She responded, \"I do.\" Counsel further inquired, \"[D]o you believe that dismissal of the petition would create a substantial risk of harm to the children or would be a detriment to their physical or psychological well-being?\" Burk again responded, \"I do.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b641 The court first became aware of the possibility that the children could be Indian children when Father's counsel cross-examined Burk. He asked, \"Do you know whether either of the parents have any Indian descent?\" Burk responded that she had not yet asked the parents because of her inability to contact them but that the children's paternal grandparents indicated the children did not. When Mother's counsel questioned Burk, she inquired, \"[A]re you aware that [Mother] is eligible for enrollment in the Crow Tribe?\" Burk responded, \"I am not due to not being able to have that type of conversation with her,\" and then further explained her problems communicating with Mother. Burk further opined that TIA would be inappropriate in this case because it would not obligate the parents to follow through on requested improvements, whereas TLC would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b642 Mother's counsel subsequently argued that, because the children may be Indian children, ICWA may apply to the case and therefore the Department must provide active, not reasonable, efforts. Mother's counsel indicated Mother would stipulate to TIA in order to give the Department more time to investigate and follow-up on certain things. The Court asked counsel whether Mother was asserting that ICWA applied in this case and counsel responded, \"Yes, Your Honor. [Mother is] not enrolled in the Crow Tribe but she's eligible for enrollment. So, again, I think that there's always a process when ICWA possibly applies, when the Department investigates and confers with the Tribe, and I think that step needs to be taken.\" After asking more questions of the Department, the Court concluded, \"So the Department has not made efforts to determine whether or not ICWA applies at this point given that lack of communication, we haven't sent notices to the Tribe or Tribes at issue. That's a matter that would be resolved down the road if, in fact, the parents provided us with information or even an allegation that ICWA applies.\" Father's counsel stated that\n   the children were potentially eligible for tribal enrollment based on Mother's ancestry and that the Tribe needed to be notified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b643 The court summarized the evidence presented at the proceeding and stated it had significant concerns about drug presence, drug use, and possible drug distribution in the family home. The court concluded the environment was unsafe and unhealthy for the children and that, at that point, there was no need to further investigate the situation but, instead, the court needed to act to protect the children and work\n   with the parents to remedy the situation. The court adjudicated the children as YINC. It decided to not apply the ICWA standard at that time because there was no evidence that the children were enrolled or enrollable, noting that the only argument made at the show cause hearing was that Mother may be enrollable but was not enrolled. The court stated, \"We're going to need more information to see the connection that the children have with the Tribe and whether or not the connection is of a sufficient degree that the Tribe actually tells us they are enrolled or enrollable.\" The court instructed that, if it granted TLC, \"examination of the ICWA question is going to be a priority concern. There's been a suggestion that ICWA's applicable, and if, in fact, we actually have evidence of that, then we're probably going to have to reconvene .... At the present time, there's no evidence that that's the case with respect to these children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b644 The court then asked the Department if it wanted to proceed with a disposition hearing, the Department responded that it did, and neither parent requested the court continue the disposition pending ICWA's notice requirement. Instead, the parents asserted that TIA was more appropriate pending tribal notice. Burk testified again, stating that the Department would develop treatment plans and that, regarding the ICWA issue, she would send notifications to the Tribe that day. The court ultimately granted the Department TLC for six months and specifically found that dismissing the petition at that time would \"create an unreasonable risk of continued abuse or neglect of the children.\" The court stated, \"With respect to the ICWA issue, ... the parents are obligated under statute to talk with or to work with the Department, to provide information about the children's backgrounds .... This includes any information that would relate to the children's Indian heritage and their enrollment in or enrollability in a Native American Tribe.\" The court directed the parents to \"specifically cooperate and provide to the Department information about what Tribe or Tribes are at issue, what the status of the children are as far as the parents' know, any contact information the parents may have with representatives of the Tribe or Tribes, and any other corollary information that will assist in that determination.\" The court concluded, \"I do want those ICWA investigation ... efforts to be part of the Department's immediate exercise of temporary custody over the children.\" Following the hearing, the Department sent notice of the pending case to the Crow Tribe. The Tribe received the notice and, in March 2017, notified the Department that the children were not eligible for enrollment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b645 The Court concludes the District Court abused its discretion when\n   it did not comply with ICWA's notice requirements before proceeding on from the show cause hearing. Opinion, \u00b6 23. I agree with the Court that as soon as the parents made the District Court aware of the possibility that the children were Indian children, the court needed to ensure that the Department provided notice to the Tribe as required by \u00a7 1912(a). However, the court was within its discretion to order TLC in the interim-it found, based on substantial credible evidence, that returning the children to the parents would subject them to an unreasonable risk of continued abuse or neglect. ICWA cannot be construed as to prevent the court's authority on an emergency basis, and I believe the Court errs when it finds the District Court abused its discretion by ordering TLC at the show cause hearing. The District Court was not precluded from making decisions to ensure the children remained safe, even if the Tribe had not yet received notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201922\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b646 I am further troubled by the Court's unnecessary criticism of the Department's actions. First, the Court criticizes the Department for not giving enough consideration\n   to whether there was reason to know the children were Indian children at the show cause hearing. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Review of the show cause hearing transcript, however, demonstrates that both the Department and the District Court thoroughly considered whether ICWA applied in these proceedings. The District Court further emphasized that the Department's first priority needed to be an ICWA inquiry, and the Department assured the District Court that it would be. Second, the Court views the Department's actions as perpetuating an attitude that it had \"no affirmative duty to make further inquiry or provide tribal notice and inquiry when parents are not cooperative.\" Opinion, \u00b6 22. Review of the record however, does not support the Court's recitation of the facts-the Department expressed frustration with the parents' lack of cooperation but nonetheless affirmatively stated at the show cause hearing that it would send the Tribe notices that day, and it did so. Child abuse and neglect cases present sensitive, emotionally-charged, and complicated issues. This Court should not be unnecessarily critical of the Department's actions when the record demonstrates the Department's respect for and consideration of the applicable laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b647 While identifying errors that I do not, the Court ultimately affirms the District Court on the basis that its errors were harmless.
