Concluding that the district court (1) properly determined that there exists no OMA privilege in New Mexico, and (2) did not abuse its discretion in determining that Sanders failed to meet her burden of establishing the applicability of the attorney-client privilege, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    The Historical Facts Underpinning the Underlying Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {2} The underlying case between two media outlets-the Albuquerque Journal and KOB-TV, LLC (collectively, Plaintiffs)-and the Albuquerque Public Schools (APS) Board of Education (the Board) and APS's records\n   custodian Rigo Chavez (collectively, Defendants) is an enforcement action under the New Mexico Inspection of Public Records Act (IPRA), NMSA 1978, \u00a7\u00a7 14-2-1 to -12 (1947, as amended through 2018) (the IPRA action). In the IPRA action, Plaintiffs seek to enforce their right to inspect public records that Defendants have withheld from inspection based on claims that those records are exempt from inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {3} The IPRA action was borne of the events surrounding and immediately preceding the abrupt resignation of Winston Brooks from his position as APS Superintendent on August 15, 2014-just two days after the start of the 2014-2015 school year-and the $350,000 buyout of Brooks' contract that the Board approved as part of Brooks' Resignation and Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement). On August 11, 2014, the Board met in a closed session to discuss a report prepared by attorney Agnes Padilla (the Padilla Report, or Report) at the request of Board President Analee Maestas. The Report was commissioned after Maestas and Board member Martin Esquivel became aware of \"misconduct allegations involving [Brooks]\" and what they later described as the possibility of litigation against APS resulting therefrom. The closed meeting was convened for the purpose of \"discuss[ing] a limited personnel matter regarding [Brooks'] performance, evaluation, improvement plan, reports or concerns received by the president of the [B]oard or [members of the] Board of Education related to [Brooks], [Brooks'] contract, and possible disciplinary action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {4} During the closed meeting, Brooks and his attorney Maureen Sanders waited in a room separate from where the Board was meeting with its attorney, Tony Ortiz. More than once during the closed meeting, Ortiz left the Board to speak with Brooks and Sanders. Four days later, the Board and Brooks entered into the Settlement Agreement. Included as part of the Settlement Agreement was a reference letter for Brooks signed by Maestas and containing a positive review of Brooks' tenure as APS Superintendent, noting the Board's appreciation for his service, and \"wish[ing] him well in his future endeavors.\" The Settlement Agreement provided that APS \"will maintain [the] reference letter for Brooks in his personnel file\" and \"[i]f contacted by anyone seeking references for Brooks ... [the letter] will be the only official reference provided by [APS].\" It further provided that APS \"shall maintain ... the [Padilla R]eport ... in a file separate from Brooks' personnel file, and it shall not be released to anyone, including potential future employers in response to a request for Brooks' personnel file.\" The Settlement Agreement contained no discussion of the reasons underlying the decision to prematurely terminate Brooks' contract with APS and provided only that \"[n]othing in this [a]greement or in its execution admits wrongdoing of any kind by either party\" and that the agreement was \"mutually entered for the benefit of each party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs' IPRA Requests and Subsequent Enforcement Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {5} Between August 7 and September 3, 2014, Plaintiffs made a combined seven written requests of APS to inspect, among other public records, the Padilla Report and \"documents referencing any complaints or allegations of misconduct regarding ... Brooks.\" Defendants provided for inspection of certain requested records, denied the existence of any responsive records to other requests, and denied certain requests based on claimed exemptions under IPRA. Plaintiffs thereafter filed the IPRA action, alleging that \"Defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of showing that the documents that Plaintiffs[ ] requested were completely exempt from disclosure under any of the exceptions enumerated in Section 14-2-1.\" In defending against the IPRA action, Defendants argued that the records withheld, including the Padilla Report, are protected by (1) the attorney-client privilege, (2) the attorney work-product doctrine, and/or (3) IPRA's exception for \"letters or memoranda that are matters of opinion in personnel files.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-2-1(A)(3), (6), (8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs' Attempt to Prove Waiver of Privilege as to the Padilla Report Through Sanders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {6} During the course of litigating the IPRA action, Plaintiffs were allowed to depose\n   Padilla, Maestas, and Esquivel in order to adduce evidence relevant to the central issue of Defendants' claim that the Padilla Report is attorney-client privileged. Based on information learned in those depositions indicating that either the Padilla Report itself or its substance may have been disclosed to third parties, including possibly Sanders, Plaintiffs subpoenaed Sanders to produce \"[a]ll documents, records, or things reflecting or recording any communications from [APS] or any APS representative, agent or attorney concerning any complaints or allegations of misconduct regarding Winston Brooks or [his wife] Ann Brooks made to APS or any member of the APS Board ... after January 1, 2014.\" Sanders objected to the subpoena based in relevant part on a claim of attorney-client privilege. In her objection, Sanders explained that \"[t]he only documents responsive to the subpoena are notes [she] made ... at a meeting she attended with Tony Ortiz ... and Winston Brooks ... on August 11, 2014.\" She further explained, \"[t]here are four pages of notes from that meeting and two pages might be viewed as responsive to the [s]ubpoena.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {7} Plaintiffs also sought to depose Sanders to determine if conversations she had with various APS attorneys-particularly, her conversations with Ortiz on August 11 during the closed meeting-effected a waiver of the attorney-client privilege asserted by Defendants as to the Padilla Report. At her deposition, Sanders testified that she \"represent[s Brooks and his wife] in matters that are related to ... the employment and termination of employment of Winston Brooks\" as superintendent of APS. She acknowledged that she had at least one conversation with APS attorney Art Melendres-whom she described as Brooks' attorney \"during the time that he was [S]uperintendent\" and continuing \"after his employment ended in several matters that were pending\"-at some point before the August 11 Board meeting, though she refused to describe the conversation based on a claim of attorney-client privilege. Regarding what occurred on August 11, Sanders explained that she accompanied Brooks to the Board meeting because \"there was an agenda item involving ... Superintendent Brooks' employment matters.\" She further explained that she and Brooks were asked to \"sit in a room next to the boardroom\" and that on more than one occasion, Ortiz left the boardroom and came to speak with her and Brooks. Sanders could not recall exactly how many times Ortiz came to speak with them during the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {8} Sanders declined to answer Plaintiffs' questions regarding the conversations she had with Melendres and Ortiz, including whether Ortiz had described to her any portion of the Padilla Report, which she stated she neither received a copy of nor reviewed in full or in part. Specifically, she refused to answer the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 \"What do you remember about [the] conversation [with Art Melendres]?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 \"When you were talking with Tony Ortiz at the time of the Board meeting, on or about August the 11th, ... did you discuss a report or an investigation done by Agnes Padilla?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 \"Did Agnes[ Padilla's] name come up?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 \"Did Mr. Ortiz describe any portions of th[e Padilla R]eport to you?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"[W]hen you were meeting with Mr. Ortiz at the time of the Board meeting, did you discuss the [Padilla R]eport in any way?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 \"Do [the] notes [you took during your conversations with Ortiz] include information communicated to you by Tony Ortiz?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"When did discussions first begin between APS and Mr. Brooks or you regarding the possibility that he might resign?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As the basis for refusing to answer these questions, Sanders asserted that her communications with Melendres and Ortiz were protected by the attorney-client privilege because her client, Brooks, \"[a]s superintendent of APS[,]\" shared a \"common interest\" with Melendres' client, APS, and Ortiz's client, the Board, making their communications privileged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She alternatively refused to answer\n   questions \"on the basis of ... open meetings confidentiality.\" When Plaintiffs attempted to explore the basis of Sanders' claim of a common interest privilege, Sanders additionally declined to answer questions regarding when the purported common interest arose and whether she considered APS \"an adverse party\" to Brooks during the course of her representation of Brooks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Sanders' Testimony and Sanders' Claims of Privilege\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {9} Plaintiffs thereafter filed a motion to compel Sanders to answer the questions she had refused to answer during her deposition regarding her communications with APS's attorneys\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to produce the notes she took during the August 11 meeting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Noting that they took Sanders' deposition to determine only \"if APS waived ... asserted privileges by sharing the [R]eport or its contents with Ms. Sanders or Mr. Brooks[,]\" Plaintiffs argued that the privileges asserted by Sanders-an OMA privilege and/or the attorney-client privilege-did not either exist or apply, respectively, under the facts of the case to shield from disclosure that which \"APS's attorneys communicated to [Sanders].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {10} In responding to the motion, Sanders first argued that \"executive session communications are not discoverable\" based on the OMA's allowance for public bodies to meet in closed session to discuss \"limited personnel matters.\" According to Sanders, \"[a]though [she] and Superintendent Brooks were in a separate room [during the August 11 closed Board meeting], they were essentially a part of the executive session during their communications with Mr. Ortiz.\" Sanders contended that \"[a]s such, the communications are not subject to the public's right to know about the discussions at an open meeting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {11} Sanders next expanded upon her claim that her communications with APS's attorneys are protected from compelled disclosure under the attorney-client privilege due to a common interest shared by APS and Brooks. With respect to Melendres, Sanders noted that \"Art Melendres of the Modrall Law Firm has represented APS for years, including the entire time Winston Brooks was Superintendent[, and t]he Modrall Law Firm continued to represent Superintendent Winston Brooks in other APS[-]related matters after his employment with APS ended.\" With respect to Ortiz, Sanders asserted that \"[f]rom August 11, 2014 to August 15, 2014[,] when a Settlement Agreement was executed Mr. Ortiz and Ms. Sanders were representing two constituents of APS: its Board and its Superintendent.\" Sanders thus contended that any communications between her and APS attorneys were privileged because New Mexico's attorney-client privilege extends to communications made \"between the client or client's lawyer and another lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest[.]\" Rule 11-503(B)(3). Sanders argued that \"[i]n this case, APS and Superintendent Brooks had a commonality of interest which protected the confidential conversations to which Ms. Sanders was a participant before, during and after the August 11, 2014 Board meeting.\" According to Sanders, that common interest was \"identified in the [a]genda\n   for the August 11, 2014 Board meeting\" and \"related to [Brooks'] performance, evaluation, improvement plan, reports or concerns received by the President of the Board related to [Brooks], his contract or possible disciplinary action.\" Based on that, Sanders concluded that \"the requirements of attorney-client privilege under the common interest rule have been met as to the communications involving Ms. Sanders and APS attorneys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {12} In their reply, Plaintiffs argued that Sanders had \"offer[ed] no evidence that APS and Mr. Brooks had decided on any joint effort or strategy, much less that they shared an\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   legal interest in regard to the communications from APS's attorneys.\" Plaintiffs also argued that Sanders had failed to prove \"that the communications at issue were confidential\" and \"were intended to be confidential at the time they were made.\" Plaintiffs pointed out that Sanders and APS's attorneys \"had no written agreement to maintain the confidentiality of [their] communications nor did any person assert any promise or expectation of confidentiality.\" Thus, Plaintiffs contended that Sanders had not met her burden of proving that the attorney-client privilege applied to shield from disclosure her communications with APS's attorneys and asked the district court to grant their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {13} Following a hearing, the district court granted Plaintiffs' motion to compel Sanders to answer questions and produce in part the notes she took during the August 11 meeting. The court did so after concluding that (1) \"[n]o Open Meetings Act [p]rivilege exists in New Mexico[,]\" and (2) it \"has not been provided with a factual basis to find that there was a common interest between APS and ... Brooks[ ] between August 11 and August 15, 2014. Presentation of counsel is insufficient to establish that basis.\" The district court thus ordered Sanders to (1) \"respond to the questions asked her during her deposition\" and (2) \"produce the notes of what Mr. Ortiz told Ms. Sanders and Mr. Brooks regarding the Padilla [R]eport and other documents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {14} On appeal, Sanders advances the same arguments she made below: (1) that communications regarding \"limited personnel matters\" that occur during an executive session of a public body are not discoverable based on the OMA, and (2) that her communications with APS's attorneys and any notes she took on August 11, 2014, are protected by the attorney-client privilege based on the common interest they shared in the communications. She effectively argues that the district court erred in concluding that no privilege applies under the facts of this case to protect her communications with APS's attorneys from discovery. Defendants, who filed a brief in support of Sanders' appeal, submit that this appeal involves two additional issues: (1) whether \"an employer waive[s] IPRA protection of a personnel report regarding an employee by discussing that report with the subject employee\" and (2) whether \"a plaintiff in an IPRA case [is] permitted to ask witnesses about the document that may divulge the content of the protected document[.]\" We disagree with Sanders on the merits of her arguments and with Defendants that this appeal involves any issues other than those advanced by Sanders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {15} We review discovery orders and initial determinations regarding the applicability of privileges for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe Pac.

While acknowledging that the OMA \"does not specifically address whether the discussions occurring within an executive session are immune from discovery for litigation purposes[,]\" Sanders asks this Court to conclude that allowing discovery of her conversations with Ortiz will \"impair the public policy decision made by the Legislature\" to allow sensitive, private personnel matters to remain confidential. She reasons that the OMA, \"by allowing executive sessions related to limited personnel matters, certainly indicates a strong public policy to protect the confidentiality of those deliberations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {18} The problem with Sanders' argument is that it fails to recognize that \"confidentiality\" and \"privilege\" are \"legally distinct concepts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Notably, those assertions, themselves, were vague, unclear, and not entirely consistent. In responding to Plaintiffs' motion to compel, Sanders merely cited the agenda for the August 11, 2014 Board meeting in identifying the common interest as \"relat[ing] to [Brooks'] performance, evaluation, improvement plan, reports or concerns received by the President of the Board related to [Brooks], his contract or possible disciplinary action.\" Then, at the hearing on Plaintiffs' motion to compel when asked by the district court to \"tell [it] what the common interest is\" because the court did not understand it as presented, Sanders' counsel stated, \"The common interest is to work out a possible exit for ... Brooks. If ... both sides decided that it was in the best interest for him to leave, then they were working on that ... common interest.\" When pressed by the district court to explain the \"identical legal interest tied to [Sanders' and Ortiz's] communications[,]\" Sanders' counsel offered, \"I think that the identical legal interest is for both sides to be looking at whatever legal issues may exist with regard to working out this common goal to separate amicably.\" Sanders' counsel summed up the matter with, \"What's the common legal goal here? They're trying to make a plan.\" Ortiz, in joining Sanders to argue against the motion, described the parties' common interest as, \"You have a problem with an employee; you invite him in.

And she did not do so despite relative clarity in our law permitting privilege proponents to employ a variety of procedures-such as submission of a privilege log, an affidavit, an ex parte affidavit, live testimony, or some other means of demonstrating a factual basis for establishing the applicability of the privilege-to demonstrate the applicability of a privilege given the particular circumstances of a given case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pi\u00f1a\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352310\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/661/\">\n    2001-NMCA-055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 24, 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352310\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/661/\">\n    130 N.M. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"352310\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/130/661/\">\n    29 P.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that the plaintiff \"must provide a privilege log\" and that the log, \"together with any supplemental affidavits[,] must affirmatively demonstrate an objectively reasonable basis for each assertion of privilege[,]\" but also explaining that the procedural guidelines for asserting a privilege \"are not immutable\" and that \"[t]hey may be modified as required by the circumstances of a particular case\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albuquerque Rape Crisis Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549854\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/398/\">\n    2005-NMSC-032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549854\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/398/\">\n    138 N.M. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2549854\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/138/398/\">\n    120 P.3d 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting\n   that the court may need to conduct an in camera inspection to determine whether certain communications are discoverable);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

At best, it arguably offers indicia that Brooks and APS at some time-possibly even various times-shared a common goal or desire (e.g., to clear Brooks' name, or to keep the Padilla Report from being disclosed, a common desire we note they continue to share), which is insufficient to establish that they shared an identical legal interest in the matters that Melendres and Ortiz communicated to Sanders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pac. Pictures Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3876543\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/679/1121/#p1129\">\n    679 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"a shared desire to see the same outcome in a legal matter is insufficient\" for the common interest exception to apply);\n   <em>\n    Hunton &amp; Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505215\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/272/#p284\">\n    590 F.3d at 283-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" '[I]ndicia' of joint strategy as of a particular point in time are insufficient to demonstrate that a common interest agreement has been formed.\"). Indeed, much of what Sanders contends supports her position of a common interest instead suggests the possibility that Brooks' interests were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   aligned with those of the Board, which had investigated allegations of his possible misconduct and then convened in a lengthy and non-public executive session regarding that personnel matter after having received the Padilla Report. Particularly given the existence of facts that give rise to the appearance that the parties had antagonistic interests, it was incumbent upon Sanders to not only combat that appearance but also affirmatively and specifically establish the existence of an agreement between the parties regarding the identicality of their\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   interest in communications they intended to be privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {28} Moreover, what we do see from our review of the record is that the evidence Sanders now points to was not presented by Sanders to the district court-either as an evidentiary proffer or even in her response brief-as supplying a basis for finding the existence of a common interest. Indeed, much of that evidence was proffered by Plaintiffs, not Sanders, for purposes unrelated to the issue of whether the Board and Brooks had a common interest at the time of Sanders' communications with Ortiz. Sanders' reliance on such evidence now, after the fact, fails to supply a basis for reversing the district court's determination that it had not been provided a factual basis for finding a common interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {29} Because we cannot say that the district court's ruling is clearly contrary to the logical conclusions demanded by the facts and circumstances of the case, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that Sanders failed to meet\n   her burden of establishing the applicability of the attorney-client privilege. We acknowledge the difficult position in which Sanders has been put and her ensuing effort to zealously represent her client and meet her ethical obligations as a lawyer. Having failed her burden of establishing privilege, however, we reject Sanders' contention that the district court's order or this Court's affirmance of the same results in \"compel[ling] her to do that which her ethical obligations prohibit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 16-106(B)(6) NMRA (permitting a lawyer to \"reveal information relating to the representation of a client to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary ... to comply with ... a court order\"); Rule 16-106(A) (providing that \"[a] lawyer shall not reveal information ...\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   ... disclosure is permitted by Paragraph B of this rule\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Defendants' Arguments Are Without Merit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {30} Defendants join Sanders in her arguments regarding the OMA and the applicability of the common interest aspect of the attorney-client privilege, adopting them by reference and offering no additional argument or analysis to support those proffered bases for reversal. Defendants advance two additional arguments for why this Court should reverse the district court's order and conclude that Plaintiff's motion to compel should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {31} Defendants first contend that Plaintiffs' \"discovery request to compel Ms. Sanders' testimony under the rationale that it might create a broader waiver of the entire [Padilla] Report is faulty\" and that this Court \"should not allow the search for a waiver as a rationale to compel the discovery sought from Ms. Sanders.\" This argument first reflects a misunderstanding of Plaintiffs' argument regarding the relevance and discoverability of Sanders' testimony. The record plainly establishes that Plaintiffs seek Sanders' testimony for the limited purpose of proving that APS voluntarily disclosed the Padilla Report or its substance to Sanders, thereby effecting a waiver of the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work product protection and defeating Defendants' claim that the Report is exempt from inspection under Section 14-2-1(A)(6), (8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {32} Defendants' argument also reflects a misunderstanding of the limited scope of this appeal, including the applicable law that resolves it. Defendants argue that this Court \"should begin the analysis of any alleged waiver\" by recognizing \"the clear protections IPRA affords employer/employee information\" via Section 14-2-1(A)(3)'s exemption for \"letters or memoranda that are matters of opinion in personnel files.\" Defendants' argument ignores that this Court is not presently faced with any questions regarding the applicability of Section 14-2-1(A)(3)'s exemption, much less whether any waiver has occurred under any IPRA exception. We agree with Plaintiffs that because the district court has not yet been asked to rule on whether Section 14-2-1(A)(3)'s exemption applies, this argument is not properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {33} Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs \"should not be permitted to compel testimony about the substance of the [Padilla] Report\" by \"forc[ing] Ms. Sanders to discuss what she may have heard about the [R]eport during executive session.\" Again, Defendants did not raise this issue before the district court below, and it is not properly before us in this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {34} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {35}\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   WE CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   STEPHEN G.
