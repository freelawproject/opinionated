Defendant argues that his right to a speedy trial was violated, that he was prejudiced by the trial court's requirement that he wear leg restraints during trial, and that he was denied his rights both to self-representation and the effective assistance of counsel. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 One evening in December 2011, an officer on patrol saw Defendant driving a vehicle that had been reported stolen. The officer followed Defendant and activated his lights and siren, signaling Defendant to pull over. Defendant refused to stop and instead accelerated to a high speed. The officer, unable to safely pursue Defendant, initiated a neighborhood containment plan to prevent Defendant from getting away. As the officer began\n   reconnoitering the neighborhood, he observed the stolen car abandoned on the road with the driver's door open and the engine still running. Soon after, another officer found Defendant half a block from the abandoned car, sweating and out of breath. A third officer with a dog that had tracked Defendant from the abandoned car also approached Defendant. Defendant was arrested and charged with the previously named offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 In January 2014, a jury convicted Defendant of all three charges. On appeal, we summarily reversed his convictions because the trial court had failed to address Defendant's multiple requests to represent himself. On remand, Defendant again sought to represent himself, but he insisted that he would not waive his right to the assistance of counsel unless the trial court either granted him the use of a law library or the assistance of standby counsel. The trial court granted his request for the assistance of standby counsel. The court clarified that Defendant would be representing himself and was responsible for his own defense. Standby counsel's role was limited to assisting Defendant in securing witnesses and in accessing relevant legal materials. Shortly before trial, Defendant complained that standby counsel was not serving his interests and that he did not believe he was \"being properly represented.\" He also complained that standby counsel was not providing him with the information or evidence he requested and had failed to help him locate the witnesses he wished to subpoena.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Also during pretrial hearings, Defendant raised concerns about wearing leg restraints in view of the jury. Defendant proposed that he wear a taser vest as an alternative to leg restraints. However, the bailiff explained to the court that courtroom security procedures do not allow criminal defendants to wear only a taser vest. Rather, the protocol calls for such vests to be worn in addition to leg restraints. The court agreed that Defendant could not only wear a taser vest. To allay Defendant's concerns of prejudice, the trial court suggested that both Defendant and the prosecutor remain seated during trial. Defendant rejected this suggestion, preferring to walk about the courtroom as best he could in leg restraints. Defendant's case on remand proceeded expeditiously to trial with the exception of one continuance-at Defendant's request-to locate additional evidence and witnesses. After a two-day trial in April 2015, a jury convicted Defendant of all three charges. Defendant again appeals, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial court denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. \"We review the issue of whether a defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Trial Delay\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to a speedy trial. U.S. Const. amend. VI.

In cases of retrial, other courts have declined to include all the time that has passed from the original charge to the second trial, considering only the time period between the appellate mandate reversing a conviction and the retrial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Icgoren v.

We therefore conclude that the trial court did not deprive Defendant of his right to a speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II. Leg Restraints\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Defendant contends that the trial court unfairly prejudiced him by requiring him to wear leg restraints in the presence of the jury. \"It is well established that a principal ingredient of due process is that every criminal defendant is entitled to a fair and impartial trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366623\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/824/469/#p473\">\n    824 P.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473 (Utah Ct. App. 1991) (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). It can be \"inherently prejudicial\" to \"visibly shackl[e] a defendant\" because \"it suggests to the minds of jurors that he is guilty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Madsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9307887\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1134/\">\n    2002 UT App 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9307887\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/57/1134/\">\n    57 P.3d 1134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Still, a trial court may physically restrain a criminal defendant \"to prevent an escape, resort to violence, or disruption of the trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10366623\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/824/469/#p473\">\n    824 P.2d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The question of whether Defendant actually presented any of those risks is not at issue in this appeal. Instead, Defendant argues that there were ways the trial court could have minimized the risk of prejudice even if it was necessary to restrain him. Defendant was restrained using shackles that would lock \"if someone stands up abruptly or moves.\" To ensure the jury could not see Defendant's leg restraints, the trial court offered to have everyone at counsel table remain seated, including the prosecutor, and for curtains to be hung from the tables to conceal everyone's legs. But Defendant rejected the trial court's offer, insisting confining everyone to counsel table would signal the jury that Defendant was shackled. And he wished to move about freely during trial. He therefore made the choice to forgo the everyone-remain-seated option and preserve his ability to get up and move around during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 To conclude that the use of visible restraints was inherently prejudicial, it\n   has to be clear that \"the trial court created [the] inherently prejudicial situation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Had Defendant accepted the trial court's offer to have everyone at counsel table remain seated, the jury would have been none the wiser that he was physically restrained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant therefore created his own prejudicial situation, and accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not err in requiring Defendant to wear leg restraints during his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   III. Standby Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Defendant contends, seemingly inconsistently, that both his right to self-representation and his right to the effective assistance of counsel were violated when \"his standby counsel failed to ... provide him access to relevant legal materials [and] ... subpoena witnesses.\" There are two mutually exclusive rights guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment: the right to the assistance of counsel and the right to self-representation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But the court clarified that Defendant would be \"primarily responsible for things\" and \"responsible for being able to comply with all the expectations.\" While Defendant does not dispute that his waiver of the right to counsel was knowing and voluntary, he denies that he waived the right to the assistance of counsel in toto, arguing that he \"did not entirely self-represent\" because his standby counsel played the role of \"co-counsel\" during his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 Courts have traditionally appointed standby counsel \"to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help\" and \"to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant's self-representation is necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    Faretta v.

However, the court in\n   <em>\n    Frampton\n   </em>\n   also noted that generally ascertaining that a defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving his right to counsel \"can only be elicited after penetrating questioning by the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 187. Indeed, our supreme court pointed trial courts to a scripted colloquy from the Bench Book for United States District Court Judges, outlining questions which might be asked to verify that a defendant understands the significant right being waived and how that waiver might be applied in the real-world setting of a trial court.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 187 n.12.

Further, a formal order of appointment ensures that a defendant appreciates the truly binary nature of the decision between self-representation and representation by counsel: it is either one or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 Such an order appointing standby counsel, in addition to parameters specific to a case, might include language such as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   In summary of the warnings that have previously been made to Defendant in open court, and unless and until Defendant expressly invokes the right to counsel and relinquishes his status as pro se counsel:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. Any witnesses in any hearing or trial will be questioned by Defendant, not his standby counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   B. Any arguments made in open court will be made by Defendant, not his standby counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   C. Any statements made by Defendant in court can be used against him in this or any other proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   D. Defendant will continually be responsible for compliance with the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Utah Rules of Evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   E. The court cannot give any legal advice to Defendant, including advice on how to try this case, hold a hearing, or otherwise proceed in this matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   F. Standby counsel's role is to act as a resource and is not appointed to keep Defendant from making mistakes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   G. Standby counsel may assist Defendant in obtaining legal resources, but standby counsel is not expected to conduct research for Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   H. In the court's opinion, Defendant would be better served by being represented by an attorney. However, Defendant has elected to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his right to counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
