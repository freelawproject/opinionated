We hold that it does in two ways. First, the Arizona legislature's grant of broad authority to AHCCCS to investigate suspected fraud necessarily implies an exception to the privilege for internal AHCCCS investigations and proceedings. And, second, the AHCCCS statutes implicitly abrogate the privilege in the criminal investigation and prosecution of suspected AHCCCS fraud because the disclosure requirements in the AHCCCS statutes and the legislature's clear intent to support criminal prosecution of AHCCCS fraud preclude harmonizing the physician-patient privilege with the AHCCCS statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Chalice Zeitner visited a Phoenix obstetrician for an abortion in early March 2010, claiming she had discovered she was pregnant after recently undergoing extensive radiation and chemotherapy treatments for cancer. The obstetrician referred her to a specialist, whom Zeitner told she had been diagnosed with a malignant uterine tumor and was undergoing chemotherapy. In late March 2010, Zeitner successfully applied for AHCCCS benefits, stating on her application that she had a serious chronic illness and her pregnancy was high-risk and life-threatening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On March 31, the obstetrician received an email seemingly following up on a procedure the obstetrician had proposed to Zeitner. The email, signed by \"Al Zeitner,\" emphasized the urgency of the procedure, claiming Zeitner would resume cancer treatments on April 9 and needed to have her tumor removed within four weeks. A few days later, Zeitner provided the obstetrician a letter purportedly written by a doctor at the out-of-state hospital Zeitner claimed had treated her for cancer. The letter recommended that Zeitner \"receive an urgent [abortion] ... to relieve third term life-threatening certainties to the patient.\" The obstetrician, relying on this information, concluded that an abortion was necessary to protect Zeitner's health. Based on his opinion, AHCCCS authorized payment for the procedure, and the obstetrician performed the abortion on April 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 While performing a caesarean section on Zeitner for another pregnancy nearly a year later, the obstetrician found no physical evidence to support Zeitner's previous claims of uterine cancer. Upon further investigation, he discovered the letter delivered by Zeitner in early April was not authored by the doctor whose name appeared on the letter. The obstetrician reported his suspicions about Zeitner to her health plan, which forwarded the matter to AHCCCS for investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 A grand jury eventually indicted Zeitner on eleven counts, including charges for defrauding AHCCCS, which generally does not cover abortions except when necessary to save a woman's life or to protect a woman's health.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 35-196.02(A)-(B). The State alleged that Zeitner lied about having cancer so her abortion would fall within the exception to that rule. The State also alleged Zeitner committed identity theft and forgery by impersonating a doctor recommending that she receive her abortion. Zeitner pleaded not guilty to every charge and moved to preclude all information her physicians obtained from her, including records of her communications with the physicians and their examinations of her, arguing they were protected under Arizona's physician-patient privilege. The State opposed the motions, arguing the privilege was abrogated by statute, and the trial court denied the motions before trial. After an eleven-day trial, in which the court admitted Zeitner's medical records and allowed her physicians to testify, the jury convicted Zeitner on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Zeitner's sole argument on appeal was that the superior court erred by admitting her medical records and allowing her physicians to testify against her. The court of appeals affirmed, holding that the AHCCCS statutes abrogated \"the [physician-patient] privilege ... in cases of suspected AHCCCS fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court noted that the AHCCCS statutes require health-care providers to report suspected fraud to AHCCCS, A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2918.01(A), and to turn over patient records to fraud investigators, A.R.S. \u00a7 36-2903(I).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567684\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/990/#p992\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 222-23 \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567684\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/990/#p992\">\n    418 P.3d at 995-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, even absent an express exception, the statutory scheme reflects the legislature's intent to exempt AHCCCS from the comprehensive constraints imposed by the physician-patient privilege. Based on its purpose and scope, the privilege would generally prohibit the type of disclosures required by the AHCCCS statutes (i.e., disclosure of confidential patient information to a third party).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nevertheless, physicians providing AHCCCS services must report \"any cases of suspected fraud,\" and AHCCCS must investigate these reports. \u00a7 36-2918.01(A). In conducting its investigations, AHCCCS may subpoena and \"examine any person under oath\" and \"compel the production of any record ... necessary to support an investigation.\" \u00a7 36-2918(G). We cannot infer that the legislature, in granting such broad investigatory authority, intended the privilege to stand as a bulwark against AHCCCS fraud investigations. Accordingly, considering the nature of legislative exceptions to the privilege and the purposes those exceptions serve-the prosecution of crime or the protection of a \"greater good\"-we conclude that the provisions expressly granting AHCCCS the authority to compel disclosure of patient information to investigate reports of fraud- \u00a7\u00a7 36-2903 and -2918(G)-create an exception to the privilege for internal AHCCCS investigations and proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 We likewise conclude that the MFCU possesses authority to compel disclosure of patient information to investigate and prosecute fraud. It is illogical to believe that the legislature intended AHCCCS to withhold information relevant to a criminal investigation and prosecution of fraud after expressly mandating that all matters of suspected fraud be referred to the attorney general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-2918.01(A). The critical issue in a Medicaid beneficiary fraud case is whether the beneficiary lied to her physician to obtain AHCCCS coverage. This is particularly true, as here, where the beneficiary's fraud is designed to obtain AHCCCS coverage for services not generally covered by the program. We fail to see how the attorney general can fulfill his duty-and the legislature's intent-to prosecute beneficiary fraud, or how a jury can determine whether the beneficiary committed fraud against AHCCCS, without having access to the beneficiary's and physician's relevant communications. It is the very information contained within these communications that forms the foundation of the fraud charges. Because the physician-patient privilege would prohibit the same disclosures that the AHCCCS statutes require, we conclude that the privilege cannot be harmonized with the AHCCCS statutes \"to give each effect and meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cave Creek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855520\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/1/\">\n    233 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7 \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3855520\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/233/1/\">\n    308 P.3d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we also hold that the AHCCCS statutes implicitly abrogate the privilege in the attorney general's investigation and prosecution of suspected AHCCCS fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Zeitner contends that, even if the statutory scheme abrogates the physician-patient privilege as to AHCCCS, patient information disclosed to the attorney general (through the MFCU) remains subject to its protections. We are unpersuaded. In addition to lacking statutory support, this contention does nothing to advance the purpose of the privilege. After AHCCCS begins its internal investigation of fraud, the protective curtain of confidentiality-intended to promote full and frank disclosures between a patient and her physician-is already stripped away. And even if such an interpretation did somehow advance the privilege's purpose, the state and public's legitimate and substantial interests in deterring and prosecuting fraud and preserving the state's federal Medicaid funding carry the day over the patient's residual privacy interests.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Benton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1467834\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/182/466/#p468\">\n    182 Ariz. at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1467834\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/182/466/#p468\">\n    897 P.2d at 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that in instances where a victim invokes the privilege to protect her abuser, \"the public's interest in protecting victims outweighs the privacy interest reflected in the physician-patient privilege\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 Zeitner next argues that \u00a7 36-2903(I) distinguishes between the \"use\" and \"release\" of privileged information and only provides for the \"release\" of such information, thereby prohibiting the attorney general from introducing the privileged information at trial. We disagree. The basic statutory premise of Zeitner's argument is flawed. Section 36-2903(I), which contains the distinguishing language between use and release, requires the AHCCCS director to create rules governing the use or release of confidential information, which unquestionably includes information generally protected by the physician-patient privilege. These rules, however, govern only the actions of the agency and those who contract to provide services for the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Admin. Code R9-22-512(A) (limiting the release of safeguarded information by \"[t]he Administration, contractors, providers, and noncontracting providers\"). Consequently,\n   after AHCCCS refers a matter to the attorney general for prosecution of beneficiary fraud, the agency's rules no longer apply, and the distinction between use and release is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Furthermore, interpreting the AHCCCS statutory scheme as precluding the use of the very information that the statutes require to be released to support the investigation and prosecution of fraud would generate an absurd result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Montgomery v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329655\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/98/\">\n    237 Ariz. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4329655\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/237/98/\">\n    346 P.3d 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987 (2014) (noting that \"[s]tatutes should be construed sensibly to avoid reaching an absurd conclusion\"). Zeitner's position is untenable because it would defeat the purpose of those statutes and regulations which contemplate disclosure and prosecution-to deter and punish AHCCCS fraud by providers and beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b627 Zeitner further argues that, even if the privilege is abrogated, it is only abrogated to the extent expressly contemplated by the AHCCCS statutes-the release or disclosure of patient medical records, not physician testimony. This argument, too, is unavailing. We agree with the court of appeals that \"[i]t would serve little purpose, and would make little sense, for a patient to retain the power to prevent her physician from testifying when the physician can be legally compelled to release the patient's medical records.\"\n   <em>\n    Zeitner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%20217\">\n    244 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   224 \u00b6 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567684\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/990/#p992\">\n    418 P.3d at 996-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Arizona courts have expanded the physician-patient privilege beyond its original testimonial protections to include patients' medical records because \"the privilege ... would be rendered meaningless if it were destroyed the moment that a physician transcribed communications from a patient or knowledge he has obtained from his examination of a patient into hospital records.\"\n   <em>\n    Rowles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1251017\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/21/424/\">\n    21 Ariz.

Applying that same reasoning in reverse, protecting the physician's testimony after compelling disclosure of a patient's medical records would not advance the privilege-the curtain of confidentiality has already been pulled aside. Thus, the only purpose served by restricting disclosure to medical records would be to impede the attorney general in his investigation and prosecution of AHCCCS fraud, a result wholly inconsistent with the AHCCCS statutory fraud control scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628 The comprehensive fraud control measures embodied in the federal and state Medicaid schemes, including sweeping patient record disclosure requirements, make clear that the physician-patient privilege must yield to the State's interest in combatting fraud where providers and beneficiaries are suspected of AHCCCS fraud. The legislature's express provisions in the AHCCCS statutes granting AHCCCS broad authority to investigate matters of suspected fraud- \u00a7\u00a7 36-2903 and -2918(G)-necessarily imply an exception to the privilege for AHCCCS investigations and proceedings. These same provisions also exhibit an intent to provide law enforcement access to patient information when investigating and prosecuting AHCCCS fraud, thereby implicitly abrogating the privilege in the attorney general's investigation and prosecution of suspected provider and beneficiary AHCCCS fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 Accordingly, we affirm the court of appeals' opinion and affirm Zeitner's convictions and resulting sentences.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
