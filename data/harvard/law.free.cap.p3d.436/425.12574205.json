He appeals his sentence. In the published portion of this opinion, we reject Kim's argument that he should have received credit for his presentence electronic home monitoring (EHM). The 2015 amendment to RCW 9.94A.505 precludes felons convicted of certain crimes, including murder in the second degree, from receiving credit for time served on EHM before sentencing. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we reject Kim's other arguments regarding his sentence. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In March 2016, Kim shot and killed Jakeel Mason who attempted to steal items from Kim's convenience store. The State charged Kim with murder in the second degree. Pretrial, the court released Kim from custody but imposed numerous conditions including he could only reside at his home address, he could not travel outside Pierce, King, Thurston, or Kitsap counties, he could not contact victims or witnesses, he could not possess weapons or firearms, and he could not consume or possess alcohol or marijuana. The court also ordered him to be on EHM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Approximately one year later, Kim plead guilty to the murder charge. Pending sentencing, the court released Kim on similar conditions, including continued EHM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The court sentenced Kim to 100 months. Kim sought credit for the 450 days he had spent on EHM. Because of RCW 9.94A.505(7), the court did not give Kim credit for time spent on EHM. Kim appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Kim argues that RCW 9.94A.505(7) violates the double jeopardy, equal protection, and due process clauses of the United States and Washington constitutions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. APPLICABLE STATUTES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The general rule is that a person shall receive credit for time served in confinement. RCW 9.94A.505(6). The term \"confinement\" means \"total or partial confinement.\" RCW 9.94A.030(8). Under RCW 9.94A.030(36), \"partial confinement\" includes electronic monitoring. However, a \"sentencing court shall not give [an] offender credit for any time the offender was required to comply with an electronic monitoring program prior to sentencing if the offender was convicted of ... [a] violent offense.\" RCW 9.94A.505(7)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Murder in the second degree is a serious violent offense and a subcategory of a violent offense.

DOUBLE JEOPARDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Kim argues that because he served 450 days on EHM, and because EHM continues to be statutorily defined as \"confinement,\" RCW 9.94A.505(7) is punitive in intent. Therefore, Kim claims that he is being subjected to unconstitutional \"confinement\" twice for the 450 days he served on EHM.

EQUAL PROTECTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Kim argues that the 2015 amendment to RCW 9.94A.505 violates equal protection because it makes two arbitrary classifications. First, Kim argues that it draws improper classifications between different crimes. For example, the amendment permits sentencing courts to give credit for EHM to white collar criminals but not to murderers, as is the case here. Second, he contends it draws improper classifications among defendants who have committed the same crime. For example, Kim argues that if one person is released without any conditions and the other is released subject to EHM, the person who is subject to EHM will end up serving more time in \"confinement\" for the same crime and for the same sentence. We disagree that there is an equal protection violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 \"Equal protection requires that persons similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law receive like treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   is more on point. A rational basis supports the legislature's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 Here, as Kim points out, the 2015 amendment leads to two classifications. First, the amendment distinguishes between felons convicted of violent offenses and felons convicted of all other felonies not listed in the statute. RCW 9.94A.505(6) - (7). Second, the amendment distinguishes between violent offenders, i.e., between defendants released on presentence EHM who are \"confined\" but not given credit for that confinement and defendants released with\n   no conditions who do not serve an additional and unaccounted for \"confinement\" period.\n   \u00b625 Regarding Kim's first argument, a rational basis exists for the legislature's decision to not allow credit for time served on presentence EHM release. The legislature has made a determination that people who are convicted of more serious crimes should not get credit for time served on presentence EHM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b626 The State has at least two legitimate interests and must balance these sometimes-competing interests. First, it has a legitimate interest in protecting its citizens. It also has a legitimate interest in affording criminal defendants adequate defense preparation. EHM can conflict with the State's first interest, but it undoubtedly furthers the State's second interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015402\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/171/455/#p467\">\n    171 Wash.2d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=256%20P.3d%20328\">\n    256 P.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In an attempt to balance these interests, the legislature looked to the relative seriousness of various crimes to determine which felons should receive credit for presentence EHM. Thus, the legislature has made a determination that people who are charged with more serious crimes are a greater threat to society and should not receive presentence EHM credit. There is a sufficient rational basis for the legislature to make this distinction because it is an attempt to balance and further its two legitimate interests identified above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b627 As to Kim's second argument, there is also a rational basis. Kim argues that the legislature's action had no rational basis because, as currently defined, the statute imposes more \"confinement\" on defendants subject to EHM than on defendants who committed the same crime and were sentenced identically but who were released without any conditions. However, there is a rational basis for the legislature to distinguish between these two types of defendants because other factors, including a person's flight risk, are taken into consideration by a judge in determining whether a defendant should be released on EHM or without conditions. CrR 3.2. Kim's argument is based on the legislature's use of the term \"confinement.\" But the legislature,\n   in making a specific statute, carved out an exception for when confinement does not include EHM. Kim's argument is based on nomenclature, not constitutional grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b628 We conclude that RCW 9.94A.505(7) does not violate Kim's equal protections rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b629 RCW 9.94A.505(7) does not infringe Kim's constitutional rights under the double jeopardy or equal protection clauses under the United States and Washington constitutions. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b630 A majority of the panel having determined that only the foregoing portion of this opinion will be printed in the Washington Appellate Reports and that the remainder shall be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2.06.040, it is so ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Maxa, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lee, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The State argues that Kim failed to present an adequate record for review of Kim's double jeopardy, equal protection, and due process claims. We disagree. However, as to Kim's due process claim, Kim only provided conclusory arguments and passing treatment to this issue; therefore, we do not consider it.
