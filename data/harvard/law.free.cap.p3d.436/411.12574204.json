Reagan alleges that Dr. Newton injured her while conducting an independent medical examination (IME) on her. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Newton because Reagan did not present expert testimony that Dr. Newton violated the standard of care as required to maintain a medical malpractice action under chapter 7.70 RCW. The court also disregarded without comment Reagan's\n   medical battery claim that she had not pleaded but had raised in opposition to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 RCW 7.70.010 states that the substantive and procedural requirements of chapter 7.70 RCW, the medical malpractice statute, apply to actions regarding injuries \"occurring as a result of health care.\" RCW 7.70.030, which establishes the grounds for a medical malpractice claim, also applies to injuries \"occurring as the result of health care.\" The primary question here is whether a physical examination during an IME that causes injury to the person being examined constitutes \"health care\" governed by chapter 7.70 RCW. In addition, a question exists whether a person injured during an IME also can maintain a common law medical battery claim against the IME physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 We hold that (1) a physical examination during an IME that causes injury to the person being examined constitutes \"health care\" under RCW 7.70.010 and therefore Reagan was required to present expert testimony regarding breach of the standard of care, (2) the trial court properly dismissed Reagan's medical malpractice claim against Dr. Newton because she did not present expert testimony addressing the applicable standard of care or whether Dr. Newton had breached that standard of care, and (3) Reagan can maintain a claim for medical battery under CR 15(b) even though she did not plead that claim and Reagan presented evidence\n   in opposition to summary judgment that created a genuine issue of material fact regarding Dr. Newton's liability for medical battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's dismissal of Reagan's medical malpractice claim, but we reverse the trial court's dismissal of Reagan's medical battery claim and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In June 2013, Reagan injured her back while in the course of her employment. She filed a workers' compensation\n   claim with the Department of Labor and Industries (DLI). DLI accepted Reagan's claim for injuries to her thoracic and cervical regions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 DLI subsequently requested that Reagan undergo an IME. The IME's purpose was to determine Reagan's current work restrictions, if she could return to work, if her treatment had concluded, and whether she had a permanent impairment as a result of the injury. DLI also requested that the IME provider make treatment recommendations, including stating whether treatment was curative or rehabilitative, the goals of treatment, and the estimated length and prognosis of treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 In May 2014, Dr. Newton, an orthopedic physician, and Dr. Dennis Chong, a physiatrist, performed Reagan's IME. Reagan's sister-in-law, Lisa Wilson, accompanied her to the examination and remained in the room throughout the exam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Reagan told Dr. Newton that she had a previous injury to her left hip. During his physical examination, Dr. Newton had Reagan lie on her back. He then bent her left knee toward her chest and rotated her bent knee from the hip joint. Reagan told Dr. Newton that her hip would not rotate any further because of her previous injury, but Dr. Newton pushed her leg all the way down. Reagan screamed in pain, and Dr. Newton stated, \"That was the reaction I was looking for.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 110. Wilson also recalls Reagan telling Dr. Newton \"that's as far as it goes\" before he \"yanked\" on her leg, Regan crying out in pain, and Dr. Newton commenting about Reagan's reaction. CP at 113-114. As a result of this maneuver, Reagan experienced excruciating pain in her hip. Wilson, who drove Reagan home, stated that Reagan continued to experience pain and discomfort after the IME concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Reagan subsequently filed a lawsuit against Dr. Newton in which she alleged that his negligence in manipulating her hip during the IME caused her injury. The complaint requested a judgment against Dr. Newton for\n   damages suffered as a result of his negligence. The complaint did not assert a claim for medical battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Dr. Newton moved for summary judgment on liability. Specifically, he claimed that Reagan had failed to present expert testimony required to support a claim under RCW 7.70.030(1) that he had breached the appropriate standard of care during his examination of Reagan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 Reagan opposed the summary judgment motion, claiming that chapter 7.70 RCW did not apply to her claim because Dr. Newton was not providing \"health care\" during the IME. She also asserted in her brief that she could recover under a theory of medical battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Reagan submitted declarations from Dr. Bruce Blackstone, who saw her for a subsequent IME in January 2015, and from Dr. Mark Colville, who performed her original hip surgery. Dr. Blackstone characterized Reagan's \"acute onset of left hip pain that occurred during the IME of May 13, 2014\" as \"an aggravation of pre-existing arthritis, which is actually attributable to her work-related injury suffered back in 2008.\" CP at 127-28. Dr. Colville also attributed the left hip pain to \"the manipulation performed during her independent medical exam [of May 2014],\" finding that it had \"aggravated a preexisting osteoarthritic condition of the left hip.\" CP at 142. But neither physician offered any opinion regarding the appropriate standard of care or whether Dr. Newton followed that standard of care during the IME.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Dr. Newton's reply brief did not mention medical battery. But the parties addressed the claim on the merits during oral argument, and Dr. Newton did not argue\n   that the trial court should not consider the medical battery claim because it had not been pleaded. The court did not address medical battery during argument or in its summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Newton and dismissed Reagan's claims. Reagan appeals the trial court's summary judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.

However, these factors demonstrate only that there is no physician-patient relationship between an IME physician and the person being examined. They do not answer whether a physician-patient relationship is necessary to assert a claim under RCW 7.70.030(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b649 Reagan's arguments are not persuasive. In addition, her position would be detrimental to persons undergoing IMEs.

Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b650 Dr. Newton utilized his medical skills to examine Reagan. Although Dr. Newton did not have a traditional physician-patient relationship with Reagan, Reagan was Dr. Newton's \"patient\" in the generic sense that he interacted with and examined her. And he had a limited relationship with her in that he had a duty not to injure her during his examination. Accordingly, we hold that Dr. Newton's IME involved \"health care\" and therefore that RCW 7.70.030(1) governed his liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   C. SUFFICIENCY OF EXPERT TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b651 Because the medical malpractice statute applies here, Reagan had the burden in opposition to summary judgment to present evidence establishing a genuine issue of fact that Dr. Newton failed to follow the accepted standard of care under RCW 7.70.030(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   addition, Reagan was required to present evidence regarding the accepted standard of care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 7.70.040(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Wash.%202d%2079\">\n    191 Wash.2d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567920\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/819/\">\n    419 P.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reagan argues that the expert medical testimony from Dr. Blackstone and Dr. Colville was sufficient to avoid summary judgment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b652 As noted above, breach of the applicable standard of care generally must be established through expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Wash.%202d%2079\">\n    191 Wash.2d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567920\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/819/\">\n    419 P.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both Dr. Blackstone and Dr. Colville opined that the acute onset of Reagan's left hip pain occurred as a result of Dr. Newton's manipulation of the hip during her May 2014 IME. But these opinions focused only on causation. Neither physician offered any opinion regarding the appropriate standard of care or whether Dr. Newton followed that standard of care during the IME. Therefore, Reagan's evidence was insufficient to sustain a claim under RCW 7.70.030(1) and RCW 7.70.040(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b653 Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Dr. Newton under RCW 7.70.030(1) because Reagan did not provide the required expert testimony that Dr. Newton violated the accepted standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   D. MEDICAL BATTERY CLAIM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b654 Reagan argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her claim for medical battery because she presented sufficient\n   evidence to support that claim. Dr. Newton argues that summary judgment was appropriate because Reagan did not plead battery or any intentional conduct in her complaint and because the statute of limitations bars the claim. We reject Dr. Newton's procedural arguments, and hold that Reagan presented evidence in opposition to summary judgment that created a genuine issue of material fact regarding Dr. Newton's liability for medical battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   1.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b668 Here, Reagan raised medical battery for the first time in her response to Dr. Newton's summary judgment motion. She noted that battery involves a nonconsensual touching and stated that she did not consent to the manipulation of her hip. Dr. Newton did not address medical battery in his reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b669 At oral argument on the summary judgment motion, Dr. Newton did not object to Reagan's medical battery claim on the basis that it had not been raised in her complaint. Instead, he discussed applicable case law and argued that the medical battery theory did not apply to the facts because Reagan had consented to Dr. Newton's performance of the IME. Reagan responded that there was \"clearly a question of fact in terms of whether or not there's a medical battery here.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 21. Reagan also pointed out \"that the defense raised nothing in its reply with respect to the medical battery.\" RP at 23. In response, Dr. Newton briefly argued again that there could be no medical battery claim because Reagan had consented to the IME.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b670 It is unclear whether or not the trial court considered the medical battery claim. The court asked no questions during oral argument, took the matter under advisement, and did not issue an oral ruling. The court later issued a written summary judgment order that dismissed without comment \"[t]he claims asserted by the Plaintiff.\" CP at 216.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b671 Under\n   <em>\n    Dewey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Newton's argument on the merits at the summary judgment hearing does not necessarily preclude him from asserting that CR 15(b) is inapplicable. As this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Kirby\n   </em>\n   , a defendant should not be penalized for attempting a defense to an\n   unpleaded claim where the defendant's lack of preparation is the result of the plaintiff's procedural failures.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"684023\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/124/454/#p469\">\n    124 Wash.

However, in both of those cases the defendant argued at the summary judgment hearing that the new claim had not been pleaded in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20P.3d%20827\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dewey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"254837\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/95/18/#p26\">\n    95 Wash.

Here, Dr. Newton made no such argument and never objected to addressing the medical battery claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b672 Based on Dr. Newton's failure to object to Reagan asserting the medical battery claim and arguing that claim on the merits, we hold that the summary judgment proceedings amounted to a trial of the claim by implication under CR 15(b). Accordingly, we\n   apply CR 15(b) and treat the medical battery claim as if it had been raised in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   4. Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b673 Dr. Newton argues that even if we can consider Reagan's medical battery claim under CR 15(b), that claim is barred by the statute of limitations. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b674 The statute of limitations for common law battery claims is two years. RCW 4.16.100(1). Reagan alleges that she was injured on May 13, 2014. She filed her lawsuit against Dr. Newton on December 14, 2015, well within the statute of limitations. But Dr. Newton points out that Reagan did not raise the medical battery claim until she filed her summary judgment response on June 12, 2017, which was more than two years after she filed suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   \u00b675 However, CR 15(b) states that if issues are tried by express or implied consent, the issues \"shall be treated\n   <em>\n    in all respects\n   </em>\n   as if they had been raised in the pleadings.\" (Emphasis added.) \"In all respects\" necessarily includes treating the issue as pleaded at the time of the original complaint for statute of limitations purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reichelt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1192408\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/107/761/#p767\">\n    107 Wash.2d at 766-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=733%20P.2d%20530\">\n    733 P.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we reject Dr. Newton's statute of limitations argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   5. Summary Judgment on Medical Battery Claim\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b676 Because Reagan's medical battery claim must be treated as if the claim was raised in the complaint, we address whether Reagan provided sufficient evidence to avoid summary judgment. We hold that the trial court erred in dismissing the medical battery claim on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b677 Reagan cited her own deposition and Wilson's declaration to support the conclusion that Dr. Newton intentionally \"yanked,\" CP at 114, on Reagan's leg after she withdrew her consent to be touched further. Both remember Reagan telling Dr. Newton \"that's as far as it goes\" before he further rotated her leg from the hip, causing Regan to cry out in pain. CP at 114. Both also recall Dr. Newton then saying something to the effect of, \"That's the response I was looking for.\" CP at 110, 114. This testimony is sufficient to create genuine issues of fact regarding the existence of an offensive contact, Dr. Newton's intent to cause that contact, and Reagan's withdrawal of any consent to further rotate her hip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b678 Dr. Newton raises three brief arguments on the merits of the medical battery claim. First, he argues that Reagan relies only on her own self-serving testimony that he intentionally injured her. But a party's declaration is enough to create a question of fact where her deposition testimony was based on her personal observations of the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189779\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/180/859/#p864\">\n    180 Wash.

On a summary judgment motion brought by the opposing party, we must treat the plaintiff's eyewitness testimony as true, even if it is self-serving.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=324%20P.3d%20763\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b679 Second, Dr. Newton argues that Reagan consented to the IME and did not show that she did not consent to his touching of her as required in\n   <em>\n    Bundrick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275179\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/128/11/#p16\">\n    128 Wash.

But viewed in the light most favorable to Reagan, both her testimony and Wilson's testimony support an inference that\n   Reagan asked Dr. Newton to stop pushing on her hip and thereby withdrew her consent to that maneuver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b680 Third, Dr. Newton argues that Reagan submitted no admissible evidence that he intended to cause her harm. But both Reagan and Wilson testified that after Reagan cried out in pain, Dr. Newton stated that he was looking for that response. And as noted above, the requisite intent for battery is to cause the offensive contact, not the actual harm.\n   <em>\n    Kumar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4242321\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/180/481/#p504\">\n    180 Wash.2d at 504-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.3d%20193\">\n    325 P.3d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189779\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/180/859/#p864\">\n    180 Wash.

That statute states that the medical malpractice statute applies to \"all civil actions and causes of action, whether based on tort, contract, or otherwise, for damages for injury occurring as a result of health care.\" The Supreme Court has stated, \" '[W]henever an injury occurs as a result of health care, the action for damages for that injury is governed exclusively by RCW 7.70.' \"\n    <em>\n     Fast\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452127\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/27/#p34\">\n     187 Wash.2d at 34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20P.3d%20232\">\n     384 P.3d 232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (alteration in original) (quoting\n    <em>\n     Branom\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"83458\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/94/964/#p969\">\n     94 Wash.
