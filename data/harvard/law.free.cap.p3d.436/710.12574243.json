While northbound on Benton Avenue toward Custer Avenue in a pickup truck with a boat trailer in tow, Parsons first encountered the chase as the motorcycle and pursuing police car were oncoming southbound. Parsons observed the motorcycle traveling at a high rate of speed with the police car in hot pursuit-emergency lights and siren activated. After turning eastbound onto Custer Avenue after the chase passed by, Parsons again saw the speeding motorcycle and pursuing police car, this time rapidly approaching him from behind as he proceeded on Custer toward Montana Avenue. Seeing the fleeing motorcycle as an imminent risk to public safety and intent on stopping it to allow the pursuing police to apprehend the driver, Parsons slowed and pulled his pickup across the oncoming westbound lane, thereby fully blocking both lanes in an attempt to force the motorcycle to stop. Not intent on stopping, the motorcyclist instead tried to drive up the curb to go around the roadblock on the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, the motorcycle crashed on the curb, resulting in injury to the rider. The pursuing police immediately arrived, stopped, and arrested the injured motorcyclist, ultimately charging him with various offenses related to the chase. Police also later charged Parsons with misdemeanor negligent endangerment and reckless driving in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-208(1) and 61-8-301(1), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 At his subsequent jury trial, on the State's motion, the Municipal Court precluded Parsons from presenting evidence and argument that, rather than in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard for the safety of others as alleged by the State, he acted reasonably under the circumstances to assist police in apprehending the fleeing motorcyclist as authorized by \u00a7 46-6-502, MCA (citizen arrest authority). Ruling that the authority to make a citizen's arrest did not render Parsons immune from the charged offenses and that he lacked the requisite probable cause for a citizen's arrest in any event, the Municipal Court granted the State's motion in limine and further refused to instruct the jury on Parsons's authority to make a citizen's arrest. At the close of trial, the jury convicted Parsons of misdemeanor negligent endangerment and reckless driving as charged. After the District Court affirmed the Municipal Court judgment on intermediate appeal, Parsons timely appealed here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 On appeal from a municipal court of record, district courts function as intermediate appellate courts with the scope of review \"confined to review of the record and questions of law. ...\" Sections 3-5-303, 3-6-110(1), MCA ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, pursuant to its express language, \u00a7 46-5-502, MCA, is merely an affirmative grant of authorization for law enforcement roadblocks. By its terms, \u00a7 46-5-502, MCA, has no application to private citizens and thus no application here. Even by negative implication, nothing in the language of \u00a7 46-5-502, MCA, evinces any legislative intent to preclude a citizen from using a vehicle or other physical means to temporarily block a road as the mechanism of force to effect an arrest authorized by \u00a7 46-6-502(1), MCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without limitation other than circumstantial reasonableness, \u00a7 46-6-502(1), MCA, expressly authorizes a private person attempting to effect an arrest upon probable cause to \"use reasonable force to detain the arrested person.\" In the current absence of a narrower statutory definition, what is or is not \"reasonable force\" in degree or mechanism is an open-ended question of fact dependent on the unique facts and circumstances of each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Here, the record clearly manifests substantial, uncontradicted evidence that, upon observing a fast-approaching motorcyclist fleeing from police at high speed through town at imminent risk to public safety, Parsons attempted to stop the motorcycle by temporarily blocking the road with his vehicle until the pursuing police could arrive, stop, and arrest the rider as so obviously intended. Moreover, it is further uncontradicted and beyond material dispute on the record that, regardless of whether the police desired his assistance or would have eventually apprehended the motorcyclist on their own, Parsons's roadblock did in fact immediately stop and detain the fleeing suspect long enough for the pursuing police to stop and physically arrest him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is certainly conceivable that, with knowledge that \u00a7 46-6-502, MCA, authorizes citizens to use reasonable force to effect a citizen's arrest\n   until police arrive, the jury could have at least found reasonable doubt as to whether Parsons acted in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard of the safety of others under the totality of the circumstances. Thus, Parsons's asserted authority and intent to make a citizen's arrest was a materially relevant\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   consideration,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , as to whether he acted in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard for the safety of others beyond a reasonable doubt as alleged by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Even if Parsons's authority to make a citizen's arrest might otherwise be relevant, the State further asserts, as concluded by the Municipal Court, that he in any event lacked the requisite probable cause to make a citizen's arrest on the particular facts of this case. In support of this assertion, the State correctly asserts that Parsons had no idea why police were chasing the fleeing motorcycle. However, by its express language, \u00a7 46-6-502(1), MCA, does not necessarily require in every circumstance that the\n   citizen know the specific offense committed or the specifics of the offense. It merely requires that the citizen have \"probable cause to believe that the person is committing or has committed an offense\" and that \"the existing circumstances require the person's immediate arrest.\" Section 46-6-502(1), MCA. Probable cause is not talismanic. It is no more than knowledge of facts and circumstances \"sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that another person is committing or has committed an offense.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Missoula v.

Those facts alone were sufficient for an objectively reasonable belief that the motorcyclist had not only committed an offense, but further, that he or she was then in the process of committing additional offenses by attempting to elude pursuing police. Probable cause is inherently a question of fact under the totality of the circumstances known. On the record here, a jury could have reasonably concluded that Parsons had probable cause to believe that the motorcyclist had committed an offense and that circumstances required his or her immediate arrest. The jury could have thus further found reasonable doubt as to whether Parsons acted in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard of the safety of others as alleged by the State or, as he asserts, reasonably under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 In further tacit acknowledgement of the relevance of Parsons's citizen's arrest authority and intent, the State asserts that the Municipal Court did not err in any event because Parsons's conduct was clearly unreasonable under the circumstances. However, like\n   probable cause, the question of what constitutes \"reasonable force\" as referenced in \u00a7 46-6-502(1), MCA, is inherently a question of fact under the totality of the circumstances. Regardless of other supportable jury views, the record reflects substantial evidence upon which a jury could have reasonably concluded that Parsons was attempting to effect a citizen's arrest of the fleeing motorcyclist using a mechanism and degree of force reasonable under the circumstances. If so, that factual consideration would have been materially relevant to whether he acted in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard for the safety of others beyond a reasonable doubt as alleged by the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Finally, though acknowledging that Parsons was not attempting to assert his citizen's arrest authority and intent as an affirmative defense, the State repeatedly asserts that the Municipal Court did not err in any event because the authority to make a citizen's arrest did not \"immunize\" Parsons from criminal liability. While we agree, that point of law does not necessarily preclude Parsons's authority and intent to make a citizen's arrest as a factual consideration relevant to the sufficiency of the State's proof of the elements of the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 As a matter of law, proof of the elements of an affirmative defense completely negates otherwise sufficient proof of the essential elements of a charged offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In contrast to an affirmative defense, Parsons merely sought to present evidence and argument on his authority and intent to make a citizen's arrest as a non-affirmative fact defense, i.e., as a relevant factual consideration among others to undermine or rebut the State's proof on the elements of the charged offenses. In particular, Parsons sought to present evidence and argument supported by jury instruction that, rather than in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard of the safety of others, he acted reasonably under the circumstances within his lawful authority to make a citizen's arrest using reasonable force. With appropriate instruction that the authority to make a citizen's arrest does not necessarily preclude criminal liability but is nonetheless a factual matter the jury may consider,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , in determining whether Parsons acted in negligent, willful, or wanton disregard of the safety of others beyond a reasonable doubt as alleged, the jury could have fairly assessed the sufficiency of the State's evidence as a matter of fact without prejudice to either party. Consequently, as a matter of law on\n   the record in this case, Parsons's contemplated assertion of his authority and intent to make a citizen's arrest was not an assertion of\n   an affirmative defense or immunity from criminal liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 The Dissent correctly asserts that \u00a7 46-6-502(2), MCA (\"private person making an arrest shall immediately notify the nearest available law enforcement agency or ... officer and give custody of the person\" thereto), \"does not authorize a private citizen ... to involve himself in an active law enforcement action.\" True. But nor does \u00a7 46-6-502(2), MCA, expressly or implicitly preclude a citizen's arrest when police are pursuing a suspect with intent to arrest but have yet to apprehend him or her under circumstances where, as here, it is uncertain that they will be able to do so. The Dissent erroneously relies on a clearly distinguishable case where the purported private citizen (i.e., out-of-jurisdiction police officer) exceeded any citizen arrest authority by continuing with field sobriety testing of a\n   <em>\n    stopped suspect in custody\n   </em>\n   after local police had arrived and were standing by. In stark contrast, the pursuing police in this case were hardly \"at the scene\" when Parsons stopped the fleeing motorcyclist-they were still chasing and had yet to catch him. If the Legislature is inclined to limit the citizen's arrest authority to better conform to the demands, concerns, or preferences of modern law enforcement, it is certainly free to do so. In the meantime, we must simply construe \u00a7 46-6-502, MCA, as clearly and unequivocally written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 Trial courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions which we will affirm as long the instructions as a whole fully, correctly, and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law.\n   <em>\n    State v.
