At\n   trial, he asserted it was necessary for him to provide the marijuana for his mother, who was in pain and dying of cancer. Mr. Ruelas requests a new trial and argues the trial court erred in three ways: (1) in admitting his postarrest, pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   statements, (2) in requiring a medical expert witness for his necessity defense, and (3) by precluding his medical expert witness from testifying because his proposed testimony was first disclosed after the State rested. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 On November 10, 2015, Sergeant Oscar Garcia stopped Mr. Ruelas for speeding. Mr. Ruelas rolled down his window and gave Sergeant Garcia his license and registration. Sergeant Garcia smelled marijuana coming from the pickup truck. He asked Mr. Ruelas about the smell and asked him to roll down his rear window. Mr. Ruelas complied, and Sergeant Garcia saw a large garbage bag containing marijuana. Sergeant Garcia then arrested Mr. Ruelas for felony possession of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Before advising Mr. Ruelas of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, Sergeant Garcia processed paperwork to impound the truck. He asked Mr. Ruelas who owned the truck. Mr. Ruelas answered, \" 'My sister.' \" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 40. Mr. Ruelas then explained that he was returning to his home in Edwall, Washington, after having cleaned the marijuana. He explained in detail how the marijuana was packaged to make clear to Sergeant Garcia that he was not selling or trafficking it. Mr. Ruelas said he had a medical marijuana card but did not provide one. Sergeant Garcia asked Mr. Ruelas where he had cleaned the marijuana. Mr. Ruelas answered that he grew the marijuana at his home, had taken it to his sister's to clean it, and was in the process of taking it back home. Sergeant Garcia then read Mr. Ruelas his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On February 26, 2016, the State charged Mr. Ruelas with one count of possession of marijuana over 40 grams. Trial was set for May 24, 2016. On May 9, 2016, the parties agreed to continue the trial for Mr.\n   Ruelas to review an offer and prepare motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On June 13, 2016, the trial court held a CrR 3.5 hearing. The court found that Mr. Ruelas's initial pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statement was the result of a routine processing question and that his additional statements were made either spontaneously and not in response to a question likely to produce an incriminating response. The court denied Mr. Ruelas's suppression motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 After the court's ruling, Mr. Ruelas requested a continuance to find an expert witness. Mr. Ruelas informed the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge, we're anticipating that there's a medical marijuana defense on this particular case. And so the Court's aware, there's still the necessity defense and we have an expert witness that I have to retain yet, but who will testify that the amounts that my client had were consistent with the use for the-for himself and the two other people he was providing for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Report of Proceedings (RP) at 29. Trial was reset for August 23, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 On July 20, 2016, Mr. Ruelas requested a second continuance to retain an expert witness, and explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   We are requesting one more continuance of trial. ... I think you understand that this is a medical marijuana case. We do plan on putting on the defense of necessity for going over the allowed limit. We have been in contact or trying to get in contact with Greg Carter. He is going to be our expert witness hopefully to testify at trial; however, he is medical director at St. Luke's and he's very difficult to get in contact with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   RP at 36-37. Trial was reset for October 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 On October 7, 2016, Mr. Ruelas requested a third continuance. He explained, \"There are some medical issues\n   that I think will be coming to light at trial for which we will require an expert.\" RP at 44. He continued, \"If this is indeed going to be ramping up for trial then our search for an expert will actually be fruitful at this point. There was no point in hiring an expert when we were anticipating a possible resolution.\" RP at 45. The trial court denied Mr. Ruelas's third continuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 On October 18, 2016, Mr. Ruelas filed his final witness list. The list did not include a medical expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Trial began on October 25, 2016. The court addressed motions in limine and questioned Mr. Ruelas about his defense of medical necessity. Mr. Ruelas explained that he was asserting the common law defense of medical necessity, not the statutory defense under the Washington State Medical Use of Cannabis Act, chapter 69.51A RCW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State objected to the defense on the basis that Mr. Ruelas could not lay a proper foundation without having a medical expert testify. The court agreed, and reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] says, \"The defendant will be required to show that there is no equally effective legal drug.\" You would have to have, I believe, medical knowledge as to what legal drugs are out there on the market that may or may not be as effective as to treat the symptoms that marijuana has in the case. I feel that that element and perhaps one of the others would require the expert testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   RP at 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 The State put on its evidence and rested. Mr. Ruelas then told the court that Dr. Carter was available to testify telephonically, possibly at noon. Mr. Ruelas said that Dr. Carter had reviewed Mr. Ruelas's mother's medical records, and would testify, \"given [her] medical condition [that she was dying of cancer ] ... there was no other alternative ... for treating [her] symptoms ....\" RP at 217-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b612 The State objected:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Mr. Ruelas has] had eight months with the case. We have no discovery with regards to this potential witness being even an option or that he's going to testify. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ... The fact that he's not available to come in and testify, that's another issue. The State would object to any telephonic testimony. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   So the fact he has in his possession 1800 grams of marijuana, ... it is quite shocking that he wants to throw this name out and surprise the second day of trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   RP at 219-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b613 Mr. Ruelas responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I'm not inviting this, but I think the appropriate remedy is not the exclusion of the witnesses [sic], that might be viewed as being an extraordinary remedy and should not be taken. I think the Government, if they need time to prepare for this witness, can ask for a continuance to adequately prepare for the witness. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   RP at 221.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b614 The court weighed whether to continue the trial or to preclude Dr. Carter from testifying:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [W]e just heard about this doctor this morning, day two of trial, and I do think it's significantly late. The case was filed ... eight months ago. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ... And I appreciate this witness is key to the defense and if the witness could testify as to what I've been told he'll testify. That would make that defense available. The necessity defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   And I do think [the late disclosure is] a big problem and I don't think the Court has any alternative but to exclude this witness. I appreciate that would ... prejudice the defendant's ability to present a defense, but it's not any type of an unfair\n   prejudice to the defendant because he and his counsel have had a long time with which to get the witnesses [sic] ....\n   <em>\n    And it would ... impose an extreme burden on the Court to have a delay and it would result in substantial delay.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    ... The problem is there's two sides in the case that should have a right to a fair trial, and that would include the prosecution. The prosecution ... may want to bring in their own witness. They may want to think about after they talk to this witness, what he says, and conduct some discovery to see whether there may be some other witness that might disagree with this Dr. Carter.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   And to allow the witness to testify and to proceed with trial is unfair to the prosecution in the case here. ... And I don't know what the Court of Appeals will do ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   ... [But reversing under these circumstances] would almost render it impossible for a Trial Court to effectively manage a court calendar and do their job. It would, I think, encourage lawyers to not do their job.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   So I'm excluding the witness. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   RP at 224, 229-32 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b615 The trial resumed, closing arguments were given, and the jury found Mr. Ruelas guilty. He appealed, and we granted oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b616 During oral argument, Mr. Ruelas conceded the first issue on appeal. Mr. Ruelas conceded that his pre-\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   statements to Sergeant Garcia were not prejudicial. The statements were consistent with his theory of the case-that the marijuana was for his mother who was dying of cancer. Mr. Ruelas even emphasized these statements during his cross-examination of Sergeant Garcia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A. THE NECESSITY DEFENSE REQUIRED MEDICAL TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b617 Mr. Ruelas argues the trial court denied him his constitutional right to present a defense when it erroneously\n   ruled that a medical expert was required for him to assert the defense of necessity. Mr. Ruelas's constitutional argument fails because the trial court correctly determined that his necessity defense required medical testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b618 \"Generally, necessity is available as a defense when the physical forces of nature or the pressure of circumstances cause the accused to take unlawful action to avoid a harm which social policy deems greater than the harm resulting from a violation of the law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The four elements are: (1) the defendant reasonably believed the commission of the crime was necessary to avoid or minimize the harm, (2) the harm sought to be avoided was greater than the harm resulting from a violation of the law, (3) the threatened harm was not brought about by the defendant, and (4) no reasonable legal alternative was available that is as effective as marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20P.3d%20472\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pittman\n   </em>\n   , 88 Wash.

NO ABUSE OF DISCRETION FOR PRECLUDING WITNESS TESTIMONY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b622 Mr. Ruelas argues the trial court erred in precluding Dr. Carter from testifying.

The court determined that a substantial trial continuance would burden the court's ability to manage its own trial schedule and encourage late witness disclosures. We note that the jury had been empaneled and it had heard most of the evidence. A substantial\n   trial continuance would have required the jury to return weeks or months later after the State interviewed Dr. Carter and then procured its own medical expert. By that time, the jury likely would have forgotten much of the evidence the State presented. The trial court reasonably concluded that a lesser sanction would not be effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b626\n   <em>\n    Impact of witness preclusion on evidence and case outcome\n   </em>\n   : The trial court found that precluding Dr. Carter from testifying would prevent Mr. Ruelas from presenting his necessity defense. The court further concluded that this prejudice was not unfair because Mr. Ruelas had eight months to obtain a medical expert. We agree. We also question whether precluding Dr. Carter from testifying impacted the outcome of the case. Although Dr. Carter would have testified that marijuana was medically necessary for Mr. Ruelas's mother, Mr. Ruelas would have been hard-pressed to justify why she needed 1,800 grams of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b627\n   <em>\n    Prosecution surprise or prejudice\n   </em>\n   : The trial court found that the State was both surprised and prejudiced by Dr. Carter's proposed testimony. Mr. Ruelas never formally disclosed Dr. Carter as a witness until the second day of trial. The State had no reason to obtain its own medical expert for the trial. Had the trial court allowed Dr. Carter to testify, the State likely would have needed a substantial trial continuance, which risked the jury forgetting much of the testimony it heard in the State's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b628\n   <em>\n    Culpability of violation:\n   </em>\n   The trial court did not make a finding whether Mr. Ruelas's late disclosure was willful/bad faith. Our review of the record convinces us that Mr. Ruelas did not act willfully or in bad faith. Mr. Ruelas explained that it was difficult to obtain his mother's medical records, which Dr. Carter needed to review. Mr. Ruelas also expressed difficulty in communicating with Dr. Carter, who he described as very busy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b629 Nevertheless, the weight of the first three factors are such that we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it precluded Dr. Carter from testifying. Mr.\n   Ruelas does not cite any authority that holds that a trial court abuses its discretion when it precludes an expert disclosed during trial from testifying.
