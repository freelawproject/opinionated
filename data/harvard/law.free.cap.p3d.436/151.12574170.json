(Pharmacy) and SG Nursing Home LLC dba Kolob Care &amp; Rehabilitation of St. George (Nursing Home) entered into a written agreement for Pharmacy to become Nursing Home's exclusive provider of all pharmacy-related products and services. Soon after signing the contract, however, Nursing Home attempted to cancel its agreement with Pharmacy, apparently realizing that it was still contractually committed to a different provider. Pharmacy then sued Nursing Home, asserting claims for breach of contract as well as various fraud-related causes of action. Nursing Home defended the case, in part, by arguing that the parties had been mutually mistaken about Nursing Home's ability to terminate its contract with its existing provider, and asserting that the parties had therefore never actually entered into an enforceable contract. Prior to trial, on Nursing Home's motion, the court determined that Pharmacy chose to \"elect\" its breach of contract remedies and that it would not be permitted to further pursue its fraud-based remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The case proceeded to trial, and a jury determined that Nursing Home breached the contract and that Pharmacy was entitled to over $143,000 in damages, plus attorney fees, even though the jury instructions made no mention of attorney fees. However, the jury also determined that the parties had, in fact, been mutually mistaken about the terms of Nursing Home's contract with its previous provider. Believing that the jury's answers to the questions on the special verdict form were inconsistent, the trial court resubmitted the case to the jury. After briefly re-deliberating, the jury affirmed its breach finding, but changed its mutual mistake finding. It also amended its damages award by increasing the amount of consequential damages while eliminating any mention of attorney fees. Following trial, the court refused to award Pharmacy any prejudgment interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Both parties appeal. Nursing Home asserts that the trial court erred in resubmitting the case to the jury. Pharmacy asserts that the trial court erred by excluding one of its expert witnesses, by dismissing its fraud-based claims prior to trial, and by failing to award prejudgment interest. We affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the trial court's judgment, and remand the case for the limited purpose of entering judgment in favor of Pharmacy on its breach of contract claim in an amount consistent with the jury's original damages award (less attorney fees).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In August 2009, Adam Katschke and a business partner formed Pharmacy. Pharmacy began as an \"open-door\" pharmacy, which is a \"typical retail community pharmacy\" that is open to the public. After operating as an\n   open-door pharmacy for several months, Katschke and his business partner decided that they wanted to grow their business, and in 2010 started contacting various entities in southern Utah with the goal of becoming a \"closed-door\" pharmacy. A \"closed-door\" pharmacy typically is not open to the public but, instead, serves as a dedicated pharmacy for one or more entities such as long-term care facilities, nursing homes, or assisted living centers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 One of the entities that Pharmacy contacted was Nursing Home, a facility that billed itself as \"the largest skilled nursing facility in Southern Utah.\" When Pharmacy initially contacted Nursing Home about becoming its pharmacy, Nursing Home already had an existing agreement with a different provider, but was considering a change due to \"service issues\" it was experiencing with that provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In March 2010, Katschke met with a representative (Manager) of Apex Healthcare Solutions, LLC, the company that owned Nursing Home and had supervisory authority over its employees. During the meeting, Manager indicated to Katschke that Nursing Home was interested in utilizing Pharmacy's services, but that Katschke had to be the specific pharmacist assigned to the account; no one else would do. Katschke indicated that he would be willing to make arrangements to serve as the face of Pharmacy in its relationship with Nursing Home, and to personally work with Nursing Home during the contemplated closed-door contract. Although they had apparently come close to agreement on material terms, Nursing Home and Pharmacy did not sign a contract at that meeting. According to Katschke, Nursing Home wanted Pharmacy \"to go write it up and give [Nursing Home] some proofs\" of a proposed contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After meeting with Katschke, Manager contacted Nursing Home's existing provider to determine whether it could terminate its contract. After that conversation, Manager \"was under the impression that [Nursing Home was] on a month-to-month contract\" with its existing provider, and that Nursing Home would be able to terminate its contract and transition to a different provider as early as June 28, 2010. However, Nursing Home did not terminate its contract at that time. And Katschke, for his part, was unaware of the terms of Nursing Home's contract with its other provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Katschke also owned and operated another pharmacy in Nevada (Nevada Pharmacy), and Katschke was the sole pharmacist staffing that pharmacy. To honor Nursing Home's request that he be the face of Pharmacy for any relationship with Nursing Home, Katschke determined that Nevada Pharmacy would need to hire another pharmacist to operate it. Soon after the March 2010 meeting, believing that a contractual relationship with Nursing Home was imminent, Nevada Pharmacy made that hire, and agreed to retain a second pharmacist for a 36-month term beginning on May 1, 2010, at a rate of $45 per hour for a 40-hour week plus various benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Meanwhile, Katschke began to renovate Pharmacy in order to come into compliance with regulations governing closed-door pharmacies. This involved adding shelving, countertops, pharmacy software, an alarm system, and a refrigerator. Pharmacy completed these improvements in April 2010, and incurred over $33,000 in expenses in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 On May 25, 2010, after some additional negotiations, Katschke and Manager-on behalf of their respective entities-signed a contract whereunder Pharmacy would become Nursing Home's exclusive closed-door pharmacy beginning on June 28, 2010 and continuing for an initial one-year term. The agreement contained a provision allowing for automatic renewal of the agreement for additional one-year periods unless, at least ninety days prior to the expiration of the current contractual term, either party provided the other with written notice of its intent not to renew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 That same day, after the contract had been signed, Nursing Home's administrator (Administrator) contacted the existing provider to let it know that Nursing Home was \"going in a different direction.\" The provider responded by expressing its view that Nursing Home did not have the right to cancel the contract. Administrator informed Katschke\n   of the issue in an email, but initially downplayed it, stating that he thought he could \"get this resolved within a day or two.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Several days later, on June 7, however, Administrator sent another email to Katschke informing him that \"apparently we are not going to be able to get out of\" the contract with the other provider \"until the end of October [2010],\" despite just having signed a contract with Pharmacy. Administrator further explained that \"[w]e ... would like to do business with you but right now it looks like we don't have a choice other than to take a step back, at least for a while.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 Later that month, after apparently making the determination that it was bound by its contract with the other provider, Nursing Home made the decision to renew its contract with that provider. The renewed contract was set to commence on July 1, 2010, just three days after its contract with Pharmacy was set to commence, and was renewable in one-year terms thereafter. Administrator gave Katschke the bad news on July 11, 2010, via email: \"[W]e have decided to stick with [the other provider] for at least another year.\" Administrator's email did not mention Nursing Home's contract with Pharmacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614 Later that year, in October 2010, Pharmacy sued Nursing Home for (among other claims) breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, constructive fraud, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615 As the case proceeded to trial, Pharmacy informed the court and Nursing Home of its intention to call a pharmacist (Pharmacy Expert) as an expert witness. Pharmacy Expert had experience dealing with closed-door pharmacies, and Pharmacy wanted him to testify about \"the number of years for which [Pharmacy] can recover damages\" for lost profits. Pharmacy Expert's proposed testimony included the opinion that the parties likely would have renewed the contract for at least six years. Nursing Home moved to exclude that testimony, arguing that Pharmacy Expert's analysis was unhelpful and unreliable. The trial court granted Nursing Home's motion, reasoning that \"there are not sufficient facts in this case to support the proposed testimony\" that Nursing Home \"would have renewed its pharmacy provider agreement with [Pharmacy] for at least six years had [Nursing Home] begun using [Pharmacy] for its pharmaceutical needs in 2010.\" Therefore, the trial court determined that Pharmacy Expert's proposed testimony should be excluded because it would not be helpful to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616 Also prior to trial, Nursing Home asked the trial court to force Pharmacy to \"elect its remedy,\" arguing that Pharmacy \"is seeking to recover two categories of damages that are wholly contradictory to one another.\" Nursing Home argued that \"there must be an election of remedies in cases involving contracts and deceitful inducement because the recovery of both lost profits and reliance damages constitutes a double recovery.\" The trial court agreed with Nursing Home, determining that Pharmacy \"has chosen to affirm its contract with [Nursing Home] and has elected money damages as the remedy for [Nursing Home's] alleged breach of that contract.\" From that premise, the court concluded that \"the doctrine of election of remedies and the economic loss rule preclude [Pharmacy] from pursuing its tort claims against [Nursing Home] for fraud in the inducement, constructive fraud, intentional misrepresentation[,] and negligent misrepresentation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617 The case then proceeded to jury trial on Pharmacy's claim for breach of contract. Pharmacy did not call a damages expert, choosing instead to rely on Katschke's testimony regarding damages. Katschke initially testified that Pharmacy would have realized $401,280 in profit during the first year of its contractual relationship with Nursing Home. Katschke arrived at that figure by starting with the pricing terms of the contract, making certain assumptions about the number of patients and other variables, and computing a one-year profit estimate. On cross-examination, Katschke acknowledged that his figure did not include certain additional overhead costs, which he estimated to be approximately $43,000. In the end, then, Katschke testified that Pharmacy sustained approximately $358,000 in lost profits during the relevant one-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618 Nursing Home countered that testimony with a damages expert (Damages Expert), who was employed as a financial analyst for Nursing Home's existing provider's parent company, which Damages Expert characterized as the \"largest long-term care or closed-door pharmacy operator in the country.\" Damages expert offered his opinion that, not only did Pharmacy not sustain any lost profits, Pharmacy would have\n   <em>\n    lost\n   </em>\n   over $127,000 had it been Nursing Home's exclusive provider of pharmacy services for the one-year term of the contract. Damages Expert based his calculation on an analysis of the revenues received and expenses incurred during the year in question by Nursing Home's existing provider, and then adjusting that analysis based on various perceived differences between Pharmacy and the existing provider. On cross-examination, Pharmacy's counsel called into question several of the assumptions that Damages Expert made during his analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619 At the conclusion of the trial, Pharmacy argued to the jury that Nursing Home breached the contract by deciding \"to stick with [the other provider] for at least another year.\" Nursing Home, in contrast, argued that it was mistaken about its ability to terminate its contract with its other provider, and therefore the affirmative defense of mutual mistake applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620 Upon completion of closing arguments, the trial court submitted a special verdict form to the jury that contained a series of questions. The verdict form was nine pages long and quite complex, and after some of the questions it instructed the jury to proceed in one fashion if its answer was \"yes,\" but to proceed in a different fashion if its answer was \"no.\" In particular, after the question about mutual mistake, the verdict form stated as follows: \"If you answered 'yes' [that mutual mistake existed], please proceed to the next question.\" After the next question, the jury was instructed, regardless of the answer, to \"[p]roceed to\" the question \"on the following page\" and to complete the remainder of the verdict form. The instructions did not inform the jury that, if it found the existence of a mutual mistake, the parties' contract may be considered unenforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b621 After deliberation, the jury found that Nursing Home entered into and breached a contract with Pharmacy. However, the jury also found that Nursing Home's \"ability to terminate its contract with [the other provider] was a basic assumption or an important fact, upon which both\" parties based their contract, and that, at the time the contract was formed, both Pharmacy and Nursing Home \"were mistaken regarding [Nursing Home's] ability to terminate its contract\" with the other provider. In addition, the jury found that Pharmacy sustained $143,989\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in \"Lost Profits,\" but that Pharmacy did not sustain any amount of \"Consequential Damages.\" After a line entitled, \"Total Damage Award,\" the jury wrote the phrase \"$143,989 plus attorney fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b622 After reviewing the special verdict form in open court, the trial court determined that \"there are inconsistencies here.\" The court explained to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   An affirmative defense to the breach of contract is mutual mistake, and you found that there was [a] mutual mistake. If there was a mutual mistake made, then there was no contract. It never formed, and so you couldn't award damages. And rather than have this go up on appeal with that instruction, I would like you to go back and consider if, in fact, you found by clear and convincing evidence that there was [a] mutual mistake ..., then you can't find a contract and find damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 The court then referenced the jury's hand-written award of \"attorney fees,\" and made the following statement to the still-empaneled jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   As a matter of fact, the only time attorney[ ] fees can be awarded is if it's in the contract or if there's a statute. There was no statute that would be involved, and if you read-and I'm sure that you did-the contract did not have an attorney[ ] fees clause. If there had been one, we would have been arguing about it and about the amount. And since it's not, your suggestion here plus attorney[ ] fees is also [-] I guess as a matter of law I can't do that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 The court then resubmitted the case to the jury. The court did not restrict the number of questions the jury could reconsider; rather, the court simply gave the jury another complete copy of the special verdict form, along with the \"old one to review,\" and sent the jury back into the jury room. After re-deliberation, the jury reaffirmed its finding that Pharmacy and Nursing Home entered into a contract and that Nursing Home had breached that contract. However, the jury changed its prior finding of mutual mistake, this time answering \"no\" to the question of whether Nursing Home's \"ability to terminate its contract with [the other provider] was a basic assumption, or an important fact, upon which both\" parties based their contract. The jury also amended its damages award. The jury again found that Pharmacy suffered \"Lost Profits\" of $143,989, but this time-after the court informed it that attorney fees were not recoverable-found that Pharmacy had also suffered \"Consequential Damages\" of $120,000. The second damages verdict contained no mention of attorney fees. After it returned the second verdict form, the jury was discharged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 After trial, Pharmacy submitted a proposed judgment calculating its total damages as $603,980.60, apparently arriving at that figure after taking the jury's award and adding interest at a rate of 1.5% per month, pursuant to a term of the contract. Nursing Home objected to the proposed judgment, arguing that Pharmacy's proposed judgment was \"based on an improper prejudgment interest rate.\" Specifically, Nursing Home asserted that the contract's rate of 1.5% per month applied only to penalties on \"unpaid balances\" and \"invoices\" and did not apply to the jury's damages award because Pharmacy \"never actually provided any drugs or medical supplies to [Nursing Home's] patients.\" Nursing Home also argued that if prejudgment interest were appropriate, it should be calculated at 10% per annum. The trial court, however, determined that an award of prejudgment interest was inappropriate, no matter the rate, because the jury could not have reached its judgment amount using \"fixed standards of valuation,\" and must instead have reached its verdict based on \"its best judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b626 Both parties appeal, and together raise four issues for our review. Nursing Home raises one issue in its appeal, and Pharmacy raises three issues in its cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b627 Nursing Home argues that the trial court should not have resubmitted the case to the jury after reviewing the jury's first special verdict form. As we explain below,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46, we review this issue for abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b628 In its cross-appeal, Pharmacy first argues that the trial court should have allowed Pharmacy Expert to testify. \"We review a district court's decision to admit or exclude expert witness testimony for an abuse of discretion and will not reverse that decision unless it exceeds the limits of reasonability.\"\n   <em>\n    Conocophillips Co. v.

As Nursing Home sees it, the trial court could have \"reconciled\" the jury's answers to the questions, and therefore should not have sent the jury back for additional deliberation. To support its argument, Nursing Home cites several Utah cases instructing trial courts not to \"presume inconsistency\" in a jury's answers to questions on a special verdict form; instead, \"[w]here the possibility of inconsistency in jury interrogatories or special verdicts exists,\" courts are instructed to \"seek to reconcile the answers if possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennion v.

After a trial court discharges the jury, it is no longer possible to ask the jury about any arguable inconsistencies in its answers to the written questions on the special verdict form. In that situation, rather than re-convene a new jury and put the parties and the court to the time and expense of a second trial, trial courts should of course make every effort to view the special verdict form in a way that permits each of the answers to be reconciled with the others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b633 But we do not think that this same rule should apply-at least not with the same force-in a situation where an arguable inconsistency is brought to the trial court's attention while the jury remains empaneled. In that situation, it is still possible to ask the jury to clarify any inconsistencies in the verdict form. This case presents the question of whether, and to what extent, a trial court has the discretion to ask a still-empaneled jury to redeliberate to resolve perceived inconsistencies in a special verdict form. For the reasons we explain, we hold that, where a jury remains empaneled, a trial court need not strain quite so mightily to reconcile the answers on the verdict form as it must after the jury has been discharged, and that, in such a situation, trial courts possess discretion to both (a) determine whether an inconsistency exists in the jury's verdict, and (b) determine whether to resubmit the case to the jury for re-deliberation to resolve the perceived inconsistency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 The first issue that we must confront involves determining whether inconsistency is present in a jury verdict, and in calibrating the breadth of the discretion given to the trial court in making that determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shaun P.

In such\n   cases, because the body that rendered the verdict remains available for consultation, a powerful option exists that does not exist later: the court can simply ask the jury what it meant. Exercising this option allows the court to go right to the source for clarification and remove any doubt about the jury's true intentions. After the jury makes clear its true intentions, there is no longer any need for judges or attorneys to spin their wheels speculating about the jury's true intent or about the verdict's various possible meanings, or arguing about whether the verdict can (or cannot) be reconciled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b637 In order to breathe life into this approach, however, trial courts must be given a measure of discretion in determining whether inconsistencies are present in a particular verdict. This is so for at least two reasons. First, by definition, such an issue will arise in a time-sensitive setting-with the jury still empaneled, there will not usually be time for comprehensive research or briefing on the issue. In most such instances, the court will be assisted only by some brief and improvised oral argument from counsel. The court is in the position of having to decide, more or less on the spot, whether the jury's answers are inconsistent, because once the court discharges the jury, it is no longer possible to seek the jury's input.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this situation, there seems very little possible harm (as discussed further below,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b644-45) in asking the jury to re-deliberate, but there are almost certainly substantial benefits (e.g., clarity) to be gained, which potential benefits will evaporate as soon as the jury is discharged. In close cases, where facial or potential inconsistencies are present, trial courts should be encouraged to seek the jury's input while they still can, without having to worry about being reversed on appeal because, technically speaking and after comprehensive research and briefing, the original verdict turned out to be reconcilable after all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veranda Beach Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535072\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/1364/#p1381\">\n    936 F.2d at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that, \"if there was room for doubt\" about whether the verdict contained inconsistencies, \"the trial court should be granted substantial latitude\" to seek the jury's input).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b638 Second, the trial court will by that point have sat through the entire trial, and will have observed the jury's behavior and attitude. The trial court will also have approved the questions posed to the jury, and will have also provided the jury its instructions that it used to interpret and fill out the verdict form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these reasons, courts have recognized that the trial judge is \"in the best position to determine whether the answers reflect confusion or uncertainty,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712711\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/813/#p821\">\n    151 F.3d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified), and \"is in an excellent position to evaluate whether the jury will likely be able to resolve [the] uncertainty with proper guidance,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richard v.

For all of these reasons, the trial court is in an advantaged position to be able to discern-even in a time-sensitive setting-whether the jury's answers are inconsistent in a way that might be illuminated by additional jury input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b639 We therefore hold that-as long as the jury that rendered the verdict remains empaneled-a trial court is not under the same obligation to \"reconcile\" a jury's answers as it is after the jury is discharged. A trial court may seek the jury's input if the jury's answers are potentially inconsistent, or are inconsistent under any reasonable view.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Veranda Beach Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535072\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/936/1364/#p1381\">\n    936 F.2d at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a trial court may seek the jury's input \"if there [is] room for doubt\" about whether the verdict is inconsistent).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b640 Moreover, trial courts possess the latitude to seek the jury's input regarding potential inconsistencies, regardless of the particular form the verdict takes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b641 In some situations, trial courts-by force of rule-can (and sometimes must) seek the input of a still-empaneled jury regarding potential inconsistencies in its verdict. For instance, when a jury is asked to render a \"general verdict\" along with \"written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict,\" a trial court \"shall return the jury for further consideration\" if its \"answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

Instead, the trial court submitted a special verdict form to the jury. Special verdicts are governed by rule 49(a), not by rule 49(b), and rule 49(a) is silent with regard to whether a trial court can, or must, send a jury back for re-deliberation if its answers to the questions on the special verdict form are inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

First of all, the verdict form contained an error, in that it did not tell the jury to stop its deliberations if it found the presence of mutual mistake. Second, and relatedly, while the jury heard plenty of testimony about Nursing Home's misunderstanding of the terms of its contract with its previous provider, neither attorney spent much time discussing mutual mistake, or its potential ramifications, during closing argument. Upon reviewing the verdict, especially under the time pressures associated with the situation, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by seeking the jury's input for clarification. We find no fault in the trial court's conclusion that the verdict was potentially inconsistent, nor with the trial court's decision to ask the jury to confirm that the result was indeed what it intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b651 And we likewise perceive no infirmities with the trial court's statement to the jury regarding the potential inconsistency. The trial court objectively explained to the jury\n   what the inconsistency was-specifically, that the jury's finding of mutual mistake was potentially inconsistent with its findings of breach and damages-and asked the jury to re-deliberate on those issues. We perceive nothing in the trial court's statement to the jury that could be interpreted, even subtly, as the trial court placing its thumb on the scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b652 Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion when it asked the jury to re-deliberate regarding the inconsistency in the verdict form between the jury's mutual mistake finding and the jury's breach and damages findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b653 We reach a different conclusion, however, with regard to the trial court's decision to allow the jury to re-deliberate regarding the amount of damages. There was not even a potential inconsistency in the jury's answers on this issue, and therefore there was no basis to ask the jury for additional input.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b654 In its initial verdict, the jury awarded Pharmacy $143,989 in \"Lost Profits\" damages and $0 in \"Consequential Damages.\" In addition, the jury hand-wrote the words \"plus attorney fees.\" In connection with its discussion that the jury's finding of mutual mistake and breach of contract was inconsistent, the trial court also explained to the jury that the court could award attorney fees only if authorized by statute or by contract, and that neither situation was applicable. After learning that information, and after its second round of deliberations, the jury amended its consequential damages award, increasing it from $0 to $120,000, but this time did not hand-write in any award of \"attorney fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b655 There was no plausible inconsistency regarding the jury's initial findings regarding the amount of damages, and therefore there was nothing for the jury to reconsider upon re-deliberation regarding the amount of damages. The jury very clearly and unambiguously determined that Pharmacy was entitled to $143,989 in lost profits, $0 in consequential damages, and that the jury wished for Pharmacy to also recover its attorney fees.

Pharmacy disagrees, and asserts on appeal that one of the primary issues in the case was whether it was entitled to damages for one year, or whether it was also entitled to damages for additional renewal periods. Pharmacy contends that Pharmacy Expert's testimony would have established that closed-door pharmacy contracts, like the one at issue here, \"are almost always one-year contracts with auto-renewal clauses that are honored by the parties,\" and that Pharmacy Expert would have testified about \"the expected length of similar closed[-]door pharmaceutical agreements.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b661 But on the facts of this case, the parties never had an opportunity to contemplate whether they might want to renew the contract at the conclusion of the first year, because Nursing Home almost immediately decided not to continue its contractual relationship with Pharmacy. As noted above, either party had the right, pursuant to the non-renewal provisions of the contract, to end the contractual relationship after the first year. Nursing Home exercised this right-albeit in somewhat unconventional fashion-by email in July 2010, before the contractual relationship ever really got off the ground. Under these circumstances, there was therefore no need for expert testimony postulating about whether, and for how long, the parties might have renewed or extended the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b662 Thus, there existed a sound basis for the trial court's conclusion that Pharmacy Expert's proposed testimony would not have been helpful to the jury in determining any disputed issues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balderas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403265\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/138/75/\">\n    2006 UT App 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 27,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8403265\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/138/75/\">\n    138 P.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and was therefore not \"reliably applied to the facts\" of the case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah R.

The trial court concluded that Pharmacy was required to either affirm the contract and seek damages for breach, or avoid the contract and seek reliance and/or punitive damages for fraud. The court then found that Pharmacy chose \"to affirm its contract with [Nursing Home]\" and \"elected money damages as the remedy for [Nursing Home's] alleged breach\" of the contract.

The trial court properly asked the jury to reconsider its potentially inconsistent answers regarding mutual mistake, breach, and damages, but the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to re-deliberate regarding the amount of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   \u00b688 With regard to Pharmacy's cross-appeal, we conclude that the trial court acted within its discretion in excluding the testimony of Pharmacy Expert. We further conclude that the trial court should not have dismissed Pharmacy's fraud-based claims based on the election of remedies doctrine, but nonetheless properly dismissed those claims under the economic loss rule. Finally, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined not to award prejudgment interest on Pharmacy's damages award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \u00b689 We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's orders, vacate the trial court's judgment, and remand the case to the trial court for the limited purpose of entering judgment in favor of Pharmacy on its breach of contract claim in an amount consistent with the jury's original damages award ($143,989 in lost profits, and $0 in consequential damages), but without attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Indeed, in its post-verdict musings, the trial court stated that \"[p]erhaps on this one we should have said if you find mutual mistake ... stop your deliberations, sign the jury verdict form and return it.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    While this figure is certainly within the range of damages discussed by Katschke and Damages Expert, it is unclear from the record how this figure was derived.
