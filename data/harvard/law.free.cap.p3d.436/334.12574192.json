Specifically, Defendant claims ineffective assistance of counsel by reason of counsel's alleged failure to adequately explain the immigration consequences\n   of his guilty plea. Defendant asserts that counsel's ineffective assistance precluded him from entering his plea knowingly and voluntarily. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Defendant is a lawful permanent resident of the United States. In 2016, the State charged Defendant with the purchase, transfer, possession, or use of a firearm by a restricted person,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   a third degree felony (the Firearm Charge),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-10-503\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-10-503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(a) (LexisNexis 2017);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, a third degree felony (the Drug Possession Charge),\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-10-503\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37-8(1)(a)(iii) (Supp. 2017); and possession of drug paraphernalia, a class B misdemeanor,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-10-503\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 58-37a-5(1)(b) (2016). With the assistance of counsel (Plea Counsel), Defendant pled guilty to the Firearm Charge. In exchange, the State dismissed the remaining two charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 In support of his plea, Defendant signed a statement acknowledging that he understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty. The statement included the following section:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Immigration/Deportation:\n   </strong>\n   I understand that if I am not a United States citizen, my plea(s) today may, or even will, subject me to deportation under United States Immigration laws and regulations, or otherwise adversely affect my immigration status, which may include permanently barring my re-entry into the United States. I understand that if I have questions about the effect of my plea on my immigration status, I should consult with an immigration attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the bottom of Defendant's signed statement, Plea Counsel certified that she had discussed Defendant's statement with him and that she believed he fully understood its contents. Although no mention was made of the immigration ramifications of the guilty plea at the subsequent plea hearing, it does appear-and Defendant acknowledges-that the district court complied with rule 11 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure when it accepted his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4 Two days after pleading guilty, Defendant says he received a letter from the United States Department of Homeland Security. The letter referenced Defendant's guilty plea in the current case and notified him that Homeland Security had probable cause to remove him from the United States. Defendant immediately wrote to the district court requesting to \"recant\" his guilty plea. He stated that he had not been advised that pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge would adversely affect his immigration status. Once the district court appointed new counsel for Defendant, he filed a motion to withdraw Defendant's plea, arguing that it \"was not knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily entered\" and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5 Defendant and Plea Counsel both testified at the subsequent evidentiary hearing. Plea Counsel testified that she had consulted with an immigration attorney regarding the immigration implications of Defendant pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge. She stated that the immigration attorney had provided her with a \"pretty detailed\" written analysis of Defendant's case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which analysis she recounted from memory:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   His analysis of that was that [the Drug Possession Charge] was an aggravated felony, [the Firearm Charge] was not an aggravated felony; however [it] was a charge that would render an individual inadmissible, so there were immigration consequences stemming from both charges. One charge had more serious consequences for immigration purposes than the other.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plea Counsel explained that it was her understanding that an \"aggravated felony\" charge would result in Defendant's immediate deportation, whereas a charge that rendered the Defendant \"inadmissible\" meant that he would be unable to adjust his status-apply for citizenship, for example-but not necessarily that he would be deported. Plea Counsel further testified that she had visited Defendant more than once to discuss the immigration implications of pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge. Each time, Plea Counsel brought the immigration attorney's written analysis to help facilitate those discussions. It was Plea Counsel's opinion that she had covered the immigration issue with Defendant in a \"complete manner.\" Specifically, they had discussed that both the Firearm and Drug Possession Charges carried immigration consequences, but that the Drug Possession Charge was likely to carry more adverse immigration consequences than the Firearm Charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 6 Next, Defendant testified that Plea Counsel had discussed possible immigration consequences with him, but that it was his understanding that a conviction on the Firearm Charge was \"unlikely\" to result in his deportation. He testified that if he had understood that he was \"likely\" to be deported as a result of pleading guilty to the charge, he would not have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 7 At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court concluded that Plea Counsel had not been ineffective in representing Defendant-she had done \"her due diligence\" in consulting the immigration attorney and had \"explained [the immigration ramifications] very, very well.\" The court further found that Defendant had entered the guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 8 Defendant first argues that the district court erred in concluding that Plea Counsel had not rendered ineffective assistance when she advised him of the possible immigration ramifications of pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge. \"When confronted with ineffective assistance of counsel claims, we review a lower court's purely factual findings for clear error, but we review the application of the law to the facts for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Archuleta v.

Because Defendant's second argument-that he did not enter the plea knowingly and voluntarily-appears to be predicated solely on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and Defendant does not challenge the district court's factual findings that supported its conclusion, our determination of Defendant's first claim essentially resolves his second claim.

He asserts that he \"should have been told straight-up that if he entered a plea of guilty to the [Firearm Charge], he would be deemed 'deportable' and without any possibility for equitable relief.\" Contending that pleading guilty to either the Firearm or Drug Possession charge would result in his deportation, as evidenced by the letter from Homeland Security he claims to have received, he argues that Plea Counsel should have advised him to reject the plea deal and to take his chances at trial, as slim as they might be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, Defendant argues that Plea Counsel's inexperience in the field of immigration law prevented her from properly informing him of the possible adverse immigration consequences of pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 Conversely, the State argues that Plea Counsel was required to notify Defendant only that pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge carried the risk of negative immigration consequences. In any event, the State argues that the district court noted that Plea Counsel consulted an immigration attorney and that her analysis was sound.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As explained by the State, \"the firearm felony was preferable to the drug felony from an immigration standpoint.

First, because the determination of whether the Firearm Charge constitutes an \"aggravated felony\" for immigration purposes is neither \"succinct\" nor \"straightforward,\" Plea Counsel was obligated to inform Defendant only that pleading guilty to the Firearm Charge carried immigration risks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jelashovic v.

Plea Counsel testified that it was her understanding \"there were immigration consequences stemming from both charges,\" which she explained to Defendant. Defendant testified that it was his understanding that it was \"unlikely\" that he would be deported if he pled guilty to the Firearm Charge. This testimony demonstrates that Plea Counsel did advise him that there was at least some risk of negative immigration consequences to pleading guilty. As such, Plea Counsel \"did her due diligence,\" in the words of the district court, and even exceeded the duty imposed by\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   by consulting an immigration attorney to determine what the likely immigration risks would be in Defendant's particular case and then sharing that information with Defendant, rather than merely inviting him to consult with an immigration attorney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 16 Second, the plea statement that Plea Counsel discussed with Defendant and that Defendant signed also warned, with our emphasis, of the potential risk of deportation: \"I understand that if I am not a United States citizen, my plea(s)\n   <em>\n    may, or even will, subject me to deportation\n   </em>\n   under United States immigration laws and regulations, or otherwise adversely affect my immigration status.\" Defendant therefore cannot claim that he was unaware that his guilty plea could possibly result in his deportation when the statement he signed and said he understood clearly indicated as much.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Gil v.
