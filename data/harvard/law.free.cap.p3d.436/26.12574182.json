This case is before us for a second time. In the first appeal, we reversed the trial court's dismissal of the case on justiciability grounds and remanded for the trial court to determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to declarations that the atmosphere and other natural resources are trust resources that the state has a fiduciary obligation to protect.\n   <em>\n    Chernaik v.

On remand, the trial court denied plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and granted the state's motion for summary judgment, concluding that (1) only state submerged and submersible lands are resources encompassed by the common-law public-trust doctrine and (2) the state does not have a fiduciary obligation to protect public-trust resources from the effects of climate change. Based on those conclusions, the trial court entered a judgment dismissing plaintiffs' case. Plaintiffs appeal, arguing that they are entitled to the declarations that they sought in their motion. On appeal, we conclude that the public-trust doctrine does not impose a fiduciary obligation on the state to take affirmative action to protect public-trust resources from the effects of climate change. Because that conclusion resolves the controversy between the parties, we do not address the other declarations sought by plaintiffs. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in its rulings on the parties' summary judgment motions. However, because the trial court dismissed the case rather than entering a judgment declaring the parties' rights, we vacate and remand for the trial court to enter the requisite declaratory judgment.\n   We begin by discussing plaintiffs' amended complaint and our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Chernaik I\n   </em>\n   because the remand order in that case set up the parties' motions for summary judgment that are now on review. Plaintiffs sued the state in 2011 for declaratory and injunctive relief based on plaintiffs' conception of \"the public-trust doctrine.\" In their amended complaint, plaintiffs assert that the state holds \"vital natural resources\" of the state in trust for the benefit of its citizens, including the waters of the state, submerged and submersible lands, islands, shorelands, coastal areas, wildlife, fish, and the atmosphere. Plaintiffs further allege that the state has a fiduciary obligation to protect and preserve those resources for purposes of \"conservation, pollution abatement, maintenance and enhancement of aquatic and fish life, habitat for fish and wildlife, ecological values, in-stream flows, commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation, energy production, and the transport of natural resources.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs also set forth allegations related to the effects from climate change worldwide and, more specifically, effects from climate change on Oregon's natural resources, citizens, and economy, and allege that \"[a] failure to take appropriate action will result in the severe alteration and potentially the collapse of the earth's natural systems leaving a planet that is largely unfit for human life.\" Plaintiffs further allege that \"Oregon has the ability to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and take the steps necessary to protect the public trust assets of the State from the adverse [effects] of climate change.\" Plaintiffs recognize that the state has taken some steps meant to combat the effects of climate change; however, plaintiffs allege that the goals that the state has set are inadequate and, \"[d]espite having a concrete greenhouse gas reduction and mitigation plan in place, Oregon is falling significantly behind the targets set by that plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a single claim for declaratory relief based on the public-trust doctrine. For that claim, plaintiffs assert that the state has failed \"to uphold [its] public trust obligations\" with respect to the resources that plaintiffs allege are part of the public trust, and that failure \"threatens the health, safety, and welfare of Plaintiffs, as well as\n   present and future generations of Oregon citizens.\" In their prayer for relief, plaintiffs request both declaratory and injunctive relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[1.] A declaration that the atmosphere is a trust resource, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect the atmosphere as a commonly shared public trust resource from the [effects] of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"[2.] A declaration that water resources, navigable waters, submerged and submersible lands, islands, shorelands, coastal areas, wildlife, and fish are trust resources, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect these assets as commonly shared public trust resources from the [effects] of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"[3.] A declaration that Defendants have failed to uphold their fiduciary obligations to protect these trust assets for the benefits of Plaintiffs as well as current and future generations of Oregonians by failing adequately to regulate and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the State of Oregon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[4.] An order requiring Defendants to prepare, or cause to be prepared, a full and accurate accounting of Oregon's current carbon dioxide emissions and to do so annually thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"[5.] An order requiring Defendants to develop and implement a carbon reduction plan that will protect trust assets by abiding by the best available science.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"[6.] A declaration that the best available science requires carbon dioxide emissions to peak in 2012 and to be reduced by at least six per cent each year until at least 2050.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to plaintiffs' amended complaint, the state filed a motion to dismiss based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the trial court lacked the authority to grant the relief that plaintiffs sought. The trial court granted that motion, and plaintiffs appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, we reversed the trial court's dismissal of plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    Chernaik I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768822\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/263/463/#p481\">\n    263 Or.

The state specifically requested that the trial court make the following rulings, and dismiss plaintiffs' amended complaint:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"1) The common law public trust doctrine does not extend to the atmosphere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"2) The common law public trust doctrine does not impose the particular affirmative actions associated with traditional legal trusts (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., fiduciary obligations or duties).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Instead, Oregon courts have applied it only as a restraint on alienation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"3) Because there are no fiduciary duties associated with the common law public trust doctrine, any declaratory or injunctive relief based on an alleged violation of such duties must be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"4) Even if this Court recognizes new fiduciary duties under the public trust doctrine, injunctive relief is not warranted, because the Court must presume that the State will comply with the new law as announced, and therefore, that no future violation of law is likely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"5) This Court is without authority to grant injunctive or further relief, because doing so would violate the principle of separation of powers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"6) Finally, this Court lacks authority to grant injunctive relief, because such relief would cause the Court to decide a political question that our constitutional system entrusts to the other branches of government.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court granted the state's motion for summary judgment, denied plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, and entered a general judgment dismissing the action. In a letter opinion, the trial court set out its reasoning. The court first concluded that only submerged and submersible lands are resources that are encompassed by the public-trust doctrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, the court determined that the following resources are not public-trust resources: navigable waters of the state, beaches, shorelands, islands, fish and wildlife, and the atmosphere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The court then turned to the duties that the state has under the public-trust doctrine. The court reviewed relevant case law and concluded that, historically, \"courts applying the public trust doctrine have merely prevented the State from entirely alienating submerged and submersible lands under navigable waters,\" and noted that no such alienation is at issue in this case. Based on that history, the\n   court concluded that \"the State does not have a fiduciary obligation to protect submerged and submersible lands\n   from the [effects] of climate change.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On appeal from that judgment, plaintiffs assign error to the trial court's denial of their motion for partial summary judgment and its grant of the state's motion for summary judgment. Both rulings are reviewable on appeal \"to determine whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Busch v.

That is, the state may not convey interests in those lands or allow uses of those lands or the waters over them in a manner that causes a substantial impairment to the public's right to navigation, commerce, fishing, or recreation in those waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With that background in place, we turn to the arguments presented in this appeal. Plaintiffs' first argument, which we ultimately do not reach, is that the public-trust doctrine applies to more than just the submerged and\n   submersible lands to which Oregon obtained title upon statehood by virtue of its sovereignty. Plaintiffs assert that the doctrine also encompasses all \"essential natural resources,\" including, among other things, the waters of the state, fish and wildlife, and the atmosphere. Because we do not reach the merits of that argument as unnecessary to our disposition, we proceed in this opinion to refer to \"public-trust resources\" in the abstract, without identifying the resources that the term necessarily encompasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument, which we do address, asserts that the public-trust doctrine does more than restrain state action. Plaintiffs argue that the doctrine imposes fiduciary obligations on the state to take affirmative action to prevent substantial impairment to public-trust resources and, in particular, substantial impairment from the effects of climate change. Essentially, plaintiffs argue that inherent in the public-trust doctrine is a state obligation to protect public-trust resources from substantial impairment-whatever the source of that impairment-and that we should not be constrained from applying the public-trust doctrine in a manner that upholds that principle simply because our prior case law was based on fact patterns that are not readily translatable to the issue now before the court. Plaintiffs assert that adhering to the trial court's narrow view of the public-trust doctrine renders it meaningless in the face of the existential\n   threats to our state's resources from climate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Many law professors also have appeared in support of plaintiffs as\n   <em>\n    amici curiae\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   law professors).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   On this issue they argue that \"[t]he sovereign fiduciary duty to protect the public's crucial assets from irrevocable damage remains the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of the public trust.\" They assert that we should apply the trust-law concept that requires that a trustee not sit idle and allow damage to trust property to\n   occur. They argue that, by not taking proper action in the face of climate change, the state is \"abdicat[ing] [its] sovereign public trust responsibility to protect the climate system for today's citizens and for future generations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The state responds that the public-trust doctrine does not impose affirmative, fiduciary-like trust duties upon the state. Rather, the state asserts, the public-trust doctrine is a means by which to guide state action-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , it imposes a restraint on state action so that its actions do not substantially impair the public's interest in the title-navigable waters of the state-but the doctrine does not compel any particular state action in the first instance. The state points out that the \"trust\" in the public-trust doctrine is not the same as a \"trust\" over property or money covered by a trust instrument, and, thus, ordinary trust law with its attendant fiduciary duties that are imposed on trustees does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Before we address the parties' arguments, we first return to what plaintiffs are asking for in this case. As set out above, plaintiffs bring a single claim for relief under the common-law public-trust doctrine. In connection with that claim, plaintiffs seek declarations that the state has a \"fiduciary obligation\" to protect public-trust resources \"from the [effects] of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.\" Thus, we must answer whether, under the common-law public-trust doctrine, the state has a fiduciary obligation to affirmatively protect public-trust resources from the effects of climate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As a starting point, we reject plaintiffs' and\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   law professors' reliance on other state's case law and on other sources of Oregon law, such as the Oregon Constitution, statutes, and regulations, to support their understanding of Oregon's common-law public-trust doctrine. As discussed\n   above, the public-trust doctrine is a matter of state common law. As such, it is the common law of this state that deter-mines the contours of that doctrine. That the state may have other obligations under the Oregon Constitution, statutes, or regulations does not inform what obligations the public-trust doctrine itself requires of the state, which is the question that plaintiffs have put at issue. Plaintiffs chose to sue the state based solely on the common-law public-trust doctrine; as such, we must base our analysis on that doctrine. In rejecting reliance on other sources of Oregon law, we note that plaintiffs do not provide any supporting argument that those sources represent a legislative intention to codify, expand, or modify the common-law public-trust doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We thus turn to the main argument raised by plaintiff-that the public-trust doctrine imposes an inherent fiduciary obligation on the state to take affirmative action to prevent substantial impairment to public-trust resources from the effects of climate change. To support that argument, plaintiffs\n   primarily rely on statements made in\n   <em>\n    Geer v.

Plaintiffs' reliance is misplaced for at least two reasons. First, the statement was not made by the Court as a comment on the nature of the public trust; the Court was quoting a much larger section from an Illinois Supreme Court case to support its point that state courts had also concluded that the states have authority \"to qualify and restrict the ownership in game killed within its limits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 532-33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701158\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/519/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Court held only that the nature of property in game gives the state the\n   <em>\n    authority\n   </em>\n   to regulate the taking of game and to prohibit its shipment out of state; it did not make any holding regarding affirmative duties of the states with respect to game or the public trust.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701158\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/519/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701158\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/519/\">\n    at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701158\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/519/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on the Oregon Supreme Court case of\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the state has \"powers and duties\" over trust resources.

The issue in the case was whether wild deer are \"property of another\" for purposes of the criminal mischief statute.\n   <em>\n    Dickerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338064\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/356/822/\">\n    356 Or. at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338064\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/356/822/\">\n    345 P.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, the public-trust doctrine uses the word \"trust\" as an imperfect metaphor to capture the idea that the state is restrained from substantially impairing the common-law public right to use public-trust resources for certain purposes.\n   <em>\n    Brusco Towboat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2154497\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/30/509/#p516\">\n    30 Or.

We can find no source under the Oregon conception of the public-trust doctrine for imposing fiduciary duties on the state to affirmatively act to protect public-trust resources from the effects of climate change. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court correctly granted the state's motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment based on the above conclusion.
