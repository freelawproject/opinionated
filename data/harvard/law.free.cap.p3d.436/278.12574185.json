Due to a previous conviction for sodomy upon a child, each count potentially subjected Cuttler to an enhanced penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Cuttler ultimately agreed to plead guilty to one count of rape of a child without the enhancement, which carried a 25-years-to-life prison sentence. Before sentencing, Cuttler moved to withdraw his guilty plea and the district court granted that motion after an evidentiary hearing. The State appeals. We agree with the State that the district court exceeded its discretion in granting Cuttler's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and we therefore reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In October 2012, a seven-year-old child reported to authorities that Cuttler engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Soon after the report, the State charged Cuttler with two counts each of rape of a child,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-402.1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-402.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2012) ; sodomy on a child,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-402.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-403.1; and aggravated sexual abuse of a child,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-402.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-404.1.

On interlocutory appeal, the Utah Supreme Court reversed the district court's order.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pending disposition of the evidentiary issue in the supreme court, Cuttler allegedly fled from Utah while on pretrial release, resulting in the State filing additional charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following the supreme court's decision and the new charges, the State offered Cuttler a plea deal for global resolution of all charges. It offered to let him plead guilty to one count of rape of a child in exchange for the State's agreement to remove the enhanced life-without-parole penalty on that charge, to dismiss the remaining five charges, and to dismiss the separate case for fleeing the jurisdiction. Cuttler agreed to these terms. In the written plea agreement, Cuttler acknowledged that \"[he] did have sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 14,\" which constituted a first-degree-felony rape of a child and carried a punishment of \"25 years to life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 At the plea hearing, the prosecutor informed the court that Cuttler intended to plead guilty to rape of a child, identifying it as \"Count I without the enhancement. That is a mandatory 25 to life, however.\" During the plea colloquy, the district court identified the sentence as \"25 years to life ... in the Utah State Prison\" and asked Cuttler if he understood that the charge carries a \"mandatory 25 years to life\" sentence. Cuttler responded \"Yes.\" The district court also stated that the charge required mandatory imprisonment, which Cuttler acknowledged he understood. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court found Cuttler to be \"proceeding voluntarily, knowingly[,] and with full understanding,\" and it subsequently endorsed his guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Prior to sentencing, conflict counsel appeared on behalf of Cuttler and moved to withdraw his guilty plea, which motion the\n   State opposed. The district court held an evidentiary hearing at which Cuttler and his prior Plea Counsel testified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cuttler explained, \"[W]e discussed 25 to life, not mandatory 25 to life.\" Cuttler could not recall whether his Plea Counsel had ever used the word \"mandatory\" in their discussions of the sentence or if counsel had advised him that the judge would have the ability to reduce the sentence below 25 years. Cuttler argued that his plea was not knowingly made, because \"he did not understand that the Court lost discretion to reduce his sentence below 25 years in prison.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 The district court ultimately agreed that Cuttler's plea was not made knowingly. Specifically, the court determined that, by entering the plea,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Cuttler] was subjecting himself to a mandatory sentence that included time in the Utah State Prison for a term of 25 years to life. However, he did not know that he was subjecting himself to a minimum mandatory sentence of 25 years. He understood that the sentence was mandatory, but in no part of the record was he made aware that the sentence was a minimum mandatory sentence that took away all discretion from the judge or the State of Utah Board of Pardons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court further concluded that it fully complied with rule 11 of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure in taking the plea. The State timely appealed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -18a-1(3)(c) (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 8 The State contends that the district court erroneously granted Cuttler's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

P. 11(e)(5). Because the court concluded that the sentence to be imposed in this case required a minimum mandatory period of incarceration, it determined that Cuttler's guilty plea was not entered knowingly. That is, the district court concluded that, because Cuttler never heard the words \"minimum mandatory\" uttered during the plea hearing, Cuttler could not understand the \"minimum mandatory nature\" of his sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6965249\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/309/230/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We first consider the applicable sentence in this case, and then we review the guilty plea and the district court's authorization of withdrawal of that plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.

Relevant to our review, rule 11(e)(5) of the Utah Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the court to ensure that \"the defendant knows the minimum and maximum sentence, and if applicable, the minimum mandatory nature of the minimum sentence, that may be imposed for each offense to which a plea is entered.\" The court must explain and a defendant must understand the penalty that will be imposed upon conviction of the charged crime.

The court also received a written plea agreement supporting Cuttler's guilty plea. This agreement stated that Cuttler was pleading guilty to rape of a child, a first-degree felony. Under the heading \"Punishment Min/Max and/or Minimum Mandatory,\" Cuttler was notified that pleading guilty subjected him to a sentence of \"25 years to life.\" In the plea agreement, Cuttler further acknowledged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I know the maximum sentence that may be imposed for each crime to which I am pleading guilty.... I know that by pleading\n   guilty ... to a crime that carries a mandatory penalty, I will be subjecting myself to serving a mandatory penalty for that crime.

The Plea Withdrawal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 Despite finding that Cuttler understood the applicable sentence and that \"the Court's colloquy was comprehensive and followed the Rule 11 plea requirements,\" the district court set aside Cuttler's guilty plea. It determined that because no one clarified for Cuttler during the plea colloquy that his 25-years-to-life sentence was a \"minimum mandatory sentence,\" \"Cuttler could have been left with the reasonable understanding that even though there was a mandatory sentence, the Court or the Board of Pardons retained some discretion to reduce, but not eliminate, that mandatory sentence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that Cuttler met his burden and demonstrated that his plea was not knowingly made because he was not \"made aware that the sentence was a minimum mandatory sentence that took away all discretion from the judge or the State of Utah Board of Pardons.\" The State asserts that the district court erred as a matter of law in reaching this conclusion. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 16 The court erroneously determined that Cuttler was subject to a minimum mandatory term of imprisonment and that, in order for his plea to be knowingly entered, the court was required to advise Cuttler that the court lacked discretion to sentence Cuttler below the minimum term-25 years-set forth in the statute. We first address the district court's discretion to deviate from the applicable sentence.

As the State points out, \"the rape-of-a-child statute's use of the 'not less than' language is similar to the language used for other indeterminate sentences.\" Thus, the sentence to be imposed for a child rape conviction is treated the same as any other indeterminate term, and the only significant difference is the limit on the district court's authority to order probation or suspend the sentence rather than impose the prison sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b610.

Indeed, this particular bit of information-the court's lack of discretion to reduce the sentence-is not a collateral or even likely consequence of his guilty plea, but rather of no consequence. Because the court properly informed Cuttler of the likely consequences of his guilty plea, the court, at least initially, correctly determined that his guilty plea was knowingly entered. The court made a mistake of law, however, in concluding that, to knowingly enter a guilty plea, Cuttler needed to understand that the district court lacked any room for leniency with regard to the minimum term of the indeterminate sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B. The Board's Discretion to Parole Cuttler before he Serves the Minimum Term in Prison\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 The Utah Board of Pardons generally retains discretion to determine the actual number of years of imprisonment a defendant serves, which may be less than the minimum term of the sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Padilla v. Utah Board of Pardons &amp; Parole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888685\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/947/664/#p669\">\n    947 P.2d 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669 (Utah 1997). Subject to certain exceptions, the Board may pardon or parole an offender convicted of rape of a child \"before the minimum term has been served.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-27-9\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-27-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(b) (LexisNexis 2017). The Board is given this broad authority, \"[w]ith the exception of certain minimum mandatory sentences where the Board is specifically prohibited from paroling an offender before service of the minimum term of years.\"\n   <em>\n    Labrum v. Utah State Board of Pardons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/#p907\">\n    870 P.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907 (Utah 1993). This is not such a sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 The Utah Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a defendant sentenced to prison\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   prior to April 29, 1996, for a first degree felony involving ... rape of a child, a violation of Section 76-5-402.1... or a prior offense as described in Section 76-3-407, may not be eligible for release on parole by the Board of Pardons and Parole until the offender has fully completed serving the minimum mandatory sentence imposed by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-27-9\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-27-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a). Cuttler argues that this exception would apply in his case. The Board could not release him in less than 25 years, Cuttler asserts, because (1) he was sentenced in New York before 1996, for (2) a prior sexual offense. We do not read this provision so expansively. By its plain language, the statute restricts the Board's authority to release a defendant before the minimum term is served on a sentence imposed prior to 1996. Even assuming that Cuttler's New York conviction and sentence applies under this statute, which we do not decide, Cuttler does not contend that he is still serving that sentence, that it is a minimum mandatory sentence, or that the Board has authority to parole him on the New York sentence. Absent application of this exception,\n   the Board generally retains discretion to determine the actual time served for the applicable sentence in this case, even if that amount is less than the statutory minimum term. Because the Board is not specifically prohibited from considering an early release, the sentence applicable to Cuttler pursuant to his guilty plea is not strictly a minimum mandatory sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labrum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362975\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/870/902/#p907\">\n    870 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   907 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Gray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801338\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/715/\">\n    2016 UT App 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801338\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/372/715/\">\n    372 P.3d 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 21 In allowing Cuttler to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court erroneously concluded that the sentence applicable in this case was a minimum mandatory sentence. Relatedly, the court erred in determining that Cuttler's guilty plea could not have been knowingly made because Cuttler did not understand that this was a minimum mandatory sentence. It was not. The sentence applicable to Cuttler's guilty plea is subject to the Board's discretion to consider early release before Cuttler has served the minimum term. Accordingly, to knowingly plead guilty in this case, Cuttler was not required to first hear the clearly isolated phrase 'minimum mandatory' in relation to his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 22 The district court found, and our review of the record confirms, that Cuttler was properly informed of the direct consequences of pleading guilty. The court, Plea Counsel, and the written plea agreement accurately communicated, multiple times, that pleading guilty would subject Cuttler to mandatory imprisonment for 25 years to life. Cuttler confirmed that he understood this sentence. With regard to explaining the applicable sentence, no more was required in this case. Consequently, Cuttler's guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 23 That Cuttler did not understand the district court's lack of discretion to reduce the minimum term does not render his guilty plea unknowing. Further, Cuttler's guilty plea remains effective even though he was not told that the Board lacked discretion to parole him early. Indeed, this explanation would have been simply incorrect. The Board retains the discretion to parole Cuttler before he has served the minimum term of his sentence, and therefore the sentence he understood would be imposed is not a minimum mandatory sentence. In granting Cuttler's motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court made mistakes of law and therefore exceeded its discretion. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Judge Michele M. Christiansen Forster authored this Opinion, in which Judges Gregory K. Orme and Kate A.

We note, however, that the record reflects no affirmative statement, passing comment, or suggestion, which might have led Cuttler to develop this understanding. He certainly did not bring it to the court's attention at the change-of-plea hearing. In any event, Cuttler explains that, when he pleaded guilty, he simply \"did not know what he did not know.
