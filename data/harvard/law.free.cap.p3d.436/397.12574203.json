We address whether the trial court properly dismissed the claim on summary judgment. In doing so, we discuss each element of the tort. And we discuss the affirmative defense of privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Upon passage of Initiative 502 (I-502) in 2012, the City issued a regulation prohibiting marijuana retail shops from being located within 1,000 feet of each other (the 1,000 Foot Separation). In 2014, the City denied Greensun a license to operate such a shop after determining the business planned to locate too close to another shop deemed \"first-in-time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Greensun then filed this action against the City, claiming violations of the due process and privileges and immunities clauses of the Washington State Constitution. The trial court dismissed the case on summary judgment. Greensun appealed. Because the City adopted its first-in-time rule without engaging in formal rule-making, this court invalidated it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 On remand, Greensun amended its complaint to claim tortious interference with business expectancy. On cross-motions for\n   summary judgment, the trial court dismissed Greensun's claim and declared the City had remedied the rule-making issue identified in the first appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 Because genuine issues of fact exist as to the tortious interference claim, we affirm in part and reverse in part the trial court's order denying Greensun's motion for partial summary judgment and granting the City's summary judgment motion. We remand the case for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On November 6, 2012, Washington passed I-502. Laws of 2013, ch. 3 \u00a7 41. I-502, in part, legalized the possession of limited amounts of marijuana and directed the Washington State Liquor Control Board (the LCB) to develop and implement rules to regulate and tax recreational marijuana retailers by December 31, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Greensun's managing members, Seth Simpson and David Ahl, leased a retail space at 10600 Main Street, Bellevue, Washington on November 29, 2012. They planned to open a retail marijuana shop there. As such, Greensun made several upgrades to the building. It intended to operate a medical marijuana business at the space until the LCB implemented the regulations for recreational marijuana. Greensun applied to the City for a building permit on January 8, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The City opposed Greensun's attempt to open a medical marijuana operation, claiming the proposed use violated Bellevue's Land Use Code (LUC). The City obtained injunctive relief prohibiting the opening of a medical marijuana facility at the location. Greensun then abandoned its plan to open a medical marijuana store. However, because it still planned to use the space for recreational marijuana, it extended its lease through June 30, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The LCB then opened the application process for retail marijuana licenses. Greensun applied. By March 1, 2014, the LCB had screened Greensun's application and listed it as one of 19 qualified applicants for licenses in Bellevue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 On March 17, 2014, the City adopted Ordinance 6156, which extended Ordinance 6133 B-1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for an additional six months and implemented a new restriction-the 1,000 Foot Separation. Under the restriction, no marijuana retailer could be located within 1,000 feet of any other marijuana retailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 On April 2, 2014, the LCB announced it would process license applications \"with geographic distribution and population density in mind.\" To this end, the LCB allocated a predetermined number of initial licenses for recreational marijuana stores to each jurisdiction. If the number of applicants in a jurisdiction exceeded its number of licenses, the LCB would use a lottery system to determine which applicants it would license. The LCB stated it expected to issue the initial retail licenses in \"batches\" during the first week of July 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The LCB initially allocated four such licenses for Bellevue. Because 19 qualified applicants sought to open shops in Bellevue, the LCB held a lottery on May 2, 2014. Greensun ranked fifth. Two other applicants, Par 4 Investments LLC (Par 4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and High Society, ranked in the top four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 On May 7, 2014, the City e-mailed High Society about the 1,000 Foot Separation. It explained that \"[a] retailer will 'lock down' their location upon submittal of a complete building permit application. This means that once we determine a building permit application complete for review that [sic] we will apply the 1,000 foot separation from that property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 On May 16, 2014, Par 4 applied for its building permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Greensun met with the City on May 19, 2014. At the meeting, it told the City the LCB would likely disqualify\n   High Society's application because the business listed the wrong address. It asked how the 1,000 Foot Separation would be applied if Greensun became one of the four lottery winners. The City advised Greensun it would give priority to the applicant who first submitted a complete building permit application. Greensun mentioned it had submitted a complete application for 10600 Main Street in 2013. The City responded that the LCB had to have designated an applicant as a lottery winner to establish priority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 On May 21, 2014, the City made the determination that Par 4's building permit application was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 On May 27, 2014, a reporter from The Seattle Times asked the City about how it would enforce the 1,000 Foot Separation. The City responded that it \"will consider the first retail applicant who submits a complete building permit as the 'first in,' against which the other applicants will be compared for conformance with the requirement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 Around the end of May 2014, Greensun applied to the City for a business license to operate a retail marijuana shop at 10600 Main Street. On June 3, 2014, the City sent a letter to Greensun stating that it \"can only approve a business license application for the four selected retailers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City denied the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b619 The City received Par 4's marijuana license application from the LCB on June 4, 2014. The City approved Par 4's proposed location at 10697 Main Street, but stated it \"reserves all rights accorded under law to enforce violations of city ordinances and codes as exist now or as hereafter amended.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b620 On June 5, 2014, the LCB notified Greensun that it became one of the four lottery winners because of High Society's disqualification. The LCB told the City about Greensun's new status on June 9, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b621 In an email to High Society on June 11, 2014, the City stated that Par 4 had \"locked down\" their location for purposes of the 1,000 Foot Separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 The City then determined it would not use the timing of building permit applications for the first-in-time test. The City deemed the method inequitable because the \"[v]esting of a building permit had no connection to the Washington State Liquor Control Board's program.\" Instead, the City decided to tie the first-in-time determinations to when the LCB issued its licenses. The City did so without engaging in formal rule-making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 On June 24, 2014, the City informed applicants that \"[i]n the event two or more retail marijuana applicants seek licensing from the LCB and are located within 1000 feet of another potential retail applicant, the City shall consider the entity that is licensed first by the LCB to be the 'first-in-time' applicant.\" The City detailed the application process, explaining that if the LCB approves an application, the applicant will receive a payment request for a $1,000 license fee. The City said, once the LCB receives the fee, it will send a conditional approval letter that acts as a 30-day marijuana license until the applicant receives a business license with the marijuana endorsement from the Washington State Department of Revenue Business Licensing Service. The City indicated the issuance date for the 30-day license would determine which applicant had priority for the purposes of the 1,000 Foot Separation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b624 The City approved Greensun's marijuana license application on June 25, 2014. The application listed 10600 Main Street as Greensun's address. As with Par 4, the approval notice provided that the City \"reserves all rights accorded under law to enforce violations of city ordinances and codes as exist now or as hereafter amended.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b625 On July 1, 2014, Greensun tendered payment of its license fee to the LCB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b626 On July 2, 2014, High Society obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the LCB. The TRO prohibited\n   the LCB from licensing retail marijuana applicants except for the four original lottery winners. The LCB then told Greensun it could not accept its license fee payment.\n   \u00b627 The same day, an LCB employee emailed the City a copy of High Society's complaint. The City responded, \"[I]t sounds like if [the LCB] issue[s] a license for a Bellevue retail store on Monday, it likely would be to Par 4 Investments (based on the status of Novelty Tree, Happy Highway, and High Society)? Can you please confirm?\" The LCB indicated that the City had assumed correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b628 Par 4 paid the license fee to the LCB on July 3, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b629 The LCB issued the first batch of marijuana retailer licenses on July 7, 2014. Par 4 received its conditional approval letter from the LCB via email at 9:17 a.m. that day. The letter sent to Par 4 was misdated July 3, 2014. Upon receiving the letter from the LCB, Par 4's attorney e-mailed it to the City. The City replied, \"Consistent with my letter to your client dated June 24, 2014, [Par 4] is first in time for purposes of application of the 1,000 foot separation requirement between retail marijuana outlets.\" At 1:08 p.m. that same day, the LCB issued Par 4 a corrected letter with the date changed to July 7, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b630 The initial batch of licensed applicants omitted Greensun. However, later in the day on July 7, a court lifted High Society's TRO. The LCB emailed Greensun its conditional approval letter at 3:04 p.m. on July 7. The LCB then issued an updated list of the retail marijuana licenses to include Greensun. After the LCB added Greensun to the list, counsel for Par 4 emailed the City asking if this affected its first-in-time status. The City responded it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b631 At 4:19 p.m. on July 7, Greensun received an email with a letter from the City attached. The letter provided that the City had deemed Par 4 first-in-time. Accordingly, the City told Greensun it may not open a marijuana retail store at 10600 Main Street. Greensun claimed the City\n   incorrectly deemed Par 4 to be first-in-time because the LCB issued the conditional license dated July 3, 2014 in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b632 The City then engaged in the following inquiries: Chad Barnes, an Assistant City Attorney for the City, contacted Assistant Attorney General Kim O'Neal, who represented the LCB. He did so \"to better understand the timing of the conditional approval letters issued by the LCB.\" O'Neal informed the City \"that the LCB currently takes the position that the July 3, 2014 letter received by [Par 4] was not the actual marijuana retail license.\" O'Neal clarified that \"that the actual licenses were issued following the July 7, 2014 online notice.\" When asked if the LCB could determine which applicant it had licensed first, O'Neal \"indicated that their system was not set up for such a query.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b633 On July 11, 2014, the City sent letters to Par 4 and Greensun asking them to provide any information that may indicate whom the LCB had licensed first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b634 Counsel for Par 4 responded on July 14, 2014. Par 4 noted it placed first in the LCB lottery. It said it paid the license fee on July 3, 2014 and the LCB issued its conditional approval letter the same day. Par 4 also asserted it had received its initial conditional approval letter on the morning of July 7, 2014, and Greensun did not receive its letter until after the court lifted the TRO later in the day. Lastly, Par 4 stated it should be licensed because the City confirmed Par 4's status as first-in-time on July 7, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b635 Greensun's attorney responded on July 21, 2014. Greensun pointed out it first applied for a building permit 18 months prior and thus had first-in-time status under the City's original method. It further contended the LCB had issued the July 3, 2014 letter to Par 4 in error because it had intended to issue all of the licenses simultaneously. Greensun argued the LCB issued both Par 4's and Greensun's licenses on July 7, 2014. Additionally, Greensun noted it \"passed [its] final inspection first and [was] invoiced on July 1st prior to [Par 4].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b636 On July 29, 2014, the City informed Greensun via letter that it had \"determined that [Par 4] was licensed by the LCB before [Greensun]. Consequently, [Par 4] is 'first-in-time' for the purposes of applying the separation requirements established in Ordinance No. 6156.\" The letter further explained the City's decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The City's decision is based on the fact that on July 3, 2014, the LCB sent [Par 4]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   a letter indicating it was approving [Par 4]'s marijuana retailer license and directed that the letter be posted as [Par 4]'s temporary permit. The LCB subsequently sent [Par 4] a revised temporary operating permit on July 7, 2014 at 1:08 pm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The City's decision is further supported by the LCB's records that indicated [Par 4's] license was approved on July 6, 2014. [Greensun's] license was not approved until July 7, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The City will not grant [Greensun] a business license to operate a retail marijuana outlet at 10600 Main Street based on the separation requirement in Ordinance 6156.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b637 The next day, July 30, 2014, the City's legal planner and assistant attorney emailed other city employees and directed them not to approve Greensun's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b638 Par 4 opened its retail marijuana store on October 7, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b639 Greensun filed a complaint against the City on November 3, 2014. The complaint alleged the City had violated the due process and privileges and immunities clauses of the Washington State Constitution and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In the complaint, Greensun claimed it \"would have been able to open its retail store in less than a week of [the LCB's] issuance of its license on July 7, if the City of Bellevue had issued its requested business license.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b640 On May 20, 2015, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissed Greensun's\n   suit. The trial court ruled the City did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in denying Greensun a business license. Greensun appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b641 On August 3, 2015, during the pendency of the first appeal, the Bellevue City Council engaged in formal rulemaking and passed Ordinance 6253 to legislatively adopt its first-in-time rule. The ordinance specified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   If two or more marijuana retail applicants seek licensing from the state and propose to locate within 1,000 feet of each other, the City shall consider the entity who is licensed first by the state liquor and cannabis board to be the \"first-in-time\" applicant who is entitled to site the retail use. First-in-time determinations will be based on the date and time of the state-issued license or conditional license, whichever is issued first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b642 On June 13, 2016, this court reversed the trial court's summary judgment order.\n   <em>\n    City of Bellevue v.

Greensun filed its amended complaint on February 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b644 The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Greensun sought partial summary judgment on the issue of liability with respect to its claim for tortious interference. The City asked the court to dismiss Greensun's\n   suit and to grant declaratory relief confirming it remedied the rule-making issue. On November 2, 2017, the court denied Greensun's motion, granted the City's motion, and dismissed Greensun's claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b645 Greensun appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b646 Greensun claims the trial court erred by entering summary judgment for the City and denying its motion for partial summary judgment.

Greensun alleged it would have opened its store but for the City's refusal to issue it a business license. It submitted evidence that it would have been able to open its store within a week of receiving its license, and therefore lost profits from that time forward. To support this claim, Greensun points to the net profits of $2,577,614 in 2015, and $3,760,535 in 2016, generated by its licensed retail store in Des Moines. Simpson contends the Des Moines store is very similar to the store Greensun would have opened in Bellevue. Both spaces, he contends, are around 3,000 square feet, located on a major arterial, and have convenient customer parking. In another declaration, Simpson points to the LCB's published gross sales reported by each of its licensees. According to the LCB website, Par 4 reported $300,000 in gross sales for its first month of operation. Viewed in the light most favorable to Greensun, this evidence raises a material issue of fact as to whether the company suffered damages as a result of the City's conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   F.

It offers the following interpretation of the 1,000 Foot Separation requirement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   Under the City's zoning ordinances, Greensun and Par 4 became \"marijuana\" retailers subject to the 1,000 [sic] Separation rule at the time the LCB issued them licenses. Thus, at the time Greensun received its marijuana license from the LCB, it was in violation of the 1,000 Foot Separation because the LCB had already issued a license [sic] Par 4 for a location within 1,000 feet of the Greensun's Premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b680 However, as discussed above, the City's decision to use the timing of the LCB licensing for the first-in-time determinations was questionable. The City originally implemented a system where applicants would \"lock down\" a location based on building permit applications. It then abandoned that to instead link the first-in-time determinations to which applicant the LCB licensed first, even though the LCB stated it would issue the licenses in \"batches.\" After the LCB informed the City that its system could not determine which applicant had been licensed first, the City asked the applicants to submit evidence as to who the LCB licensed first. This prompted even Par 4 to complain about the City's \"illogical first in time rule.\" In\n   <em>\n    Greensun I\n   </em>\n   , we described the City's actions as \"ad hoc\" and \"troubling.\" No. 73646-9-I, slip op. at 15, n. 11, and 17, n.13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b681 Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Greensun, there is a material issue of fact as to whether the City acted in good faith.
