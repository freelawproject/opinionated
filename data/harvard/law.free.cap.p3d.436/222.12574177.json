Defendant pled guilty to murder, a first degree felony, and was sentenced to prison in 2011. He now challenges his guilty plea on the grounds that it was not knowing or voluntary and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the summary judgment denying his petition for postconviction relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 Defendant admitted to police that, on April 4, 2010, he shot and killed the man (Victim) who was having an affair with his wife. He explained that, having discovered the affair, he angrily confronted Victim in a park. Defendant then pointed a gun at Victim, intending to scare him into admitting to the affair. When Victim admitted to sleeping with Defendant's wife, Defendant replied that \"this kind of thing is not forgiven.\" Defendant said that Victim then lunged for the gun, and a struggle ensued. Defendant told police that the gun discharged several times in the course of the struggle, and Victim was shot once in the abdomen, once in the leg, twice in the back, and once in the back of the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 The State charged Defendant with murder, a first degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-203\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3)(a) (LexisNexis 2017); the purchase, transfer, possession, or use of a firearm by a restricted person, a second degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 76-10-503(2)(a); and obstruction of justice, a second degree felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-8-306(3)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant entered into a plea bargain, agreeing to plead guilty to murder if the other charges were dismissed. At the plea hearing, Defendant acknowledged he knew that by pleading guilty he was waiving his constitutional\n   rights, including the right to the presumption of innocence and the right to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant further acknowledged that he understood everything that his counsel had discussed with him, including the plea affidavit. The court then inquired whether Defendant had any questions about the plea affidavit, to which Defendant replied that he did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 After trial counsel described the factual basis for Defendant's murder charge, Defendant made statements implying that he acted in self-defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honor, on April 4th 2010 in Salt Lake County [Defendant] confronted a man who had been sleeping with his wife. An argument and subsequent fight took place at which time he pulled out a firearm and he shot the man killing him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   THE COURT: Is that what happened, [Defendant]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: I defended myself. It was not my intention. I never thought about hurting him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [TRIAL COUNSEL]: Your Honor, we had-discussed the imperfect self-defense concept and that he did pull out a gun to get the man to confess to sleeping with his wife. And that the man charged at him but he was unarmed. So that is why he used a gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: I will find that that is a sufficient factual basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: He was drugged and drunk and I didn't know if he had a weapon, a knife and that's why I-\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Defendant made these statements, the district court clarified with Defendant that he intentionally killed Victim by asking Defendant whether he knew that by pulling the trigger he would cause Victim's death. Defendant acknowledged that he did. After entering his guilty plea, Defendant asked to be sentenced immediately and waived the right to withdraw his plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b65 After a few months in prison, Defendant filed a petition under the Post-Conviction Remedies Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 78B-9-101 to -405 (LexisNexis 2012), arguing that his plea was involuntary because his attorney explained his plea to him without the assistance of an interpreter. He also raised an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on that same basis, specifically arguing that counsel's failure to use an interpreter resulted in Defendant not knowing that he had a valid self-defense argument and could have taken his case to trial. The State filed a response to his petition, asserting that Defendant had not carried his burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that his trial counsel's performance was deficient and prejudicial. The State also contended that the nature of Defendant's plea was both voluntary and knowing because any misunderstandings regarding his plea that arose out of his communications with his attorney were cured by his plea affidavit and plea colloquy, both of which had been translated into Spanish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b66 An evidentiary hearing was held, but suspended, and in the meantime, the State moved for summary judgment. Granting the State's motion, the district court concluded that Defendant had failed to show that trial counsel's performance was deficient and that all constitutional prerequisites for a valid guilty plea had been satisfied in Defendant's case. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 Defendant contends that the district court erred in granting the State's motion for summary judgment for two reasons. First, he argues that his plea was not knowing or voluntary, asserting he did not understand the essential elements of his murder charge at the time of his plea. Second, he argues that his trial counsel's performance was deficient for failure to use an interpreter during their out-of-court discussions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b68 \"We review an appeal from an order dismissing or denying a petition for\n   postconviction relief for correctness without deference to the lower court's conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

Stumpf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208966\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/175/#p183\">\n    545 U.S. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 183,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208966\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/175/#p183\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8208966\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/175/#p183\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Trial counsel assured the district court that the concept of imperfect self-defense had been explained to Defendant, and where Defendant had previously told the court he understood everything counsel had explained to him, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that Defendant understood how the imperfect self-defense theory applied in his case. Furthermore, with the benefit of an interpreter during the plea colloquy, Defendant made no objection to trial counsel's assurance that Defendant understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b614 We do, however, recognize that Defendant's statements suggesting possible self-defense did raise a question of whether he intended to kill Victim because he stated, \"It was not my intention. I never thought about hurting him.\" It was therefore necessary for the court to address the conflict between this statement and his plea affidavit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Maguire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10354692\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/830/216/#p217\">\n    830 P.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217 (Utah 1991) (\" 'Any omissions or ambiguities in the affidavit must be clarified during the plea hearing, as must any uncertainties raised in the course of the plea colloquy.' \") (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1991) ). And the court did address this conflict by asking Defendant whether he knew that his actions, specifically pulling the trigger of the gun, would cause Victim's death. Defendant acknowledged that he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b615 Defendant further contends that he did not understand his guilty plea because he \"speaks Spanish, has a fifth-grade education, and did not speak English except a few random words at the time he pleaded guilty,\" while \"[h]is trial counsel did not speak Spanish.\" He additionally claims not to have read the plea affidavit before signing it. But these claims contradict Defendant's statements to the district court during his plea hearing. Defendant is bound by his statements because \"the representations of the defendant, his lawyer, and the prosecutor at [a plea] hearing, as well as any findings made by the judge accepting the plea, constitute a formidable barrier in any subsequent collateral proceedings. Solemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\"\n   <em>\n    Blackledge v.

Here, there is no valid reason to doubt the truthfulness of Defendant's statements to the district court during his plea colloquy\n   because an interpreter was present and Defendant professed to understand everything discussed with counsel and the contents of his plea affidavit. Because there is nothing in the record that suggests Defendant lacked an understanding of the elements of the murder charge against him or anything but his own later assertions that he did not actually understand the essence of imperfect self-defense, the district court did not err in concluding on summary judgment that his plea was voluntarily and knowingly made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II.

But with an interpreter present, Defendant never advised the court that there was any issue in communicating with his counsel. He specifically acknowledged in the plea colloquy, during which an interpreter was present, that he understood everything counsel had explained to him. Had there been an insurmountable language barrier, Defendant had the opportunity to raise this issue with the court in the plea hearing on several occasions when asked by the court whether he understood everything his counsel had discussed with him and whether he had questions about the plea affidavit. We therefore are not persuaded that trial counsel acted unreasonably in failing to secure an interpreter for his out-of-court consultations with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b619 We do appreciate the importance of interpreters, but any suggestion that we should err on the side of requiring an interpreter in this case is dispelled by the other basis on which Defendant's ineffective assistance claim can be rejected. Defendant does nothing to establish that counsel's failure to secure an interpreter was prejudicial. To contest his guilty plea on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, Defendant \"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that such a decision would have been rational under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Rippey v.

Defendant must do more than allege that he would not have pled guilty had his counsel secured an interpreter for their out-of-court discussions. Rather, we \"look to the factual circumstances surrounding the plea\" and whether it would have been rational for Defendant to reject the plea and insist on a trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6907674\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/337/1071/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 At the time of the State's plea offer, Defendant had already confessed to killing\n   Victim, and a motion to suppress that confession had been denied by the district court. Defendant asserts that, had trial counsel better explained the elements of murder to Defendant, he would have known he had a valid claim for imperfect self-defense based on his statement to officers that Victim lunged at him during the confrontation. But the imperfect-self-defense theory is substantially undermined by the fact that, in what Defendant characterized as a tussle over the gun that he brought only to scare Victim, Victim was shot five times, including twice in the back and once in the back of the head. Based on these circumstances, there is nothing to suggest that it would have been rational for Defendant to reject the State's offer to dismiss the other two felony charges against him in exchange for his guilty plea to the murder charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b621 Defendant's statements and actions do not demonstrate that his guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary or that his counsel performed deficiently by not having an interpreter present during their out-of-court discussions. Additionally, he fails to establish any prejudice as a result of this decision by counsel. We thus presume Defendant's counsel rendered constitutionally adequate assistance, exercising reasonable professional judgment, and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the State. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   JUDGE GREGORY K. ORME authored this Opinion, in which JUDGE MICHELE M. CHRISTIANSEN FORSTER concurred. JUDGE JILL M. POHLMAN concurred in part and concurred in the result in part, with opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   POHLMAN, Judge (concurring in part and concurring in the result in part):\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b622 I concur with the lead opinion except as to Part I, in which I concur in the result. I am troubled by my colleagues' conclusion that the district court adequately remedied the conflict between the statements in Defendant's plea affidavit and his self-defense assertions during the plea colloquy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Defendant interjected statements that created a conflict about the nature of his plea. In my view, it is questionable whether the court's attempts to resolve the conflict were successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b623 The court apparently recognized the significance of Defendant's initial assertion that he \"defended [him]self,\" and it attempted to resolve the apparent conflict between his plea affidavit and that assertion by asking defense counsel if it changed the plea. But although counsel explained that he had \"discussed the imperfect self-defense concept\" with Defendant, he did not explain what Defendant understood. Thus, counsel's representation did not resolve the conflict or demonstrate that Defendant understood he was waiving any potential defenses in pleading guilty to first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b624 Defendant further added to the confusion when he interjected that he shot Victim because \"[Victim] was drugged and drunk and [Defendant] didn't know if [Victim] had a weapon.\" The court again tried to resolve the conflict, this time asking Defendant whether he knew that his actions would cause Victim's death. Defendant acknowledged that he knew \"by pulling the trigger\" of the gun he could cause Victim's death, but that acknowledgement did not speak to the conflict created by his assertions: whether he understood that in pleading guilty to first degree murder he was conceding that the concept of imperfect self-defense did not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b625 Thus, I question whether the ambiguities introduced in the plea hearing regarding the nature of Defendant's plea were resolved by the court's colloquy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addressing Defendant's challenge based on ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude that he failed to demonstrate that, absent the claimed errors, he would have rejected the State's plea offer and that it would have been rational under the circumstances to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rippey v.

I believe this deficiency is equally fatal to Defendant's challenge based on the voluntary nature of his plea.
