FISCHER, JUDGE:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b61 Kenneth Ray Johnson sued the GEO Group, Inc., GEO Care, and their employees Kirk Smith and Connie Wood (the GEO parties) concerning two alleged assaults while he was in the custody of the Department of Corrections and incarcerated at GEO's Lawton Correctional Facility. Johnson further alleged that he was denied medical care for the injuries he suffered as a result of the assaults. Johnson also sued the DOC alleging that he continued to be denied medical care after he was transferred from GEO's facility back to a DOC facility. Richard Baldwin sued the DOC alleging it improperly disclosed his medical, psychological and juvenile criminal records to counsel for GEO. Johnson and Baldwin appeal the district court's judgment in favor of the defendants granting their motions for summary judgment. The appeal has been assigned to the accelerated docket pursuant to Oklahoma Supreme Court Rule 1.36(b), 12 O.S. Supp. 2013, ch. 15, app. 1, and the matter is submitted without appellate briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm the judgment in favor of the DOC as to Baldwin's claim because the undisputed facts in this record show that the DOC did not disclose Baldwin's medical, psychological or juvenile criminal records. As to Johnson's claim against the DOC, we affirm that portion of the judgment regarding Johnson's tort claims because the DOC is immune from suit for those alleged torts. However, the DOC is not immune to the extent that it denied medical care for Johnson's serious medical needs in violation of his rights protected by Article 2, section 9 of the Oklahoma Constitution. We vacate that portion of the district court's judgment and remand that aspect of Johnson's claim for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 We vacate the judgment in favor of the GEO parties because Johnson complied with the notice provisions of the Governmental Tort Claims Act, 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7\u00a7 151 to 172, and filed his action within the applicable statute of limitations, and there are issues of fact concerning when Johnson's cause of action accrued. That aspect of this case is also remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 At the time the events precipitating Johnson and Baldwin's claims occurred, both men were in the custody of the DOC. Pursuant to a contract between the DOC and the GEO Group, they were incarcerated at GEO's Lawton Correctional Facility, a private prison. Johnson alleges that he was physically assaulted on two occasions by a GEO correctional officer and that he was denied medical care for his injuries after the assaults. The alleged assaults occurred in late March and early April of 2012. Shortly thereafter, Johnson was transferred back to a DOC facility where he stayed until he was released in March of 2013. After his return to a DOC facility, Johnson sued the GEO Group and its correctional officer in federal court regarding the alleged assaults. Johnson's federal court complaint was filed on April 19, 2012, and alleged that the GEO Group failed to properly train and supervise its correctional officer and that its medical personnel refused to provide treatment for the injuries Johnson suffered as a result of the assaults. Johnson's claim against the GEO parties in this case is based only on the alleged denial of medical care. Johnson's amended petition states: \"No federal causes of action are sought at this time by Plaintiffs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Baldwin claims to have been a witness to one of the alleged assaults and his deposition was taken in conjunction with Johnson's federal suit. Baldwin's claim is based on an alleged improper and unauthorized disclosure of his medical, psychological and juvenile criminal records which were then used as the basis for questioning him during his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Johnson and Baldwin filed their petition in the Comanche County district court on April 4, 2014. They named the DOC, several of its employees and the GEO parties as defendants. On February 9, 2015, Johnson and Baldwin dismissed the DOC defendants without prejudice. Both plaintiffs filed essentially the same claim against the DOC defendants in the district court for Oklahoma County on May 28, 2015; however, they only issued summons for and obtained service on the DOC. Johnson and Baldwin then filed an amended petition in the Comanche County case on June 1, 2015, naming only the GEO parties as defendants. The two cases proceeded independently until the DOC voluntarily agreed to have the Oklahoma County case consolidated with the Comanche County case. The transcript of the Oklahoma County case pleadings was filed in the Comanche County case on January 27, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Prior to the consolidation of the cases, the GEO parties filed a motion to dismiss in the Comanche County case. On January 20, 2016, the district court denied GEO's motion as to Johnson's claim but granted that motion as to Baldwin's claim. Baldwin did not seek leave to amend nor did he file an amended petition. Further, Baldwin did not appeal the order dismissing his claim. Therefore, Baldwin's claim against the GEO parties has been terminated in their favor and is not an issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 After the Oklahoma and Comanche County cases were consolidated, all of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment. Johnson and Baldwin appeal the district court's May 12, 2017, Journal Entry of Judgment granting those motions and entering judgment in favor of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Title 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2056 governs the procedure for summary judgment in this case.

Baldwin's Claim against the DOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Baldwin alleges that his juvenile criminal record was unlawfully disclosed to counsel for the GEO parties and used at his deposition. Baldwin claimed to be a witness to one of the alleged assaults on Johnson at GEO's facility. Baldwin's deposition was taken on October 29, 2013, after he was released from incarceration. During the deposition, GEO's counsel asked Baldwin if he had any criminal history prior to the conviction for which he had been incarcerated at GEO's facility. Baldwin answered \"juvenile.\" A series of nine questions and answers followed, which appear to have been redacted later at the request of Baldwin's counsel. Baldwin sued the DOC alleging it unlawfully provided GEO's counsel his Texas juvenile records, which were used as the basis for these questions at his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 In its motion for summary judgment, the DOC conceded that it provided some of Baldwin's records to GEO's counsel but argued that \"no juvenile records nor medical/psychological records were requested or produced to [GEO's counsel].\" The quoted statement is contained in an affidavit supporting the DOC's motion for summary judgment. In his response, Baldwin stated that he was unable to admit or deny the statement in the affidavit. Nonetheless, Baldwin argued: \"Some how [GEO's] counsel while representing Defendant GEO in the Federal Court litigation had access to Baldwin's juvenile records and asked him specific questions.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   When a motion for summary judgment is properly made and supported, an opposing party may not rely merely on allegations or denials in its own pleading; rather, its response must, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, set out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. If the opposing party does not so respond, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against that party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2056(E).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Once defendant has introduced evidentiary materials indicating that there is no substantial controversy as to one fact material to plaintiff's cause of action and that this fact is in defendant's favor, plaintiff then has the burden of showing that evidence is available which would justify a trial of the issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Runyon v.

The district court's judgment in favor of the DOC as to Baldwin's claim is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II. Johnson's Appeal of the Judgment in Favor of the DOC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b613 Johnson's claim against the DOC is based on the alleged assaults at GEO's facility. Johnson alleges that the DOC \"failed to take proper and immediate action\" after the assaults, and after he was transferred back to a DOC facility, DOC healthcare providers continued to deny him medical care. Johnson alleged that the DOC's conduct constituted various State torts including assault and battery, civil conspiracy, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Johnson also alleged that this conduct violated his civil rights protected by Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 With respect to the latter, Johnson contends that he is asserting a \"\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   claim.\" In\n   <em>\n    Bosh v. Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    2013 OK 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    305 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that pre-trial detainees have a private right of action pursuant to Article 2, \u00a7 30 of the Oklahoma Constitution to redress the use of excessive force. This is not a\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   case. Johnson was incarcerated as the result of a prior conviction at the time he was allegedly assaulted. Johnson's claim is governed by Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 9.\n   <em>\n    Bosh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    2013 OK 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    305 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Johnson's petition alleges that they continued to deny him medical care until he was released in March of 2013. In his response to the DOC's motion for summary judgment, Johnson relied on his deposition testimony stating that DOC medical personnel not only ignored his request for medical care but also told him \"to deal with the injury when he got out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 The DOC's reply to Johnson's response does not offer evidence contradicting Johnson's testimony or the affidavit of the physician who treated Johnson after he was released from the DOC's facility. That treating physician stated that he could not rule out the possibility that Johnson's post-incarceration injury resulted from the lack of medical care Johnson alleged while he was in DOC custody. The DOC did not offer evidence contradicting Johnson's evidence, but even if it had, that would only have created an issue of fact precluding summary judgment. Summary judgment is only proper where \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\" 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2056(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winston v. Stewart &amp; Elder, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11363303\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1063/\">\n    2002 OK 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11363303\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/55/1063/\">\n    55 P.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the district court is required to rule out all theories of liability fairly comprised within the evidentiary materials).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Further, and contrary to the DOC's argument, Johnson has not just sued the DOC for acts or omissions committed by its contractor, the GEO Group or the GEO Group's employees. Johnson's claim against the DOC is based on the DOC's alleged failure to act while he was in DOC custody and incarcerated in GEO's facility, as well as for the DOC's failure to provide medical care after he was transferred back to a DOC facility. The record shows that Johnson was transferred from the GEO facility to a DOC facility on April 13, 2012, shortly after the alleged assaults, and that he was released from custody by the DOC on March 25, 2013. As a result, Johnson's claim against the DOC is not, as the DOC argues, based on acts that occurred prior to April 19, 2012, the date on which he filed his federal court case. The last date on which Johnson alleges that he was denied medical care by the DOC was March 25, 2013, the date he was released by the DOC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Rather than challenging the merits of Johnson's claim, the DOC's motion for summary judgment raised three essentially jurisdictional arguments: (1) Johnson's suit is barred because he failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Governmental Tort Claims Act; (2) the DOC is immune from suit for the conduct that Johnson alleges occurred; and (3) the district court did not have jurisdiction because Johnson failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A. The Notice Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b619 The DOC first argues that Johnson's suit must be dismissed because he failed to comply with the notice requirements of the Tort Claims Act. 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7\u00a7 151 to 172. \"Compliance with the statutory notice provisions of the [Tort Claims Act] is a jurisdictional requirement to be completed prior to the filing of any pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall v. The GEO Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958879\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/324/399/\">\n    2014 OK 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6958879\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/324/399/\">\n    324 P.3d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 156(B) of the Tort Claims Act provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [C]laims against the state or a political subdivision are to be presented within one (1) year of the date the loss occurs. A claim against the state or a political subdivision shall be forever barred unless notice thereof is presented within one (1) year after the loss occurs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The last date on which Johnson could have been denied medical care was March 25, 2013, the date he was released from the DOC facility. The record contains a Notice of Tort Claim dated February 5, 2014, from Johnson's attorney to the DOC. The DOC does not argue that this notice was defective. And, this notice was clearly provided \"within one (1) year after the loss occurs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Consequently,\n   Johnson complied with the one year requirement of section 156(B) of the Tort Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 Also in the record is a letter from the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services denying Johnson's February 2014, tort claim. That letter states that Johnson's claim was denied as of March 14, 2014, and that he had one hundred and eighty days within which to file suit. Section 157(B) of the Tort Claims Act provides: \"No action for any cause arising under this act ... shall be maintained unless valid notice has been given and the action is commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days after denial of the claim as set forth in this section.\" Johnson's Comanche County lawsuit was filed on April 4, 2014, and named the DOC as a defendant. Johnson's Comanche County petition satisfied the filing requirements of section 157(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b621 However, Johnson voluntarily dismissed his Comanche County case against the DOC on February 9, 2015. He did not sue the DOC again until May 28, 2015, when he filed his Oklahoma County action. That case was filed more than one hundred and eighty days after Johnson's tort claim was denied on March 14, 2014. Consequently, Johnson's Oklahoma County case is barred by the limitation period in section 157(B), unless Johnson is entitled to the benefit of his Comanche County filing. We hold that he is.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   If any action is commenced within due time, and ... if the plaintiff fail in such action otherwise than upon the merits, the plaintiff ... may commence a new action within one (1) year after the ... failure although the time limit for commencing the action shall have expired before the new action is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 100. \" Section 100 permits the refiling of a governmental tort claims action only where the court's power has been invoked by the original action.\"\n   <em>\n    Cruse v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs of Atoka Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1995%20OK%20143\">\n    1995 OK 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10340151\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/910/998/\">\n    910 P.2d 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Johnson's original Comanche County case properly invoked the district court's jurisdiction and his Oklahoma County action was filed within one year after the dismissal of his Comanche County case. Consequently, Johnson has satisfied the notice and filing requirements of sections 156 and 157 of the Tort Claims Act, and the DOC is not entitled to judgment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B. The Immunity Argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b622 The DOC next argues, citing 51 O.S. Supp. 2016 \u00a7 155 of the Tort Claims Act, that it is immune from Johnson's suit: \"The state or a political subdivision shall not be liable if a loss or claim results from: ... [p]rovision, equipping, operation or maintenance of any prison, jail or correctional facility ....\" 51 O.S. Supp. 2016 \u00a7 155(25). Although the DOC is correct in some respects, the Tort Claims Act \"cannot be construed as immunizing the state completely from all liability for violations of the constitutional rights of its citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Bosh v. Cherokee Cnty. Governmental Bldg. Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    2013 OK 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975114\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/305/994/\">\n    305 P.3d 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing the identical exemption, then numbered as section 155(24), regarding claims filed by pretrial detainees). Nonetheless, Johnson's Oklahoma tort claims, which include assault and battery, civil conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraud, relate to the operation of a correctional facility and the DOC is immune from suit for those claims. 51 O.S. Supp. 2016 \u00a7 155(25). The district court's judgment in favor of the DOC regarding Johnson's State tort claims is affirmed. The judgment regarding Johnson's constitutional claim is vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   C. The Exhaustion Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b623 In addition to his tort claims, however, Johnson also alleges that by denying him medical care, the DOC violated his Oklahoma Constitutional rights pursuant to Article 2, \u00a7 9, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. As this Court held in\n   <em>\n    Edelen v. Board of Commissioners of Bryan County\n   </em>\n   , Johnson's allegation that the DOC knowingly denied him care for a serious medical need would \"establish a violation of Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 9.\"\n   <em>\n    Edelen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985657\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/660/\">\n    2011 OK CIV APP 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985657\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/660/\">\n    266 P.3d 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   , October 24, 2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing so, we relied on\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

We did so for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b625 First, in the absence of controlling State authority: \"Federal case law provides a logical framework for determining the scope of the protection guaranteed by Oklahoma constitutional law.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaylord Entertainment Co. v.

And, following this principle, the\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   Court had relied on United States Supreme Court Eighth Amendment precedent when it determined that Oklahoma prisoners have a private right of action for the use of excessive force pursuant to Article 2, \u00a7 9 of Oklahoma's Constitution. Article 2, \u00a7 9 is the Oklahoma counterpart to the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b626 Second, the Oklahoma Supreme Court followed\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

We conclude that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would reach the same result that we reached in\n   <em>\n    Edelen\n   </em>\n   regarding Johnson's constitutional claim against the DOC. The deliberate denial of care for a prisoner's serious medical needs would violate Article 2, \u00a7 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b627 The DOC does not address whether Johnson has an Article 2, \u00a7 9 claim in this case, but contends that the district court would not have jurisdiction of any such claim because Johnson failed to comply with the administrative exhaustion requirements in Title 57 of the Oklahoma statutes. Section 564 of Title 57 requires a prisoner in the custody of the DOC to \"completely exhaust all administrative remedies on all potential claims\" before filing suit. 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 564. Section 566.3 requires an inmate to have \"exhausted all the remedies as provided in the grievance procedure\" of the DOC before the district court may entertain the suit. 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 566.3(G)(2). Finally, \"full and complete exhaustion of all administrative and statutory remedies on all potential claims against ... the Department of Corrections ... is a jurisdictional requirement and must be completed prior to the filing of any pleadings.\" 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 566.5.

This argument ignores traditional rules of statutory construction. Both sections 564 and 566.5 of Title 57 require exhaustion of administrative \"remedies,\" not exhaustion of an administrative \"process.\" \"[T]he general rule is that nothing may be read into a statute which was not within the manifest intention of the legislature as gathered from the language of the act.\"\n   <em>\n    Stemmons, Inc. v.

The Legislature did not require a prisoner to file a grievance and complete the grievance \"process\" before filing suit. The Legislature required a prisoner to exhaust pursuit of \"all available administrative remedies. ...\" 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 564.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Finally, this construction is consistent with federal law on this issue. In the appellate record is the Report and Recommendation of the federal magistrate judge filed in Johnson's federal case. That Report considered the GEO Group's motion for summary judgment arguing that Johnson's case should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies available through the DOC's grievance process which GEO Group was required to adopt and follow. The Report states that exhaustion of available administrative remedies is required before a prisoner can sue in federal court, citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2006). The Report also states that Johnson did not exhaust the administrative process but concludes that \"he had no obligation to do so\" because the GEO Group did not identify any remedies that would have been available to Johnson if he had completed the grievance process. The Report recommended that the GEO Group's motion for summary judgment be denied. The federal district court adopted that recommendation and denied the GEO Group's motion for summary judgment on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Johnson sued the DOC for actual and punitive damages. Absent some form of immunity, monetary damages are an appropriate remedy for the violation of constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    Gay Activists Alliance v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1981%20OK%20162\">\n    1981 OK 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10439302\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/638/1116/\">\n    638 P.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DOC's Inmate/Offender Grievance Process provides at paragraph II.B.4, that: \"Grievances shall not be submitted requesting monetary compensation.\" Therefore, no remedy was available to Johnson for the monetary damages he seeks for the alleged violation of his Article 2, \u00a7 9 rights. The DOC's grievance process was not even available to him. If no administrative remedy is available, there is no administrative process to exhaust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b633 We hold that sections 564 and 566.5 of Title 57 only prevent a court from obtaining jurisdiction of a prisoner's Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 9 claim if the DOC's grievance procedure would provide a remedy comparable to that available through an action in district court. In this case, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b634 Consequently, Johnson was not required to initiate or complete the DOC's Inmate/Offender Grievance Process with respect to his constitutional claim for the denial of medical care prior to suing the DOC. The district court had jurisdiction of that portion of Johnson's petition. The judgment in favor of the DOC regarding Johnson's Article 2, \u00a7 9 claim is vacated, and that aspect of this case is remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   III. Johnson's Appeal of the GEO Parties' Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b635 Johnson's Amended Petition in the Comanche County case alleges that he was\n   physically assaulted on two occasions by a correctional officer employed by the GEO Group. From the record, it appears that the assaults occurred on April 5, 2012, and \"about two weeks\" before that. The individual that Johnson alleges committed these assaults is not named as a defendant in this case. However, Johnson did name him and the GEO Group as defendants in his April 2012 federal case. In this case, Johnson alleges that the GEO Group and GEO Care failed to provide medical care after the assault. Johnson's amended petition also alleges that GEO employees, Smith and Wood, were employed as medical personnel. But, the body of the petition does not allege any specific wrongdoing by either of these defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b636 Johnson claims that by denying him medical care, the GEO parties violated the rights guaranteed to him pursuant to Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 9. He also alleges that the GEO parties have committed associated State torts including assault and battery, civil conspiracy, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Like the DOC's motion, the GEO parties' motion for summary judgment does not principally rely on undisputed substantive facts, but raises essentially jurisdictional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A. Failure to Comply with Tort Claims Notice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b637 The GEO parties argue that they are entitled to judgment because Johnson failed to comply with the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act, citing 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 566.4(B)(2) : \"No tort action or civil claim may be filed against any ... private correctional company ... until all of the notice provisions of the Governmental Tort Claims Act have been fully complied with by the claimant.\"\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 566.5 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In any legal proceeding filed by an inmate, full and complete exhaustion of all administrative and statutory remedies on all potential claims against the state, the Department of Corrections, private entities contracting to provide correctional services ... is a jurisdictional requirement and must be completed prior to the filing of any pleadings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The section 566.5 requirement for complete exhaustion of \"statutory remedies\" includes the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

The answer to that question requires construction of the relevant provisions of the Tort Claims Act, guided by the general principle that \"the primary goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and follow the intention of the legislature and in construing statutes relevant provisions must be considered together, where possible, to give force and effect to each.\"\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter v.

The state, its political subdivisions, and all of their employees ... shall be immune from liability for torts.\" 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 152.1(A). None of the GEO parties is the State of Oklahoma, a political subdivision of the State or an employee of either.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   51 O.S. Supp. 2014 \u00a7\u00a7 152 (11) and 152(13). And, we cannot add language to extend sovereign immunity to the GEO parties when the Legislature has not chosen to do so. \"[T]he general rule is that nothing may be read into a statute which was not within the manifest intention of the legislature as gathered from the language of the act.\"\n   <em>\n    Stemmons, Inc. v.

Supp. 2016 \u00a7 155(18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   ., 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 153.1 (\"Nothing in the Governmental Tort Claims Act shall be construed as allowing an action or recovery against this state ... due to the housing of federal inmates or inmates from another state in facilities owned or operated by private prison contractors.\"). Consequently, it is clear that the Legislature did not intend to create any new cause of action. It appears that the Legislature intended to impose nothing more than a procedural requirement that must be satisfied before any suit can be filed against a private correctional facility. Pursuant to this construction, the GEO parties' jurisdictional argument is limited to the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b641 The notice section of the Tort Claims Act provides: \"A claim against the\n   <strong>\n    state\n   </strong>\n   shall be in writing and filed with the Office of the Risk Management Administrator of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services ....\" 51 O.S. Supp. 2012 \u00a7 156(C) (emphasis added). Section 156(D) of the Tort Claims Act sets out the requirements for filing a notice of tort claim against\n   <strong>\n    a political subdivision\n   </strong>\n   of the State and provides that the claim shall be \"filed with the office of the clerk of the governing body.\" 51 O.S. Supp. 2012 \u00a7 156(D) (emphasis added). There is no provision in the Tort Claims Act requiring the submission of a notice of tort claim to a non-governmental entity like the GEO Group. And, there is no entity identified in the Tort Claims Act as the person designated to receive a notice of tort claim on behalf of a non-governmental entity like the GEO Group. The only notice required by the Tort Claims Act is notice to the State's risk manager or the clerk of its governing body of its political subdivisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b642 Consequently, there is clear inconsistency between the literal direction in the exhaustion provisions of Title 57 and the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act. \"When a strict literal construction leads to an inconsistent or incongruent result between provisions, we will utilize rules of statutory construction to reconcile the discord and ascertain the legislative intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Hogg v.

The prisoner did not file any notice or otherwise attempt to comply with the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act before filing his suit. In affirming dismissal of the prisoner's case for lack of jurisdiction, the Supreme Court held that compliance with the notice provisions of the Tort Claims Act was required \"prior to the filing of any pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. But, the Court did not address what notice was required or to whom it was to be submitted because the plaintiff had not submitted any notice. Therefore, what Johnson was required to do before filing suit against the GEO parties has not yet been settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b643 As discussed in Part II(A) of this Opinion, Johnson did satisfy the notice requirements of the Tort Claims Act as to his claim against the DOC. Johnson's tort claim notice was submitted on February 6, 2014, less than one year after the date he was allegedly last denied medical care.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   51 O.S. Supp. 2012 \u00a7 156(B). And, Johnson's Comanche County suit was filed on April 4, 2014, within one hundred and eighty days after his tort claim was denied on March 12, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 157(B). Those are all of the \"notice provisions\" of the Tort Claims Act available to Johnson or with which he could have complied. 57 O.S.2011 \u00a7 566.4(B)(2). We find no authority supporting the GEO parties' argument that the filing period for Johnson's notice of tort claim should have begun on April 13, 2012, the last date on which Johnson was incarcerated in their facility. This may have been the date on which the GEO parties last denied Johnson medical care, but that does not resolve the Tort Claims Act notice issue. The GEO parties' argument fails to consider the effect of the notice requirement on the accrual of Johnson's cause of action against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b644 Although we find no provision in the Tort Claims Act requiring Johnson to notify any of the GEO parties of his claim against them, Johnson was clearly required to notify someone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   57 O.S.2011 \u00a7\u00a7 566.4 and 566.5. Even though Johnson was incarcerated at GEO's Lawton facility when these events\n   occurred, he remained in the custody of the DOC. And, the DOC was responsible for selecting the GEO Group's facility as the location of Johnson's incarceration. Even if the DOC might ultimately be able to avoid liability for the acts or omissions of the GEO parties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   51 O.S.

Johnson's claim is based on Article 2, \u00a7 9 of the Oklahoma Constitution. Nonetheless, the substance of the GEO parties' argument is that the events giving rise to Johnson's claim against them occurred, at the latest, by April 13, 2012, when he was transferred back to the DOC. Because Johnson's suit was not filed until April 4, 2014, they contend that Johnson's suit is barred by the one-year limitation period in 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 95(11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b647 The applicable provision of section 95 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   A.

But\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable on this point. Brown's suit was based on acts that occurred while he was incarcerated in the Creek County jail. And, Brown sued Creek County, a political subdivision of the State. Consequently, Brown's suit was one \"arising under\" the Tort Claims Act. 51 O.S.2011 \u00a7 157(B).

As previously established, none of the GEO parties is either.

Johnson's tort claim was denied on March 25, 2014.

In his summary judgment response, Johnson argued that the denial of medical care after an assault like he suffered can result in a chronic condition or permanent injury. He contended that his condition was diagnosed as chronic and potentially permanent, a fact he did not discover until late 2013 when he was released from prison and finally able to see a physician. Attached to Johnson's response is a portion of the transcript from the deposition of Johnson's treating physician, which supported Johnson's argument. \"The discovery rule allows the limitation period in certain tort cases to be tolled until the injured party knows or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Digital Design Group, Inc. v.

They merely argued that Johnson must have been aware of his injury by April 19, 2012, the date he filed his federal lawsuit based on the same injury. Consequently, a question of fact exists as to when Johnson knew of his injury. That dispute precludes summary judgment. \"Only if the court should\n   conclude that there is no material fact in dispute and the law favors the movant's claim or liability-defeating defense is the moving party entitled to summary judgment in its favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Copeland v.

If Johnson's cause of action accrued in late 2013, when he contends that he discovered the permanent nature of his injury, then his suit was filed within the one-year limitation period of section 95(11), the limitation period that the GEO parties argue is applicable. Summary judgment in favor of the GEO parties was not available on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   C. Exhaustion of GEO's Grievance Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b653 The GEO parties also argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Johnson failed to exhaust GEO's facilities' grievance procedure while he was incarcerated in their facility. According to the Special Report submitted by GEO's warden in Johnson's federal case, GEO \"abides by the policy and procedure of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections regarding grievance procedures ....\" GEO conceded in the federal case that no real remedy was available to Johnson. And, the federal court ruled against GEO on that issue, a ruling that may have preclusive effect as discussed in the following section of this Opinion. If not, our discussion of the grievance exhaustion requirement in Part II(C) of this Opinion may dispose of GEO's exhaustion argument, a matter to be resolved on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   D. The Medical Affidavit Issue\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b654 The GEO parties also argue that Johnson failed to file an affidavit from a medical expert with his petition as required by 12 O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 19.1(A). That statute applies in \"any civil action for negligence wherein the plaintiff shall be required to present the testimony of an expert witness to establish breach of the relevant standard of care ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . In those cases, the statute requires that the plaintiff submit an affidavit, filed with the petition stating that the plaintiff has consulted with an expert and has obtained a written opinion that the plaintiff's claim is meritorious.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Johnson argues that an affidavit was not required because his is not a medical negligence case, but a claim based on the complete denial of medical care. The GEO parties did not respond to this argument or otherwise demonstrate the applicability of section 19.1 to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   \u00b655 Johnson also points out that GEO has taken the deposition of his medical expert and obtained the expert's opinion. The district court denied the GEO parties' motion to dismiss on this basis, and they did not seek immediate review of that decision. The GEO parties have failed to show that granting the relief they request at this point in the litigation would \"secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of [this] action.\" 12 O.S.2011 \u00a7 2001. The remedy for failure to comply with section 19.1 is a ninety-day extension within which to submit the missing affidavit. Summary judgment in favor of the GEO parties on this basis is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   E. The Preclusive Effect of the Federal Court Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b656 The GEO parties' final argument is that Johnson's claim is precluded by the decision of the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in the related case that Johnson filed on April 19, 2012. In that case, Johnson sued the GEO Group and the correctional officer that he alleged committed the assaults. Johnson alleged that the GEO Group failed to properly supervise the officer and failed to provide adequate medical care after the assaults in violation of Johnson's federal constitutional rights. The GEO Group filed a motion for summary judgment, which the federal district court granted as to Johnson's claims for failure to supervise and failure to provide adequate medical care. The federal court entered judgment in favor of the GEO Group on November 5, 2013, noting that the case would proceed against the individual defendant. Ultimately, the case was dismissed after Johnson settled his claim against the GEO correctional officer. There is no evidence in this record showing that Johnson appealed the judgment in favor of the GEO Group.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b657 Claim preclusion bars relitigation of issues by the same parties which either were or could have been litigated in a\n   prior action that resulted in a judgment on the merits.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The issues that Johnson asserts against the GEO Group in this case appear to be the same as the issues that were resolved by the federal court judgment in favor of the GEO Group, but with one fundamental difference. Johnson's claim in federal court was based on the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. His claim in this case is based on Okla. Const. art. 2, \u00a7 9.
