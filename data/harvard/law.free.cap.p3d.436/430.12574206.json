When one court exercises its jurisdiction in a specific case, the priority of action doctrine prohibits another court from interfering. But what constitutes the same case for purposes of the priority of action doctrine is not always clear. Our case law establishes that a search warrant proceeding is not part of the same case for purposes of the doctrine because one proceeding does not have a preclusive effect on the other. We now hold that the same is true for a preliminary appearance hearing. A court's authority to hold a preliminary appearance hearing is separate from the authority to adjudicate a criminal trial, and the preliminary appearance hearing has no preclusive effect on the criminal trial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Because a preliminary appearance hearing is distinct from the criminal trial process, a district court's exercise of authority over a substantive criminal charge does not preclude the superior court from holding a preliminary appearance hearing. This matter is therefore reversed, with instructions that the State be granted a writ of mandamus directing the district court to recognize the validity of preliminary appearance orders issued by the superior court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 This case arises from a dispute between judges of the superior and district courts of Stevens County regarding how to handle preliminary appearances for individuals arrested and detained in the county jail. The conflict began on January 29, 2018, when the administrator for the Stevens County Superior Court sent an e-mail to the superior and district court judges, prosecutors, and others notifying them that all in-custody first appearances for both courts were to be heard by the superior court at noon on Mondays through Fridays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 The superior court administrator's e-mail was not well-received by the district court. On February 2, 2018, Stevens County District Court Judge Gina Tveit e-mailed the district court staff directing that no orders be filed in a district court case unless signed by a district court judge or district court judge pro tem. This e-mail was copied to the superior court judges, the county clerk, the county's chief corrections officer, and the superior court administrator (who then forwarded it to the prosecutor's office).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 On February 5, 2018, the Stevens County Superior Court judges jointly signed an administrative order requiring all preliminary appearances be heard by the superior court judges or a court commissioner. The order identified the reasons for instituting the policy, including: scheduling conflicts between the courts, the clerks, the jail, and attorneys; the hardship to the jail to accommodate different first appearances held in both courts; the frequent interruptions and excessive delays caused by the current procedure; and the superior court's ability to remedy the situation by conducting all first appearances during the noon hour via video to the jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The Stevens County prosecuting attorney subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus, seeking to require Judge Tveit to rescind her February 2, 2018, directive and to recognize the validity of superior court\n   preliminary appearance orders. According to the affidavit in support of the petition, a Stevens County Superior Court judge presided over an in-custody first appearance for an individual named Edwin Maestas concerning two gross misdemeanors. The superior court judge entered a CrR 3.2 hearing order and set the matter over to the district court for 1:30 p.m. that day. The district court staff did not file the order or set the matter on the district court's docket. The State's affidavit also referenced two other criminal cases where Judge Tveit disregarded the administrative order and presided over the preliminary appearances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 The State's petition for mandamus was heard by a visiting superior court judge, appointed pursuant to\n   RCW 4.12.040. Citing the priority of action rule, the visiting judge denied the State's petition. In his memorandum opinion dated March 7, 2018, the judge reasoned that a preliminary appearance is part of a criminal case and once the district court assumes jurisdiction of a case through a filed criminal charge, the superior court is prohibited from exercising jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The State timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 A statutory writ of mandamus may be issued \"to compel the performance of an act which the law especially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station.\" RCW 7.16.160.

Because district court clerks act at the direction of district court judges, RCW 3.54.020, the mandamus petition was directed at Stevens County District Court Judge Tveit. According to the State, mandamus should issue because Judge Tveit's instruction that the district court staff not accept preliminary hearing orders from superior court is based on a mistake of law. According to the State, the superior court retains authority to hold a preliminary hearing and enter related orders, even after a district court case has been filed and the district court has assumed exclusive original jurisdiction over the trial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Our assessment of the State's position requires an analysis of superior court jurisdiction and how that\n   jurisdiction is, or is not, limited by a district court's exercise of jurisdiction over a particular criminal case. In this context, the term \"jurisdiction\" refers to a court's power to act.\n   <em>\n    ZDI Gaming, Inc. v. Wash.

In this context, a court's role is reactive; it has no authority to proceed without receiving some sort of formal charge. But a preliminary hearing is different.
