The judgment awarded Enrique Torero (Father) sole physical custody of their minor child, A.T., modifying the custody arrangement from their divorce decree. The district court did not take any evidence to\n   support a finding that a substantial change of circumstances had occurred or that a transfer in custody was in the child's best interest. Because the district court did not make the required findings before entering the judgment by default, it exceeded its discretion in modifying the existing custody order. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Upon their divorce in September 2014, Mother and Father were granted joint physical and legal custody of their child, A.T. Eight months later, Mother filed a petition to modify the divorce decree based on changed circumstances. Mother sought sole physical custody of A.T. because Father had moved out of the area, making joint physical custody impractical. Father filed an answer denying Mother's allegations and seeking dismissal for failure to state a cause of action. Father also filed a motion seeking a court determination of where the child should go to school as well as a custody evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 At a hearing on the motions, the parties stipulated that A.T. would attend the school Father selected and agreed to a custody evaluation regarding Mother's petition to modify. The court then ordered a custody evaluation, splitting the cost equally between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Pursuant to rule 4-903 of the Utah Rules of Judicial Administration, the domestic relations commissioner held a settlement conference in which the custody evaluator participated. When the parties were unable to reach a resolution, the commissioner certified the case for trial. The commissioner's pre-trial order provided that either party could request a written report from the evaluator and that \"both parties shall share the costs of the written report equally, one-half (1/2) to each.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Father requested a written custody evaluation, and the evaluator informed the parties that the cost of such a report was $3,500, which needed to be paid in full before the report could be prepared. Father promptly paid the evaluator for his half.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Roughly two months before trial, the evaluator notified the court that she had not received payment from Mother and, consequently, would be unable to submit the report before trial. Father subsequently filed a motion to continue the trial as well as a motion for sanctions and attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 In the motion for sanctions, Father alleged that the custody evaluator had recommended, during the settlement conference, that Father \"should have physical and legal custody to the parties' minor child and that [Mother's] parent time should be substantially reduced.\" Father also alleged that Mother had \"no intention of complying with the court's order and paying\" the evaluator because the evaluation was adverse to her. As a sanction for Mother's failure to pay, Father sought an order awarding him \"the sole physical and legal custody of the parties' minor child,\" attorney fees, and other appropriate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The district court held a telephone conference with the parties' attorneys. Father's attorney asserted that Mother was \"flat-out refusing to pay\" for the custody evaluation because \"it was readily apparent [from the rule 4-903 hearing] that the report was very negative towards [Mother].\" Mother's attorney conceded, \"[Father's counsel] is correct, [the evaluator's] discussion at the 4-903 hearing was not favorable to [Mother].\" Her attorney explained that Mother did not intend to call the evaluator as a witness at trial and believed that the evaluator's testimony was unnecessary given that Father had not filed a counterpetition seeking sole custody of A.T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The district court suggested that, if Father was now asking for sole custody, Father should amend his pleadings to include that relief. Father's attorney agreed and indicated that he would immediately file an amended answer and counterpetition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 The district court granted the motion to continue but deferred its ruling on sanctions. The court again ordered that \"both sides pay one-half the cost\" of the written report. The court warned that it might impose sanctions if Mother persisted in her refusal to pay:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I think I can grant as a sanction custody to the father if she doesn't pay, and that's kind of why I want her to pay one half, is\n   because if she continues to take this position, I'm not going to pay, then to me, a logical sanction is to say fine, the Court's going to award custody to the father, but I don't think I can do that until the pleadings are amended.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The district court issued an order requiring Mother to immediately pay the evaluator and allowing Father to amend his pleadings. Father filed an amended answer and counterpetition to modify the divorce decree by granting him sole physical and legal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The following month, the district court held a telephone conference with Father's attorney and Mother, appearing pro se.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father's attorney explained that Mother did not pay the evaluator as ordered and had instead offered to pay $50 per month until the debt was satisfied. Based on her failure to comply with the court's order, Father asked the court to strike Mother's pleadings and enter a default judgment granting sole custody to Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Mother objected, insisting she was willing but unable to pay. Mother confirmed that she was able to \"pay $50, ... until [she was] able to come up with the whole amount.\" The court explained to Mother that \"it just doesn't work that way\" because she had already been ordered to pay one-half of the fee immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Mother again objected, saying, \"Your Honor, I don't have money. I don't have money. I don't have money right now. I will pay her immediately. I am trying to come up with the funds.\" The court explained that taking a year or two to pay in installments was unacceptable because the case needed to move forward to trial. Mother objected again, saying, \"I just got done telling you that I don't have all the funds right now.\" Mother insisted that she had told her former attorney that she would pay the evaluator \"when she renders services,\" and that her former attorney had misrepresented her position to the court. The court asked again, \"So you don't intend to pay your half of the fee to [the evaluator]?\" At that point, Mother suggested that it might be easier for her to communicate in Spanish and offered to respond to the court in writing, but she reiterated, \"I'm saying I will pay her as soon as I come up with the full amount. I'm not refusing to pay.\" Mother stated that she was trying to \"get money from [her] kids, or a loan for [her] house\" and would try to come up with the full amount within four to six weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 The court asked Father's attorney how long the case had been pending, but Mother continued speaking. Father's counsel stated that \"she always interrupts\" and \"we've had problems with her complying with the court orders,\" which counsel asserted had resulted in delay. Mother continued to object, but the court stated, \"All right, [Father's attorney], I'll grant your motion. We'll just strike her answer and enter a default judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 Following the telephone conference, the district court signed a written order, prepared by Father, stating that because Mother had \"failed to comply with the Court's prior Orders, her Petition for Modification is hereby stricken and judgment shall be entered pursuant to the [Father's] Counter Petition to Modify Decree of Divorce.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court later entered an order modifying the divorce decree to award Father \"sole legal and physical custody of the parties' minor child.\" The order also provided that \"[Father] is to be awarded his costs and attorney fees against [Mother].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 Contemporaneously, the court entered \"Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   drafted by Father's attorney, in which the court purported to make factual findings that (1) there was a \"substantial and material change[ ] warranting the modification of the custody\" and (2) the change was in the child's \"best interests.\" These findings repeated Father's alleged facts verbatim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Mother appealed after the modified divorce decree was entered but before the court's final order setting the amount of attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b619 While Mother states several issues on appeal, the substance of her arguments relates to three discrete rulings by the district court. First, she challenges the district court's decision to allow Father to amend his answer and file a counterpetition for sole physical and legal custody. \"We review a district court's decision to grant an amendment of the pleadings for abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Swan Creek Vill.

Generally, \"we overturn a sanction only in cases evidencing a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick v.

In his brief, Father argues that we lack jurisdiction over the attorney fees issue, but he does not challenge our jurisdiction over the appeal generally. Nonetheless, \"because subject matter jurisdiction goes to the court's authority to hear a case, courts have an independent obligation to raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.\"\n   <em>\n    In re adoption of Baby E.Z.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    2011 UT 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n    266 P.3d 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b623 On May 22, 2017, the district court entered a modified divorce decree supported by separately entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. At that time, the court ruled that Father was entitled to an award of his costs and attorney fees. Mother filed her notice of appeal on June 19, 2017, seeking review of the court's \"final order\" dated May 22, 2017. When the notice of appeal was filed, the court had not yet entered an order setting the amount of attorney fees. The district court docket reflects that the order awarding attorney fees was entered on September 15, 2017. An amended judgment reflecting the amount of the attorney fees award was not entered until November 24, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mother never filed an amended notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624 Until recently, any \"appeal filed before a claim for attorney fees had been resolved was premature and would be dismissed.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 58A advisory committee notes on 2016 amendments. But in 2016, rule 4(b) of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure was amended \"to change the effect of a motion for attorney fees on the appealability of a judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985700\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/702/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The rule now provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A notice of appeal filed after announcement or entry of judgment, but before\n   entry of an order disposing of [a motion or claim for attorney fees under Rule 73 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure ], shall be treated as filed after entry of the order and on the day thereof, except that such a notice of appeal is effective to appeal only from the underlying judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Utah R. App. P. 4(b)(2). In other words, \"[i]f a notice of appeal is filed before the order resolving the timely motion, the appeal is not dismissed; it is treated as filed on the day the order ultimately is entered.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 58A advisory committee notes on 2016 amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b625 In applying the new rule 4(b), Father argues that once the court entered the order setting the amount of attorney fees, Mother's notice of appeal became effective, but only as to the May 22, 2017 order modifying the divorce decree. But, in a recent opinion, this court held that the new rule applies only if the pending motion for attorney fees is filed post-judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie v.

If the notice of appeal is prematurely filed before entry of a final, appealable order, the appellate court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b626 In concluding that the new rule applies only to post-judgment motions for attorney fees, our opinion in\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   relies on 4(b)(1)(F)'s specific reference to \"a motion or claim for attorney fees under rule 73 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347336\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1096/\">\n    2017 UT App 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347336\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1096/\">\n    407 P.3d 1096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Looking to the language of rule 73, we noted that a motion pursuant to the rule must \"specify the judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347336\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/407/1096/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation simplified). Because the application of rule 4(b)(1)(F) is limited to motions under rule 73, which in turn seems to presume that a judgment will exist when such a motion is filed, we concluded that rule 4(b)(1)(F) applied only to post-judgment motions for attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 Thus, under\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   , we lack jurisdiction, not just over the attorney fees award as Father contends, but over the entire appeal. In\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   , we held that we lacked jurisdiction where the husband filed his notice of appeal from an order dismissing his motion to modify a divorce decree and awarding attorney fees in an amount to be determined at a later date. Similarly, here, Mother filed her notice of appeal from entry of the modified divorce decree, which, among other things, awarded Father attorney fees in an amount to be determined. Because the modified divorce decree, like the order in\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   , contemplated additional action by the court, it was not final for purposes of appeal. And because the unresolved attorney fees issue did not result from a post-judgment motion under rule 73,\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   holds that rule 4(b)(1)(F) does not apply. Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction to hear this case as an appeal as of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b628 Ordinarily, this conclusion would necessitate dismissal of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loffredo v.

The primary issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion when it modified custody as a sanction against Mother without considering the best interests of the child. As explained in Part IV, this court has previously held that a district court cannot impose such a sanction. Any change in custody must be accompanied by adequately supported findings that the change is in the best interests of the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Given that the sanctions imposed by the district court over Mother's objection were in contravention of controlling authority, we would have initially deemed this issue worthy of an interlocutory appeal under rule 5. This is especially true where, at the time Mother filed her notice of appeal, Father had yet to submit an affidavit of attorney fees and costs and a final judgment on the matter was still some months off. Considering the time-sensitive nature of a child's custody and the uncertainty regarding when the attorney fees issue would be resolved, this case would have been suitable for interlocutory review to correct the patent error below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 The nature of this case also justifies special treatment. Unlike the order dismissing petitions to modify a divorce decree in\n   <em>\n    McQuarrie\n   </em>\n   , this case involves a custody order affecting a minor child.

However, this appeal involves the best interests of a minor child, and those interests have not been properly considered despite well-established law requiring such findings as a prerequisite to a change in custody.

If the court intended to award fees under section 30-3-3(1), it did not make the required findings regarding Father's financial need or Mother's ability to pay. If the court intended to award attorney fees as a sanction, it did not identify the authority on which the sanctions were based or the conduct that would merit such sanctions. Given the lack of findings to support an attorney fee award on either ground, we vacate the award without prejudice to the district court entertaining renewed motions for attorney fees on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b650 We reverse the imposition of sanctions and vacate the order modifying the decree of divorce. We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Mother claimed that she had fired her former attorney because he misrepresented to the court that she was willfully refusing to pay. Mother explained:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n    It's the other attorney communicating [to] you otherwise, that I was not going to pay, and it's not my fault that I got incompetent counsel communicating [to] you other than what I communicated [to] him. That's why I'm here, Your Honor, communicating to you what my intent is. I'm not refusing to pay [the evaluator]. I will pay [the evaluator]. I am trying to get the money ... [s]o I can pay [the evaluator] all the amount.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The sanction sought by Father was to strike Mother's pleadings. Although the court had verbally ordered Mother's answer stricken, Mother had not answered Father's counterpetition, and thus there was no answer to strike. Instead, the court struck Mother's petition to modify.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Neither the order setting the award of attorney fees or the amended judgment is part of the record on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     McQuarrie\n    </em>\n    's holding that\n    <em>\n     ProMax\n    </em>\n    still applies to pre-judgment motions for attorney fees appears to be in tension with the advisory committee's notes on the 2016 amendments.
