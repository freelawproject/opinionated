The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that Faucheaux, who seemingly brought this action as personal representative of the estate of Helen M. Faucheaux, did not have legal authority to bring a wrongful death suit. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In 2009, Faucheaux called 911 after finding his wife, Helen Faucheaux, \"unable to even complete a full sentence,\" \"stumbling around the house,\" and \"stumbl[ing] into the bathroom\" where he \"heard snorting noises.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Faucheaux informed the 911 operator that Helen had a history of drug abuse and that he was concerned that she \"had overdosed.\" Provo City police officers were dispatched, arrived at the Faucheaux home, and concluded that Helen was intoxicated and needed to \"sleep it off.\" They also advised Faucheaux to \"leave her alone\" since she was upset with him. Faucheaux insisted that his wife needed to be evaluated by a medical professional because she had previously attempted suicide and was possibly overdosing. Despite his pleas, the officers told him \"to\n   have a good night\" and left. He did not have a good night. Approximately two hours later, Faucheaux went to check on his wife and found her dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Faucheaux brought a wrongful death suit against Provo City, claiming its officers \"negligently failed to protect\" Helen when they responded to \"his request for a welfare check\" because, in answering that request, they \"undertook a specific action to protect\" Helen. Provo City, then discerning no problem with standing or subject matter jurisdiction, simply answered the complaint and later filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that \"its police officers had no legal duty to take [Helen] into custody against her will and deliver her for involuntary commitment\" and that \"[t]he discretionary acts of [Provo City's] police officers also provide [Provo City] with governmental immunity.\" Granting summary judgment to Provo City, the district court ruled that the city owed no duty of care to Helen and that, even if it did, it was immune from suit. Faucheaux appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On appeal from the initial summary judgment against Faucheaux, we determined that the district court erred in concluding that \"the public-duty doctrine shields Provo from liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Faucheaux v.

Faucheaux had no capacity to sue for wrongful death, and no real party in interest may be substituted.\" Faucheaux filed a response to the city's motion, arguing that Provo City forfeited the right to file a motion to dismiss when it filed its answer and that he brought his claim against Provo City as a personal representative of the heirs of Helen's estate, with the caption of his complaint identifying the estate as the party bringing the suit being merely a technical error. The district court dismissed the case, concluding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the estate did not have legal authority to bring a wrongful death suit under Utah Code section 78B-3-106(1) (LexisNexis 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Faucheaux again appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 \"Because the propriety of a motion to dismiss is a question of law, we review for correctness, giving no deference to the decision of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Krouse v.

Utah's wrongful death statute therefore permits only the heirs of the decedent, the personal representative of the decedent for the benefit of the decedent's heirs, or the heirs' guardian to bring a wrongful death suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-3-106(1) (LexisNexis 2012).

However, for both issues, he essentially argues that the district court erred by not recognizing that the caption of his complaint merely contained a technical error. Faucheaux asserts that he substantially complied with Utah Code section 78B-3-106(1) in bringing suit against Provo City, albeit purportedly as the personal representative of his wife's estate, because the body of his complaint states, with our emphasis, that \"Kevin Faucheaux is the personal representative, or will soon be named the personal representative, of the Estate of Helen M.

He argues that the complaint's caption, naming the plaintiff as \"Estate of Helen M. Faucheaux,\" was a technical error which he should be allowed to correct under rule 15(c) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure so that the caption reflects the substance of his complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Nevertheless, it is clear to us from the complaint and the record as a whole that Faucheaux purportedly brought this suit on behalf of the estate, and therefore in the first appeal we noted that Faucheaux was bringing the suit as the \"personal representative of Helen's estate.\"\n    <em>\n     Faucheaux v.

But we recognize that there is a fine line in a case where the decedent dies intestate between a recovery for the estate, which will be distributed to the heirs once any bills have been paid, and a recovery directly for the heirs. The line is even finer where, as here, the personal representative who brought the suit is also the primary-if not exclusive-heir. In sum, Faucheaux's technical-error argument takes him only so far. It supports our conversion of the plaintiff named in the caption in the earlier appeal from \"Estate of Helen M. Faucheaux\" to Kevin Faucheaux but does not warrant ignoring the complaint's references, and our prior opinion's recognition, that he brought the action as personal representative of the estate, albeit expressly for the benefit of Helen's heirs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Utah courts have broad authority over wrongful death claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-5-102(1) (LexisNexis 2012) (\"The district court has original jurisdiction in all matters civil and criminal, not excepted in the Utah Constitution and not prohibited by law.\");\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6884404\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/343/288/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-3-106(1) (creating a cause of action \"when the death of a person is caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Our holding in\n    <em>\n     Haro v.
