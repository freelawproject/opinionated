Four rounds struck Victim in his chest and arm, one of which killed him. Corona and his accomplices, who planned to rob Victim all along, fled, leaving Corona's cell phone at the murder scene. A jury convicted Corona of aggravated murder, aggravated robbery, possession of a firearm by a restricted person, and five counts of felony discharge of a firearm, all despite testimony from Witness that she pulled the trigger, not Corona. Corona challenges his convictions on four grounds: (1) that the trial court erroneously allowed the prosecution to present evidence of a prior shooting; (2) that trial counsel was ineffective for not moving to suppress evidence discovered from Corona's cell phone; (3) that Utah's aggravated murder statute is unconstitutionally disproportionate as applied; and (4) that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that Corona's convictions for discharge of a firearm should merge with his aggravated murder conviction. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 A group consisting of Corona's codefendants decided to rob Victim, a drug dealer. The group arranged to meet Victim early one morning in a church parking lot under the guise of a drug deal. Concerned that Victim would be armed and having no firearm of their own, the group enlisted Corona, who had a gun. Corona agreed to assist in the robbery and accompanied the group, all in a single car, to the church parking lot. Corona and another codefendant remained in the car while the other codefendants hid behind a nearby shed. There they waited for Victim to arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Witness drove Victim to the church parking lot. Victim exited his SUV and moved into the backseat of the car, where Corona and another codefendant waited. The group converged on Victim and a struggle ensued. Corona exited the car, drew his gun, and pointed it at Victim. As the struggle continued, Corona fired several shots at Victim. One shot proved fatal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Corona fled on foot. As he fled, Witness told the other codefendants to get in the SUV. Witness drove out of the parking lot with the codefendants, picking up Corona on the way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The police soon arrived and secured the scene. The police found Victim slumped over in the back seat of the still-running car, which the police traced to one of the codefendants. They also found Corona's cell phone on the front passenger seat of the car and Victim's cell phone on the floor in the backseat. The police requested a warrant, stating in the supporting affidavit, \"By looking in this phone your affiant and assisting investigators hope to identify the victim, suspect or suspects.\" A warrant was issued that authorized police to \"make a search of the above-named or described premises for the ... described property or evidence and if [the police found] the same or any part thereof, to ... retain such property in [police] custody, subject to the order of this court.\" The police seized and searched the cell phones, which revealed the identities of the phones' owners as well as calls between the two phones in the minutes leading up to the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The police also recovered fingerprints belonging to some of the codefendants, but none belonging to Corona. Five bullet casings and four bullets were also recovered. A ballistics analysis revealed that the five casings were fired from the same firearm and that the bullets were fired from the same firearm. But because the gun was not recovered, ballistics analysis could not determine whether the shell casings and bullets were fired from the same gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Based on the evidence collected at the scene, the police arrested Corona and the codefendants. All of the codefendants denied involvement at first, but they later admitted involvement and identified Corona as the shooter. The codefendants agreed to testify against Corona in exchange for guilty pleas to reduced charges. The codefendants' identification of the shooter was corroborated by Corona's girlfriend (Girlfriend). Girlfriend initially provided an alibi for Corona, saying that she and Corona were both home at the time of the murder. But, in a follow-up interview seven months later, she told police that Corona had left on the morning of the murder with one of the codefendants and told Girlfriend that he was going to help rob someone and he was taking his gun. Girlfriend further told police that when Corona returned he admitted to shooting Victim and that Corona was upset about having left his cell phone at the murder scene. While she attempted later to distance herself from these statements and go back to her original story that Corona had stayed home, Corona's and Girlfriend's cell phone records showed multiple calls and texts to each other near the time of the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Girlfriend's second interview also provided investigators with a lead that eventually connected Corona to the murder. Girlfriend made statements to police, which she later recanted, that Corona fired a gun during a different altercation in an AutoZone parking lot. Ballistics analysis showed that the bullet casings recovered at this prior shooting were fired from the same gun as the one used against Victim. Shortly before trial in April 2013, the State filed notice of its intent to introduce rule 404(b) evidence of the AutoZone shooting. The notice included a\n   police report of that shooting. On Corona's motion, the court continued the trial so that the admissibility of this evidence could be fully briefed and analyzed under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. The court eventually excluded the evidence of the prior shooting, reasoning that the evidence relied \"almost entirely\" on Girlfriend's inconsistent statements. But the court allowed reconsideration of its decision should \"the State develop additional evidence regarding the identity of the shooter ... or the door is opened by [Corona].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Four days before trial in January 2014, the State moved for reconsideration, claiming that it had developed additional evidence related to some car molding found at the scene of the AutoZone shooting matching a piece of molding missing from Corona's grandfather's car. The court gave the parties the option to continue the trial and address the rule 404(b) and suppression issues or to have the motions struck as untimely and proceed to trial. Corona agreed to proceed to trial and the court left its prior decision in place, subject to the defense opening the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 During the defense's case at trial, Corona called Witness to testify. Witness had made statements to police after the murder that she was waiting in her car when Victim was shot. But at trial, Witness testified that she, not Corona, shot and killed Victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On cross-examination and over defense counsel's objection, the State questioned Witness about where she had obtained the gun. Witness explained that she received the gun from a friend, not Corona, but refused to identify the friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 After Witness testified, the State argued that Witness had opened the door for admission of the evidence of the AutoZone shooting to be used to rebut her testimony. The court allowed the State to present the evidence of the AutoZone shooting, including evidence of the vehicle molding. Corona objected to the admissibility of the evidence and, although he had declined the earlier offer of a continuance before trial, now moved for a continuance, which the court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 The jury convicted Corona on all counts. Corona appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Corona brings four challenges on appeal. First, he contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the prior shooting. A trial court's admission of other-acts evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v. Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 56,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 Second, Corona contends that his counsel \"was ineffective in not pursuing suppression of unconstitutionally seized cellphone evidence.\" \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Again, we decide a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raised for the first time on appeal as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20UT%20App%20146\">\n    2018 UT App 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12570402\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/427/1261/\">\n    427 P.3d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. Evidence of the Prior Shooting\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Corona contends that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence of the AutoZone shooting in which he had been implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Corona argues four reasons why the evidence was improperly admitted: (1) the evidence \"could not properly be used to impeach [Witness]\" under rule 608 of the Utah Rules of Evidence ; (2) the evidence \"was not proper rebuttal evidence\"; (3) the evidence violated rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence in that it \"was irrelevant, improper character evidence, and more prejudicial than probative\"; and (4) \"the State's motion to admit the 404(b) evidence was not timely and the denial of a continuance to prepare to meet this evidence [was] prejudicial.\" We examine these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. Evidence of the AutoZone Shooting Was Properly Used to Impeach Witness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Corona argues that it was improper to use evidence of the AutoZone shooting to impeach Witness's statements that she was the shooter. Citing rule 608 of the Utah Rules of Evidence, he asserts that \"the admission of the [prior shooting] was improper because specific bad acts evidence alleged against the defendant cannot be used to attack another witness's credibility for truthfulness.\" We disagree and conclude that rule 608 does not apply in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 Rule 608 of the Utah Rules of Evidence governs what evidence may be introduced to attack or support a witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. The AutoZone shooting evidence is not an instance of conduct that attacks or supports Witness's character for truthfulness or untruthfulness; rather, it is substantive evidence that rebuts Witness's testimony that she shot Victim. \"[O]nce the defendant offers evidence or makes an assertion as to any fact, the State may cross-examine or introduce on rebuttal any testimony or evidence which would tend to contradict, explain or cast doubt upon the credibility of [that evidence].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    2014 UT App 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    318 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Accordingly, once defense counsel presented testimony that Witness, not Corona, had the gun, the State could properly use extrinsic evidence to prove that this assertion was arguably, and in the State's view demonstrably, false. The evidence did not address Witness's character for truthfulness or any other character trait. Instead, the evidence presented here provided a basis for the fact finder to conclude that Corona possessed and used the same gun weeks before Victim's murder, contradicting Witness's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 In\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   , a sixteen-year-old girl alleged that Thompson had forcibly engaged in sexual acts with her on a specific date between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Both Thompson and a friend testified that on that date, Thompson was driving a long-haul truck and that they were together on the road by 6:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Additionally, Thompson put driving logs into evidence to support the testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The State then offered extrinsic evidence, in the form of testimony of a transportation specialist, to challenge the accuracy of the driving logs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The transportation specialist presented a computer generated report purporting to prove that the log entries, specifically the distance travelled in the time reported, was \"not physically possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, Thompson claimed ineffective assistance of counsel, arguing that counsel should have objected to the transportation specialist evidence under rules 404, 405, and 608.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. This court rejected the claim, holding, among other things, that rule 608 did not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31. This court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [r]ule 608 of the Utah Rules of Evidence expressly incorporates [the limitation on character evidence], stating that extrinsic evidence of specific conduct is not admissible to attack or support a witness's\n   <em>\n    character for truthfulness\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah R. Evid. 608(b). But this limitation does not apply to evidence used to directly rebut a witness's testimony or other evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    2014 UT App 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    318 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b621 We reach a similar conclusion here. Because the evidence of the AutoZone shooting directly rebuts Witness's testimony and does not go to Witness's general character for truthfulness, it is not the type of evidence contemplated under rule 608.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10453878\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/578/512/#p514\">\n    578 P.2d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514 (Utah 1978) (explaining that witness testimony is subject to \"cross-examination on any matter which would tend to contradict, explain or cast doubt upon the credibility of [that] testimony,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   and that \"testimony or evidence which is purposed to those same objectives may be introduced in rebuttal\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 1991) (same). We therefore reject Corona's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B. Evidence of the AutoZone Shooting Was Proper Rebuttal Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b622 Corona argues that \"when impeaching a witness with 404(b) evidence, it is axiomatic that the prior bad acts alleged are against the testifying witness, not another person.\" We do not share this view. As explained above, such an axiom may be true when uncharged conduct is used to support or attack that witness's\n   <em>\n    character for truthfulness\n   </em>\n   , but not when the prior bad act is used to contradict the witness's\n   <em>\n    testimony\n   </em>\n   . Corona points to no authority adopting the argument he asserts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Instead, \"once the defendant offers evidence or makes an assertion as to any fact, the State may cross-examine or introduce on rebuttal any testimony or evidence which would tend to contradict, explain or cast doubt upon the credibility of his testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    2014 UT App 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7272946\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/318/1221/\">\n    318 P.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Corona presented evidence, through Witness, that Witness obtained the gun from a friend and used it to shoot Victim. The evidence of the AutoZone shooting contradicts and casts doubt upon the credibility of that testimony. We therefore conclude that the evidence of the AutoZone shooting was proper rebuttal evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 Corona also argues that the evidence was improperly admitted because the State, not Corona, opened the door for admission of the evidence on the cross-examination of Witness. Corona relies on\n   <em>\n    State v. Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481764\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/992/951/\">\n    1999 UT 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11481764\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/992/951/\">\n    992 P.2d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to support his argument. In\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   , the Utah Supreme Court held that defense counsel did not open the door to certain evidence where the State had \"already introduced a great deal\" of related evidence and that defense counsel was \"entitled, indeed required as a practical matter, to rebut or explain that evidence by [the defendant's] testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The facts here are inapposite. The first time any evidence was introduced that Witness had the gun and shot Victim was during Witness's testimony. The testimony was not used to explain evidence that was previously introduced; rather, it was entirely new. And the State was entitled to respond to the evidence adduced by the defense. Thus, we reject Corona's argument that the State, not Corona, opened the door for rebuttal evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C. Evidence of the Prior Shooting Was Introduced for a Proper Noncharacter Purpose\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b625 Corona further argues against the admittance of the evidence of the prior shooting, claiming that \"[t]he only purpose the evidence served was an improper and irrelevant one-to suggest that Corona was a dangerous person and was likely the shooter because he had been involved in another shooting.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 Rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence allows evidence of prior bad acts to be admitted so long as it is offered for a noncharacter purpose \"such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\" Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(2). Our supreme court has articulated a three-part test for the admittance of rule 404(b) evidence: \"the prior bad-act evidence (1) must be offered for a genuine, noncharacter purpose, (2) must be relevant to that noncharacter purpose, and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Reece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    2015 UT 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n    349 P.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up). Our supreme court added that \"matters of conditional relevance must also meet the preponderance of the evidence standard under rule 104(b).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6869076\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/712/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b627 The trial court's analysis of the evidence sufficiently met these standards. First,\n   the trial court concluded that evidence was admitted for a noncharacter purpose-identity. Second, the court concluded that the evidence was relevant to the identity of the shooter in this case. Third, the trial court concluded that the evidence should not be excluded under rule 403, which provides that a court \"may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Utah R. Evid. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628 Indeed, the evidence goes to the identity of the shooter by showing who had possession of the murder weapon. The evidence contradicted Witness's testimony that she, not Corona, possessed the gun in the weeks prior to the altercation with Victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, while conducting its rule 403 analysis, the trial court concluded that, in addition to the inconsistent testimony of Girlfriend that led to the investigation which matched the bullet casings from both shootings, the car molding evidence \"added to the strength of the evidence.\" The trial court was also careful to limit the evidence of the prior shooting to facts relevant to the shooter's identity, expressly excluding \"the injuries of the alleged victim.\" Under these facts, we cannot agree with Corona's challenge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945934\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/761/\">\n    2014 UT App 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21, 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945934\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/761/\">\n    322 P.3d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming the trial court's decision to allow evidence of a prior shooting to show identity where the same gun was used in both shootings).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   D. Disclosure of Rule 404(b) Evidence Was Not an Abuse of Discretion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b629 Next, Corona asserts that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a continuance mid-trial after the State sought to introduce the car molding evidence. The trial court found that the notice of the molding evidence was sufficient under rule 404(b) and the timing of the disclosure was justified by the State's late discovery and receipt of the report. The trial court ruled the notice reasonable because \"it [was] not so prejudicial to the defendant that they couldn't have done what they needed to do before the trial\" and \"the State provided that information ... as soon as the investigator was able to obtain [it].\" Given the long-in-advance notice the State had provided as to the specific bad act at issue and the general nature of the evidence anticipated in the particular circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b630 Rule 404(b) requires \"reasonable notice of the general nature\" of the bad-acts evidence the State intends to introduce, and the rule expressly provides that such notice may even be appropriate \"during trial if the court excuses lack of pretrial notice on good cause shown.\" Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b631 We see no abuse of discretion for three reasons. First, the State provided notice of the general nature of the evidence, including Girlfriend's testimony and the ballistics testing, well in advance of the trial. This made Corona generally aware of the evidence and allowed him to prepare to challenge it. We further see no flaw as to the requirement to disclose the nature of the evidence the State intended to offer. Certainly, the notice provided in April 2013, which included a police report, gave notice of the specific bad act at\n   issue and identified most of the evidence connected with the circumstances. Accordingly, Corona was on notice that the issue was likely to come up at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b632 Second, while the State did not identify the evidence matching the car molding until six days before trial, the State moved quickly to acquire the evidence once it became apparent how Witness would testify. After acquiring the evidence, the State produced it to Corona within one day. Moreover, the trial court's earlier ruling that excluded the bad-acts evidence was always conditioned on whether \"the door is opened at trial for either impeachment or rebuttal purposes.\" The trial court later determined that the door had indeed been opened. The trial court's ruling to allow short notice of the molding evidence days before trial is warranted under the particular circumstances of this case because (1) the State gave notice within one day of receiving the report of the molding match and (2) Corona had previously been put on notice that the door could be opened for such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b633 In this regard, it is of little import that the trial court first excluded the evidence and then reversed its pretrial determination. The trial court had already noted that its pretrial ruling was subject to what occurred at trial. When the court made its ruling, it was viewing the question of admissibility in light of what had actually taken place at trial, as opposed to any pretrial determination. In other words, the trial court viewed the evidentiary question in light of Witness testifying that she had possessed the murder weapon during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b634 Third, the court found that the disclosure several days before trial was not so late that Corona could not address it. While Corona has challenged this finding, he has not demonstrated any concrete reason why he did not have time to prepare or adequately respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b635 Under these circumstances, the trial court's determination was not so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of discretion. Therefore, Corona's challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II. Cell Phone Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b636 Corona contends that his counsel \"was ineffective in not pursuing suppression of unconstitutionally seized cellphone evidence.\" We reject this claim because law enforcement sought and obtained a warrant before searching the phone's contents, and Corona does not challenge the validity of the warrant on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b637 To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a party must show that \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\" and that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

The warrant application unambiguously sought authority to search the contents of the cell phone. And while we acknowledge that there may be issues with the language employed in the warrant itself, Corona, in his principal brief, presents no argument that the warrant was constitutionally infirm.

Application of Utah's Aggravated Murder Statute\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b639 Corona next challenges the constitutionality of Utah's aggravated murder statute, arguing that one of the aggravating circumstances, felony discharge of a firearm, is disproportionate and violates the state and federal constitutions. However, because Corona's enhanced conviction is independently supported under another aggravating circumstance, i.e., aggravated robbery, his challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b640 Utah's aggravated murder statute enhances criminal homicide to aggravated murder if, among other things, \"the homicide was committed incident to ... aggravated robbery,\" or if the actor was previously convicted of \"felony discharge of a firearm.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2076-5-202\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 76-5-202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(d), -202(1)(j)(xvii) (LexisNexis 2017). Corona was convicted of aggravated murder based on a previous felony conviction for discharge of a firearm. The jury also found Corona guilty of aggravated robbery. Both factors independently support Corona's aggravated murder conviction, and Corona does not challenge the constitutionality of the statute under the enhancement for aggravated robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b641 Because Corona's aggravated murder conviction is supported by his conviction for aggravated robbery, any decision we make regarding the constitutionality of the felony discharge of a firearm enhancement would not affect Corona's constitutional rights.

However, Corona makes no argument and provides no reasoned analysis concerning the applicability of subsection (1). Instead, Corona attempts to characterize his felony discharge of a firearm convictions under subsection (3) of the merger statute (and cases analyzing that subsection) as lesser-included offenses to his aggravated murder conviction. Following that line of analysis, Corona does not address the question of whether one or all of the shots fired-as well as the resulting murder-constitute a single offense, but instead only \"compare[s] the statutory elements of each offense\" and attempts to determine whether a greater-lesser relationship exists.
