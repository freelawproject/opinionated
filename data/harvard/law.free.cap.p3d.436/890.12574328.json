Ms. Yearsley then met with Appellant to inform him that she was pregnant in July of 2015. After that, the two communicated sporadically through early August 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 14, 2015, Ms. Yearsley was at a bar where she worked ... when Appellant showed up. He stopped by to repay some money he owed her, and wanted to talk, but eventually he started to cause a scene. Because of his belligerent behavior, Ms. Yearsley suggested that they take the conversation back to her place. While they were at Ms. Yearsley's apartment, she used a smartphone, an iPhone 6, that Appellant had given her daughter. This apparently annoyed Appellant, so he snatched it from her and left. After Appellant departed with her cell phone, Ms. Yearsley called the police to report it, but she declined to pursue charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day, August 15, Ms. Yearsley activated her old iPhone 5. Later that day, while she was in the shower getting ready for work, the shower curtain swung open, and there was Appellant. He grabbed her by the throat, and took her out of the shower and into the bedroom. As she started to scream, he placed his other hand over her nose and mouth. Once in the bedroom, Appellant put Ms. Yearsley on the bed and told her she needed to listen to him and that she had no choice but to do so. She continued to squirm and scream, and Appellant body-slammed her onto the ground with one hand still on her throat and the other over her nose and mouth. Ms. Yearsley struggled to breathe and almost blacked out, which caused her to become still. Appellant then removed his hands and let her sit up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Once free from Appellant's grasp, Ms. Yearsley ran to the bathroom and turned off the shower. She picked up a piece of the shower rod that had fallen on the floor and tried to defend herself with it. It was no use, however, as Appellant followed her to the bathroom and was able to pick her up in a \"bear hug.\" However, she managed to grab her reactivated iPhone 5 from the bathroom counter before Appellant carried her out to the living room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Once in the living room, Appellant sat down on the couch with Ms. Yearsley on his lap, still clenched in a bear hug. Appellant told her how much he loved her and that she just needed to listen to him. Unbeknownst to him, Ms. Yearsley had succeeded in dialing 911 and hitting send. When a dispatcher answered the 911 call, Appellant discovered what she had done. He grabbed the phone, punched Ms. Yearsley in the thigh, exited through the front door, and took off in his car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Dockter v.

Before that, Mr. Dockter filed two\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motions for a new trial under W.R.Cr.P. 33(c) in the district court: one on\n   March 15, 2017 (\"the First Motion\"); and the other on May 3, 2017 (\"the Second Motion\"). In his First Motion, he argued that various documents established that he was living at Ms. Yearsley's address and that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not discovering and raising this at trial. He argued this evidence was \"newly discovered\" and that it refuted the charge that he unlawfully entered Ms. Yearsley's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [\u00b66] In his Second Motion, in addition to generally reasserting some of his arguments from his First Motion, Mr. Dockter argued that the State failed to disclose before trial that it was prosecuting one of its witnesses, Kyle Christensen, in a separate criminal case, and that Mr. Christensen and Ms. Yearsley committed perjury at his trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b67] The district court appointed the Public Defender's Office to represent Mr. Dockter. On June 16, 2017, the court held a hearing on both of Mr. Dockter's motions. At the beginning of the hearing, the Public Defender's Office objected to its appointment because Mr. Dockter's direct appeal had ended, and Mr. Dockter did not have the right to counsel to pursue his motions. The district court agreed and concluded that Mr. Dockter was not entitled to a public defender. The court then heard from Mr. Dockter,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , regarding his two motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b68] On August 1, 2017, the district court denied Mr. Dockter's motions.

First, it is from the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Story\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384929\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/788/617/#p627\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Urbigkit &amp; Macy, JJ., dissenting).

And, finally, the quote addresses when a court must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine a motion for a new trial, not the right to counsel in such circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10005018\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/763/489/#p492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Dockter was not entitled to appointed counsel to pursue his motions for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Mr. Dockter's proposed evidence that he lived with the victim was not \"newly discovered\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b613] Mr. Dockter attached various documents to his motions which he asserted established that he lived with Ms. Yearsley at the time of his crimes. These documents primarily consisted of his unemployment paperwork filed in July 2015 with the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services that listed Ms. Yearsley's address as his home address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also attached an affidavit from an attorney who represented him in Colorado in August 2015 that stated Mr. Dockter's bond paperwork in Colorado showed he lived with Ms. Yearsley and that she appeared in court with Mr. Dockter in Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b614] Presumably, Mr. Dockter relied on this \"newly discovered evidence\" to refute the charge that he unlawfully entered Ms. Yearsley's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-3-307\">\n    Wyo.

However, in his brief, Mr. Dockter admits that this evidence is not \"newly discovered.\" Indeed, all of this evidence was available to him, or his attorney, at the time of his trial in April 2016. Because this evidence is not newly discovered, it was not a basis for a new trial under Rule 33(c), and the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied his motions on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. A defendant cannot raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a motion for a new trial based on \"newly discovered evidence\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Dockter presents a myriad of arguments regarding his trial counsel's alleged constitutional ineffectiveness by not \"conduct[ing] an adequate review into the facts of the case [police reports] and impeach[ing] the witnesses with those facts when glaring and crucial discrepancies existed in testimony,\" and his appellate counsel, presumably, for not raising trial counsel's ineffectiveness on appeal. However, the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel does not qualify as \"newly discovered evidence\" under Rule 33(c). In addition, Rule 33(c) is not the proper avenue to litigate appellate counsel's alleged ineffectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

It is questionable whether this information was \"suppressed\" when the \"evidence\" Mr. Dockter relies on is a scheduling order, entered in Mr. Dockter's case, that showed the State had pending charges against Mr. Christensen. We find it unnecessary to decide this question because, even if Mr. Dockter's attorney had known of Mr. Christensen's pending criminal charges, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability the result would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p676\">\n    473 U.S. at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205331\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/667/#p676\">\n    105 S.Ct. at 3380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b619] The district court concluded that \"[t]he alleged inconsistency in Mr. Christensen's testimony was something that was explored or at least argued and could have been explored further had counsel found it valuable.

Even if Mr. Dockter had been able to discredit Mr. Christensen's account of whether Mr. Dockter's car was out front, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability the result would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

He contended that Mr. Christensen and Ms. Yearsley lied about the location of Mr. Dockter's car. Ms. Yearsley told police that Mr. Dockter's car was parked in front, but testified at trial that it was parked in the back. He also argues that Ms. Yearsley lied about being pregnant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b621] A prosecutor cannot \"knowingly use[ ] perjured testimony to obtain a conviction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Lacey v.

As to the location of his car, the only \"newly discovered evidence\" that Mr. Dockter presented in support of his motion was the inconsistency between what the witnesses told police and what they testified to at trial. This is not \"newly discovered\" because the police reports Mr. Dockter relies on were available to him at trial. Moreover, merely pointing out inconsistencies in a witness's testimony is not sufficient to prove that the State knowingly allowed them to commit perjury. Rather, cross-examination is generally the proper method to bring those inconsistencies to the jury's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   [\u00b622] As to Ms. Yearsley's pregnancy, she testified at trial that she was pregnant when Mr. Dockter assaulted her in August 2015 and that she had told him on July 25, 2015, that she was pregnant. Mr. Dockter cites to Ms. Yearsley's testimony that the last contact she had with him was in late-May 2015, but that she still claimed to be pregnant at the trial in April 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dockter's attorney brought up Ms. Yearsley's remarkably long pregnancy in closing argument and pointed out that, if it was Mr. Dockter's child, she was \"six to eight weeks over due.\" Mr. Dockter's attorney also attempted before trial to prevent the State from mentioning that Ms. Yearsley was pregnant. Because Mr. Dockter's attorney addressed the issue of Ms. Yearsley's pregnancy before and at trial, it was not \"newly discovered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    F. A claim of cumulative error is not cognizable in a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b623] Mr. Dockter argues that the cumulative effect of his alleged errors warrants a new trial. However, the only avenue for Mr. Dockter to receive a new trial was by demonstrating that he had acquired \"newly discovered evidence.\" W.R.Cr.P. 33(c). Under our cumulative error doctrine, we review whether the cumulative effect of two or more errors \"deprived [a defendant] of a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Buszkiewic v.
