Groove terminated Vander Veur's employment in June 2013. Vander Veur argues that the district court incorrectly granted summary judgment to Groove on his claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing regarding certain commissions and a bonus to which he claims entitlement. He also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in Groove's favor on its unjust enrichment claim, which was based on Vander Veur's retention of certain commission draws following his termination. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 Around September 2010, Groove, a company that sells television services to customers, such as hotels, hired Vander Veur as a sales representative. Vander Veur's duties included, among other things, producing leads and generating new business by signing new customers for television services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In October 2012, Vander Veur and Groove entered into a Sales Representative Compensation Agreement (the Compensation Agreement). Among its relevant provisions, the Compensation Agreement provided that it would be effective as of October 15, 2012, and that it would \"remain in effect as long as [Vander Veur] is employed by Groove.\" The agreement further provided that \"Groove [would] pay [Vander Veur] a commission for each Qualifying Sale deemed commissionable as defined in this Agreement.\" The Compensation Agreement defined \"Qualifying Sale\" as \"a commissionable sale where the minimum margin requirements are met and the installation is complete.\" It also explained that Vander Veur was entitled to biweekly draws against his earned commissions and that these draws would be deducted from his earned commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Vander Veur also signed an Employee Handbook Acknowledgement on three separate occasions-in December 2010, December 2011, and April 2013. Each acknowledgement explained that, notwithstanding the policies and procedures detailed in the handbook, Vander Veur's employment was at will; both Groove and Vander Veur had the right to terminate their employment relationship at any time, with or without notice or cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Groove terminated Vander Veur's employment in June 2013. At the time of termination, Vander Veur was in the process of procuring six commissionable sales. While Vander Veur had apparently obtained either written sales contracts or verbal commitments for each sale, it is undisputed that at the time of his termination none of those sales had been installed. The first of the six installations took place in July 2013, approximately one month after Vander Veur's termination, and all six sales were installed within three months of his termination. Groove did not pay Vander Veur any commission for the six sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 In addition, before his termination, Vander Veur was working with Groove's lead sales representative and another Groove employee to complete a large sale to provide satellite services to a hotel. In connection with this sale, Groove stood to be paid a sizeable bonus from Showtime (the Showtime bonus). Groove's president, Vander Veur, and the lead sales representative apparently agreed that, after paying $1,000 to the other Groove employee who had assisted with the sale, they would split the Showtime bonus evenly between them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Groove did not receive the bonus from Showtime until nearly one month after Vander Veur's termination, and Groove did not share any portion of it with Vander Veur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After his termination, Vander Veur filed suit against Groove. Among other things, he alleged that Groove had breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the compensation and bonus agreements by terminating him for the express purpose of avoiding paying him the six commissions and the Showtime bonus.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Groove counterclaimed, asserting breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims against Vander Veur on the basis that Vander Veur had retained certain draw monies that exceeded the commissions he had earned prior to his termination. Groove's breach of contract claim was based upon a 2013 Sales Representative Agreement (the 2013 Agreement) that Vander Veur had not signed, and it pleaded its unjust enrichment claim in the alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Groove moved for summary judgment on Vander Veur's claims as well as its unjust enrichment counterclaim. As to the six commissions, Groove argued that Vander Veur could not rely on the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to claim entitlement to the commissions in light of \"the parties' course of dealing and [Vander Veur's] at-will employment status.\" Groove pointed to the plain language of the Compensation Agreement, asserting that the agreement unambiguously stated that commissions were not earned until installation. Groove also characterized Vander Veur's breach of the implied covenant claim as an improper attempt to have the court \"retroactively re-craft more favorable payment terms\" than those to which Vander Veur agreed, asserting that it undoubtedly never would have agreed to pay Vander Veur commissions for post-termination installations had it considered and addressed the issue in the Compensation Agreement. Indeed, Groove claimed that it had \"\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   paid commissions to sales representatives for installations that were completed after the termination of employment.\" Groove further argued that Vander Veur could not \"use the covenant to pencil in a 'good cause' termination restriction\" in light of the \"numerous acknowledgements he signed in which he expressly recognized that his employment was at-will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Regarding the Showtime bonus, Groove similarly argued that Vander Veur's claim for breach of the implied covenant was unavailing where Groove \"never would have agreed to pay Vander Veur\" that bonus \"after the termination of his employment.\" In its summary judgment reply memorandum, Groove\n   also contended that the claim should be dismissed for the alternative and independent reason that there was \"no enforceable contract\" as to the Showtime bonus, because there was no meeting of the minds on whether Vander Veur would have been entitled to the bonus post-termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 Finally, Groove argued that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on its unjust enrichment claim. Groove accepted for purposes of summary judgment that, as Vander Veur claimed in his answer, the 2013 Agreement was \"inapplicable to him,\" and Groove argued that it met the three requirements to establish unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rawlings v. Rawlings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991381\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/754/\">\n    2010 UT 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6991381\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/240/754/\">\n    240 P.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing the \"three elements\" required to prove \"[a] claim for unjust enrichment in Utah\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 In response, Vander Veur argued that summary judgment was inappropriate on his breach of the implied covenant claims because \"[a] rational jury could determine based on the facts\" that Groove's claimed reason for terminating him was mere pretext and that his termination, \"executed on the eve of him becoming eligible for significant commission and bonus payments,\" was instead done \"to deprive him of the commissions and bonuses he was to receive once the jobs he had sold were installed.\" Regarding Groove's counterclaims, Vander Veur argued that Groove was not entitled to judgment on its unjust enrichment claim for two reasons. First, he argued that because an unjust enrichment claim is cognizable only if no contract controls, Groove could not prevail simply by \"ignor[ing],\" for purposes of summary judgment, the 2013 Agreement on which its breach of contract counterclaim was based. Rather, Vander Veur contended that Groove should have to \"withdraw its breach of contract claim,\" or, at the very least, be required to explain \"why it has no legal remedy under its breach of contract cause of action prior to proceeding with its unjust enrichment claim.\" Second, he argued that Groove had failed to prove its unjust enrichment claim primarily because the existence of his own claims made the calculation of the benefit conferred to him and his liability for it \"impossible,\" where he could be entitled to offset as well as pre- and postjudgment interest, should he prevail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 The district court granted summary judgment to Groove on all issues, dismissing Vander Veur's claims with prejudice. It also entered judgment in Groove's favor for unjust enrichment in the amount of $2,925.04, plus prejudgment interest. Vander Veur appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Vander Veur argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of Groove on his claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as well as Groove's unjust enrichment claim. Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 56(a). \"An appellate court reviews a district court's legal conclusions and ultimate grant or denial of summary judgment for correctness and views the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    ZB, N.A. v.

Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Vander Veur argues that the district court incorrectly granted Groove summary judgment on his claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Although he acknowledges the at-will nature of his employment with Groove, he nevertheless asserts that terminating his employment for the express intention of depriving him of the fruits of certain compensation agreements goes to the core of the covenant that the Utah Supreme Court identified in\n   <em>\n    Young Living Essential Oils, LC v. Marin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985808\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/814/\">\n    2011 UT 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985808\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/814/\">\n    266 P.3d 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and is on that basis impermissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (explaining that the covenant's \"core function\" is requiring that a party to a contract \"refrain from actions that will intentionally destroy or injure\n   the other party's right to receive the fruits of the contract\" (quotation simplified) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Groove disagrees, arguing that Vander Veur seeks to circumvent the terms of the agreements at issue and the at-will nature of his employment by using the covenant to create a new term or obligation to which it clearly did not, and never would have, agreed-that is, paying Vander Veur commissions and bonuses for sales he generated but that were completed post-termination. Because Vander Veur has not established that Groove would have \"\n   <em>\n    undoubtedly\n   </em>\n   ... agreed to the post-termination payment arrangement\" that he seeks, Groove asserts that Vander Veur \"has not satisfied his substantial threshold burden\" to survive summary judgment below or prevail on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 The parties therefore disagree about the applicability of the covenant in the circumstances present here, particularly given the at-will nature of Vander Veur's employment. To determine whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Vander Veur's claims for breach of the implied covenant, we therefore must decide the extent to which the covenant may be applied in this case, where an at-will employee is seeking compensation for commissions to which he claims he would have been entitled pursuant to a compensation agreement had his employment not been terminated for the purpose of depriving him of those commissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 Despite Vander Veur's contention to the contrary, this appears to be a matter of first impression for our courts. As we explain below,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-30, Utah's appellate courts have recognized the applicability of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to at-will employment relationships, but have not yet determined whether the implied covenant is available to provide relief in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 We therefore begin by discussing the function of the covenant, and we ultimately conclude that the covenant may be employed in limited circumstances to protect an at-will employee's right to receive compensation for work performed pursuant to a compensation agreement attendant to the at-will employment relationship. We then apply this principle to determine whether dismissal of Vander Veur's implied covenant claims regarding entitlement to the six sales commissions and the Showtime bonus was proper. We ultimately conclude that it was improper to dismiss Vander Veur's claims as to the six commissions and the Showtime bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A. At-Will Employment and the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Vander Veur asserts that his termination violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, because it was carried out for the specific purpose of depriving him of his right to the compensation he was to receive under the Compensation Agreement and the Showtime bonus oral contract. This case therefore involves the intersection of an at-will employment relationship, where the employee may be terminated with or without cause, and the applicability of the implied covenant to obligations inherent in separate agreements attendant to an at-will employment relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 It is well-settled that the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inheres in every contract,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

The Six Commissions and the Compensation Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b631 Vander Veur argues that the district court incorrectly granted summary judgment against him on his claim that Groove breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by terminating his employment to avoid paying him commissions on the six sales he had procured, but which had not yet been installed, before his termination. The district court dismissed this claim. The court reasoned that Vander Veur had to \"establish that the parties undoubtedly would have agreed\" to pay Vander Veur for the six commissions post-termination had they \"considered and addressed it at the outset,\" and it determined that \"[t]his requirement is fatal to Vander Veur's claim.\" The court then concluded that the undisputed facts demonstrated that Groove would not have agreed to such a covenant and that \"[t]o hold that Groove might have an obligation to pay commission payments to Vander Veur would impose a new affirmative obligation on Groove that is outside the [Compensation] Agreement and unsupported by the course of conduct between the parties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b632 We concluded above that an at-will employee may assert a claim under the implied covenant to recover compensation he or she would have received under the terms of his or her compensation agreement but for the employer's bad faith termination of the\n   at-will relationship for the purpose of depriving the employee of that compensation.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook v.

App. 1996). In this regard, the implied covenant protects the at-will employee from an employer using an at-will termination to specifically avoid its obligations under an attendant compensation agreement. Vander Veur claims that Groove sought to deprive him of the commissions he would have received through his work securing the sales agreements, and to which he claims entitlement under the Compensation Agreement, by terminating his employment for the specific purpose of avoiding paying him the commissions before the triggering event for payment of the commissions-installation-occurred. As we explained, this is the type of claim that implicates the core of the implied covenant and of which the covenant is singularly designed to protect. On that basis, no agreement between the parties about the implied covenant's applicability in these circumstances was required, and the district court erred by determining that the success of Vander Veur's implied covenant claim turned on whether Groove would have agreed to pay Vander Veur the commissions post-termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b633 We therefore vacate the district court's dismissal of the implied covenant claim for the six commissions and remand for further proceedings. To be sure, we express no opinion on whether Vander Veur might be ultimately successful in proving his claim in the district court, should the case proceed to trial. But for purposes of this appeal, it is enough that the court erred in its application of the implied covenant to the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C. The Showtime Bonus\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b634 Vander Veur also argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his breach of the implied covenant claim as to the Showtime bonus. The district court provided two alternatives for its dismissal of this claim. First, the court determined that it was \"undisputed that Groove and Vander Veur would not have agreed to a covenant that provided for payment of the Showtime bonus after Vander Veur was terminated from Groove,\" and that to conclude that Groove \"might have an obligation to pay a post-termination Showtime bonus payment to Vander Veur would impose a new affirmative obligation on Groove\" that was unsupported by the parties' course of conduct. In the alternative, the court concluded that \"there was no enforceable contract as to the Showtime bonus,\" because \"there was never a meeting of the minds regarding [the] material contract term\" of whether Vander Veur would have forfeited the Showtime bonus \"if his employment were terminated prior to Groove's receipt of the Showtime funds.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b635 Given our conclusion above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-30, we cannot sustain the district court's dismissal based on its analysis of the implied covenant; Vander Veur's claim does not create a \"new affirmative obligation\" for Groove but instead only seeks to assert entitlement to the bonus money based upon purported rights and obligations created by the bonus agreement itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b636 Likewise, we are unable to sustain the district court's dismissal on the basis that there was no enforceable contract between Vander Veur and Groove regarding the Showtime bonus. Groove did not move to dismiss the Showtime bonus claim for lack of an enforceable contract. Rather, the only ground Groove asserted for dismissal of this claim was Vander Veur's failure to demonstrate entitlement to relief under the implied covenant-a proposition necessarily dependent on the Showtime bonus agreement being an enforceable contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson v.

Indeed, Groove's contention that the court could reject the bonus claim on the alternative basis that there was not an enforceable contract appeared only as an aside in its summary judgment reply memorandum, underdeveloped and without any meaningful analysis of the relevant facts, pertinent contract principles, and whether the term at issue-agreement regarding post-termination payment-was, in fact, a material term whose absence would be sufficient to render the entire agreement unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The district court's adoption of the contractual basis as an alternate ground for dismissal closely tracked Groove's limited argument on the point and, accordingly, suffered from similar underdevelopment.

He asserts that the district court's resolution of the counterclaim was improper for two reasons: (1) Groove had a legal remedy available, as it asserted that a contract governed the resolution of the claim; and (2) even if no contractual remedy was available, Groove failed to prove its entitlement to its unjust enrichment claim. \"Claims based on equitable doctrines are mixed questions of fact and law.

Vander Veur contends that, because Groove asserted a breach of contract cause of action to recover the commission draws and has otherwise \"failed to assert why its breach of contract cause of action did not bear on the trial court's consideration\" of summary judgment or withdraw the breach of contract claim altogether, it is barred from recovery under unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b640 But Groove's assertion that there was a legal remedy governing the repayment of the draws was disputed between the parties. In its counterclaim, Groove contended that it was entitled to recover these draws under the 2013 Agreement to which Vander Veur never formally agreed in writing. That agreement contained an express provision related to repayment of draws against commissions. In his answer, Vander Veur disputed that he was subject to the 2013 Agreement. Thus, in its summary judgment motion, Groove accepted for purposes of the motion Vander Veur's contention that the 2013 Agreement\n   did not apply to him, and it argued entitlement to judgment as a matter of law solely under the theory of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b641 We have previously observed that concessions made for these limited purposes are acceptable in circumstances involving claims pleaded in the alternative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Govert Copier Painting v.
