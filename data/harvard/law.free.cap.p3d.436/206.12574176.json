(Father) appeals the juvenile court's order terminating his parental rights to his children, B.T.B. and B.Z.B. He contends that termination was not \"strictly necessary\" in this case, for various reasons. Father's arguments compel us to directly analyze the meaning of the phrase \"strictly necessary,\" as used in Utah Code section 78A-6-507(1), and require us to examine how that relatively new statutory admonition fits with the historical two-part test we have long applied in termination of parental rights cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In order to comprehensively answer these questions, we find it necessary to re-examine and disavow some of our case law in this area. Ultimately, we conclude that courts should analyze the \"strictly necessary\" language as part of the \"best interest\" element of our historical test, but we emphasize that-partly because of the addition of the \"strictly necessary\" aspect of the analysis-the \"best interest\" inquiry should be applied in a more thorough and independent manner than some of our cases might suggest. Because we clarify and partially reformulate the test for termination of parental rights, we remand this case to the juvenile court for reconsideration in light of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 3 Father and J.P.B. (Mother) married in 2010 and divorced in 2013. B.T.B. and B.Z.B. (the Children) are their children. After the divorce, the Children remained in Mother's custody; they have never been in the custody of the State. Beginning in 2012, Father has periodically been incarcerated for a variety of offenses, largely resulting from drug use. Since the divorce, Father has had only occasional contact with the Children, visiting them a total of fourteen times and sending them infrequent letters and Facebook messages. Father has never paid child support, despite being ordered to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 In March 2017, Mother filed a petition with the juvenile court to terminate Father's parental rights. As discussed in greater detail below, Utah courts have historically applied a two-part test when considering whether to terminate parental rights: (1) whether statutory grounds for termination are present, and (2) whether termination of the parent's rights is in the best interest of the affected child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re T.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985723\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/739/\">\n    2011 UT 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985723\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/266/739/\">\n    266 P.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the termination of parental rights hearing, Mother argued that statutory grounds for termination existed because Father had abandoned and neglected the Children, and had made only \"token efforts\" to communicate with them. Mother argued that it would be in the Children's best interests for Father's parental rights to be terminated because it \"ripped [the Children's] hearts out every time\" Father went to prison and dropped out of contact, causing significant instability in their lives. Mother also referenced some of our cases that indicate that, when statutory grounds for termination are present, it follows \"almost automatically\" that it will be in the child's best interest to terminate the parent's rights. Although Father did not contest\n   the existence of statutory grounds for termination, he argued that it was not in the Children's best interests to terminate his rights because he \"loves [the Children], loves to be with [the Children], cares about them, [and] wants to protect them,\" and because the Children could benefit from having a \"strong relationship\" with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 Father also advanced a separate argument, pointing out that the Utah Legislature modified the relevant statutory language to state that courts may terminate parental rights only if they find termination to be \"strictly necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-507(1) (LexisNexis 2012). Father argued that this statutory modification required the juvenile court to find that termination was \"strictly necessary\" before terminating his parental rights, and argued that this requirement could not be met unless the termination was required to \"free the children for adoption.\" Thus, Father asserted that, because Mother's petition did not anticipate an adoption or any other change in the Children's living situation, it was not \"strictly necessary\" to terminate his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 6 After taking the matter under advisement, the juvenile court issued an order terminating Father's rights. The court found that several statutory grounds for termination were present. The court further determined that termination of Father's parental rights would be in the Children's best interests, because \"[t]he Children have not had the opportunity to establish any kind of appropriate parent-child relationship\" with Father and because reintroduction of Father into the Children's lives would likely require \"reintroduction therapy,\" which the court determined would \"not provide the Children the kind of permanency that they need and deserve.\" The court \"separately\" analyzed whether termination of Father's rights was \"strictly necessary,\" and rejected Father's argument that, without a pending adoption, termination could never be \"strictly necessary.\" The court found it \"strictly necessary\" to terminate Father's rights, because Father's \"inconsistent parent time ... will continue to damage the Children unless they are given a more permanent living situation,\" and determined that \"such permanency is only available to the Children by terminating\" Father's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7 Father appeals the juvenile court's order terminating his rights. The crux of the appeal is whether the juvenile court correctly applied the \"strictly necessary\" language to the historical test for termination of parental rights. We review a trial court's interpretation of a statute for correctness.\n   <em>\n    Holste v.

But there is no support in statute or in Utah Supreme Court case law\n   for a rule requiring such an inference \"almost automatically\" in every case and, in addition, our development of this principle has created a number of unfortunate problems in our law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 The first problem with essentially merging the \"best interest\" inquiry into the \"statutory grounds\" inquiry is that we have removed a useful-and perhaps constitutionally required\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -tool from our trial judges' toolkits. In the course of hearing all of the evidence in the case, the trial judge gets to know the family in question-she can hear the parent speak, listen to the caseworker's observations, sometimes even hear from the child (or at least a guardian ad litem), and learn more than an appellate court can about the details of the family dynamics at play. In family and domestic cases, our law grants trial judges wide latitude to make factual findings and to craft solutions for families and children that make the most sense in the particular situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harmon v.

It should have been sufficient for affirmance that the trial court made a reasoned, supported finding that the movant had not carried her burden of proof on the best interest element. Trial courts should not have to make any additional finding that a case is \"rare\" or \"unusual\" in order to determine that a parent's rights should not be terminated. By imposing this additional requirement, we have placed a burden on the parent whose rights are at issue to come forward at the termination hearing with some evidence demonstrating that the case is \"rare\" or \"unusual.\" (Certainly, the petitioner (e.g., DCFS) will not have an incentive to bring any such evidence to the trial court's attention.)

In contrast, the guardian ad litem contends that the \"strictly necessary\" language is completely prefatory-essentially meaningless introductory language-and that it does not affect the test at all.

On appeal, the petitioners argued that, once the juvenile court found statutory grounds for termination, it should have presumed \"that termination was in the child's best interests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. We rejected that argument because \"[t]here is no such presumption in Utah.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, we stated that if we were to adopt that position, \"it would make little sense to employ the two-step analysis required by Utah law\" in termination cases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. We further noted that \"[b]oth parts of the analysis are necessary, as required by the statutory arrangement adopted by the Utah Legislature, and both must be proven by those seeking termination of the parent-child relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither our decision in\n   <em>\n    R.A.J.\n   </em>\n   , nor any of our other cases to speak in similar terms,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   has ever been overruled or otherwise called into question, and thus there exist contrary lines of case law in our jurisprudence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 43 Finally, our precedent has not, in our view, engendered any meaningful \"reliance\" upon it such that disavowal would \"create injustice\" or upset litigants' expectations. One way this principle could come into play in this situation is if the disavowal of our line of cases could allow parents whose rights were terminated thereunder to come back into court and re-litigate the termination issues. For better or for worse, however, our law contains no provision-other than a full-scale re-adoption-permitting a parent whose rights have been terminated to regain those rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-513(1) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017) (stating that a termination order \"divests the child and the parents of all legal rights, powers, immunities, duties, and obligations with respect to each other, except the right of the child to inherit from the parent\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78A-6-514(4) (LexisNexis 2012) (stating that even a \"voluntary relinquishment or consent for termination of parental rights ... may not be revoked\"). Any rule we might announce regarding disavowal would apply only prospectively, and would not allow, for instance, the parents whose rights were terminated in\n   <em>\n    A.M.O.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    G.J.C.\n   </em>\n   to re-open those cases and thereby upset whatever permanency and stability those rulings fostered. There is therefore no reliance-based reason to shrink from\n   disavowal of our \"almost automatically\" line of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 44 For all of these reasons, the principle of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   is no bar to disavowal of our precedent in this area. Accordingly, we disavow our prior cases to the extent they suggest that, once statutory grounds for termination are established, it follows \"almost automatically\" that termination will be in the best interest of a child, or that it is only in \"rare\" or \"unusual\" cases that termination of parental rights will not follow from a finding of statutory grounds for termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b6 45 We must now address the specific questions raised by the facts of this case, and we do so unconstrained by our \"almost automatically\" line of cases. First, we examine the \"strictly necessary\" language in Utah Code section 78A-6-507(1), and determine its meaning. Second, and relatedly, we address the precise question Father raises, namely, whether termination of parental rights can ever be \"strictly necessary\" if no adoption or other alternative parenting arrangement is contemplated. Finally, we must consider whether the juvenile court correctly applied governing legal principles to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 46 As noted earlier, the parties advance three different interpretations of the \"strictly necessary\" language. We have already rejected the interpretation proposed by the guardian ad litem. We now examine the other two arguments, and in the end we are persuaded, in general, by the interpretation advanced by Mother and (at least at the hearing) endorsed by the juvenile court: that the \"strictly necessary\" language does not create a separate third element of the test for termination of parental rights but, instead, should be considered as an important part of the \"best interest\" inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 47 The \"best interest\" test is broad, and is intended as a holistic examination of all of the relevant circumstances that might affect a child's situation. More than a century ago, our supreme court noted that the concept included examination of \"the physical, intellectual, social, moral, and educational training and general welfare and happiness of the child,\" and that the best interest of the child, so defined, was the \"paramount consideration\" in cases involving termination of parental rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. Harker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8873369\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/44/541/\">\n    44 Utah 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8873369\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/44/541/\">\n    142 P. 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 719 (1914) (quotation simplified). As far as we are aware, the breadth of the \"best interest\" inquiry has never been diminished; indeed, we have recently defined the \"best interest\" inquiry as a \"subjective assessment based on the totality of the circumstances\" surrounding the child.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re G.J.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773794\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/58/\">\n    2016 UT App 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6773794\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/379/58/\">\n    379 P.3d 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 48 Surely a test this broad, and intended to capture all of the relevant facts and circumstances unique to a particular child's situation, is sufficiently comprehensive to encompass an inquiry into whether termination of a parent's rights is actually necessary.

Given the existence of our \"almost automatically\" line of cases, it is no wonder that some attorneys (including Father's attorney) have, in recent years, argued for the \"strictly necessary\" language to be construed as creating a new, third element of the termination test.

Because this analysis should occur within the context of the \"best interest\" examination, it should be undertaken from the child's point of view, not the parent's. A court should not ask whether termination is strictly necessary to further an objective of one of the parents; instead, courts should ask whether it is absolutely essential to the child's best interest that a parent's rights be permanently severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 55 The \"best interest\" inquiry requires courts to examine all of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the child's situation, not just the specific statutory grounds for termination. In particular, and as the juvenile court here recognized, this part of the inquiry also requires courts to explore whether other feasible options exist that could address the specific problems or issues facing the family, short of imposing the ultimate remedy of terminating the parent's rights. In some cases, alternatives will be few and unsatisfactory, and termination of the parent's rights will be the option that is in the child's best interest. But in other cases, especially those in which grandparents or other family members have (or are willing to) come forward to care for the child, courts should consider whether other less-permanent\n   arrangements (for instance, a guardianship with a family member) might serve the child's needs just as well in the short term, while preserving the possibility for rehabilitation of the parent-child relationship in the longer term. In many cases, children will benefit from having more people-rather than fewer-in their lives who love them and care about them, and if there is a practical way to keep parents involved in the children's lives that is not contrary to the children's best interests, a court should seriously consider such an option.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re A.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10409011\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/716/284/#p287\">\n    716 P.2d at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[t]he termination of parental rights is a drastic measure that should be resorted to only in extreme cases\").

Father does not contest the existence of statutory grounds for termination of his parental rights, but argues that the juvenile court erred by determining that termination of his rights was in the Children's best interests or strictly necessary. Father spends much of his energies asserting that it can never be \"strictly necessary\" to terminate a parent's rights if there is no contemplated change in the affected child's living situation, an argument we have already rejected, along with his argument that the \"strictly necessary\" language was intended to create a separate third element to the test for termination of parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 59 However, given our holding that the \"strictly necessary\" analysis is properly part of the \"best interest\" element, we construe Father's arguments regarding \"strictly necessary\" as a challenge to the juvenile court's conclusion that termination of his rights was in the Children's best interests. And although the juvenile court was on the right track for much of its \"best interest\" analysis, at one point even stating that it \"struggle[d] with\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   the \"almost automatically\" language, its examination of the issues was framed by a test we have herein clarified and reformulated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 60 For these reasons, we think it best to vacate the juvenile court's termination order, and remand the case for reconsideration in light of this opinion. We do not, however, make any effort to urge the juvenile court to reach one conclusion or another upon reconsideration. We instruct the juvenile court to reconsider the \"best interest\" portion of the termination test, and to do so in keeping with the principles set forth herein, and without constraint from the \"almost automatically\" line of cases. We leave it to the juvenile court to determine whether a new evidentiary hearing is necessary, or whether it can adequately reassess \"best interest\" based on the evidence previously presented, aided by additional briefing and/or oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b6 61 A parent's right to raise his or her child is a fundamental right guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. Our line of cases holding that termination of parental rights should follow in all cases \"almost automatically\" if one or more of the statutory grounds for termination of parental rights is present was ill-advised, unsupported by statute or case law, and in tension with the constitutional rights of parents. For the reasons set forth herein, we disavow that line of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 62 The test for termination of parental rights has two parts, and the second part-that termination of parental rights must be in the best interest of the affected child-must be considered on its own merits, separate from whether statutory grounds for termination are present. In considering the \"best interest\" element, trial courts should think carefully about whether termination of parental rights is \"strictly necessary,\" including whether other options short of termination exist that might adequately address the family's issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 63 Because we have disavowed a line of our cases and clarified the test for termination of parental rights, we vacate the juvenile court's termination order, and remand this case to the juvenile court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Judge Ryan M.

In many (but not necessarily all) cases in which DCFS seeks to terminate the rights of a\n    <em>\n     custodial\n    </em>\n    parent, that parent will likely have been offered (and not successfully taken advantage of) reunification services.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78A-6-312(2)(b) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017) (stating that \"[w]henever the court orders continued removal\" of the child from the home, \"the court shall first ... determine whether ... reunification services are appropriate\"). In private cases where a petitioner seeks to terminate the rights of a\n    <em>\n     non-custodial\n    </em>\n    parent, by contrast, no statute requires the court to even consider whether to implement reunification services, and often no infrastructure is in place through which to offer any such services in any event.
