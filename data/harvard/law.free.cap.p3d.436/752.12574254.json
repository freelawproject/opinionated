It is undisputed Psycho Path, LLC was not attempting to purchase toluene; indeed, it purchased, or sought to purchase, an empty drum. Thus, the evidence unequivocally shows B.L.M. and his employer were not ordinary consumers of the product sold by Brainerd. Furthermore, it is undisputed that, as set forth above, the tanks of toluene sold by Brainerd did include a warning addressing the dangers of a drum full of toluene. Although an additional warning setting forth the dangers of\n   <em>\n    residual\n   </em>\n   toluene may have made the product safer to non-ordinary consumers, Oklahoma products liability law does not impose such an obligation on manufacturers or suppliers. Any alleged defect in a warning hinges on the expectations of the ordinary consumer, and, here, the ordinary consumer of the toluene sold by Brainerd would be one \"familiar with the hazards associated with\" the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 Products liability \"represent[s] a departure from, and an exception to, the general rule that a supplier of chattels [is] not liable to third persons in the absence of negligence or privity of contract.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A cmt. b (1965).

Thus, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that B.L.M. or his employer can properly be viewed as ordinary consumers of Brainerd's product, Brainerd's product was substantially changed in condition prior to reaching them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 12 The fact remains, however, that neither B.L.M. nor his employer at the time of the accident can be viewed as ordinary consumers; indeed, it is undisputed they were not consumers at all of the toluene sold by Brainerd, but were, instead, consumers of a secondhand barrel.

The\n   <em>\n    Duane\n   </em>\n   Court explained \"there is no duty to warn where the product is used in an unlikely, unexpected or unforeseeable manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. In\n   <em>\n    Duane\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff \"sued, among others, Shell and Chevron, for strict liability and negligence, arguing that Shell and Chevron were liable to him for their failure to warn of the dangerous propensities of their insulating oil.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2 (footnote omitted). The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Duane\n   </em>\n   was employed by a company that designed \"oil-filled switches,\" and one of these switches had been placed inside a tank which, after being shipped to a customer, \"had exploded internally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. It was surmised that the switch itself had failed, and the tank was therefore shipped back to the plaintiff's employer.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   In order to discover the cause of the switch's failure, [the plaintiff's employer] instructed his employees to drain the switch of the oil remaining inside before cutting open the tank, as they had done many times in the past. This time, however, [the plaintiff's employer] additionally instructed [the plaintiff] to purge the switch with compressed air before grinding it open to inspect the inside. [The plaintiff] was injured when he began grinding and the tank exploded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 19 As indicated, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Duane\n   </em>\n   sued the suppliers of the insulating oil, alleging\n   that this oil caused the explosion which resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. However, regarding the duty to warn of dangerous characteristics, the Court explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The general rule as to a supplier's duty to warn of known dangers in the ordinary use of its product is set out in Restatement of Torts (Second), \u00a7 388 :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for another to use is subject to liability to those whom the supplier should expect to use the chattel with the consent of the other or to be endangered by its probable use, for physical harm caused by the use of the chattel in the manner for which and by a person for whose use it is supplied, if the supplier\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (a) knows or has reason to know that the chattel is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (b) has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (c) fails to exercise reasonable care to inform them of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely to be dangerous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   We find that neither (a) nor (b) above is present in the case at bar. The use for which the chattel in this case was supplied was for insulating oil to be used in oil-filled vacuum switches designed and manufactured by [plaintiff's employer]. The oil was not inherently dangerous for the use for which it was supplied: as insulating oil. Plaintiffs' own allegations are that the oil became dangerous when a variety of conditions occurred, such as severe electrical arcing, purging the switch with air, and grinding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Duane\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b6 20 It is undisputed that B.L.M. and his employer were not using Brainerd's product \"for the use for which it was supplied.\" Indeed, at the time of the accident, Brainerd's product was neither being used \"in the manner for which\" it was supplied, nor \"by a person for whose use it [was] supplied.\" Therefore, we conclude there was no duty to warn B.L.M. or his employer in the manner advanced by Plaintiff. Finding no duty, we conclude Brainerd cannot be held liable under the ordinary negligence theory advanced by Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 21 We conclude Brainerd cannot be held liable under either the products liability theory or ordinary negligence theory advanced by Plaintiff. Therefore, we affirm the trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of Brainerd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 22\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   RAPP, J., and GOODMAN, J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In the deposition of a corporate representative of Brainerd, the representative testified that \"[t]he majority of a paint thinner is toluene.\" He testified that is why it is sold to entities like \"Anchor Paint.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    n.4,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In Oklahoma, \"the seller of a product in a defective condition, which is unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer, is strictly liable for the physical harm to the person or property caused by the defect. This theory of recovery is based on the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 402A (1965).\"\n    <em>\n     Allenberg\n    </em>\n    , \u00b6 11 (footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In Plaintiff's supplemental response to Brainerd's motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff attached an affidavit of her attorney wherein he states that, based on the \"recent testimony of Defendants Marquez\" - i.e., the employers of B.L.M. and the owners of Psycho Path, LLC - \"[i]t is unknown when and from whom the barrel in question was purchased. The chain of custody of the barrel could have been with Defendant Thomas, Defendant West Texas Drum Company, or Defendant Brainerd. From the deposition of Mr. Marquez, it appears that more likely than not, the barrel was in the possession of one [of] these three (3) Defendants,\" and \"it is impossible to determine which Defendant had custody of the barrel\" immediately before it came into the possession of the Marquezes. However, it appears that any lack of evidence in this regard - in particular, lack of evidence as to whether Brainerd sold the empty drum directly to Psycho Path, LLC - is the result of the fact that this issue was never in dispute. That is, as set forth above, it was Plaintiff's position (at least until the filing of its supplemental response) that the drum was \"resold\" - i.e., that it was foreseeable to Brainerd that its drums full of toluene might be subsequently resold - but at no point did Plaintiff allege that Brainerd was in the business of selling empty tanks or that it sold the tank to Psycho Path, LLC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    More importantly, evidentiary materials have been presented in support of the conclusion that Brainerd was in the business of selling toluene, not emptied secondhand barrels, and that the owners of Psycho Path, LLC purchased a barrel on the secondhand market from Third-Party Defendant Robert Thomas, an individual not affiliated with Brainerd, who testified to selling one-hundred secondhand barrels to Psycho Path, LLC just prior to the accident.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , R. Tab 4, Brainerd's Exhibit 2 (stating, inter alia, \"Product identifier [-] Toluene,\" \"Distributed by: brainerd,\" \"intended for use as a refinery feedstock, fuel or for use in engineered processes\"); R. Tab 4, Brainerd's Exhibit 3; R. Tab 4, Brainerd's Exhibit 6 (\"Through discovery, the parties have learned that [Mr. Thomas] actually supplied the used barrel that is the subject matter of this litigation ....\"); R. Tab 6, Plaintiff's Exhibit 2 (deposition of Mr. Thomas wherein the following statements are found: \"Mr. Victor Marquez, this individual who purchased the barrels\"; \"your testimony is that you sold Psycho Path two different orders of 50 barrels each? A. Yes, sir.\"; the sale occurred \"[a]bout a week or two before Halloween.\"). Therefore, even if Mr. Marquez stated in his deposition that he does not know \"when and from whom the barrel in question was purchased,\" this does not support a reasonable, non-speculative, and countervailing inference that Brainerd sold the empty tank to Psycho Path, LLC.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Thus, we agree with Brainerd's assertions in its response in opposition to Plaintiff's supplemental response, wherein it states that no testimony of Mr. Marquez \"change[s] the facts as they had previously been identified.\" Brainerd asserts, \"Nothing in the testimony of Mr. Marquez indicates that the barrel came from anywhere but Mr. Thomas.\" Brainerd asserts this is \"a fact known since July 2016, when Mr. Thomas gave his deposition and admitted that he had sold a large number of barrels to Mr. Marquez\" prior to the accident. Brainerd further asserts Plaintiff has \"presented no evidence that the barrel in question came from anywhere other than Mr. Thomas.\"\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    Once a defendant has introduced evidentiary materials showing no substantial controversy as to one fact material to plaintiff's cause of action and this fact is in defendant's favor, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that evidence is available which would justify a trial of the issue. If such evidence is not presented, summary judgment should, if appropriate, be entered against the non-moving party.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    <em>\n     Swift\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6974238\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/1127/\">\n     2013 OK CIV APP 88\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 28,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6974238\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/310/1127/\">\n     310 P.3d 1127\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted).
