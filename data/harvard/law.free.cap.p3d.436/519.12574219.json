The Smiths also argue the court erroneously concluded no issues remained in their lawsuit against the concrete subcontractor after granting the subcontractor summary judgment. Finally, they challenge the attorney fees awarded to both the general contractor and concrete subcontractor as unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In September 2010, the Smiths entered into an agreement with SK Builders, Inc., a licensed general contractor, for the construction of a home. The original contract price was $1,632,804. The house was approved for occupancy, subject to final inspection and corrections, on March 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 On May 1, 2012, SK submitted a third amended version of Payment Application No. 19 (\"PA 19\") to the Smiths, claiming they owed $180,289.61.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to the contract, SK had previously submitted and the Smiths had paid numerous monthly payment applications throughout the period of construction. In total, they made progress payments to SK in the amount of $1,506,314.76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Before SK submitted the third amended version of PA 19, Ronald Robinette, architect and contract administrator, sent SK a letter advising that no further payments would be made until outstanding issues were resolved. According to Robinette, SK actually owed the Smiths money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The outstanding issues to which Robinette referred concerned an interior concrete crack and the absence of wire mesh in the concrete that formed the back patio. SK had made repairs by injecting epoxy into the interior concrete crack. SK had also retained engineers to test the back patio, and they had concluded that, although the concrete deviated from the plans, it was in fact stronger than as specified in the plans. Based on the engineering findings, the concrete subcontractor, DC Concrete, refused to completely replace the back patio. PA 19 did not contain any request for payment related to the concrete work; the Smiths had already paid the full amount for the concrete work in previous payment applications, without objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The Smiths terminated the contract with SK effective May 5, 2012. Neither the Smiths, nor Robinette acting on their behalf, ever paid SK the amount requested in PA 19. Nor did the Smiths or Robinette object in writing to any of the items contained in PA 19. The Smiths continue to occupy the house and have not replaced the back patio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 SK sued the Smiths, claiming a violation of the APPA, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment. In the lawsuit, SK sought payment of the $180,289.61 claimed in PA 19, an additional $10,234.15, interest, and attorney fees. The Smiths counterclaimed against SK, also bringing a third-party complaint against SK's owner and some of SK's subcontractors, including DC, alleging breach of contract/defective workmanship, professional negligence, and fraudulent misrepresentation. Additionally, after several amendments to the third-party complaint, the Smiths included claims against Robinette and various project engineers. All claims except SK's claims against the Smiths were settled or otherwise resolved before trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of DC on the Smiths' breach of contract and fraudulent misrepresentation claims, finding no contractual privity between DC and the Smiths. Further, notwithstanding the Smiths' assertion that there were unresolved claims, the court ruled that no legal issues remained with respect to DC and, therefore, it was entitled to judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P. The court awarded DC $259,092.70 in attorney fees, $5,299.34 in costs, and $30,564 in sanctions pursuant to Rule 68(g), Ariz. R. Civ. P.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ. P. 68(g) (sanctions for party who rejects offer of judgment, but does not obtain more favorable judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 After a bench trial, the trial court found the Smiths had violated the APPA by failing to object in writing to any of the items in PA 19 within fourteen days of its submission. The court, however, found in favor of the Smiths on SK's breach of contract claim and dismissed SK's unjust enrichment claim. It entered judgment for SK for $180,289.61, and awarded SK $60,000 in attorney fees. The court later reduced the attorney fees awarded to SK to $50,000. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21 and 12-2101(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Payment Application No. 19\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The Smiths first argue PA 19 did not comply with the requirements for a progress payment under the APPA because most of the work in PA 19 was completed outside the preceding thirty-day billing cycle. They also argue that PA 19 was at most a \"final billing\" that did not impose the same obligations and time limits on them as a progress payment application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 We review issues of statutory interpretation and application de novo.\n   <em>\n    Obregon v.

As noted, they neither objected to the billing within the statutory fourteen-day period, nor paid it within the statutory seven-day period that followed. Although the APPA requires owners and contractors to comply with time limitations,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   2000 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 233, \u00a7 4, the Smiths argue their compliance was unnecessary in this instance because PA 19 contained work completed outside the thirty-day billing cycle and, therefore, was not a progress payment application under the APPA, but rather a final billing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that is not the case. After SK submitted PA 19, the Smiths asked for a \"final statement\" of the remaining amount owed to SK. Further, Robinette issued \"The Final Adjusted Contract Sum\" more than one month after SK submitted PA 19. PA 19 was, therefore, a progress payment application. However, even though we reach this conclusion, our interpretation of the APPA leads us to further conclude SK was not entitled to relief for any items not falling within the preceding thirty-day billing cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 The APPA unambiguously provides that a contractor must base a progress payment \"billing or estimate\" on \"the work performed and the materials supplied during the preceding thirty day billing cycle.\" 2000 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 233, \u00a7 4. Thus, the plain language necessarily means that the APPA does not allow relief for work performed or materials supplied outside the preceding thirty-day billing cycle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farris v.

Here, in support of its absurdity argument, SK gives the example of an appliance being purchased one month, stored the next month, installed the next month, and then tested as operational the next month. SK, however, ignores the fact that the APPA expressly allows progress payments to include either a \"billing or estimate\" of \"work performed\" and \"materials supplied.\" 2000 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 233, \u00a7 4. Thus, applying the APPA to SK's example, a contractor would comply with the APPA by submitting estimates of the amount of work performed and materials supplied concerning the appliance within each thirty-day billing cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Moreover, SK overlooks the demanding standard for finding absurdity. \"A result is 'absurd if it is so irrational, unnatural, or inconvenient that it cannot be supposed to have been within the intention of persons with ordinary intelligence and discretion.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, finding absurdity contemplates extraordinary circumstances; a court may not disregard a statute's plain language and find absurdity merely because it believes the statute is unwisely enacted, results in awkward procedures, or leads to a harsh result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz.

The choice of the appropriate wording rests with the Legislature, and the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature.\"). Here, considering the plain language of the statute, including the legislature's decision to permit estimates of the work performed and the materials supplied in the preceding thirty-day billing cycle, requiring compliance with the plain language of the APPA's thirty-day billing provision does not lead to an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 SK also contends strict interpretation of the thirty-day billing cycle requirement is inconsistent with contractor-subcontractor relations. The APPA does link the owner's progress payments to work done by subcontractors billed in the contractor's payment application.\n   <em>\n    Stonecreek Bldg. Co. v.

And, a subcontractor is not obligated to provide the contractor with payment applications limited to the preceding thirty-day billing cycle. 2000 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 233, \u00a7 5. Therefore, as provided for by the plain language of the statute, the burden is on the contractor either to estimate the work performed and materials supplied by subcontractors during each thirty-day cycle, or to contractually obligate their subcontractors to submit their respective billings and estimates on time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 The \"primary purpose of [the APPA] is to require an owner to identify and disapprove those items that need to be corrected early in the process so that contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers receive prompt payment for their work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Stonecreek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5543838\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/36/\">\n    216 Ariz. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5543838\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/216/36/\">\n    162 P.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As discussed, for contractors to benefit from the APPA, they must comply with the thirty-day billing cycle requirement. SK admitted that PA 19 was submitted \"[f]or work that had been completed to the date of that application,\" and could have been completed in the year and one-half leading up to that date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   None of the items in PA 19 list the dates when the work was performed or the materials supplied, so it is unclear which items, if any, were within the applicable billing cycle. The Smiths identified and SK agreed that $13,744.61 of plumbing work and $17,777 of flooring work included in PA 19 were completed at least before the certificate of occupancy was issued on March 22, 2012, and that PA 19 billed $27,596.80 for appliances that were purchased in 2011. Further, Robinette testified that none of the items billed in PA 19 occurred within the previous thirty-day cycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 Neither the APPA, nor Arizona cases discussing it, expressly assign the burden of proof concerning the thirty-day billing cycle requirement. We conclude that the burden of proving compliance with the APPA's thirty-day billing cycle requirement falls on the contractor submitting a payment application.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yeazell v.

This is consistent with the obligation of the contractor to establish a violation of the APPA. Here, in finding in favor of SK, the trial court found SK \"ha[d] proved all the elements required under the statute and the case law to establish a violation of the [APPA].\" However, the court did not address the Smiths' thirty-day billing cycle argument. Thus, seeking relief under the APPA, SK met its burden of proving that PA 19 was submitted to the Smiths and not objected to or paid, but failed to prove compliance with the thirty-day billing cycle requirement. And, as noted, PA 19 included many items that were undisputedly outside the thirty-day cycle.

In subsequent amendments, the Smiths added additional parties and additional claims, but the only counts against DC remained breach of contract/defective workmanship and fraudulent misrepresentation. Ultimately, the Smiths included several additional \"claims\" against DC in their response to DC's motion for summary judgment regarding fraudulent misrepresentation. These new allegations were conspiracy, concealment, and aiding and abetting. The trial court declined to consider them or any other new allegation, reasoning that the Smiths \"had three and one-half years to amend their complaint to add counts ... [and] [t]o permit [the Smiths] to maintain entirely new causes of action against\n   [DC] without proper notice and an informed chance to defend themselves would be grossly unfair.\" The court then granted DC summary judgment on both counts, and entered judgment in favor of DC pursuant to Rule 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b624 At issue is whether any claims against DC other than breach of contract/defective workmanship and fraudulent misrepresentation remained. The Smiths argue additional claims were present in the case since at least the third amended third-party complaint, which they assert contained, at a minimum, claims for negligence, respondeat superior, and negligent misrepresentation. Although language about conspiracy and concealment was contained within the breach of contract/defective workmanship and fraudulent misrepresentation counts, the trial court entered judgment in favor of DC on the entirety of those two counts, which were the only counts directed towards DC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision not to consider any additional allegations was within the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walls v.

DC successfully proved no contract existed with the Smiths and successfully defended their fraudulent misrepresentation claim. The trial court awarded DC attorney fees, noting that the defense of one claim could not be separated from the defense of the other. The Smiths argue the court mistakenly concluded that the breach of contract claim was irreconcilably intertwined with the fraudulent misrepresentation claim and, therefore, DC's fee award should have been limited to the breach of contract defense. They further assert the facts necessary to grant summary judgment on the breach of contract claim were undisputed and available to all parties when the case started three and one-half years earlier. Thus, the Smiths essentially argue, DC should have brought its summary judgment motion sooner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b630 Here, we must determine whether the fraudulent misrepresentation claim could not exist but for the alleged contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ML Servicing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248491\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/562/\">\n    235 Ariz. 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248491\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/235/562/\">\n    334 P.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Smiths alleged that DC breached a contractual agreement with them by failing to pour the concrete according to plans and specifications, and by knowingly performing and concealing defective work. Their fraudulent misrepresentation claim was based on the allegation that DC knew it performed defective work under the contract and did not intend to cure the defects in the concrete according to the contractually required plans and specifications. Thus, both the breach of contract claim and the fraudulent misrepresentation claim were intertwined in the counts against DC. The Smiths' fraudulent misrepresentation claim could not exist but for the alleged contract. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding DC attorney fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Attorney Fees on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b631 All parties request attorney fees on appeal.

We award the Smiths their reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal with respect to SK's claims against the Smiths. DC prevailed against the Smiths in this appeal; therefore, we award DC reasonable attorney fees against the Smiths. The Smiths may recover taxable costs against SK, and DC may recover taxable costs against the Smiths, each pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341, upon compliance with Rule 21(b), Ariz. R. Civ. App. P.
