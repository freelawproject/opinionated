As to the Wilsons' second contention, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in equitably dividing the interpleaded funds between the Wilsons and EMIA. We therefore affirm the district court's order allocating the interpleaded funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 This case began in September 2010 with the tragic death of Jessica Wilson, who was struck by a car while walking in a crosswalk. Jessica died at the hospital a few hours later. Jessica's insurance provider, EMIA, covered $78,692.34 of her medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In 2011, Jessica's parents, the Wilsons, filed a wrongful death claim against the driver of the car that struck Jessica, seeking funeral expenses and compensation for the loss of Jessica's companionship, love, and affection. In 2013, the Wilsons reached a tentative settlement with the driver's insurer for the $100,000 limit of his liability insurance policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 In January 2014, EMIA filed a \"Complaint for Subrogation Claim\" against the driver, seeking reimbursement for the $78,692.34 in medical expenses it had paid out on Jessica's behalf, with accrued interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   EMIA asserted its subrogation claim under the terms of its insurance policy with Jessica. The driver filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that EMIA lacked standing to bring suit in its own name. The district court denied the driver's motion, observing that (1) Utah Code sections 78B-2-105, 78B-3-106, and 78B-3-107 did not apply; (2) Utah Code section 31A-21-108 applied and allowed an insurer to bring \"an action to subrogate in either its name or the name of its insured\"; and (3) pursuant to EMIA's insurance policy with Jessica, EMIA \"was entitled to recovery against a third-party tortfeasor.\" Consequently, the court determined that EMIA had standing to file its lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Eventually, the parties agreed to consolidate the cases against the driver, and the driver filed an interpleader counterclaim\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   against EMIA and the Wilsons, in which his insurer agreed to interplead with the court the $100,000 policy limit. EMIA and the Wilsons agreed to accept the $100,000 in settlement of their claims against the driver and to dismiss him from the lawsuit with prejudice, but they disagreed on how to allocate the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 After a hearing on the matter, the district court concluded that it was \"equitable to divide the $100,000.00 equally between the parties, specifically, $50,000.00 to the Wilsons and $50,000.00 to EMIA.\" However, in recognition of the fact that the Wilsons had \"labored more than EMIA to acquire the $100,000.00 that was deposited with [the] Court by [the driver],\" the court determined that it was \"equitable to reimburse the Wilsons for one half of their attorneys' fees and costs from EMIA's portion\"-$16,667 in attorney fees and $9,150.69 in costs. Accordingly, the court awarded $75,817.69 of the interpleaded funds to the Wilsons and $24,182.31 to EMIA. The Wilsons appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 In\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   , this court determined that Utah Code section 31A-21-108\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"contains no language\n   <em>\n    granting\n   </em>\n   an insurance company the right to bring a subrogation action in its own name.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812036\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/471/\">\n    2016 UT App 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812036\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/471/\">\n    368 P.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We also observed that \" 'it has been generally held that a suit at law to enforce [a] right of subrogation must, at common law, be brought in the name of the insured, rather than by the insurance company in its own name and right.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johanson v. Cudahy Packing Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8869181\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/107/114/\">\n    107 Utah 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8869181\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/107/114/\">\n    152 P.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 104 (1944) ). Thus, we concluded that \"EMIA lacked standing to bring a subrogation action [against the driver] in its own name rather than in the name of Jessica or Jessica's\n   estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Therefore, we further concluded that the district court erred in dividing the interpleaded funds between the Wilsons and EMIA, and we \"reverse[d] the [district] court's order and remand[ed] with instructions for the [district] court to dismiss EMIA's claims and award all of the interpleaded funds to the Wilsons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Given our determination that EMIA lacked standing, we declined to address the Wilsons' other arguments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. EMIA petitioned our supreme court for certiorari, which was granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2069\">\n    2017 UT 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567062\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/355/\">\n    416 P.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 The supreme court reversed, concluding that EMIA had standing to sue for subrogation in its own name pursuant to the express terms of its insurance policy with Jessica Wilson.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 19. First, the court discussed the law of equitable subrogation and observed that \"[t]he law of equitable subrogation places limits or conditions on the insurer's right of subrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13. \"One of those conditions is the 'made-whole' principle, which states that an insurer is at least sometimes required to fully compensate its insured for any losses before it asserts a claim for subrogation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The court then discussed subrogation by the express terms of a contract and explained that \"[a]n insurer and an insured may agree to contract away the requirements of the common law of equitable subrogation. They may provide in an insurance policy that the insured need not be made whole before the insurer may sue for subrogation ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. With regard to the made-whole principle, the court explained that the principle \"arise[s] as a matter of our common law of equitable subrogation\" and that it \"can be modified by contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 (quotation simplified). Observing that EMIA's insurance policy with Jessica \"recognized EMIA's authority 'to pursue its own right of Subrogation against a third party' without regard to whether the insured 'is made whole by any recovery,' \" the court stated that \"[i]t is difficult to imagine a clearer statement of EMIA's authority to sue for subrogation in its own name and without regard to full 'make-whole' compensation for the Wilsons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Consequently, the supreme court upheld EMIA's standing to sue for subrogation in its own name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The court remanded the case to this court with instructions to identify and address any issues that remained for decision after\n   <em>\n    Wilson II\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 On remand from the supreme court, we asked the parties to submit supplemental briefing advising this court as to which, if any, of the issues raised in the original briefing in\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   remained outstanding and needed resolution. The Wilsons identified two remaining issues: (1) whether EMIA's claim was barred by Utah Code section 78B-3-107, and (2) whether the district court erred in its allocation of the interpleaded funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 The Wilsons first contend that EMIA's claim was barred by Utah's survival action statute, Utah Code section 78B-3-107.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   More specifically, they assert that section 78B-3-107\"expressly gives the cause of action for a pre-death injury (all special and general damages suffered) to 'the personal representatives or heirs of the person who died' \" and that \"[p]re-death medical expenses are part of an injury claim.\" Thus, although they do not explicitly state as much, the Wilsons appear to be arguing that EMIA could not seek reimbursement for the medical expenses it paid out on Jessica's behalf as part of its subrogation claim. We decline to address the merits of this contention because it is inadequately briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 An appellant's brief \"must explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal.\" Utah R.

First, the Wilsons quote a paragraph from this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   , wherein we referred to EMIA's action as a personal injury action and stated that EMIA should have brought the action \"in the name of the estate or intervened in the Wilsons' action against [the driver]\" instead of in its own name.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812036\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/471/\">\n    2016 UT App 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812036\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/368/471/\">\n    368 P.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Wilsons have failed to provide any analysis of that paragraph or, more importantly, to explain how it supports their argument in light of our supreme court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Wilson II\n   </em>\n   that EMIA could file a subrogation action in its own name based on the express terms of its insurance policy with Jessica.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2069\">\n    2017 UT 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567062\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/355/\">\n    416 P.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, we are inclined to agree with EMIA that the Wilsons' argument is merely an \"attempt to categorize EMIA's cause of action as one for personal injury\" instead of as a subrogation action. Next, the Wilsons simply quote Utah Code section 78B-3-107, providing no analysis. And lastly, they assert, without providing any pinpoint citations, that\n   <em>\n    Morrison v. Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8868054\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/104/151/\">\n    104 Utah 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8868054\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/104/151/\">\n    140 P.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1943), stands for the proposition that \"[p]re-death medical expenses are part of an injury claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 That is the extent of the Wilsons' analysis, and it is inadequate. As we have stated many times, \"an appellate court is not a depository in which a party may dump the burden of argument and research.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wachocki v.

The Wilsons have offered only bald citation to authority and conclusory statements without any meaningful analysis-they have failed to explain why, given the supreme court's opinion, EMIA could not seek reimbursement of the medical expenses it paid out on Jessica's behalf in its subrogation action. Consequently, they have failed to carry their burden of persuasion on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 The Wilsons next contend that the district court erred in its allocation of the interpleaded funds. \"An action in interpleader is a proceeding in equity in which a person who has possession of money or property which may be owned or claimed by others seeks to rid himself of risk of liability, or possible multiple liability, by disclaiming his interest and submitting the matter of ownership for adjudication by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry's Sales, Inc. v.

The court also found that EMIA disbursed a substantial\n   amount\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   for Jessica's medical expenses. The court then noted that the $100,000 interpleaded by the driver was \"insufficient to satisfy the damages claimed by the Wilsons and EMIA.\" The court further found that the Wilsons had been in litigation with the driver for a longer period of time than EMIA and that the Wilsons had \"labored more than EMIA to acquire the $100,000.00 that was deposited with [the] Court by [the driver].\" Lastly, the court found that both parties had incurred attorney fees and costs, and the Wilsons specifically had paid $33,334 in attorney fees and $18,301.38 in litigation costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 The district court then observed that \"[i]nterpleader actions filed pursuant to Rule 22 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure are equitable in nature\" and that, because the parties' claims to the $100,000 exceeded that amount, the court had to \"balance the equities and determine how that amount should be allocated.\" Relying on its factual findings, the court stated that \"[t]he equities that should be balanced in this matter are the Wilsons' loss of their daughter and EMIA's claim for reimbursement for the medical expenses it paid out [on] behalf of Jessica Wilson.\" The court determined that it was equitable to divide the $100,000 equally between the parties, that is, $50,000.00 to the Wilsons and $50,000.00 to EMIA. However, recognizing that the Wilsons' efforts to obtain the $100,000 were disproportionate to those of EMIA, the court further determined that it was equitable to reimburse the Wilsons for one-half of their attorney fees and costs from EMIA's portion of the funds. Accordingly, the court awarded $75,817.69 to the Wilsons and $24,182.31 to EMIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b618 The Wilsons do not challenge the district court's factual findings. Instead, they assert that the district court's allocation of the interpleaded funds was incorrect for two reasons: (1) \"wrongful death claimants have 'superior equity' \" over an insurer attempting to enforce its subrogation rights, and (2) there is a \"priority of payment\" in situations, like this one, where there are multiple parties competing for the same settlement proceeds.

Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Wilson II\n   </em>\n   , our supreme court ruled that EMIA's authority to sue for subrogation was based in contract-EMIA's insurance policy with Jessica Wilson.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2069\">\n    2017 UT 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567062\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/355/\">\n    416 P.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Observing that EMIA's policy with Jessica specifically \"recognized EMIA's authority 'to pursue its own right of Subrogation against a third party' without regard to whether the insured 'is made whole by any recovery,' \" the supreme court stated that \"[i]t is difficult to imagine a clearer statement of EMIA's authority to sue for subrogation in its own name and without\n   regard to full 'make-whole' compensation for the Wilsons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Because Jessica's policy with EMIA was sufficiently clear to contract away the common law principles of equitable subrogation, the made-whole principle-the general rule that the insured be made whole before the insurer can recover from the tortfeasor-does not apply in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 Second, the Wilsons assert that Utah law establishes \"[a] priority of payment in competing claims.\" More specifically, they assert that \"[w]hen victims (like the Wilsons) and a subrogated insurer (like EMIA) compete for the same settlement proceeds, Utah law establishes a priority of payment, and gives first priority to the claimant with 'superior equity.' \" (Emphasis omitted.)

XVI, \u00a7 5. Our supreme court has observed that Article 16, Section 5\"enshrines two separate protections on the right to recover for wrongful death\": (1) \"that the right to recover damages 'shall never be abrogated' \" and (2) \"that the amount of the damages 'shall not be subject to any statutory limitation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

The Wilsons provide no explanation or analysis as to how either protection has been implicated or violated in this case. Moreover, as EMIA correctly observes, the Wilsons \"provide no argument or analysis as to how Article Sixteen of the Utah Constitution supposedly supports their proposition that [they] have a superior right of recovery over EMIA.\" Because the Wilsons' argument is \"devoid of any meaningful analysis,\" we conclude that it is inadequately briefed and decline to address it further.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, the district court recognized that the interpleaded funds were insufficient to satisfy either of the Wilsons' or EMIA's claims, and it divided the funds equally between the parties. The court then equitably reimbursed the Wilsons, out of EMIA's portion of the funds, for one-half of their attorney fees and costs. Although equity might have countenanced the court awarding more of the interpleaded funds to the Wilsons, equity did not demand that the court do so. The Wilsons received approximately three-fourths of the interpleaded funds, and we are unable to conclude that the court abused its discretion in allocating the funds as it did.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8338513\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/149/348/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b627 We conclude that the Wilsons' argument that EMIA's claim was barred by Utah Code section 78B-3-107 is inadequately briefed.
