Brelvis argues that the superior court erred by compelling it to comply with the CID because it violates Brelvis' (1) right against self-incrimination, (2) right against intrusion into its private affairs, and (3) right against unreasonable search and seizure. Brelvis also argues that the CID is directed at the managing member of Brelvis, Bruce Mesnekoff, in his personal capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that the superior court properly required Brelvis to comply with the CID and consequently affirm its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On August 3, 2016, the AGO received a complaint regarding an entity known as the Student Loan Help Center LLC. Although the complaint identified the \"National Student Loan Help Center\" as its subject, it included an Internet address for the \"Student Loan Help Center.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 159-60. The complaint also included a link to the Better Business Bureau's (BBB) Internet complaint page regarding the Student Loan Help Center. The BBB webpage for the Student Loan Help Center included the following information:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Pattern of Complaints\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   BBB files indicate that The Student Loan Help Center has a pattern of complaints\n   stating that the business does not consolidate loans after the consumer pays an initial fee. Complaints further show that consumers['] request for refunds go unanswered by the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In September 2014, July 2015, and December 2016, BBB sent a request to The Student Loan Help Center to address this pattern and what actions the business has taken to help eliminate the causes of complaints. As of today's date, BBB has not received a response from the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   CP at 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b64 The Student Loan Help Center also does business under the name Brelvis Consulting LLC. Mesnekoff owns and operates Brelvis and is its registered agent. On October 21, the AGO sent a CID to Brelvis pursuant to RCW 19.86.110 as part of its investigation into whether Brelvis had engaged in unfair or deceptive business practices in violation of RCW 19.86.020.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CID was addressed to Brelvis, in care of Mesnekoff. The AGO's investigation related to possible misrepresentations about student loan forgiveness and other possible violations of Washington's Debt Adjusting Act, chapter 18.28 RCW, and Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW, based on the August 3 complaint. The CID included 12 interrogatories and 13 requests for production. The CID requested several categories of documents and responses from Brelvis regarding matters such as advertisements, payment records, customer complaints, client intake and communication records, and other information about Brelvis' business, its employees, and any litigation against the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b65 On November 22, counsel for Brelvis contacted the AGO requesting additional time to respond to the CID. On December 29, after multiple e-mail communications, the AGO informed Brelvis that if it did not respond to the CID by January 5, 2017, the AGO would file a motion to enforce the CID. Brelvis retained new counsel who, on January 12, e-mailed the AGO requesting additional time to respond to the CID. Then, on January 27, counsel informed the AGO that Brelvis was again seeking new counsel with regard to the CID. On January 30, the new counsel for Brelvis contacted the AGO to confirm that it had taken over representation for Brelvis. On February 3, the AGO told Brelvis that it would give it until February 10 to respond to the CID. Brelvis did not respond to the interrogatories and requests for production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b66 On February 14, the AGO filed a petition to enforce the CID, which the superior court granted. Brelvis filed a motion for reconsideration of the order enforcing the CID, which the superior court denied. Brelvis appealed both the superior court's order enforcing the CID and its order denying reconsideration to our court. On April 21, Brelvis filed a motion to stay the superior court's March 24 order, which the superior court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Brelvis argues that the superior court's order compelling compliance with the CID is erroneous because it violates Brelvis' (1) right against self-incrimination, (2) right against unlawful intrusion into its private affairs, and (3) right against unreasonable search and seizure. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I. SCOPE OF CID\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b68 As an initial matter, Brelvis argues that Mesnekoff's individual rights against self-incrimination, unlawful intrusion into his private affairs, and unreasonable search and seizure are implicated. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b69 The CID noted that it was directed to \"Brelvis Consulting LLC\" and to Mesnekoff as its registered agent for service. CP at 18. The interrogatories and requests for production defined \"You,\" \"Your,\" and \"Brelvis\" as referring to Brelvis Consulting LLC, including any principals, owners, employees, officers, agents, and \"any other persons or entities acting on behalf of or under the direction, authorization or control of Brelvis.\" CP at 18, 20. Brelvis argues that because the definition of \"You,\" \"Your,\" and \"Brelvis\" encompasses Mesnekoff, \"the CID applies\n   to him personally.\" Reply Br. of Appellant at 10-11. Brelvis asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [t]he plain language of the CID equates Mr. Mesnekoff individually and personally with the word \"Brelvis.\" Mr. Mesnekoff\n   is therefore required by the terms of this CID to answer the interrogatories under oath.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Reply Br. of Appellant at 11. Brelvis also argues that Mesnekoff is personally implicated because the CID was addressed to Brelvis in care of him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b610 A corporation is \"artificial, invisible, intangible,\" and it exists only in law.\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

In\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   , the defendant, a shareholder and principal officer in a corporation, attempted to assert a privacy interest in the corporations' banking records. 1 Wash.

The court determined that the defendant could not assert a privacy interest in the corporation's banking records because those records have not been historically considered part of a shareholder or officer's private affairs and \"a corporation's financial transactions do not reveal sufficiently sensitive information about a person's personal contacts and associations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 807. Therefore, Mesnekoff does not have a personal privacy interest in Brelvis' business records under article I, section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b656 With these conclusions, it is unnecessary to examine the second component in analyzing claims under article I, section 7 : whether the disturbance was justified by authority of law.

Specifically, the AGO was investigating whether Brelvis made misrepresentations about student loan forgiveness and committed other violations of Washington's Debt Adjusting Act, chapter 18.28 RCW, and Consumer Protection Act, chapter 19.86 RCW. Our Supreme Court has held that \"there is no question but that RCW 19.86.080 and RCW 19.86.110(1) accord to the Attorney General power to investigate possible unfair or deceptive practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120503\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/85/585/\">\n    85 Wash.2d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=537%20P.2d%20782\">\n    537 P.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court recognized that situations could \"arise where the Attorney General arbitrarily serves a civil investigative demand upon a business.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120503\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/85/585/\">\n    85 Wash.2d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=537%20P.2d%20782\">\n    537 P.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b667 Here, though, the record shows that the AGO did not act arbitrarily in instituting the investigation. The AGO relied on the August 3, 2016 complaint in issuing the CID. Although the complaint identified the National Student Loan Help Center as its subject, it also included an Internet address for the Student Loan Help Center and a link to the BBB's Internet complaint page regarding the Student Loan Help Center. Therefore, the AGO could have reasonably interpreted the August 3 complaint to pertain to Brelvis, doing business as the Student Loan Help Center. More importantly, the BBB page clearly relates to Brelvis and describes a \"pattern of complaints\" regarding Brelvis' failure to consolidate loans and respond to customer requests for refunds. CP at 164. Therefore, the AGO had an adequate foundation to initiate its investigation and did not act arbitrarily in doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b668 With this, the\n   <em>\n    Steele\n   </em>\n   test has been satisfied, and issuance of the CID did not violate Brelvis' rights under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   VI. APPELLATE FEES AND COSTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b669 The AGO asks that we award the State attorney fees on appeal under RAP 18.1(a). RAP 18.1(a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   allows a party to recover fees on appeal \"if applicable law grants a party the right to recover reasonable attorney fees or expenses.\" RCW 19.86.080(1) states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   The attorney general may bring an action in the name of the state ... against any person to restrain and prevent the doing of any act herein prohibited or declared to be unlawful; and the prevailing party may, in the discretion of the court, recover the costs of said action including a reasonable attorney's fee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b670 In the present case, the State asks the court to enforce the CID. Under RCW 19.86.110(5)(a) and (b), one receiving a CID must produce documentary material demanded and answer interrogatories subject to restrictions. Brelvis did not produce documents or answer interrogatories in response to a CID we have determined to be valid. Thus, the present case is an action \"to restrain and prevent the doing of any act herein prohibited or declared to be unlawful\" under RCW 19.86.080(1). Therefore, we award reasonable appellate attorney fees to the State under RCW 19.86.080(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b671 The superior court properly required Brelvis to comply with the CID.
