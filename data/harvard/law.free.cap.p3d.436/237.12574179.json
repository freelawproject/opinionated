Gardiner (Landlord) appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Nels Anderson (Tenant). Tenant cross-appeals the court's decision to award Landlord attorney fees with respect to Landlord's motions to strike and the court's denial of Tenant's request for attorney fees as the prevailing party. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Tenant because Landlord's claim fails as a matter of law. We remand to the district court to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its decision to award attorney fees to Landlord for the motions\n   to strike. We reverse the district court's conclusion that the Lease did not trigger the reciprocal attorney fees statute and remand for the court to determine whether Tenant should be awarded attorney fees as the prevailing party. We further conclude Tenant is entitled to attorney fees on appeal and remand to determine the reasonable amount of fees incurred on appeal and cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On November 1, 2013, Landlord and Tenant entered into a lease agreement (the Lease) for a warehouse building (the Warehouse) to last for two years until October 31, 2015. The Lease provided that Tenant was to \"repair\" the Warehouse \"at [Tenant's] sole cost and expense, including, but not limited to, electrical fixtures, interior painting and decorating, and glass replacement.\" The agreed rent escalated gradually over time from $600 per month to $1,000 per month. The Lease prohibited Tenant from subleasing the Warehouse without Landlord's prior written consent. The sublease provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Tenant] shall not ... sublet or permit the leased premises or any part thereof to be used by others for any purpose, without prior written consent of [Landlord] being first obtained in each instance; provided, however, that regardless of any such assignment or sublease, [Tenant] shall remain primarily liable for the payment of the rent herein reserved and for the performance of all the other terms of this lease required to be performed by [Tenant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Despite this provision, Tenant entered into an oral agreement to sublet the Warehouse to a subtenant (Subtenant), beginning November 1, 2013-the same day the Lease went into effect-without Landlord's written consent. Tenant and Subtenant orally agreed that Subtenant would pay $2,250 per month in rent from November 1, 2013, through October 31, 2014; and $3,000 per month from November 1, 2014, through March 31, 2015. They later signed a written agreement to sublet\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Warehouse for $5,000 per month from April 1, 2015, to September 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In July 2015, Landlord discovered that Tenant was subletting the Warehouse and sent Tenant a letter in September 2015, giving Tenant written notice of his default of the sublease provision and giving him ten days to cure by paying Landlord $30,000. Because Tenant chose not to cure the breach, Landlord terminated the Lease pursuant to its default provisions. Tenant promptly vacated the Warehouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 A few months later, Landlord filed a complaint, alleging that Tenant unlawfully detained the Warehouse, breached the Lease, and was unjustly enriched by the Sublease. Landlord claimed he had been damaged by the Sublease in the amount of $53,100, arguing that he \"would have agreed to the Sublease if Tenant had paid Landlord the difference between Tenant's rent and what Tenant received from [Subtenant].\" Landlord sought treble damages in the amount of $159,300 and reasonable attorney fees, arguing that the Sublease amounted to an unlawful detainer under Utah Code section 78B-6-802(1)(d). Alternatively, he sought $53,100 in damages for either breach of contract or unjust enrichment, stating that \"it would be unjust for the Tenant to retain the benefit from the sublet rent that he received.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Tenant filed an answer and later a Motion to Dismiss or in the Alternative for Summary Judgment (Tenant's Motion for Summary Judgment). He attached a Verified Memorandum of Points and Authorities (the Verified Memorandum) in which he swore \"under oath to tell the whole truth.\" In the Verified Memorandum, Tenant articulated material facts that were substantially similar to Landlord's complaint, including that Tenant breached the Lease, entered into a Sublease, chose not to cure the breach, and vacated in a timely fashion pursuant to the Lease's default provision. He referred to Landlord's complaint and the exhibits attached to it to support these facts. Tenant also argued that Landlord's unlawful detainer claim failed because Tenant returned possession of the Warehouse to Landlord before the term of the notice expired. He further argued that Landlord had no remedy for\n   breach of contract because the Lease allowed Landlord to terminate the Lease and collect the $1,000 rent due each month through the end of the Lease, which included lost rents from Tenant between September 14, 2015, and October 31, 2015, but, according to Tenant, nothing in the Lease entitled Landlord to the rent from the Sublease. Finally, he argued that without evidence of an unlawful detainer or a provision in the Lease that would entitle Landlord to such damages, Landlord could not claim that Tenant was unjustly enriched from the rent collected under the Sublease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 Landlord opposed Tenant's Motion for Summary Judgment, arguing that the Verified Memorandum did not comply with rule 56 of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure because it did \"not state that the facts set forth in the pleading were true and correct to the personal knowledge of the signer,\" and instead \"attempt[ed] to verify the entire contents of the pleading, not just the factual assertions, and some of the facts sworn were ... mere assumptions or conclusions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Landlord also \"[d]isputed\" many of the facts in the Verified Memorandum, essentially claiming that the facts were not relevant to the complaint or re-characterizing the way Tenant had articulated them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 Landlord then filed his own motion for summary judgment (Landlord's Motion for Summary Judgment), asserting that there was no dispute as to any material fact and arguing that subletting the Warehouse without Landlord's written consent was an unlawful detainer and a breach of contract, which \"entitled [him] to judgment\" for $153,600\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   plus reasonable attorney fees and post-judgment interest. Shortly thereafter, Tenant filed a reply memorandum in support of his own motion for summary judgment and then a memorandum in opposition to Landlord's Motion for Summary Judgment. Landlord filed motions to strike both of these replies (the Motions to Strike), claiming they were untimely filed and failed to comply with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court heard argument on the Motions to Strike and ultimately struck Tenant's two reply memoranda for being untimely and ordered Tenant to pay Landlord attorney fees and costs related to the Motions to Strike. But the court determined that, because Tenant filed a motion for summary judgment, Landlord's Motion for Summary Judgment was opposed and the court would therefore \"consider arguments and material\" from the Verified Memorandum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The district court considered both parties' motions for summary judgment. It concluded that nothing in the unlawful detainer statute or the Lease supported Landlord's claim for damages of $53,100 in rent Tenant obtained from the Subtenant. The court determined that \"the only remedy [Landlord] appears to be entitled to is a declaration under [the unlawful detainer statute] that the [Lease] is forfeited due to [Tenant's] failure to perform a condition or covenant therein.\" Tenant complied with Landlord's notice to vacate when he elected to promptly vacate the Warehouse rather than cure the breach and therefore did not unlawfully possess it. The court further concluded that even if Tenant was in \"unlawful detainer\" of the Warehouse under Utah Code section 78B-6-802(1)(d) for unauthorized subletting, that section \"does not specifically provide for damages for unauthorized subletting\" and neither did the Lease. As a result, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Tenant and denied Landlord's cross-motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 In light of judgment in his favor, Tenant requested attorney fees, contending that he was the prevailing party in the lawsuit because he successfully defended against Landlord's complaint. He also argued that he was entitled to attorney fees under the unlawful detainer statute because he successfully defended against the claim of unlawful detainer. Landlord challenged the request, arguing that the Lease's enforcement provision provided for attorney fees only to the party not in breach of the Lease. The enforcement provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Should either party default in the performance of any covenants or agreements contained herein, such defaulting party shall pay to the other party all costs and expenses, including but not limited to, ... reasonable attorney's fee[s], including such fees on appeal, which the prevailing party may incur in enforcing [the Lease] or in pursuing any remedy allowed by law for breach hereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 The district court denied Tenant's request, concluding that Tenant was the defaulting party and that the Lease \"does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees to ... the party in default.\" The court further concluded that Landlord did not become the party in default by virtue of losing the lawsuit. The court also concluded that Tenant was not entitled to attorney fees under the unlawful detainer statute, because the provision that would have allowed for such an award was not in effect until May 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   after the complaint had been filed. Because the statute did not state that it could be applied retroactively and because the statute was not amended to clarify its meaning in response to judicial action, the court concluded Tenant was not entitled to attorney fees under that statute.

Second, he argues that Landlord's Motion for Summary Judgment should have been granted because the court should have dismissed the Verified Memorandum in its entirety based on its failure to conform with rule 56 and therefore the court could not have relied on it as a replacement for Tenant's opposition to Landlord's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Landlord argues that the court erred in determining that the Lease did not afford him the damages he sought.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Summary judgment is appropriate where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R.

We agree with the district court that the Lease \"does not provide for damages as requested by [Landlord].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b617 Landlord argues that \"the law must provide a remedy in damages\" and that \" 'damages are properly measured by the amount necessary to place the nonbreaching party in as good a position as if the contract had been performed.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

He asserts that \"it is an undisputed material fact that [he] would have agreed to the sublease if [Tenant] had paid [him] the difference\n   between [Tenant's] rent and what [Tenant] received from [Subtenant].\" For example, Landlord claims he deserves $4,000 per month for the months when Tenant was required to pay $1,000 per month for rent under the Lease and Subtenant was required to pay $5,000 per month for rent under the Sublease. Landlord argues that, had the parties entered into that agreement, he would have been paid the excess rent he now seeks. Though this might be true, we do not see how this legally entitles Landlord to the excess rent from the Sublease without a provision in the Lease providing for those damages. Instead, it appears Landlord is requesting the court to enforce \"an alternative benefit to the bargain\" than the agreement he reached with Tenant in the Lease based on \"something he might have contracted for under different circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Toll v.

Landlord's responses to Tenant's motions, the Motions to Strike below and on appeal, and Landlord's motion to dismiss the cross-appeal all claimed to be based on strict compliance with the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure and the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. We agree that compliance with the rules is important, but the extent to which Landlord has attempted to enforce them is not well taken. We agree with Tenant that on numerous occasions, Landlord, through his attorney, has \"belittled\" Tenant and filed \"needless motions to strike\" in an attempt to \"avoid ... full briefing on the merits of the case.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Indeed, our review of the record shows that many of these filings appeared to \"harass [Tenant] or to cause unnecessary delay or needless[ly] increase the cost of litigation.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1) ; Utah R. App. P. 40(b)(1). For example, Tenant filed a notice of supplemental authority with the district court, informing the court of a recent opinion issued by this court,\n    <em>\n     Express Recovery Services Inc. v. Olson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342753\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/397/792/\">\n     2017 UT App 71\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342753\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/397/792/\">\n     397 P.3d 792\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this notice, Tenant explained how\n    <em>\n     Express Recovery\n    </em>\n    supported his claim for attorney fees as the prevailing party in a contract case where the contract awards attorney fees to the prevailing party.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 17-19 (concluding that a party was the prevailing party below, vacating the district court's order denying that party's request for attorney fees, and remanding to the district court to determine reasonable attorney fees). Tenant also attached to the notice a printed copy of the case. Landlord filed a response, arguing that the court should not consider the notice, because it did not comply with rule 7(i) of the Utah Rules of Civil Procedure. Specifically, he argued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    Rule 7(i) provides in pertinent part that, when a party files a notice of citation to supplemental authority, that notice must state \"the citation to the authority the page of the motion or memorandum or the point orally argued to which the authority applies, and the reason the authority is relevant.\"\n    <em>\n     [Tenant's] notice does not state \"the page of the motion or memorandum to which the authority applies.\"\n    </em>\n    The court should thus not consider [his] notice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    (Emphasis added.) (Quotation simplified.) It is obvious from the language of the notice that Tenant was referring to his motion requesting attorney fees as the prevailing party on summary judgment. Therefore, the notice was sufficient for the purpose of rule 7(i). Landlord's response to the notice resulted in Tenant filing a reply to the notice to rebut this argument. Landlord then filed a motion to strike this reply, arguing that only the notice and a response by the opposing party is permitted under rule 7(i) and \"no other memorandum is permitted.\" Landlord also requested time at an upcoming hearing to address the issue. Although the district court agreed with Landlord, we are perplexed as to the reasoning because nothing in rule 7(i)\n    <em>\n     prohibits\n    </em>\n    a reply under these circumstances.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R. Civ. P. 7(i). We are unaware of any Utah case law that has addressed this issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    On appeal, Landlord filed a motion to dismiss Tenant's cross-appeal, arguing that Tenant's docketing statement included argument in violation of rule 9 of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. This court denied this motion to dismiss because \"[t]he docketing statement [was] sufficient to meet the purposes stated in rule 9(a).\" Landlord then filed a motion to dismiss Tenant's cross-appeal with respect to whether the court erred in awarding attorney fees to Landlord on the Motions to Strike, arguing the issue was moot because Tenant had already paid those fees. We rejected that argument above, explaining that Landlord failed to cite relevant case law in support of his argument and that Utah case law specifically states that this type of issue is not moot when the party objected on the record to the award and paid the fees under protest.\n    <em>\n     See supra\n    </em>\n    note 10. Landlord also filed a motion to strike Tenant's supplemental brief, yet, as we noted previously, Landlord's supplemental brief included the same errors that he claimed Tenant's brief included.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    \u00b618 &amp; note 13. And in his reply brief on appeal, Landlord argued that one of the facts Tenant had stated in his response brief about an email from October 27, 2014, in which he informed Landlord about a neighbor (Subtenant) who had suffered a fire and needed to use the Warehouse, \"not only [was] not before the district court, but [was] an erroneous characterization of the [email].\" This fact was before the district court, not only because it was supported in an exhibit to the Verified Memorandum, but also because Landlord referred to it in his own affidavit in support of his opposition to Tenant's Motion for Summary Judgment. And our review of that email supports Tenant's explanation that a neighbor suffered a fire and would be using the Warehouse to \"house supplies until he has time to get his facility rebuilt\" and that Tenant \"just wanted to let [Landlord] know of [his] intentions and use of the building in order to maintain transparency.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The record is replete with examples such as these and many appear to have served to delay the proceedings, distract the court from the merits of the issues, mislead this court on appeal, and increase the costs of litigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah R.
