Following a jury trial, Kauhane was found guilty of Obstructing. At sentencing, Kauhane was sentenced for a petty misdemeanor under HRS \u00a7 711-1105(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On appeal, Kauhane asserts the following points of error: (1) the Second Amended Complaint is defective for failing to allege an element of Obstructing, specifically the asserted attendant circumstance that Kauhane's conduct had \"render[ed] [the road] impassable without unreasonable inconvenience or hazard\"; (2) the circuit court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the mitigating defense under HRS \u00a7 711-1105(5), which reduces Obstructing from a petty misdemeanor to a violation; (3) his conviction cannot stand because the evidence is insufficient to sustain the offense of Obstructing; and (4) the circuit court erred by sustaining the prosecution's objection during closing argument under the \"golden rule\" because the jury was entitled to consider Kauhane's choice-of-evils defense by \"walking in his shoes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We disagree with Kauhane regarding his first, third, and fourth points of error. However, given the evidence in this case, we agree with Kauhane's second point of error that the jury should have been instructed regarding the mitigating defense under HRS \u00a7 711-1105(5), which could reduce Obstructing from a petty misdemeanor to a violation. We thus vacate Kauhane's conviction for Obstructing and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 20, 2015, the Maui Police Department (\n   <strong>\n    MPD\n   </strong>\n   ) Specialized Emergency Enforcement Detail (\n   <strong>\n    SPEED\n   </strong>\n   ) team was assigned to accompany construction vehicles and equipment en route to the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (\n   <strong>\n    DKIST\n   </strong>\n   ) construction site at the summit of Haleakala on the island of Maui. At approximately mile marker two on Crater Road, the convoy encountered a number of individuals standing shoulder to shoulder blocking the road, forcing the convoy to stop. MPD Captain Clyde Holokai (\n   <strong>\n    Captain Holokai\n   </strong>\n   ) approached the individuals and asked them to move off the roadway, which they did not do. The SPEED team got into formation and Captain Holokai then re-approached the individuals with the rest of the SPEED team. Captain Holokai and other SPEED team members repeatedly requested and ordered the individuals to get off the road. Many of the individuals dispersed, revealing seven additional people seated in the middle of the roadway with some linking arms, including Kauhane. These remaining individuals, including Kauhane, were subsequently arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 7, 2016, the State of Hawai'i (\n   <strong>\n    State\n   </strong>\n   ) filed its Second Amended Complaint against Kauhane. A jury trial commenced, and the trial took a total of three days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 29, 2016, the jury returned its verdict and found Kauhane guilty as charged of Obstructing, but not guilty of Failure to Disperse or Disorderly Conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 9, 2016, the circuit court entered its Judgment and sentenced Kauhane to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   six (6) months probation, a fine of $300, and a one-day jail sentence with credit for time served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 10, 2016, Kauhane filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The commentary to the Obstructing statute provides further, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Although obstructing was formerly covered by the disorderly conduct statute, it raises certain important problems which indicate that it should have separate treatment. Primarily the problems relate to free speech and types of expressive conduct which, under the aegis of free speech, are constitutionally protected. Normally, the act of obstructing a public highway presents a great public inconvenience and serves no useful purpose. However, where the obstruction is caused by a crowd listening to a speaker, or even by a crowd protesting some official action, important goals are served by leaving the group as free from restriction as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Subsection (1) defines obstructing as knowing or reckless obstruction of any. highway or public passage. \"Obstructs\" is defined in \u00a7 711-1100 as \"renders impassable without unreasonable inconvenience or hazard.\" This conduct constitutes a violation, and if the defendant fails to heed a warning by a peace officer, it may be treated as a petty misdemeanor. However, subsection (4) makes clear that a person does not violate subsection (1) solely because of the fact that people gather to hear the person speak, or because the person is a member of such a gathering.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   HRS \u00a7 711-1105 cmt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Neither the Hawai'i Penal Code nor HRS \u00a7 711-1105 specifically designate\n   HRS \u00a7 711-1105(4)as an affirmative defense or require that a defendant must prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, the defense under HRS \u00a7 711-1105(4) is not an affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   In the case of defenses which are not affirmative, the defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt. The other side of the coin is that the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt facts negativing the defense.

However, in this case, our review of the record indicates that the jury was not instructed regarding, and did not consider, the HRS \u00a7 711-1105(4) defense.

Nor could one, contrary to traffic regulations, insist upon a street meeting in the middle of Times Square at the rush hour as a form of freedom of speech or assembly.
