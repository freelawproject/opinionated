Mother subsequently gave birth to F.M. and J.M. In April 2017, six-week-old J.M. slept most of the day and vomited \"a lot\" that evening. Mother noticed that J.M.'s arms began shaking at various times. Assuming it was a stomach issue, Father went to the store to buy tea for J.M. Meanwhile, J.M.'s condition worsened. J.M. turned pale, started moaning, could not fully open her eyes, and her arms became stiff. After Father returned from the store, Mother and Father took J.M. to an urgent-care center where they waited more than 40 minutes for the doctor to evaluate her. Upon examination, the doctor told Mother and Father to immediately take J.M. to Phoenix Children's Hospital (\"PCH\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 At PCH, a scan revealed that J.M. had a large subdural hemorrhage on the left side of her brain and a smaller subdural hemorrhage on the right. She also had damage to her optic nerve and severe retinal hemorrhaging in both eyes. The hemorrhaging caused her brain to shift out of position and compress her brainstem. Because J.M.'s life was in danger, doctors had to perform emergency neurosurgery. After surgery, Dr. Melissa Jones, a pediatrician with a specialty in child abuse pediatrics, evaluated J.M. After ruling out possible medical causes, Dr. Jones determined the injuries resulted from abusive head trauma and Mother and Father provided no alternative explanation for the cause of J.M.'s injuries. PCH reported the injuries, and DCS took custody of all three children and filed dependency petitions. The juvenile court later established the case plan as severance and adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In July 2017, DCS petitioned to terminate Mother's rights to J.M., F.M., and M.R., and Father's rights to J.M. and F.M., under the abuse ground.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. Rev. Stat. (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 8-533(B). Over seven months, DCS offered Mother and Father services, including hair-follicle testing to rule out drug abuse, psychological evaluations, individual counseling, and a parent aide during visits with the children. Although Mother and Father participated in services, in discussions with counselors, they continued to minimize J.M.'s severe injuries and provided no further explanation for how the injury occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 The juvenile court held a three-day termination hearing. Dr. Jones testified for DCS, opining that J.M.'s injuries resulted\n   from nonaccidental trauma. Dr. Ruth Bristol, J.M.'s pediatric neurosurgeon, testified on the manner and extent of J.M.'s injuries. Mother and Father's expert, Dr. Joseph Scheller, a pediatric neurologist with specialties in pediatric neurology and neuroimaging, opined that J.M.'s injuries most likely resulted from an unusual complication of a birth injury. The court took the matter under advisement and later issued an order terminating Mother's rights to J.M., F.M., and M.R., and Father's rights to J.M. and F.M. Mother and Father timely appealed.

Thus, before recounting the articles' findings, DCS was required to first lay proper foundation concerning the reliability of the publications in which those articles appeared, or the reliability of the studies within the articles.

Dr. Scheller conceded his familiarity with each authority, was able to answer DCS's follow-up questions, and at times challenged DCS's attempts to restrict his explanations of the articles' findings. While Mother and Father take issue with whether the referenced publications were current and credible, their respective counsel did not develop these arguments on redirect examination despite the opportunity to do so. And although the juvenile court ultimately rejected Dr. Scheller's opinion, it based that decision on the testimony of J.M.'s treating physicians and Dr. Scheller's concessions surrounding the cause of J.M.'s injuries, not whether Dr. Scheller's opinion was contrary to the weight of published authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

While in Mother and Father's exclusive care, J.M. suffered a large subdural hemorrhage on the left side of her brain and a smaller subdural hemorrhage on the right. She also had significant midline shift and herniation of her brain, meaning there was so much pressure in the brain that it started to shift out of its normal position. J.M. required emergency neurosurgery to relieve the pressure because it had become so great that her skull could no longer contain the brain and its contents without threatening her life. She also had diffused retinal hemorrhages (or bleeding) in all quadrants of the retina and all layers of the retina. Her head injuries negatively affected a multitude of systems in her body. Post-trauma, doctors diagnosed her with cerebral palsy because she had significant motor impairment. She also suffers from regular epileptic seizures and is blind. She now requires occupational therapy, feeding therapy, and 24-hour monitoring. Dr. Bristol testified that J.M. will likely require long-term, full-time care for the foreseeable future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b615 At the termination hearing, Dr. Jones opined that J.M.'s injuries occurred within a few days before her hospital admission and resulted from nonaccidental trauma. After reviewing the family's medical history and J.M.'s birth records, Dr. Jones found no alternative medical explanation for her injuries. Similarly, Dr. Bristol testified that J.M.'s injuries were most likely caused by recent trauma. Dr. Jones added that J.M.'s lack of external injuries did not rule out abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b616 Dr. Scheller disagreed and testified that J.M.'s injuries resulted from a subdural hematoma at birth that began spontaneously re-bleeding some weeks later, which in turn caused her retinal hemorrhages. Dr. Scheller conceded that this occurrence would be \"an unusual complication\" and that no other non-traumatic medical condition could have caused J.M.'s injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b617 Dr. Jones and Dr. Bristol opined on Dr. Scheller's conclusion, testifying that such an occurrence under the circumstances present with J.M. would be \"very, very rare.\" Dr. Jones testified that \"children [who] have spontaneous re-bleeding [also] have some other complicating factor with their brain.\" Dr. Bristol testified that in her experience as a pediatric neurosurgeon she had \"not seen a spontaneous re-bleed to that degree.\" Dr. Jones opined that J.M.'s presentation and injuries did not correspond to Dr. Scheller's theory, particularly the diffuse nature of J.M.'s retinal hemorrhages, which was consistent with \"massive trauma with acceleration and deceleration.\" Regarding J.M.'s eye injuries, Dr. Jones stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [T]here had to be [a] significant force that led to that pattern of retinal hemorrhages. You can get retinal hemorrhages from many different causes, but the only times we see [J.M.'s] pattern of retinal hemorrhages in the pediatric population is from abusive head trauma, severe motor vehicle collisions or there's some case reports of children who have fallen out of two or three story windows onto concrete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Dr. Jones specifically distinguished Dr. Scheller's theory, testifying that \"when the pressure is high in the brain, you can get retinal hemorrhages,\" but they are typically \"in the ... most recessed part of the retina ... surrounding the optic nerve,\" which was \"not the same pattern that [J.M.] had.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b618 Throughout the investigation, dependency, and termination hearings, Mother and Father maintained that J.M. had suffered no accidents or injuries that would explain her injuries. At J.M.'s first health checkup (a few weeks before her traumatic brain injury ), the doctor examining J.M. noted no concerns. Likewise, Mother and Father maintained that J.M. only began showing symptoms the evening they took her to the hospital. In sum, reasonable evidence supports the juvenile court's determination that J.M.'s injuries were the result of nonaccidental trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b619 Based on its conclusion that J.M.'s injuries were the result of nonaccidental trauma, the court also found that Mother or Father, or both, intentionally abused J.M. or knew or reasonably should have known that the other parent abused her, \"as she was in their sole care when she suffered life-threatening injuries.\" The court also found that, despite the \"timing, extent, mechanics and presentation of [J.M.'s] injuries,\" Mother and Father continued to deny that abusive conduct\n   occurred, presented a \"united front,\" and remained committed to each other and their relationship. And because neither parent had \"shown a willingness to leave the other to protect the children from the other parent,\" the court concluded that \"both parents have demonstrated their lack of protective capacities for all of the children, not only [J.M.].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b620 Mother and Father have consistently maintained that they were J.M.'s only caregivers since her birth. Mother and Father continuously denied J.M. was abused, even after they were confronted with PCH's medical assessments of J.M.'s injuries. Despite strong evidence that at least one of them caused J.M.'s injuries, Mother and Father made no attempt to distance themselves from one another. To the contrary, in the months following the incident with J.M., Mother and Father deepened their commitment to one another by marrying.

But the juvenile court rejected this argument and concluded that by failing to take steps to protect J.M. from the unidentified abusing parent, \"Mother and Father have demonstrated they cannot or will not protect their children.\" The court specifically found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Although [M.R. and F.M.] are no longer infants, [they] are young children who are vulnerable. [M.R.] has already been the victim of child abuse by Mother in the past.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   Mother and Father ... have not been forthcoming about the cause of [J.M.'s] injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court also found that \"given the parents' persistent denials that any abuse occurred,\" both J.M. and her older siblings remained at risk of future abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b625 Reasonable evidence in the record supports these findings. M.R. was nine years old at the time of the termination hearing and F.M. was almost three-both still dependent on Mother and Father to meet their needs. Both parents' actions after learning the nature of J.M.'s injuries demonstrated they could not recognize danger and keep the children safe. As J.M.'s primary caregivers, Mother and Father are the only ones in a position to explain how her injuries occurred. Mother and Father have refused to acknowledge abuse occurred or that at least one of them was responsible. Instead, they have remained together, and neither parent has taken steps to prevent the children from being returned to the same situation that led to J.M.'s near-fatal injuries. On this record, we conclude reasonable evidence supports the court's finding that the abuse to J.M. bore a substantial connection to the risk of future abuse to the other children in Mother's and Father's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b626 Moreover, reasonable evidence concerning the children's adoptability supports the juvenile court's best-interests finding. The case manager testified that F.M. and M.R. were in a kinship placement that was meeting their needs and the foster parents wished to adopt them. Due to J.M.'s special needs, she was in a separate placement for a medically-fragile child that was providing her the specialized care she required. Although J.M.'s placement was not willing to adopt, DCS identified other potential adoptive placements for her. Considering the children's stability in their current placements, and the availability of adoptive placements, the case manager testified that termination would provide the children with \"a safe, secure environment, where all of their needs will be met.\" Reasonable evidence supports the court's finding that termination was also in the children's best interests because of their adoptability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b627 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the juvenile court's order terminating Mother's rights to J.M., F.M., and M.R. and Father's rights to J.M. and F.M.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    M.R.'s father's parental rights were terminated in the same proceeding.
